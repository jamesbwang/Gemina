  Persistent hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> genotype 3 ( HEV<pathogen> G3) infections affect solid organ transplant ( SOT) recipients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT) recipients , but the burden in these cohorts in the United Kingdom is unknown. We established an audit to determine the point prevalence of HEV<pathogen> viremia in SOT and HSCT patients in the United Kingdom and compare different testing approaches to inform screening strategies. Between January 5 , 2016 , and September 21 , 2016 , 3044 patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring at a single transplant center were screened for HEV<pathogen> ribonucleic acid ( RNA) in minipools. A total of 2822 patients who could be characterized included 2419 SOT patients , 144 HSCT patients and 259 patients with no available transplant history. HEV<pathogen> RNA-positive samples were characterized by serology and genomic phylogeny. HEV<pathogen> antigen ( HEV-Ag) testing was performed on RNA-positive samples , 420 RNA-negative samples and 176 RNA-negative blood donor samples. Nineteen of 2822 patients were viremic with G3 HEV<pathogen> giving a prevalence of 0.67 %. The median alanine aminotransferase was significantly higher in the HEV<pathogen> viremic patients ( P < 0.0001); however , 2 viremic patients had an alanine aminotransferase value within the normal range at the time of screening. The HEV-Ag assay identified 18/19 viremic patients and all those patients with proven viremia longer than 4 weeks. Transplant recipients in the United Kingdom are at a low but significant risk of HEV<pathogen> infection. HEV-Ag detection could be an alternative to RNA detection where the goal is to identify established persistent HEV<pathogen> infection , particularly where expertise , facilities , or cost prohibit RNA testing.
