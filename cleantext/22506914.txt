  In joint models for item response times ( RTs) and response accuracy ( RA) , local item dependence is composed of local RA dependence and local RT dependence. The two components are usually caused by the same common stimulus and emerge as pairs. Thus , the violation of local item independence in the joint models is called paired local item dependence. To address the issue of paired local item dependence while applying the joint cognitive diagnosis models ( CDMs) , this study proposed a joint testlet cognitive diagnosis modeling approach. The proposed approach is an extension of Zhan et al. ( 2017) and it incorporates two types of random testlet effect parameters ( one for RA and the other for RTs) to account for paired local item dependence. The model parameters were estimated using the full Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC) method. The 2015 PISA computer-based mathematics data were analyzed to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. Further , a brief simulation study was conducted to demonstrate the acceptable parameter recovery and the consequence of ignoring paired local item dependence.
