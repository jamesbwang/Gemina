  Congenital craniovertebral junction deformities can be associated with an anomalous vertebral artery ( VA). At times , the artery crosses the joint posteriorly ( i.e. , persistent first intersegmental artery) and is at risk during posterior approach. We report a new variant , wherein the bilateral VA coursed medially after exiting the C3 transverse foramina to lie beneath C2 pars interarticularis and enter the foramen magnum<pathogen> ( without passing through C2 transverse foramen anywhere along its course). This is possibly a result of bilateral persistent second intersegmental arteries. It is pertinent to recognize this unusual variant to avoid VA injury , especially while inserting C2 pars/transarticular screw.
