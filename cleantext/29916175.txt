  Planarian regeneration involves a complex series of cellular events , precisely choreographed in space and time. Time-lapse imaging can provide powerful insights into tissue dynamics , as variously demonstrated in other model systems. However , time-lapse imaging of planarians has proven to be a challenge. Especially the requisite immobilization of the animals over extended periods of time is difficult , owing to their photophobic behavior and soft body architecture. Here , we describe a new embedding method using 2 % ( w/v) low melting agarose , and demonstrate that this method can effectively immobilize animals as long as 7 days. In combination with cell-permeable fluorescent dyes , this immobilization method allows for the time-lapse imaging of planaria during regeneration and other physiological processes.
