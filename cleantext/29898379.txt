  A homodimeric l-amino acid oxidase enzyme ( Cv-LAAOI) was isolated from the venom of Cerastes vipera ( Egyptian Sand viper) using gel filtration followed by anion exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of Cv-LAAO is 120 kDa in its native form and 60 kDa in its monomeric form. The optimum enzyme activity was achieved on l-Leucine as a substrate in 50 mM buffer pH 7.5 at 50 째C. The Cv-LAAOI activity was significantly reduced by increasing the temperature over 40 째C , lost 75 % of its activity at 60 째C and inhibited completely at 80 째C. The Cv-LAAOI attains the highest substrate specificity towards L-Met. The results have also indicated that Mn
