  Modeling high-temperature ( tens or hundreds of eV) , dense plasmas is challenging due to the multitude of non-negligible physical effects including significant partial ionization and multisite effects. These effects cause the breakdown or intractability of common methods and approximations used at low temperatures , such as pseudopotentials or plane-wave basis sets. Here we explore the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green<symptom> 's function method at these high-temperature conditions. The method is all electron , does not rely on pseudopotentials , and uses a spherical harmonic basis set , and so avoids the aforementioned limitations. It is found to be accurate for solid density aluminum and iron plasmas when compared to a plane-wave method at low temperature , while being able to access high temperatures.
