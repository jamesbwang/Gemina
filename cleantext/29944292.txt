  In North<pathogen> America the massive increase in opioid prescriptions for chronic non-cancer pain has been a major health issue for several years. In Switzerland , the situation is less well known. This article aims to present the evolution of the Swiss consumption and replace it in a European and international context using the International Narcotics Control Board database. Between 1985 and 2015 , the Swiss opioid consumption raised from 18 to 421 mg/person/year , making Switzerland the 7th largest opioid consumer per capita in the world. This increase could be due to more adequate pain management or liberalized opioid prescription for indications unsupported by the current evidence. Given these elements , further research is needed , yet increased caution is recommended when prescribing opioid drugs.
