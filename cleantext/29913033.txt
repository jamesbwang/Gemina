  Clinical trials have shown conflicting results regarding the use of volatile anesthesia before or after the ischemic insult in cardiac surgical patients and effect on myocardial injury. This may be attributable to the failure of continuing volatile agents into the early postoperative period. We hypothesized that combined volatile-based anesthesia and postoperative sedation would decrease the extent of myocardial injury after coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) when compared to intravenous , propofol-based approach. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the perioperative protocol and investigate whether volatile anesthesia provide cardioprotection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG). Randomized , controlled trial enrolling 157 patients scheduled for elective or urgent on pump CABG. Patients received either volatile- or propofol-based anesthesia or postoperative sedation. Volatile sedation in the ICU was provided with use of the AnaConDa Â® device ( Sedana Medical , Uppsala , Sweden). The primary outcome was myocardial injury measured by serial troponin measurement at the beginning of surgery , 2 , 4 and 12-16 h after ICU admission. The secondary outcome was cardiac performance expressed as cardiac index and need for inotropic and vasopressor drug support. The peak postoperative troponin level was defined as the highest level at any time in the first 16 h after surgery. 127 patients completed the study protocol , 60 patients in volatile group and 67 patients in propofol group. Troponin levels were similar between groups at all of the measured time points. There were no differences in cardiac index or vasoactive drug support. There was no difference in postoperative kidney function , ICU discharge or hospital discharge time. The use of volatile-based anesthesia and postoperative sedation did not confer and cardioprotection compared to propofol-based anesthesia and sedation. < p > </ p >.
