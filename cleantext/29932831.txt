  The number of people in need of palliative care is growing worldwide , particularly in the developing world. The World Health Organization recognises palliative care as a basic human right , but there are many challenges for delivering palliative care in low- and middle-income countries. In the African continent , the African Palliative Care Association ( APCA) provides guidance for political advocacy for developing palliative care programmes and has developed the APCA Palliative Outcome Score ( POS) , an evidence-based tool for measuring outcomes of palliative care. This article focuses on palliative care delivery in Shirati , Tanzania , located in the Rorya District in the Mara Region in northern Tanzania , highlighting the impressive work done with limited resources and despite many challenges. Recommendations for future research include evaluation of outcomes using the APCA POS , the application of mobile technology , and governmental advocacy for increased access to opioid medications , which have shown promise in broadening the reach of palliative care in the East African Community.
