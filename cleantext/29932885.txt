  To provide important reliability and validity data to support the use of the PROMIS Mental Health measures in caregivers of civilians or service members/veterans with traumatic brain injury ( TBI). Patient-reported outcomes surveys administered through an electronic data collection platform. Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals , an academic medical center , and a military medical treatment facility. 560 caregivers of individuals with a documented TBI ( 344 civilians and 216 military) INTERVENTION: Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PROMIS Anxiety<symptom> , Depression<symptom> , and Anger Item Banks RESULTS: Internal consistency for all of the PROMIS Mental Health item banks was very good ( all Î± > .86) and three-week test retest reliability was good to adequate ( ranged from .65 to .85). Convergent validity and discriminant validity of the PROMIS measures was also supported. Caregivers of individuals that were low functioning had worse emotional HRQOL ( as measured by the three PROMIS measures) than caregivers of high functioning individuals , supporting known groups validity. Finally , levels of distress , as measured by the PROMIS measures , were elevated for those caring for low-functioning individuals in both samples ( rates ranged from 26.2 % to 43.6 % for caregivers of low-functioning individuals). Results support the reliability and validity of the PROMIS Anxiety<symptom> , Depression<symptom> , and Anger item banks in caregivers of civilians and service members/veterans with TBI. Ultimately , these measures can be used to provide a standardized assessment of HRQOL as it relates to mental health in these caregivers.
