  Computational models of vision have advanced in recent years at a rapid rate , rivalling in some areas human-level performance. Much of the progress to date has focused on analysing the visual scene at the object level-the recognition and localization of objects in the scene. Human understanding of images reaches a richer and deeper image understanding both ` below ' the object level , such as identifying and localizing object parts and sub-parts , as well as ` above ' the object level , such as identifying object relations , and agents with their actions and interactions. In both cases , understanding depends on recovering meaningful structures in the image , and their components , properties and inter-relations , a process referred here as ` image interpretation '. In this paper , we describe recent directions , based on human and computer vision studies , towards human-like image interpretation , beyond the reach of current schemes , both below the object level , as well as some aspects of image interpretation at the level of meaningful configurations beyond the recognition of individual objects , and in particular , interactions between two people in close contact. In both cases the recognition process depends on the detailed interpretation of so-called ` minimal images ' , and at both levels recognition depends on combining ` bottom-up ' processing , proceeding from low to higher levels of a processing hierarchy , together with ` top-down ' processing , proceeding from high to lower levels stages of visual analysis.
