  C-Unsubstituted 1,2-diazetidines , a rarely studied type of four-membered heterocyclic compounds , were synthesized through an operationally simple intermolecular vicinal disubstitution reaction. 1,2-Diazetidine derivatives bearing various N-arylsulfonyl groups were readily accessed and studied by experimental and computed Raman spectra. The ring-opening reaction of the diazetidine was explored and resulted in the identification of a selective N-N bond cleavage with thiols as nucleophiles , which stereoselectively produced a new class of N-sulfenylimine derivatives with C-aminomethyl groups.
