  Average-risk women aged 50-59 years have a lower incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer relative to age-matched men , calling into question the benefit of screening colonoscopy in this age group. We aimed to determine whether FOBT is an effective initial screening test in 50-59-year-old women. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a computerized endoscopic report generator. We identified 320,906 individuals who had average-risk screening colonoscopy and 32,369 who had colonoscopy for positive FOBT. The primary outcome was the positive predictive value ( PPV) of FOBT for large polyp ( s) greater than 9 mm , as a surrogate for advanced neoplasia. Among patients aged 50-59 years undergoing screening colonoscopy , men were more likely than women to have large polyps ( 6.3 vs 4.2 % , p < 0.0001). Black women undergoing screening colonoscopy had higher rates of large polyps compared to non-Black women. The PPV in FOBT-positive men aged 50-54 ( 11.5 %) and 55-59 ( 14.4 %) was higher than in women aged 50-54 ( 6.1 %) and 55-59 ( 5.4 %). Despite this lower PPV , women aged 50-54 with a positive FOBT had a similar rate of large polyps as 50-54-year-old men undergoing screening colonoscopy ( 6.1 vs 6.3 % , p = 0.626). CRC screening with FOBT identifies 50-59-year-old men and women with a higher risk of large polyps. Since younger women have a lower risk of large polyps than men , screening with FOBT in 50-59-year-old non-Black women could be an effective screening strategy , with outcomes similar to the use of screening colonoscopy in 50-59-year-old men.
