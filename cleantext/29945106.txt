  Four affinity ligands were designed from 6-chloromethyluracil and 2-aminobenzimidazole and simulated for the interaction with bovine hyaluronidase-1. Regarding sequence alignment , bovine hyaluronidase-1 precursor showed circa 83.6 % similarity with human hyaluronidase-1. Regarding structural modeling and molecular docking , bovine hyaluronidase-1 interacted with ligands in the active site. Using epichlorohydrin , 1,3-propanediamine and cyanuric chloride as spacers , 6-chloromethyluracil and 2-aminobenzimidazole were composed to Sepharose beads. The modified Sepharose beads were then subjected to adsorption analysis with bovine hyaluronidase. After one step of affinity adsorption , the samples extracted from bovine testes were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE) analysis and activity assay. As calculated , the densities of four ligands on sorbents ( entitled as L-1 , L-2 , L-3 and L-4) were 37.7 ± 2.3 , 36.4 ± 3.2 , 42.4 ± 4.2 and 33.7 ± 2.3 μmol/g wet gel; the theoretical maximum adsorption ( Q
