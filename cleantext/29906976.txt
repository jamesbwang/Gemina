  Critical properties of the two-dimensional XY model involving solely nematic-like terms of the second and third orders are investigated by spin-wave analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that , even though neither of the nematic-like terms alone can induce magnetic ordering , their coexistence and competition leads to an extended phase of the magnetic quasi-long-range-order phase , wedged between the two nematic-like phases induced by the respective couplings. Thus , except for the multicritical point , at which all the phases meet , for any finite value of the coupling parameters ratio there are two phase transition: one from the paramagnetic phase to one of the two nematic-like phases followed by another one at lower temperatures to the magnetic phase. The finite-size scaling analysis indicates that the phase transitions between the magnetic and nematic-like phases belong to the Ising and three-state Potts universality classes. Inside the competition-induced algebraic magnetic phase , the spin-pair correlation function is found to decay even much more slowly than in the standard XY model with purely magnetic interactions. Such a magnetic phase is characterized by an extremely low vortex-antivortex pair density attaining a minimum close to the point at which the two couplings are of about equal strength.
