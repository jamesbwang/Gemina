  Neuraxial labor analgesia has become an integral part of modern obstetric anesthetic practice. Presence of a familiar person during its placement may be beneficial to the patient. A survey was sent to anesthesiologists practicing obstetric anesthesia in the USA to determine their views. The survey queried the following: existence of a written policy; would they allow a visitor; visitor 's view , sitting or standing; reasons to allow or not allow a visitor; and influence by other staff on the decision. The responses were analyzed using multiple chi-square analyses. Most practitioners supported allowing a visitor during placement. Reduction of patient anxiety<symptom> and fulfillment of patient request were the major reasons for allowing a visitor. Sitting position and no view of the workspace were preferred. Visitor interference and safety were cited as the major reasons for precluding a visitor. Nonanesthesia providers rarely influenced the decision. Epidural analgesia was the preferred technique. Essentially no bias was found in the responses; there was statistical uniformity regardless of procedures done per week , years in practice , professional certification , geographic region ( rural , urban , or suburban) , or academic , private , or government responders. The practice of visitor presence during the placement of neuraxial labor analgesia is gaining acceptance.
