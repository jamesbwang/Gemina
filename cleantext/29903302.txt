  To explore related factors for early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus ( EOD) in rural Chinese adults. Totally , 1695 newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) were recruited from baseline survey of Yuhuan Rural Adults Cohort for Diabetes during June to December 2012 in Yuhuan County , Zhejiang Province , China , and divided into EOD or late-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus ( LOD) with their diagnosis age at ≤ 40 or > 40 years , respectively. Diagnosis age was compared among different characteristics. Logistic regression was used to analyze related factors in EOD. Among 1695 new T2 DM cases , near half ( 47. 3 %) were men and 85 ( 5. 0 %) were grouped into EOD. Their mean age at diagnosis of T2 DM was ( 60. 39 ± 12. 49) years overall. Men or those with more than 9 education years , family average personal income ≥ 2000 Yuan per month , less occupational physical activities , smoking , drinking , overweight and family history of T2 DM had lower average age at diagnosis than women or those without them , while those with regular physical exercise had higher that than those without that. After the adjustment for other covariates , multiple logistic regression showed that more than 9 education years ( OR = 6. 62 , 95 % CI 3. 87-11. 32) , family average personal income ≥ 2000 Yuan per month ( OR = 6. 60 , 95 % CI 3. 32-13. 12) , and regular physical exercise ( OR = 0. 37 , 95 % CI 0. 17-0. 80) were independently correlated to EOD. Education level , income , and regular exercise are significantly correlated to EOD in rural Chinese adults.
