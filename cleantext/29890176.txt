  Hybrid molecules based on a number of steroids ( cholesterol , pregnenolone , androsterone) and 1,14-tetradeca-5Z ,9 Z-dienedicarboxylic acid linked via mono- and diethylene glycol spacers were synthesized for the first time and studied for antitumor activity in vitro. The acid was prepared using catalytic cyclomagnesiation of oxygenated 1,2-dienes with Grignard reagent in the presence of Cp
