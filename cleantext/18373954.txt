  Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumour in women , and an appropriate animal model for leiomyoma would be useful for exploring new therapeutic strategies. Therefore , we have been challenged to develop a new simple mouse model for human leiomyoma. Leiomyoma tissues were harvested from myomas resected by different surgical procedures with or without gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa) treatment and were subcutaneously implanted into BALB/c nude mice with an estradiol/progesterone-releasing pellet. The implanted leiomyoma tissues that were obtained from the marginal site of large myomas resected by abdominal myomectomy with GnRHa treatment exhibited sufficient tumour growth in the transplanted mice. The leiomyomas that were treated with GnRHa highly expressed the estrogen/progesterone receptor genes , insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2) and embryonic smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMemb) , which suggests that these factors are critical in the establishment of a mouse model of growing leiomyoma. As a result , this model will be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
