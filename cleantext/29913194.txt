  A new unusual seco-isopimarane , kaemgalangol A ( 1) and 12 usual analogs ( 2-13) were isolated from the rhizomes of Kaempferia galanga ( Family: Zingiberaceae). KaemgalangolA ( 1) represented a rarely isolated 9,10-seco-isopimarane skeleton. The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were mainlyinvestigated by spectroscopic techniques such as 1D , 2D NMR , and HRMS. The absolute configuration of 1-3 was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis as well as experimental and TDDFT-calculated electronic circular dichroism. Among the isolated diterpenoids , 5 , 6 and 9 exhibited cytotoxic activity against HeLa ( IC
