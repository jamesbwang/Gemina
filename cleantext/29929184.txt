  Following the successful development of virus-based gene vehicles for genetic therapies , exploitation of viruses as carriers of genetic tools for cellular reprogramming and genome editing should be right up the street. However , whereas persistent , potentially life-long gene expression is the main goal of conventional genetic therapies , tools and bits for genome engineering should ideally be short-lived and active only for a limited time. Although viral vector systems have already been adapted for potent genome editing both in vitro and in vivo , regulatable gene expression systems or self-limiting expression circuits need to be implemented limiting exposure of chromatin to genome-modifying enzymes. As an alternative approach , emerging virus-based protein delivery technologies support direct protein delivery , providing a short , robust boost of enzymatic activity in transduced cells. Is this potentially the perfect way of shipping loads of cargo to many recipients and still maintain short-term activity?
