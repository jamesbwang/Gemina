  The plant shoot system consists of reproductive organs such as inflorescences , buds and fruits , and the vegetative leaves and stems. In this study , the reproductive part of the Jatropha curcas shoot system , which includes the aerial shoots , shoots bearing the inflorescence and inflorescence were investigated in regard to gene-to-gene interactions underpinning yield-related biological processes. An RNA-seq based sequencing of shoot tissues performed on an Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform generated 18 transcriptomes. Using the reference genome-based mapping approach , a total of 64 361 genes was identified in all samples and the data was annotated against the non-redundant database by the BLAST2GO Pro. Suite. After removing the outlier genes and samples , a total of 12 734 genes across 17 samples were subjected to gene co-expression network construction using petal , an R library. A gene co-expression network model built with scale-free and small-world properties extracted four vicinity networks ( VNs) with putative involvement in yield-related biological processes as follow; heat stress tolerance , floral and shoot meristem differentiation , biosynthesis of chlorophyll molecules and laticifers , cell wall metabolism and epigenetic regulations. Our VNs revealed putative key players that could be adapted in breeding strategies for J. curcas shoot system improvements.
