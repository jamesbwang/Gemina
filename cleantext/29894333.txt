  Tracheobronchial calcifications are common in adults and considered as a physiological process of aging with no clinical significance in otherwise asymptomatic , healthy individuals. We are presenting a case of tracheobronchial tree calcifications as detected on F-NaF PET/CT in a 75-year-old woman. Many previous publications have reported the accumulation of NaF in extraosseous organs; these observations further set new directions in the evaluation of the metabolic activity of macrocalcification and microcalcification using molecular imaging probes.
