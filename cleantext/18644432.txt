  Performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) causes significant mental stress for rescuers , especially if performed by inexperienced individuals. Our aim was to study electrocardiogram ( ECG) alterations in rescuers and its association with gender and CPR performance. We included 126 medical students in this prospective , observational simulator study. Each student was equipped with a 3-lead continuous ECG device tracking the individual electrocardiographic output before , during and after CPR. We analyzed variations in heart rate , heart-rate variability ( HRV) and ST- and T-wave morphology. Compared to baseline , mean heart rate ( bpm) significantly increased during resuscitation and again decreased after resuscitation ( from 87 to 97 to 80 , p < 0.001). Heart-rate variability ( the standard deviation of all N-N intervals , SDNN) ( ms2) showed the opposite pattern , decreasing during resuscitation and increasing after resuscitation ( 117 to 92 to 93ms , p < 0.001). Abnormalities in T-waves and ST-segments were observed in 29.4 % of participants. Maximal heart rate ( r = 0.25 , p = 0.046) as well as heart rate reactivity ( r = 0.7 , p < 0.001) correlated with hands-on time , a measure of CPR performance. Compared to males , female rescuers had a significantly higher maximal heart rate ( 136 bpm vs. 126 bpm , p = 0.008) and lower HRV ( SDNN 102 vs. 119ms , p = 0.004) and tended to show more abnormalities in T-waves and ST-segments ( 36 % vs. 21 % , p = 0.080). CPR causes significant ECG alterations in healthy medical students with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities , with more pronounced effects in females. Clinical implications of these findings need to be further investigated.
