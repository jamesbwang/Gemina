  Grassland ecosystems are sensitive to invasions by plants from other functional groups which can alter soil greenhouse gas ( GHG) fluxes. However , the effects of plant invasion on net GHG exchanges between soils and the atmosphere , plant production , and global warming potential ( GWP) of annual grasslands is poorly understood. To evaluate the impacts of perennial forb invasions on GHG budgets of an annual grassland in China , we measured soil carbon dioxide ( CO
