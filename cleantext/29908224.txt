  This study demonstrated the effects of traumatic brain injury ( TBI) and each step of the surgical procedure for a fluid percussion injury ( FPI) model on periorbital allodynia. Adult male Wistar rats were divided in naive , incision , scraping , sham-TBI and TBI groups. Periorbital allodynia was evaluated using von Frey filaments , and heat hyperalgesia of the hindpaws was evaluated by a Plantar Test Apparatus. The statistical analyses revealed that the surgical procedure decreased von Frey filaments thresholds twenty-four hours after the surgery in all groups when compared to the naive group ( p < 0.0001). Scraping , sham-TBI and TBI groups showed a decrease in the periorbital mechanical threshold for 35 days compared with the naive and incision groups ( p < 0.0001). Only the TBI group demonstrated a significant difference in periorbital allodynia at 45 and 60 days after the injury ( p < 0.01). A significant decrease in the thermal withdrawal latency of the hindpaw contralateral to the lesion<symptom> was observed in the TBI group compared with the naive group at 7 days and 28 days after the lesion<symptom> ( p < 0.05). This study presented in detail the effects of each stage of the surgical procedure for a FPI model on periorbital allodynia over time and characterized the TBI model for this evaluation. The FPI model is relevant for the study of headache<symptom> and generalized pain in both acute and chronic phases after an injury.
