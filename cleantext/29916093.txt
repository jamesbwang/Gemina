  Mitochondrial intracrines are extracellular signaling proteins , targeted to the mitochondria. The pathway for mitochondrial targeting of mitochondrial intracrines and actions in the mitochondria remains unknown. Megalin/LRP2 mediates the uptake of vitamins and proteins , and is critical for clearance of amyloid-β protein from the brain. Megalin mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Donnai-Barrow and Lowe syndromes<disease> , characterized by brain defects and kidney dysfunction; megalin was not previously known to reside in the mitochondria. Here , we show megalin is present in the mitochondria and associates with mitochondrial anti-oxidant proteins SIRT3 and stanniocalcin-1 ( STC1). Megalin shuttles extracellularly-applied STC1 , angiotensin II and TGF-β to the mitochondria through the retrograde early endosome-to-Golgi transport pathway and Rab32. Megalin knockout in cultured cells impairs glycolytic and respiratory capacities. Thus , megalin is critical for mitochondrial biology; mitochondrial intracrine signaling is a continuum of the retrograde early endosome-to-Golgi-Rab32 pathway and defects in this pathway may underlie disease processes in many systems.
