  Cell-matrix interactions play critical roles in cell adhesion , tissue remodeling and cancer metastasis. Discoidin domain receptor 2 ( DDR2) is a collagen receptor belonging to receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK) family. It is a powerful regulator of collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix ( ECM). Although the oligomerization of DDR extracellular domain ( ECD) proteins can affect matrix remodeling by inhibiting fibrillogenesis , it is still unknown how cellular DDR2 is incorporated into collagen matrix. Using 3-dimentional ( 3D) imaging for migrating cells , we identified a novel mechanism that explains how DDR2 incorporating into collagen matrix , which we named as posterior remnant tethering. We followed the
