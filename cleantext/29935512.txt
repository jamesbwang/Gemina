  This work aims to introduce a generalized impulsive model for unimolecular dissociation processes. This model allows us to take into account the curvature of the reaction path explicitly. It is a generalization of the previously developed multi-center impulsive model ( P.-Y. Tsai and K.-C. Lin , J. Phys. Chem. A 119 , 29 ( 2015)). Several limitations of conventional impulsive models are eliminated by this study: ( 1) Unlike conventional impulsive models , in which a single molecular geometry is responsible for the impulse determination , the gradients on the whole dissociation path are taken into account. The model can treat dissociation pathways with large curvatures and loose saddle points. ( 2) The method can describe the vibrational excitation of polyatomic fragments due to the bond formation by multi-center impulse. ( 3) The available energy in conventional impulsive models is separated into uncoupled statistical and impulsive energy reservoirs , while the interplay between these reservoirs is allowed in the new model. ( 4) The quantum state correlation between fragments can be preserved in analysis. Dissociations of several molecular systems including the roaming pathways of formaldehyde , nitrate radical , acetaldehyde , and glyoxal are chosen as benchmarks. The predicted photofragment energy and vector distributions are consistent with the experimental results reported previously. In these examples , the capability of the new model to treat the curved dissociation path , loose saddle points , polyatomic fragments , and multiple-body dissociation is verified. As a cheaper computational tool with respect to ab initio on-the-fly direct dynamic simulations , this model can provide detailed information on the energy disposal , quantum state correlation , and stereodynamics in unimolecular dissociation processes.
