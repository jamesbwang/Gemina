  This study was to determine differences in the global metabolic profiles of serum and urine of Xuanhan yellow cattle , Simmental crossbred cattle ( Simmental × Xuanhan yellow cattle) , and cattle-yaks ( Jersey × Maiwa yak) under heat stress ( temperature-humidity index remained above 80 for 1 week). A total of 55 different metabolites associated with the three breeds were identified in the serum and urine samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The metabolic adaptations to heat stress are heterogeneous. Cattle-yaks mobilize a greater amount of body protein to release glucogenic amino acids to supply energy , whereas the tricarboxylic acid cycle is inhibited. Simmental crossbred cattle mobilize a greater amount of body fat to use free fatty acids as an energy source. In comparison with Simmental crossbred cattle and cattle-yaks , Xuanhan yellow cattle have higher glycolytic activity and possess a stronger antioxidant defense system and are , in conclusion , more adapted to hot and humid environments.
