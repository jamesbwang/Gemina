  Development of the Assessment in Spondyloarthritis International Society ( ASAS) classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis ( SpA) was one of the major breakthroughs in the field over the past decade. Despite some concerns related to the specificity of the criteria , they stimulated research into the early stage of the disease. This resulted in major advances in the understanding of the course of the disease , revealing predictors of progression , improvement in early diagnosis and treatment in axial SpA. In this review , we summarize the recent developments resulting from the introduction of the ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA and the implications for research and clinical practice.
