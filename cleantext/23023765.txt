  To evaluate oxidative stress in saliva of children with dental erosion as compared to children with no erosion. One single examiner , trained and prepared to make diagnosis of dental erosion according to the Basic Erosive Wear Examination index , selected 40 children aged 4 to 6 years , who attended a pediatric dentistry prevention clinic. Two groups were formed- one comprising children with dental erosion ( n = 22) , and another with no dental erosion ( n = 18). The quantity of dental biofilm was verified using the Simplified Index of Oral Hygiene , and unstimulated saliva was collected for biochemical analyses. The following were assessed in saliva: flow rate , buffering capacity , pH , and total protein concentration. Malondialdehyde levels were also verified to determine oxidative stress and total antioxidant status. The quantity of biofilm was smaller in children with mean dental erosion ± standard deviation ( 0.76 ± 0.25) , as compared to those with no dental erosion ( 1.18 ± 0.28). There was no statistical difference in saliva parameters of oxidative stress in children with dental erosion. The activity of oxidative stress in saliva did not influence dental erosion process when in its early stages.
