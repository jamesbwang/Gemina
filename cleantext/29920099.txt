  Chemical investigation of an Australian fungus , Aspergillus banksianus , led to the isolation of the major metabolite banksialactone A ( 1) , eight new isochromanones , banksialactones B-I ( 2-9) , two new isocoumarins , banksiamarins A and B ( 10 and 11) , and the reported compounds , clearanol I ( 12) , dothideomynone A ( 13) , questin ( 14) , and endocrocin ( 15). The structures of 1-11 were established by NMR spectroscopic data analysis , and the absolute configurations were determined from optical rotations and ECD spectra in conjunction with TD-DFT calculations. The secondary metabolite profile of A. banksianus is unusual , with the 11 most abundant metabolites belonging to a single isochromanone class. Conjugation of 1 with endocrocin , 5-methylorsellinic acid , 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid , mercaptolactic acid , and an unknown methylthio source gave rise to five unprecedented biosynthetic hybrids , 5-9. The isolated compounds were tested for cytotoxicity , antibacterial , and antifungal activities , with hybrid metabolites 7-9 displaying weak cytotoxic and antibiotic activities.
