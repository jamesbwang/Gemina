  Spinophilin is the most abundant protein phosphatase 1 targeting protein in the postsynaptic density of dendritic spines. Spinophilin associates with myriad synaptic proteins to regulate normal synaptic communication; however , the full complement of spinophilin interacting proteins and mechanisms regulating spinophilin interactions are unclear. Here we validate an association between spinophilin and the scaffolding protein , disks large-associated protein 3 ( SAP90/PSD -95 associated protein 3; SAPAP3). Loss of SAPAP3 leads to obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD)- like behaviors due to alterations in metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR) signaling. Here we report that spinophilin associates with SAPAP3 in the brain and in a heterologous cell system. Moreover , we have found that expression or activation of group I mGluRs along with activation of the mGluR-dependent kinase , protein kinase C Î² , enhances this interaction. Functionally , global loss of spinophilin attenuates amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion , a striatal behavior associated with dopamine dysregulation and OCD. Together , these data delineate a novel link between mGluR signaling , spinophilin , and SAPAP3 in striatal pathophysiology.
