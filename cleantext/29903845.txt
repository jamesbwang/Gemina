  In observational cohorts , adiponectin is inversely associated and free fatty acids ( FFAs) are directly associated with incident coronary heart disease ( CHD). Adiponectin tends to be reduced and FFAs elevated in type 2 diabetes. We investigated relationships of adiponectin and FFA and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACEs) and death in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) and type 2 diabetes using data from the AleCardio ( Effect of Aleglitazar on Cardiovascular Outcomes After Acute Coronary Syndrome<disease> in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) trial , which compared the PPAR-α/γ agonist aleglitazar with placebo. Using Cox regression adjusted for demographic , laboratory , and treatment variables , we determined associations of baseline adiponectin and FFAs , or the change in adiponectin and FFAs from baseline , with MACEs ( cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or stroke) and death. A twofold higher baseline adiponectin ( In contrast to prior observational data for incident CHD , adiponectin is prospectively associated with MACEs and death in patients with type 2 diabetes and ACS , and an increase in adiponectin from baseline is directly related to death. These findings raise the possibility that adiponectin has different effects in patients with type 2 diabetes and ACS than in populations without prevalent cardiovascular disease. Consistent with prior data , FFAs are directly associated with adverse outcomes.
