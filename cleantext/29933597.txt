  The sequencing and comparison of plastid genomes are becoming a standard method in plant genomics , and many researchers are using this approach to infer plant phylogenetic relationships. Due to the widespread availability of next-generation sequencing , plastid genome sequences are being generated at breakneck pace. This trend towards massive sequencing of plastid genomes highlights the need for standardized bioinformatic workflows. In particular , documentation and dissemination of the details of genome assembly , annotation , alignment and phylogenetic tree inference are needed , as these processes are highly sensitive to the choice of software and the precise settings used. Here , we present the procedure and results of sequencing , assembling , annotating and quality-checking of three complete plastid genomes of the aquatic plant genus
