  Silatrane surface anchors are protected siloxanes that are known to bond firmly ( from pH 2-11) to metal oxide electrodes under heating. However , these conditions are not always compatible with the other functionality present. A silatrane-containing porphyrin molecule and a silatrane-containing ruthenium complex have now been designed , synthesized and optimized conditions have been identified for surface binding. Two mild , room-temperature surface binding methods were explored: binding with or without an acidic pretreatment; these methods were compared to the traditional , harsher binding conditions involving strong heating. We find that a preacidified electrode gave comparable surface loadings at room temperature compared to sensitization by using the previous strong heating method. This was also true on TiO
