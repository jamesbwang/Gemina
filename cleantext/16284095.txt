  Factors determining bone mineral ( BM) loss in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) are not well known. This study aimed to determine the occurrence and predictors of BM loss in the young premenopausal women with RA. Ninety-six females with RA and 90 matched controls underwent clinical , biochemical , BM density ( BMD) , and body composition assessments. RA disease activity was assessed using disease activity score-28 ( DAS-28) and hand X-ray. In the young premenopausal females with RA having median symptom and treatment duration of 30 ( 18-60) and 4 ( 2-12) months , respectively , with moderate disease activity ( DAS-28 , 4.88 Â± 1.17) , occurrence of osteoporosis and osteopenia was 7.29 % and 25 % at spine , 6.25 % and 32.29 % at hip , and 17.7 % and 56.25 % at wrist , respectively ( significantly higher than controls). RA patients had lower BMD at total femur , lumbar spine ( LS) , radius total , and radius ultra-distal. Total lean mass ( LM) and BM content were significantly lower in RA ( BM loss is a significant problem in the young premenopausal women with recent-onset RA. LM and disease severity were the best predictors of BMD.
