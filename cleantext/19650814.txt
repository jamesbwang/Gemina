  We aimed to evaluate the relation of total homocysteine ( tHcy) concentrations with systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) levels , and examine the possible modifiers in the association among a general population of Chinese adults. A cross-sectional study. The study was conducted within 21 communities in Lianyungang of Jiangsu province , China. A total of 26648 participants aged ≥ 35 years and with no antihypertensive drug use were included in the final analysis. Overall , there was a positive association between tHcy concentrations and SBP ( per 5 μmol/L tHcy increase: adjusted β = 0.45 mm Hg; 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.61) or DBP levels ( per 5 μmol/L tHcy increase: adjusted β = 0.47 mm Hg; 95 % CI 0.35 to 0.59). Compared with participants with tHcy < 10 μmol/L , significantly higher SBP levels were found in those with tHcy concentrations of 10 to < 15 ( adjusted β = 0.80 mm Hg; 95 % CI 0.32 to 1.28) and ≥ 15 µmol/L ( adjusted β = 1.79 mm Hg; 95 % CI 1.20 to 2.37; p for trend < 0.001). Consistently , significantly higher DBP levels were found in participants with tHcy concentrations of 10 to < 15 ( adjusted β = 0.86 mm Hg; 95 % CI 0.49 to 1.22) and ≥ 15 µmol/L ( adjusted β = 2.01 mm Hg; 95 % CI 1.57 to 2.46; p for trend < 0.001) , respectively as compared with those with < 10 μmol/L. Furthermore , a stronger association between tHcy and SBP ( p for interaction = 0.009) or DBP ( p for interaction = 0.067) was found in current alcohol drinkers. Serum tHcy concentrations were positively associated with both SBP and DBP levels in a general Chinese adult population. The association was stronger in current alcohol drinkers.
