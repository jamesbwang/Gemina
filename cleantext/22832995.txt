  State health agencies ( SHA) and local health agencies ( LHA) face several challenges with the dissemination of local health data using Web-Based Data Query Systems ( WDQS). To help guide future research , this study aimed to utilize expert consensus to identify the most relevant items that contribute to these challenges. A total of 17 researchers and public health professionals agreed to participate in a three-round Delphi process. In round 1 , four topics were represented on a 42-item questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale , along with free-text responses. Free-text responses were analyzed leading to a series of items for a second Delphi round. Participants were given an opportunity to revise results in round 3 for items that did not meet consensus in round 1 or round 2. Consensus on expert opinions was defined at interquartile range ( IQR) â‰¤ 1. The experts reached consensus on a total of 21 ( 50 %) of the 42 items presented in the initial questionnaire. Eleven of the 15 ( 73 %) of the items extracted from the free-text responses met consensus. Items in consensus from this pilot study were used to develop an instrument for a broader survey across Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS) coordinators across all 50 US states. Experts confirmed that software development costs , inadequate human resources , data sharing gaps , a lack of political support , and poor data quality contribute significantly to challenges in their data implementation. The findings from this pilot study inform us of items of public health significance that will help guide future research.
