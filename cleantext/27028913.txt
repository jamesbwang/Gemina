  Understanding the details of one individual 's experience with pain , opioid use and withdrawal may generate insights into possible relationships between opioid-induced hyperalgesia and withdrawal-associated injury site pain ( WISP). This case study was extracted from a mixed methods study that characterized WISP. In 2014 , the individual was recruited from a primary care clinic that prescribes opioid agonist therapy. In an interview , she completed a 35-item survey and elaborated on her own experience. Follow-up contact was made in June of 2017. This 34-year-old white woman had several twisting injuries of her right knee between ages 13 and 15. The pain resolved each time in a few days , and she was pain free for 15 years. Around age 30 , she initiated illicit oxycodone recreationally ( not for pain) and developed an opioid use disorder. On detoxification , she experienced severe knee pain for 6 weeks that resolved postdetoxification but returned after subsequent oxycodone use and withdrawal episodes along with generalized skin sensitivity. This experience of WISP became a barrier to opioid cessation. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and gabapentin relieved WISP and methadone therapy assisted her opioid use disorder , an eventual change to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone provided superior control of both. This case report illustrates that both opioid use and withdrawal can reactivate injury site pain , which can increase with dose escalation and repeated withdrawal events. The timing , trajectory , and neuropathic features of WISP reported here are consistent with those previously reported for the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia , possibly linking these phenomena.
