  AKT plays a centralized role in tumor proliferation and survival and is aberrantly activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). In this phase 2 trial , 30 relapsed/refractory CLL patients were treated with combination afuresertib , a novel oral AKT inhibitor , and ofatumumab for 6 months , followed by afuresertib maintenance for 12 months. We aimed to achieve deeper and more durable responses , without requiring long-term continuous treatment. Treatment was generally well tolerated but respiratory<disease> infections<disease> were common , with 18 % severe requiring hospitalization. Hematologic toxicities were manageable ( grade 3-4 neutropenia 39 %). At a median follow-up of 13.4 months , overall responses were 50 % ( complete responses 3.6 %). Median progression-free survival was 8.5 months and overall survival 34.8 months. Combination therapy with ofatumumab and afuresertib is active and well tolerated , but does not appear to lead to durable responses and may not provide additional benefit over single-agent ofatumumab in relapsed/refractory CLL. Novel agent combinations are currently undergoing intense investigation.
