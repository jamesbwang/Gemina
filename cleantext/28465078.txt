  A 69-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with photosensitivity , symmetric erosive polyarthritis , and cutaneous vasculitis of lower extremities. Rhupus syndrome<disease> was diagnosed , and Chiari 's network in the right atrium and interatrial septum patent foramen ovale<disease> was achieved on transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. If it is thought that increased prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with rhupus , this congenital remnant is important for the thrombosis risk , cardiac event , and stroke. The association of both diseases may lead to more serious events and cause worse prognosis. Here , our aim is to present a 69-year-old female patient with rhupus syndrome<disease> presenting with cutaneous vasculitis and Chiari 's network in the right atrium.
