  Topological insulators have unconventional gapless edge states where disorder-induced back-scattering is suppressed. In photonics , such edge states lead to unidirectional waveguides which are useful for integrated photonic circuitry. Cavity modes , another type of fundamental component in photonic chips , however , are not protected by band topology because of their lower dimensions. Here we demonstrate that concurrent wavevector space and real-space topology , dubbed as dual-topology , can lead to light-trapping in lower dimensions. The resultant photonic-bound state emerges as a Jackiw-Rebbi soliton mode localized on a dislocation in a two-dimensional photonic crystal , as proposed theoretically and discovered experimentally. Such a strongly confined cavity mode is found to be robust against perturbations. Our study unveils a mechanism for topological light-trapping in lower dimensions , which is invaluable for fundamental physics and various applications in photonics.
