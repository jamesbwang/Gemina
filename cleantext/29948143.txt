  In previous work , we built a neuromechanical model for insect locomotion in the horizontal plane , containing a central pattern generator , motoneurons , muscles actuating jointed legs , and rudimentary proprioceptive feedback. This was subsequently simplified to a set of 24 phase oscillators describing motoneuronal activation of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs , which facilitates analyses and enables simulations over multi-dimensional parameter spaces. Here we use the phase-reduced model to study dynamics and stability over the typical speed range of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis , the effects of feedback on response to perturbations , strategies for turning , and a trade-off between stability and maneuverability. We also compare model behavior with experiments on lateral perturbations , changes in body mass and moment of inertia , and climbing dynamics , and we present a simple control strategy for steering using exteroceptive feedback.
