  The objective of this study was to investigate mid-term clinical outcomes of patients treated with ` full-plastic jacket ' ( FPJ) everolimus-eluting Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BRS) implantation. FPJ with BRS may represent an interesting option for patient with diffuse coronary artery disease ( CAD) , but data on the clinical impact of FPJ using the Absorb BRS are scant. FPJ was defined as the implantation of > 56 mm of overlapping BRS in at least one vessel. We compared outcomes of patients receiving Absorb FPJ vs. non-FPJ within the multicenter prospective RAI Registry. Out of 1505 consecutive patients enrolled in the RAI registry , 1384 were eligible for this analysis. Of these , 143 ( 10.3 %) were treated with BRS FPJ. At a median follow-up of 649 days , no differences were observed between FPJ and non-FPJ groups in terms of the device-oriented composite endpoint ( DoCE) ( 5.6 % vs. 4.4 % , p = 0.675) or the patient-related composite endpoint ( PoCE) ( 20.9 % vs. 15.9 % , p = 0.149). Patients receiving FPJ had higher rates of target vessel repeat revascularization ( TVR) ( 11.2 % vs. 6.3 % , p = 0.042). In the FPJ group , there was no cardiac death and only one ( very late) stent thrombosis ( ST) ( 0.7 %). Mid-term outcomes of a FPJ PCI strategy in the setting of diffuse CAD did not show a significant increase in composite device- and patient-related events , with rates of cardiac death and ST comparable to non-FPJ Absorb BRS implantation. However , these findings are hypothesis generating and requiring further validation.
