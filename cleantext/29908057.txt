  The risk of suffering anxiety<symptom> disorders is associated with sustained subthreshold symptoms of anxiety<symptom>. This study evaluated the stability of anxiety<symptom> scores ( high , moderate or low) across a six-month period in early adolescents ( N = 95). The associations between sustained anxiety<symptom> , vagally-mediated heart rate variability ( vmHRV) , sympathetic activity , and heart rate fractal dynamics in everyday life conditions were analyzed. The anxiety<symptom> scores from 71.50 % of participants remained at the same level. The linear correlations between anxiety<symptom> and cardiac measures were weak but a group-based approach revealed that the fractal dimension ( FD) from stable-low anxiety<symptom> participants was higher than the FD from participants with stable-moderate anxiety<symptom> scores but not higher than the FD from the stable-high anxiety<symptom> group. The short-term correlations ' exponent a1 from the stable-high anxiety<symptom> group was higher than the a1 from the stable-moderate anxiety<symptom> group but not higher than the exponent from the stable-low anxiety<symptom> group. No differences were found in the vmHRV nor sympathetic activity. The lack of a direct association between the complexity of the heart rate and the level of sustained anxiety<symptom> suggests a nonlinear pattern of associations that would be in accordance with the optimum variability principle.
