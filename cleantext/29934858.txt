  Nardostachys jatamansi has profound applications against pharmacological interventions and is categorized as a hypno-sedative drug according to Ayurveda. In the present study probable mechanism of anxiolytic action of Nardostachys jatamansi extract ( NJE) was studied using behavioral anxiolytic tests ( Elevated plus maze , Open field test , Light dark box test , and Vogel 's conflict test) in mice. Mice were treated orally with NJE ( 250 mg/kg) for 3 , 7 and 14 days or diazepam ( 1 mg/kg) followed by behavioral assessment and estimation of monoamine neurotransmitters , GABA , and antioxidant enzymes. Treatment of mice for 7 days caused an increase in time spent in open arms in elevated plus maze , number of line crossings in open field test , increased time spent in lit compartment of light-dark box test , an increase in number of licks made and shocks<disease> accepted in Vogel 's conflict test , with results comparable to diazepam and this treatment also caused a significant increase in monoamine neurotransmitters and GABA in brain and tissue antioxidant parameters. Co-treatment of NJE with flumazenil ( GABA-benzodiazepine antagonist; 0.5 mg/kg i.p) or picrotoxin ( GABA
