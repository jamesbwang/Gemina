  The purpose of this study was a dosimetric validation of the Vero4DRT for brain stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT) with extremely small fields calculated by the treatment planning system ( TPS) iPlan ( Ver .4.5.1; algorithm XVMC). Measured and calculated data ( e.g. percentage depth dose ( PDD) , dose profile , and point dose) were compared for small square fields of 30 × 30 , 20 × 20 , 10 × 10 and 5 × 5 mm
