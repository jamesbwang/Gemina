  A mesoporous imine-functionalized organic polymer ( Imine-POP) was prepared based on the reaction of an aryl ammonium salt with an aromatic aldehyde in water without any catalyst and template. The Pd coordinated Imine-POP exhibited high catalytic activity for the N-formylation of amines with CO2/H2 at 100 Â°C , affording a series of formamides in high yields.
