  Functional gastrointestinal disturbance occurs after abdominal surgeries and could last for an extended period of time in some cases. This study was designed ( 1) to evaluate the effects of needleless transcutaneous electrical acustimulation ( TEA) on postoperative recovery , and ( 2) to investigate the mechanisms involving autonomic function in postoperative patients after removal of gastrointestinal cancers. Forty-two patients ( 33 male , age: 69.5 ± 1.5 years) scheduled for abdominal surgical removal of gastrointestinal cancers were randomized to TEA ( n = 21) and sham-TEA ( n = 21). TEA was performed via acupoints ST36 and PC6 1 h twice daily from the postoperative day ( POD) 1 to day 3. Sham-TEA was performed at non-acupoints. ( 1) TEA improved major postoperative symptoms by about 30 % , including a reduction in time to defecation by 31.7 % ( P < 0.01 vs. sham-TEA) , time to first flatus by 35.9 % ( P < 0.001) , time to ambulation by 42.8 % ( P < 0.01) , time to resuming diet by 26.5 % ( P < 0.01) and hospital stay by 30 % ( P < 0.05) as well as pain score by 50 % ( P < 0.01). ( 2) TEA significantly increased vagal activity ( P < 0.001) and decreased sympathetic activity on POD 4 ( P < 0.001) compared with POD 1 as well as the serum level of NE ( P < 0.05). ( 3) The vagal activity , high frequency assessed from the spectral analysis of heart rate variability , was negatively correlated with time to resuming diet , whereas the sympathetic measurement , serum norepinephrine was positively correlated with time to resuming diet and time to flatus. ( 4) TEA but not sham-TEA decreased TNF-α by 17.4 % from POD 1 to POD 4. ( 5) TEA was an independent predictor of a shorter hospital stay. Needleless TEA improves major postoperative symptoms by enhancing vagal and suppressing sympathetic activities.
