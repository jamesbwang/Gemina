  Standard treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) is limited currently with decisions being made primarily based on tumor location , histology , and stage. The role of the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> in risk stratification is actively under clinical trial evaluations. The molecular complexity and intratumoral heterogeneity of the disease are not actively integrated into management decisions of HNSCC , despite a growing body of knowledge in these areas. The advent of the genomic era has delivered vast amounts of information regarding different cancer subtypes and is providing new therapeutic targets , which can potentially be elucidated using next-generation sequencing and other modern technologies. The task ahead is to expand beyond the existent armamentarium by exploiting beyond the genome and perform integrative analysis using innovative systems biology methods , with the goal to deliver effective precision medicine-based theragnostic options in HNSCC.
