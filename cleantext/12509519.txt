  Morphological and histological observations revealed that , at a concentration of 50 & micro; M , 5-azacitidine ( 5-azaC) totally inhibited the induction of embryogenic masses ( EM) , while the cultivation of explants ( zygotic embryos; ZEs) in the presence of 5 & micro; M of 5-azaC led to the formation of a callus with EM in 10 % of the cases. Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) analyzes revealed the presence of the morphological and ultrastructural features that are typical for the vacuolar type of cell death in the callus cells that were treated. A TUNEL assay confirmed the presence of DNA double-strand breaks for the callus cells that had been treated with both 5 and 50 & micro; M 5-azaC concentrations. Analysis of the gene expression of selected cell death markers demonstrated a reduced expression of metacaspase , protein executer 1 ( EX1) , and thioredoxin ( TRX) in the callus cells that had been treated compared to the control culture. The strongest increase in the gene activity was characteristic for glutathione S-transferase ( GST). Our studies also included an analysis of the distribution of some arabinogalactan proteins ( AGPs) and extensin epitopes , which can be used as markers of cells that are undergoing death in a
