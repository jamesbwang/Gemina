  Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma ( Ca ex PA) is defined as a carcinoma arising from a primary ( de novo) or recurrent benign pleomorphic adenoma. The most common histological subtype is adenocarcinoma , not otherwise specified , salivary duct carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma , and adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC). Few case reports of de novo dedifferentiation in ACC are there in the literature , mostly involving minor salivary glands. The dedifferentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma arising in a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid<symptom> gland has not been reported earlier. The present case highlights this rare histological subtype seen in Ca ex PA and the role of extensive histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry.
