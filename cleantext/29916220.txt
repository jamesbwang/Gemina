  Background/aim: Genetic variation , an authentic tool of individual discrimination , is being used for forensic investigations worldwide. A missing result for even one out of 13-17 markers leads to an inconclusive report. Additional reliable markers are required to compensate such deficiencies. The SE33 locus has high genetic variability in different populations and is being used in forensic investigation systems in some countries. The purpose of the study was to assess the viability of use of the SE33 locus as a supportive marker for forensic DNA profiling. Materials and methods: Amplification of the SE33 locus was performed using the PowerPlex ES Monoplex System SE33 ( Promega). After genotyping 204 Pakistani individuals , different genetic and forensic parameters for the SE33 locus were studied. Results: Genotyping of the SE33 locus revealed a total of 43 alleles including 3 novel alleles. Significant values of different forensic and genetic parameters including power of discrimination , power of exclusion , and polymorphism information content were observed. Conclusions: Addition of the SE33 locus in forensic DNA profiling may help to produce conclusive reports where results are inconclusive due to degraded evidence samples. The SE33 locus can confidently be used for Pakistani and neighboring populations having common ancestors from Iran to Central Asia , the Middle<pathogen> East , India and Turkey.
