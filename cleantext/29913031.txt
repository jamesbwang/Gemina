  Acinic cell carcinoma metastasizing to the spine is extremely rare. The authors present a case of acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid<symptom> gland with subsequent lung and spinal metastases , treated with en bloc spondylectomy. A 41-year-old man presented with a left parotid<symptom> mass. After being diagnosed with acinic cell carcinoma , he underwent a total parotidectomy. Imaging studies revealed a metastatic osteoblastic lesion<symptom> in the T4 vertebral body and multiple lung metastases. Total en bloc spondylectomy and reconstruction with a frozen tumor-bearing bone graft were performed to treat the T4 metastasis. Lung metastases were treated with periodic radiofrequency ablation. At the 48-month follow-up , there was no local recurrence of the lesions<symptom> , and the lung metastases were controlled. The bone graft had fused with the adjacent vertebrae , and the patient had full neurological function and normal daily activities. This report indicates satisfactory long-term outcomes of total en bloc spondylectomy and reconstruction with frozen tumor-bearing bone graft in a patient with acinic cell carcinoma with spinal metastasis. It also emphasizes the benefits of radical resection of spinal metastasis even in cases with multiple organ metastases. ( Orthopedics. 201x; xx ( x): xx-xx.).
