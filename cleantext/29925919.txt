  We have reported that hepatitis<disease> B<disease> X-interacting protein ( HBXIP , also termed LAMTOR5) can act as an oncogenic transcriptional co-activator to modulate gene expression , promoting breast cancer development. Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 ( PKM2) , encoded by PKM gene , has emerged as a key oncoprotein in breast cancer. Yet , the regulatory mechanism of PKM2 is still unexplored. Here , we report that HBXIP can upregulate PKM2 to accelerate proliferation of estrogen receptor positive ( ER +) breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry analysis using breast cancer tissue microarray uncovered a positive association between the expression of HBXIP and PKM2. We also discovered that PKM2 expression was positively related with HBXIP expression in clinical breast cancer patients by real-time PCR assay. Interestingly , in ER + breast cancer cells , HBXIP was capable of upregulating PKM2 expression at mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner , as well as increasing the activity of PKM promoter. Mechanistically , HBXIP could stimulate PKM promoter through binding to the -779/ -579 promoter region involving co-activation of E2F transcription factor 1 ( E2F1). In function , cell viability , EdU , colony formation , and xenograft tumor growth assays showed that HBXIP contributed to accelerating cell proliferation through PKM2 in ER + breast cancer. Collectively , we conclude that HBXIP induces PKM2 through transcription factor E2F1 to facilitate ER + breast cancer cell proliferation. We provide new evidence for the mechanism of transcription regulation of PKM2 in promotion of breast cancer progression.
