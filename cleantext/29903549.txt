  Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group ( TPOG) initiated two consecutive protocols for treating pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma since 1995. However , the results have not been analyzed and reported yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the treatment results of these two protocols in our hospital and to assess whether the results are comparable to other large-scaled studies. Treatment of pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma according to TPOG protocols at National Taiwan University Hospital began in 1995. Between 1995 and 2006 , patients were treated by TPOG RMS 95 protocol , which was based on IRS-III/IV. After 2007 , patients were treated by TPOG RMS 2007 protocol which was adapted from IRS-V study. The clinical data of patients were obtained retrospectively by reviewing medical records. The date of the latest follow-up was December 31 , 2016. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in this study. The 5-year overall survival ( OS) and event-free survival rates of them were 54.7 ± 8.8 % and 48.5 ± 8.6 % , respectively. The 5-year OS rates for patients treated by TPOG RMS 95 and TPOG RMS 2007 protocols were 55.0 ± 11.1 % and 55.9 ± 14.0 % , respectively. Age at diagnosis of less than ten years old and receiving operation with gross total or subtotal tumor resection were identified as independent prognostic factors that predicted better outcomes in the multivariate analysis. The clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma in Taiwan improved dramatically after incorporating two consecutive protocols from TPOG. In addition , the treatment results of these two protocols were comparable to large-scale studies of other countries.
