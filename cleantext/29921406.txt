  This study was carried out to study multi-slice spiral CT imaging for patients with gastric carcinoma and explore the values of multi-slice spiral CT imaging in staging prior to gastric carcinoma ( GC) surgery. Forty-eight patients with GC underwent multi-slice spiral CT , and the scanning results were compared with the pathological results. The similarity of the results was observed , and the accuracy was calculated. Of 48 patients , 8 did not undergo surgery because of metastasis. In the diagnosis of the remaining 40 patients , the sensitivity of multi-slice spiral CT in the diagnosis of staging of invasive depth of GC was 77.5 %; Îº = 0.642 in the analysis of consistency; there was no significant difference with the pathological results ( p > 0.05). The overall accuracy of diagnosis for stage N was 80 %. The accuracy of multi-slice CT in detecting distant metastasis of GC was 87.5 %. Multi-slice spiral CT can determine and evaluate various metastases of GC. The diagnostic results obtained using multi-slice spiral CT was probably consistent with the pathological results.
