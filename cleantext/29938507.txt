  Stir bar sorptive extraction ( SBSE) is a miniaturized and solvent-less sample preparation method for extraction and concentration of organic compounds from aqueous samples. The method is based on sorptive extraction , whereby the solutes are extracted into a polymer , such as polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) , coated on a stir bar. Using an apolar PDMS coating , SBSE provides high recoveries for apolar solutes; however , SBSE recoveries for polar solutes are low. Although several more polar coatings for SBSE were developed , these extraction phases are mostly not compatible with thermal desorption ( TD) and/or have inferior performance characteristics related to robustness , bleeding , stability , etc. compared to PDMS. In this perspective , two recently introduced SBSE approaches are described that can be used to extend the applicability of a PDMS coating to more polar solutes: ( 1) SBSE with freeze concentration ( ice concentration linked with extractive stirrer ( ICECLES)) , which is based on the concentration of analytes by gradually reducing the phase ratio ( sample/extraction phase) , and ( 2) SBSE using a solvent-swollen PDMS ( solvent-assisted SBSE ( SA-SBSE)) , which is based on a combination of polarity modification and volume increase by PDMS phase swelling using certain types of solvents while maintaining the original characteristics of the PDMS phase.
