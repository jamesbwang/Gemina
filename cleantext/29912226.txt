  Hypertrabeculation is a feature of the left ventricle that , by itself , does not coincide with left ventricular non compaction ( LVNC) , which represents a specific cardiomyopathy. Nowadays , in the absence of gold standard diagnostic criteria , the clinician must integrate imaging aspects together with medical history. The family inheritance for LVNC , presence of neuromuscular disorders , symptoms or signs of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , thromboembolic events , unexplained syncope , pathological findings at rest ECG , Holter ECG , stress test , systolic/diastolic dysfunction at rest echocardiogram , late gadolinium enhancement at cardiac magnetic resonance , and identification of specific mutations are all considered features useful for the diagnosis. Many aspects are not fully understood: multicenter studies , registers and observational studies are needed for a better comprehension of the pathology , adequate risk stratification and targeted follow-up.
