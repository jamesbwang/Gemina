  We describe our experience with robot assisted complex lower urinary tract reconstruction ( CUTR) in patients with previous open abdominal surgery ( PAS). Patients with any PAS undergoing robot assisted CUTR were included. CUTR was defined as bladder neck reconstruction ( BNR) or continent catheterizable conduits ( CCC) or both , redo surgery at the bladder neck for persistent incontinence , or any of the above with an antegrade enema channel creation ( MACE). Ureteral and renal surgeries were excluded. Patient demographics , surgery performed , operative techniques , operative times and outcomes were assessed. 36 patients met inclusion. 21 patients had multiple laparotomies for ventriculoperitoneal ( VP) shunt revisions. 15 had laparotomy with other adjunct procedures in 14 and laparotomy with colostomy in 1. There were no access injuries and 5 conversions. Mean operative time was 8.2 hrs ( 4-12 hrs). Mean length of stay ( LOS) was 74.9 hrs ( 23-216 hrs). The first 18 cases took longer than the last 18 cases ( mean 9.1 hr vs mean 7.5 hr p = 0.002). Patients with multiple VP shunt revisions had higher conversion rates and higher mean operative times when compared to other patients ( p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). Patients with multiple VP shunt revisions had longer LOS when compared to other patients ( p = 0.02). Robot assisted CUTR in patients with PAS is safe and feasible. Longer operative times should be expected early in a surgeon 's experience. Multiple VP shunt revisions have higher conversion rates and longer operative times when compared to other indications for previous surgery.
