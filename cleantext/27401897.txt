  Therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) for breast cancer based on Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors ( PERCIST) 1.0 with FDG-PET/CT measurements was evaluated , and the results compared to those obtained with currently widely used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) 1.1 , based on MRI measurements. MRI and FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed in 32 breast cancer patients before and after the NAC prior to a surgical resection. Chemotherapeutic response of the primary tumor and relapse-free survival ( RFS) were investigated using RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0. Pathological complete response ( pCR) was seen in 14 ( 43.8 %) patients , while complete response ( CR) was noted in 5 , partial response in 25 , stable disease in 2 , and progressive disease in 0 with RECIST 1.1 , and in 28 , 2 , 1 , and 1 , respectively , with PERCIST 1.0. For pCR prediction , the sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy with RECIST 1.1 were 28.6 % ( 4/14) , 94.4 % ( 17/18) , and 65.6 % ( 21/32) , and those with PERCIST 1.0 were 100 % ( 14/14) , 22.2 % ( 4/18) , and 56.3 % ( 18/32). Five patients ( 15.6 %) had recurrent development after a median period of 24 months ( range 7.8-66.8 months). Patients who achieved CR shown by RECIST 1.1 showed slightly longer RFS than those who did not ( p = 0.46) , whereas those with complete metabolic response ( CMR) based on PERCIST 1.0 showed a relatively longer RFS than non-CMR patients ( p = 0.087). For prediction of pathological response to NAC in breast cancer , RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 have complementary functions , however , FDG-PET as a post-NAC treatment assessment modality remains to be confirmed.
