  In organisms 5-formyluracil ( 5fU) , which is known as a vital natural nucleobase , is widely present. Despite the recent development of sensor designs for organic fluorescent molecules for selective targeting applications , biocompatible and easily operated probe designs that are based on natural nucleobase modifications have rarely been reported. Here , we introduce the idea of 5fU as a multifunctional building block to facilitate the design and synthetic development of biosensors. The azide group was derived from the sugar of a nucleoside , which can be further used in the selective binding of cells or organelles through click chemistry with alkynyl-modified targeting groups. The aldehyde group of 5fU can react with different chemicals to generate environmentally sensitive nucleobases that have obvious characteristics , which precious reactants can not achieve for selective fluorogenic switch-on detection of a specific target. We first synthesized 5fU analogues that had aggregation-induced emission properties , and then we used triphenylphosphonium as a mitochondria-targeting group to selectively image mitochondria in cancer cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. Additionally , the reagents exhibit a high selectivity for reaction with 5fU , which means that the method can also be used for the detection of 5fU. Combining the two characteristics , the idea of 5fU as a multifunctional building block in biosensor designs may potentially be applicable in 5fU site-specific microenvironment detection in future research.
