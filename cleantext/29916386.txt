  Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycaemia. Knowledge of type 1 diabetes has rapidly increased over the past 25 years , resulting in a broad understanding about many aspects of the disease , including its genetics , epidemiology , immune and β-cell phenotypes , and disease burden. Interventions to preserve β cells have been tested , and several methods to improve clinical disease management have been assessed. However , wide gaps still exist in our understanding of type 1 diabetes and our ability to standardise clinical care and decrease disease-associated complications and burden. This Seminar gives an overview of the current understanding of the disease and potential future directions for research and care.
