  Circulating soluble tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor 2 ( sTNFR2) has been associated with a relatively poor prognosis in various types of lymphoma. However , the specific role of TNFR2 expression in lymphoma cells remains uncharacterized. In the present study , TNFR2 expression was quantified in the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line , L428 , and the anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cell line , Karpas299 , using RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Karpas299 cells exhibited higher TNFR2 expression than L428 cells. Proliferation and drug resistance experiments demonstrated that Karpas299 cells also possessed a greater proliferative ability and resistance to adriamycin ( ADM) than L428 cells , with 50 % inhibitory concentrations ( IC
