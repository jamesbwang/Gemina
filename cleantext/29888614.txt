  Over-filtration is a well-known complication of trabeculectomy and related procedures , especially with adjunctive antimetabolites. Secondary hypotony can result in reduced visual acuity and compromise long-term surgical success. Persistent hypotony requires intervention and we describe an effective adaptation of placing conjunctival compression sutures directly over the scleral flap. A retrospective consecutive case series of all patients who underwent conjunctival compression suturing from 2012 to 2014 at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital , UK. Under sub-tenon 's anaesthesia , two 9/0 nylon figure-of-eight transconjunctival sutures were placed horizontally across the bleb: the first over the anterior flap/ostium and the second over the posterior flap edge to reduce flow through the trabeculectomy flap. A total of 10 patients underwent conjunctival compression suturing , and all patients had successful reversal of hypotony and symptom resolution within 1 week with corresponding clinical improvement. Intraocular pressure control was maintained without topical pressure-lowering agents in seven patients ( median = 10 mmHg , range = 7-12 mmHg) with a median follow-up of 35.9 months ( range = 11-61 months). Two patients required topical therapy to maintain intraocular pressure â‰¤ 14 mmHg and one patient 's hypotony returned after 10 months but remained untreated due to pre-existing poor<symptom> vision<symptom>. No patients required a return to theatre. This series demonstrates that conjunctival compression sutures can successfully provide long-term control of trabeculectomy-bleb-related hypotony. This technique offers an effective alternative for glaucoma surgeons in addressing post-trabeculectomy hypotony.
