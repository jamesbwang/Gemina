  To explore whether bandage lenses could be a safe and effective substitute for eye patch in the postoperative care for cataract surgery patients in terms of infection prevention , ocular impacts , and patient satisfaction. Patients who underwent cataract surgery were randomly divided into the eye patch group ( Group A) and the bandage lens group ( Group B). Bacterial culture samples were collected perioperatively from different sites. Evaluations of anterior segment condition and patient satisfaction were conducted on the first day of postoperative follow-up. The positive rate of bacterial cultures in Group A was higher than that in Group B , but the difference was not statistically significant. Group B had significantly longer tear breakup time , higher tear meniscus height , and slightly better patient satisfaction than Group A. Bandage lenses can be used as a safe and effective substitute for eye patch in the postoperative care for cataract surgery patients. The Clinical Study registration number is ChiCTR-IOC-17012167.
