  Clusters with an exact number of atoms are of particular interest in catalysis. Their catalytic behaviors can be potentially altered with the addition or removal of a single atom. Now the effects of doping with a single foreign atom ( Au , Pd , and Pt) into the core of an Ag cluster with 25 atoms on the catalytic properties are explored , where the foreign atom is protected by 24 Ag atoms ( Au@Ag
