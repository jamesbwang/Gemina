  Collecting sufficient template DNA from a crime scene sample is often challenging , especially with low quantity samples such as touch DNA ( tDNA). Traditional DNA collection methods such as double swabbing have limitations , in particular when used on certain substrates which can be found at crime scenes , thus a better collection method is advantageous. Here , the effectiveness of the M-Vac ® Wet-Vacuum System is evaluated as a method for DNA recovery on tiles and bricks. It was found that the M-Vac ® recovered 75 % more DNA than double swabbing on bricks. However , double swabbing collected significantly more DNA than the M-Vac ® on tiles. Additionally , it was found that cell-free DNA is lost in the filtration step of M-Vac ® collection. In terms of peak height and number of true alleles detected , no significant difference was found between the DNA profiles obtained through M-Vac ® collection versus double swabbing of tDNA depositions from 12 volunteers on bricks. The results demonstrate that the M-Vac ® has potential for DNA collection from porous surfaces such as bricks , but that alterations to the filter apparatus would be beneficial to increase the amount of genetic material collected for subsequent DNA profiling. These results are anticipated to be a starting point to validate the M-Vac ® as a DNA collection device , providing an alternative method when DNA is present on a difficult substrate , or if traditional DNA collection methods have failed.
