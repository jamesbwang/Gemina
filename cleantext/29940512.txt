  Amblyseius cucumeris ( Oudemans) is a beneficial non-target arthropod ( NTA) and a key predator of tetranychid mites in integrated pest management ( IPM) programs across China. Evaluating the toxic effects of insecticides on such predatory mites is essential for the success and development of IPM. We tested six insecticides to determine the risk of neonicotinoid insecticide toxicity to predatory mites , using the ` open glass plate method ' and adult female A. cucumeris in a `` worst case laboratory exposure '' scenario. A 48-h toxicity test was performed using the hazard quotient ( HQ) approach to evaluate the risk of each insecticide. The LR
