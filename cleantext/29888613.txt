  The basic regression discontinuity design ( RDD) has less statistical power than a randomized control trial ( RCT) with the same sample size. Adding a no-treatment comparison function to the basic RDD creates a comparative RDD ( CRD); and when this function comes from the pretest value of the study outcome , a CRD-Pre design results. We use a within-study comparison ( WSC) to examine the power of CRD-Pre relative to both basic RDD and RCT. We first build the theoretical foundation for power in CRD-Pre , then derive the relevant variance formulae , and finally compare them to the theoretical RCT variance. We conclude from this theoretical part of this article that ( 1) CRD-Pre 's power gain depends on the partial correlation between the pretest and posttest measures after conditioning on the assignment variable , ( 2) CRD-Pre is less responsive than basic RDD to how the assignment variable is distributed and where the cutoff is located , and ( 3) under a variety of conditions , the efficiency of CRD-Pre is very close to that of the RCT. Data from the National Head Start Impact Study are then used to construct RCT , RDD , and CRD-Pre designs and to compare their power. The empirical results indicate ( 1) a high level of correspondence between the predicted and obtained power results for RDD and CRD-Pre relative to the RCT , and ( 2) power levels in CRD-Pre and RCT that are very close. The study is unique among WSCs for its focus on the correspondence between RCT and observational study standard errors rather than means.
