  The notion that robotic crop pollination will solve the decline in pollinators has gained wide popularity recently ( Fig. 1) , and in March 2018 Walmart filed a patent for autonomous robot bees. However , w present six arguments showing that this is a technically and economically inviable ` solution ' at present and poses substantial ecological and moral risks: ( 1) despite recent advances , robotic pollination is far from being able to replace bees to pollinate crops efficiently; ( 2) using robots is very unlikely to be economically viable; ( 3) there would be unacceptably high environmental costs; ( 4) wider ecosystems would be damaged; ( 5) it would erode the values of biodiversity; and , ( 6) relying on robotic pollination could actually lead to major food insecurity.
