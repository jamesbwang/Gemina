  Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by interpersonal and emotional abnormalities ( e.g. , lack of empathy and guilt) and antisocial behavior. Psychopathy has been associated with a number of structural brain abnormalities , most notably in orbital frontal and anterior/medial temporal regions , that may underlie psychopathic individuals ' problematic behaviors. Past research evaluating cortical structure in psychopathy has considered thickness and volume , but to date no study has investigated differences in cortical gyrification , a measure of cortical complexity thought to reflect early neurodevelopmental cortical connectivity. We measured the local gyrification index ( LGI) in a sample of 716 adult male inmates and performed a whole brain analysis assessing the relationship between LGI and total and factor scores on the Hare<pathogen> Psychopathy Checklist-Revised ( PCL-R). PCL-R scores were negatively associated with LGI measures within the right hemisphere in the midcingulate cortex ( MCC) and adjacent regions of the superior frontal gyrus as well as lateral superior parietal cortex. Additionally , PCL-R Factor 1 scores ( interpersonal/affective traits) predicted less LGI within the right MCC and adjacent dorsomedial frontal cortex and greater LGI in bilateral occipital cortex. Scores on PCL-R Factor 2 , indicating impulsivity and antisocial behaviors , did not predict LGI in any regions. These findings suggest that psychopathy , particularly the interpersonal and affective traits , are associated with specific structural abnormalities that form during neurodevelopment and these abnormalities may underlie aberrant brain functioning in regions important in emotional processing and cognitive control.
