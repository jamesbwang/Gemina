  Ketamine has been shown to produce a rapid and potent antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant depression<symptom> Currently ketamine is most commonly administered as a 40-minute intravenous infusion , though it is unknown whether this is the optimal route of administration. To determine the plasma concentration time course of the R- and S-enantiomers of ketamine and norketamine following administration of ketamine by four different routes of administration. Plasma from conscious non-anaesthetised rats was collected following administration of ketamine by either subcutaneous ( SC) , intramuscular ( IM) , intravenous infusion ( IVI) or intravenous bolus ( IVB) routes of administration. Concentrations of the enantiomers of ketamine and norketamine were determined by LC/MS. Administration by the SC , IM and IVI routes produced an overall similar drug exposure. In contrast , administration by the IVB route produced approximately 15-fold higher peak plasma concentrations for the enantiomers of ketamine and an approximately four-fold lower AUC for the enantiomers of norketamine. Route of administration can significantly influence ketamine and norketamine exposures. These differences may influence safety and tolerability , and potentially drug efficacy in humans. This knowledge adds to current research into the optimisation of the use of ketamine for the treatment of
