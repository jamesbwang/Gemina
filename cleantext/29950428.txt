  Balancing selection is defined as a class of selective regimes that maintain polymorphism above what is expected under neutrality. Theory predicts that balancing selection reduces population differentiation , as measured by FST. However , balancing selection regimes in which different sets of alleles are maintained in different populations could increase population differentiation. To tackle the connection between balancing selection and population differentiation , we investigated population differentiation at the HLA genes , which constitute the most striking example of balancing selection in humans. We found that population differentiation of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) at the HLA genes is on average lower than that of SNPs in other genomic regions. We show that these results require using a computation that accounts for the dependence of FST on allele frequencies. However , in pairs of closely related populations , where genome-wide differentiation is low , differentiation at HLA is higher than in other genomic regions. Such increased population differentiation at HLA genes for recently diverged population pairs was reproduced in simulations of overdominant selection , as long as the fitness of the homozygotes differs between the diverging populations. The results give insight into a possible `` divergent overdominance '' mechanism for the nature of balancing selection on HLA genes across human populations.
