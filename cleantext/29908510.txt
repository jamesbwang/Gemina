  PVC pipe loops were constructed to simulate household premise plumbing. These pipe loops were exposed to water treated by physical processes at three water treatment plants in Xiamen , China from August 2016 to June 2017. After the biofilms were allowed to develop inside the pipes , these pipes were deconstructed and exposed to organic-free chlorine solution buffered at pH 6.8 Â± 0.2 for 48 h. The decay of chlorine by these biofilms was higher than by the effluent waters that were used to grow the biofilms. A chlorine consumption mass balance<symptom> model elucidated the role of both the diffusion of chlorine into the biofilm and the reaction of chlorine with the biofilm matrix. Comparable concentrations of trihalomethanes were quantified from the reaction between chlorine and source water organic matters , and chlorine and the biofilm , further emphasizing the role of biofilms in the safety of disinfected drinking water. These findings imply that when chlorine is used in the drinking water distribution system , the ubiquitous presence of biofilms may cause the depletion of chlorine and the formation of non-negligible levels of toxic disinfection byproducts.
