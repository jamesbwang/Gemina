  Eye toxicity is a mandatory parameter in human risk and safety evaluation for products including chemicals , pesticides , medicines and cosmetics. Historically , this endpoint has been evaluated using the Draize rabbit eye test , an in vivo model that was never formally validated. Due to advances in scientific knowledge , economic and ethical issues , non-animal methods based on mechanisms of toxicity are being developed and validated for increasing the capability of these models to predict eye toxicity. In this study , the Cytometric Bead Array ( CBA) and ELISA assays were used to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine profile produced by HaCaT human keratinocytes after exposure to chemicals with different UN GHS eye toxicity classifications , aiming to stablish a correlation between inflammatory endpoints and eye toxicity ( damage/irritation) potential. As a first step , cytotoxic profile of the chemicals , including 3 non-irritants and 10 eye toxicants ( GHS Category 1 , 2A and 2B) , was evaluated after 24 h exposure using MTT assay and Inhibitory Concentration of 20 % of cell viability ( IC
