  Macroautophagy is the process by which cells package and degrade cytosolic components , and recycle the breakdown products for future use. Since its initial description by Christian de Duve in the 1960s , significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie this vital cellular process and its specificity. Furthermore , macroautophagy is linked to pathologic conditions such as cancer and is being studied as a therapeutic target. In this review , we will explore the connections between autophagy and cancer , which are tumor- and context-dependent and include the tumor microenvironment. We will highlight the importance of tumor compartment-specific autophagy in both cancer aggressiveness and treatment.
