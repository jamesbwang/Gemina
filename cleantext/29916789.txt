  People utilize multiple expressive modalities for communicating narrative ideas about past events. The three major ones are speech , pantomime , and drawing. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify common brain areas that mediate narrative communication across these three sensorimotor mechanisms. In the scanner , participants were presented with short narrative prompts akin to newspaper headlines ( e.g. , `` Surgeon finds scissors inside of patient ''). The task was to generate a representation of the event , either by describing it verbally through speech , by pantomiming it gesturally , or by drawing it on a tablet. In a control condition designed to remove sensorimotor activations , participants described the spatial properties of individual objects ( e.g. , `` binoculars ''). Each of the three modality-specific subtractions produced similar results , with activations in key components of the mentalizing network , including the TPJ , posterior STS , and posterior cingulate cortex. Conjunction analysis revealed that these areas constitute a cross-modal `` narrative hub '' that transcends the three modalities of communication. The involvement of these areas in narrative production suggests that people adopt an intrinsically mentalistic and character-oriented perspective when engaging in storytelling , whether using speech , pantomime , or drawing.
