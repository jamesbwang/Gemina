  Head and neck soft tissue sarcoma<disease> ( HNSTS) is a rare neoplasm accounting for 1 % of all head and neck tumours. Because of rarity and varied biological behaviour among various subtypes , knowledge about these tumours is limited. This study aimed at analysing clinicopathological , recurrence and survival pattern of surgically treated HNSTS. Case records of 28 patients of HNSTS who underwent surgery at the Regional Cancer Centre ( RCC) , Trivandrum ( India) between 2002 and 2012 were analysed retrospectively for demographic profile , clinical features , treatment given , recurrence pattern and outcome. The median age of patients was 37 years ( range , 3-79) with male: female ratio of 3:2. Majority of patients presented with painless lump in the neck as the most common subsite affected followed by scalp and face. One patient had nodal disease , while none had distant metastasis at presentation. The most frequent histological subtypes were synovial sarcoma<disease> and fibrosarcoma followed by malignant fibrous histiocytoma , angiosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Majority ( 78.5 %) of patients received adjuvant therapy in the form of radiation , chemotherapy or chemo-radiation. After mean follow-up of 49 months , four patients had died , and six developed local recurrence and four distant metastasis. The overall 5-year survival was 82.7 % while 5-year disease-free survival was 55.3 %. HNSTS is a rare entity that requires multimodality treatment to achieve optimum locoregional control and survival.
