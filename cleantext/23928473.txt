  Single-walled carbon-nanohorns ( SNH) exhibit huge application prospects. Notably , spherical SNH possess different morphology from conventional carbon nanotubes ( CNT). However , there is a tremendous lack of studies on the nanotoxicity and mechanism of SNH , and their comparison with nanotubes. Here , the dissimilarity between SNH and CNT is found in many aspects including necrosis<symptom> , pyroptosis , apoptosis , protein expression , hydrolases leakage , lysosome stress , membrane disturbance and the interaction with membrane proteins. The improved biocompatibility of SNH over four types of established CNT is clearly demonstrated in macrophages. Importantly , a key transmembrane protein , glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B ( GPNMB) is discovered to initiate the nanotoxicity. Compared to CNT , the weaker nano-GPNMB interaction in SNH group induces lower degree of cascade actions from nano/membrane interplay to final cell hypotoxicity. In conclusion , the geometry of single-construct unit , but not that of dispersive forms or intracellular levels of nanocarbons make the most difference.
