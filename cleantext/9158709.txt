  Homocystinuria is a genetic inborn error of metabolism due to the deficiency of cystathionine Î²-synthase resulting in increased serum homocysteine and methionine and decreased cysteine which predisposes affected individuals to arterial and venous thromboembolic phenomena. We present a case of homocystinuria who presented to us as a calcified right atrial mass during the evaluation for lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> Our case reveals an unusual mix of findings using imaging with multiple detector computed tomography and radiographs.
