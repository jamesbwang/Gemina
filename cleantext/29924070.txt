  To quantitatively describe passive lower extremity range of motion in participants with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA) types<pathogen> 2 and 3 , and to establish preliminary thresholds to identify individuals at risk for performing poorly on disease-specific motor function outcome measures. Eighty participants with SMA types 2 and 3 , enrolled in an international multicenter natural history study , were evaluated with lower extremity range of motion testing and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded. A hip extension joint angle of -7.5 째 or less for SMA type 2 and 0 째 or less for SMA type 3 identified diminished motor ability with good sensitivity. For knee extension , a joint angle of -9.0 째 or less for SMA type 2 or 0 째 or less for SMA type 3 was similarly sensitive. Minimal hip and knee joint contractures were associated with diminished motor ability. Clinical trial designs should consider the effect of contractures on motor function.
