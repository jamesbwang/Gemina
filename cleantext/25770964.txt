  Fruit and nut shells can exhibit high hardness and toughness. In the peninsula of Yucatan , Mexico , the fruit of the Cocoyol palm tree ( Acrocomia mexicana<pathogen>) is well known to be very difficult to break. Its hardness has been documented since the 1500 s , and is even mentioned in the popular Maya legend The Dwarf of Uxmal. However , until now , no scientific studies quantifying the mechanical performance of the Cocoyol endocarp has been found in the literature to prove or disprove that this fruit shell is indeed `` very hard ''. Here we report the mechanical properties , microstructure and hardness of this material. The mechanical measurements showed compressive strength values of up to ~ 150 and ~ 250 MPa under quasi-static and high strain rate loading conditions , respectively , and microhardness of up to ~ 0.36 GPa. Our findings reveal a complex hierarchical structure showing that the Cocoyol shell is a functionally graded material with distinctive layers along the radial directions. These findings demonstrate that structure-property relationships make this material hard and tough. The mechanical results and the microstructure presented herein encourage designing new types of bioinspired superior synthetic materials.
