  The paper explores the concept of recovery; the unexpected material changes that occur to , and within bodies following acquired spinal conditions. The phrase ` acquired spinal conditions ' is used as a collective name for the four accounts of recovery that emerged using Participatory Action Research in the north east of England ( 2010-11). Using two qualitative methods , Photovoice and participatory diagramming , the empirical material examines the role of physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> as a way to enrich understandings of disability and the bodily experience of impairment. Three themes , bodily materiality , material objects and fluids became significant during one-to-one and small group interactions with participants. The paper is situated in wider debates in geographies of disability and impairment , focusing on the interplay between different physiological states of being and the bodily changes experienced through recovery. It argues that recovery is the process of negotiating , adapting and adjusting to changes , from the way bodily materiality shifts and fluctuates following accidents and medical interventions , settling over time as participants become aware of bodily changes , to the role of material objects and the fluids that pass back and forth changing bodily interiors. The paper closes with a call for geographies of affect to explore the individual and collective feelings associated with fluids , and the human-animal relations affecting recovery and bodily interiors.
