  This study aims to determine how Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) acquisition techniques and calculation methods affect T2 values of knee cartilage at 1.5 Tesla and to identify sequences that can be used for high-resolution T2 mapping in short scanning times. This study was performed on phantom and twenty-nine patients who underwent MRI of the knee joint at 1.5 Tesla. The protocol includes T2 mapping sequences based on Single Echo Spin Echo ( SESE) , Multi-Echo Spin Echo ( MESE) , Fast Spin Echo ( FSE) and Turbo<pathogen> Gradient Spin Echo ( TGSE). The T2 relaxation times were quantified and evaluated using three calculation methods ( MapIt , Syngo Offline and monoexponential fit). Signal to Noise Ratios ( SNR) were measured in all sequences. All statistical analyses were performed using the t-test. The average T2 values in phantom were 41.7 ± 13.8 ms for SESE , 43.2 ± 14.4 ms for MESE , 42.4 ± 14.1 ms for FSE and 44 ± 14.5 ms for TGSE. In the patient study , the mean differences were 6.5 ± 8.2 ms , 7.8 ± 7.6 ms and 8.4 ± 14.2 ms for MESE , FSE and TGSE compared to SESE respectively; these statistical results were not significantly different ( p > 0.05). The comparison between the three calculation methods showed no significant difference ( p > 0.05). t-Test showed no significant difference between SNR values for all sequences. T2 values depend not only on the sequence type but also on the calculation method. None of the sequences revealed significant differences compared to the SESE reference sequence. TGSE with its short scanning time can be used for high-resolution T2 mapping.
