  After a spinal cord injury , patients have different perceptions of sexuality , sexual function , and potential for fertility. These changes can greatly impact quality of life over a lifetime. The purpose of this workgroup was to identify common evidence based or expert opinion themes and recommendations regarding treatment of sexuality , sexual function and fertility in the spinal cord injury population. As part of the SIU-ICUD joint consultation of Urologic Management of the Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI) , a workgroup and comprehensive literature search of English language manuscripts regarding fertility and sexuality in the spinal cord injury patient were formed. Articles were compiled , and recommendations in the chapter are based on group discussion and follow the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine system for levels of evidence ( LOEs) and grades of recommendation ( GORs). Genital arousal , ejaculation , and orgasm are significantly impacted after spinal cord injury in both male and female SCI patients. This may have a more significant impact on potential for fertility in male spinal cord injury patients , particularly regarding ability of generate erection , semen quantity and quality. Female patients should be consulted that pregnancy is still possible after injury and a woman should expect resumption of normal reproductive function. As a result , sexual health teaching should be continued in women despite injury. Pregnancy in a SCI may cause complications such as autonomic dysreflexia , so this group should be carefully followed during pregnancy. By understanding physiologic changes after injury , patients and care teams can work together to achieve goals and maximize sexual quality of life after the injury.
