  To evaluate the impact of the revised Nellix instructions for use ( IFU) from 2016 on clinical outcomes and anatomic applicability by retrospectively applying them to a cohort treated with endovascular aneurysm<disease> sealing according to the original IFU 2013. A single-center study was conducted of 100 consecutive patients ( mean age 72 ± 8 years , range 46-91; 89 men) treated electively with standard bilateral EVAS from July 2013 to August 2015 and followed through December 2017. Procedures previously classified within and outside the original IFU from 2013 ( 75 and 25 , respectively) were reclassified according to the revised IFU 2016 ( 34 and 66 , respectively). Stepwise backward logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of specific anatomic features for the development of endoleak and/or migration. The single most important morphologic feature disqualifying patients from being within IFU 2016 was a thrombus ratio > 1.4 ( 36 of 41 reclassified patients). Overall technical success was 98 % ( 100 % within vs 97 % outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.323) and 30-day mortality was 3 % ( 0 % within vs 5 % outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.251). During a median follow-up of 31 months ( range 0-53) , overall mortality was 21 % ( 15 % within vs 24 % outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.469); aneurysm-related mortality was 8 % ( 3 % within vs 11 % outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.533). Twenty-six patients developed an endoleak ( 6 within vs 20 outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.172) and 23 had migration ( 4 within vs 19 outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.088). Both proximal neck length < 10 mm and neck angulation > 60 ° were positive predictors for the development of endoleak and/or migration. A reintervention was performed in 26 patients ( 7 within vs 19 outside IFU 2016 , p = 0.376). While a significant difference was found between the within vs outside IFU 2016 groups with regard to freedom from migration ( p = 0.026) and the composite freedom from endoleak and/or migration ( p = 0.021) , there were no significant differences in survival ( p = 0.201) or freedom from reintervention ( p = 0.505) , suggesting a limited effectiveness of the new IFU 2016. The IFU 2016 reduced the anatomic applicability to 34 % from 75 % for the original IFU 2013. The lack of significant intergroup differences in terms of survival and reinterventions suggests a limited effectiveness of the new IFU 2016.
