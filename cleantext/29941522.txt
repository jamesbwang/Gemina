  Adenylyl cyclase isoform 6 ( AC6) is highly expressed throughout the renal tubule and collecting duct , catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) and contributes to various aspects of renal transport. Several proteins involved in acid-base homeostasis are regulated by cAMP. In this study we assess the relative contribution of AC6 to overall acid-base regulation using mice with global deletion of AC6 ( AC6
