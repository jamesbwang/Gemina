  Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is recognised as a major challenge as people age. Yet , despite growing research on chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> management , there is little research into chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> prevention. So there is a clear need to identify multimodal activities that could be encouraged amongst older adults as part of a healthy lifestyle to reduce the incidence risk of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing we tracked 2,631 adults aged 50 + who were free from chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> at baseline across a decade and explore whether physical or psychosocial factors reduced the risk of developing chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. In relation to physical factors , engaging in vigorous weekly activity was protective against the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR = 0.74 , SE = 0.07 , CI = 0.62 to 0.89) when controlling for all identified socio-economic , health and social confounders. But no effects were found for moderate weekly activity. In relation to psychosocial factors , cultural engagement was also protective against the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR = 0.75 , SE = 0.07 , CI = 0.63 to 0.91) , but community group participation was not. These findings extend previous work showing that physical activity and psychosocial factors such as positive affect are key factors in the long-term success of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> self-management. Future interventional studies for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> are encouraged. Perspective This article explores whether physical and psychosocial activities could reduce the risk of developing chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in older age. These results could potentially help clinicians to recommend multimodal activities as part of a broader healthy lifestyle for those aged 50 + to reduce the incidence rate of
