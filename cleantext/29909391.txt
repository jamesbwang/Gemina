  A newly diagnosed 53-year-old woman with cirrhosis has repeated gastrointestinal bleeding with resulting symptomatic anaemia. She underwent routine diagnostic endoscopic evaluation without localisation of the aetiology of her bleed. Ultimately , she was found to have ectopic varices in the small bowel as a result of underlying high portal pressures. She underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for portal system decompression with resolution in her bleeding.
