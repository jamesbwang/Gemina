  Introduction & Aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the impact of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on clinical course and outcome of pregnancy. The study included 400 pregnant women free of diabetes prior to pregnancy ( Only singleton pregnancy). They were divided into 2 groups; Group 1; included 200 pregnant women with NAFLD and Groups 2; Included 200 pregnant women without NAFLD ( control group). A thorough medical history , physical examination , laboratory investigations and liver ultrasound scans for diagnosis of NAFLD were carried out in all studied populations. When women with NAFLD were compared with those without NAFLD we found that , pregnant women with NAFLD had more GDM ( 33 % versus 10 % , p = 0.001) , pre-eclampsia ( 25 % versus 12 % , p = 0.001) , hypertension ( 2 % versus 0 % , p = 0.013). However , there was no difference as regards eclampsia ( 3 % versus 2 % , p = 0.52) , preterm birth ( 11 % versus 8 % , p = 0.31) , fetal growth retardation ( 13 % versus 10 % , p = 0.35) and emesis graviderum ( 8 % versus 3.5 % , p = 0.086). There was a significant increase in fasting blood glucose ( p = 0.001) , serum level of AST ( p = 0.002) , total cholesterol and triglycerides ( p = 0.001 and 0.016 respectively) and serum uric acid ( p = 0.001) in the pregnant women with NAFLD versus the pregnant women without NAFLD. Pregnant women with NAFLD have increased risk for GDM , pre-eclampsia , hypertension , hyperuricemia , increasing total cholesterol and triglycerides and should be carefully monitored during antenatal care.b.
