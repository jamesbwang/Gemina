  Tick-borne flaviviruses have a global distribution and cause significant human<disease> disease<disease> , including encephalitis<disease> and hemorrhagic<disease> fever<disease> , and often result in neurologic sequelae. There are two distinct properties that determine the neuropathogenesis of a virus. The ability to invade the central nervous system ( CNS) is referred to as the neuroinvasiveness of the agent , while the ability to infect and damage cells within the CNS is referred to as its neurovirulence. Examination of laboratory variants , cDNA clones , natural isolates with varying pathogenicity , and virally encoded immune evasion strategies have contributed extensively to our understanding of these properties. Here we will review the major viral determinants of virulence that contribute to pathogenesis and influence both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence properties of tick-borne flaviviruses , focusing particularly on the envelope protein ( E) , nonstructural protein 5 ( NS5) , and the 3 & prime; untranslated region ( UTR).
