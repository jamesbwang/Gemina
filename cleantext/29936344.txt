  Much work has demonstrated that children are able to use bottom-up linguistic cues to incrementally interpret sentences , but there is little understanding of the extent to which children 's comprehension mechanisms are guided by top-down linguistic information that can be learned from distributional regularities in the input. Using a visual world eye tracking experiment and a corpus analysis , the current study investigates whether 5- and 6-year-old children incrementally assign interpretations to temporarily ambiguous wh-questions like What was Emily eating the cake with __? In the visual world eye-tracking experiment , adults demonstrated evidence for active dependency formation at the earliest region ( i.e. , the verb region) , while 6-year-old children demonstrated a spill-over effect of this bias in the subsequent NP region. No evidence for this bias was found in 5-year-olds , although the speed of arrival at the ultimately correct instrument interpretation appears to be modulated by the vocabulary size. These results suggest that adult-like active formation of filler-gap dependencies begins to emerge around age 6. The corpus analysis of filler-gap dependency structures in adult corpora and child corpora demonstrate that the distributional regularities in either corpora are equally in favor of early , incremental completion of filler-gap dependencies , suggesting that the distributional information in the input is either not relevant to this incremental bias , or that 5-year-old children are somehow unable to recruit this information in real-time comprehension. Taken together , these findings shed light on the origin of the incremental processing bias in filler-gap dependency processing , as well as on the role of language experience and cognitive constraints in the development of incremental sentence processing mechanisms.
