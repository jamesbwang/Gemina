  A total of 50 Salmonella<pathogen> enterica<pathogen> strains were isolated from clinical samples from 2009 to 2012 and analyzed for the presence of virulence genes found in SPI-1 , SPI-2 , and plasmids. The distribution and frequency of the antimicrobial resistance genes and plasmids were revealed , and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE) patterns were investigated. Five genes were identified from the seven strains with resistance or intermediate resistance to ampicillin: blaSHV-1 ( present in six strains) , qnrS1 ( present in five strains) , blaTEM-1 ( present in three strains) , blaCTX-M-1 ( present in one strain) , and qnrB1 ( present in one strain). One trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant strain was positive for sulI but negative for sulII. In addition , we detected TEM-1 and qnrS1 in one strain; SHV-1 and qnrS1 in two strains; TEM-1 , SHV-1 , CTX-M-1 , and qnrS1 in one strain; TEM-1 , SHV-1 , and qnrB1 in one strain; and SHV-1 and sulI genes in one strain together. Plasmid-based replicon typing assay revealed that all 50 strains carried FIIS , 13 carried I1 , 1 carried I2 , 4 carried P , 1 carried A/C , and 4 carried X1 replicon. PFGE was used to type 46 of the 50 strains and classify them into 22 major groups , 33 pulsotypes , and 8 major clusters. All strains carried all the virulence genes of interest on both Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands 1 and 2 and plasmids suggested high potential for pathogenicity. All antimicrobial-resistant strains contained at least one of the resistance genes of interest , confirming a phenotype-genotype association in antimicrobial resistance.
