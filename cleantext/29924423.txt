  There are several methods of enteral nutrition ( EN) administration , including continuous , cyclic , intermittent , and bolus techniques , which can be used either alone or in combination. Continuous feeding involves hourly administration of EN over 24 hours assisted by a feeding pump; cyclic feeding involves administration of EN over a time period of < 24 hours generally assisted by a feeding pump; intermittent feeding involves administration of EN over 20-60 minutes every 4-6 hours via pump assist or gravity assist; and bolus feeding involves administration of EN over a 4- to 10-minute period using a syringe or gravity drip. In practice , pump-assisted continuous feeding is generally acceptable for critically ill patients to prevent EN-related complications. However , a limited number of studies have been conducted to support this practice. In addition , regarding muscle protein synthesis and gastrointestinal hormone secretion , intermittent or bolus feeding may be more beneficial than continuous EN feeding for critically ill patients. For medically stable patients with feeding tubes terminating in the stomach , bolus feeding is favored with respect to practical factors , such as cost , convenience , and patient mobility. However , few studies have shown whether intermittent or bolus feeding is beneficial in a critical care setting at present. Additional randomized controlled studies comparing intermittent with bolus feeding are required.
