  There have been recent calls for the application of the complex systems approach in sports injury research. However , beyond theoretical description and static models of complexity , little progress has been made towards formalising this approach in way that is practical to sports injury scientists and clinicians. Therefore , our objective was to use a computational modelling method and develop a dynamic simulation in sports injury research. Agent-based modelling ( ABM) was used to model the occurrence of sports injury in a synthetic athlete population. The ABM was developed based on sports injury causal frameworks and was applied in the context of distance running-related injury ( RRI). Using the acute: chronic workload ratio ( ACWR) , we simulated the dynamic relationship between changes in weekly running distance and RRI through the manipulation of various ` athlete management tools '. The findings confirmed that building weekly running distances over time , even within the reported ACWR ` sweet spot ' , will eventually result in RRI as athletes reach and surpass their individual physical workload limits. Introducing training-related error into the simulation and the modelling of a ` hard ceiling ' dynamic resulted in a higher RRI incidence proportion across the population at higher absolute workloads. The presented simulation offers a practical starting point to further apply more sophisticated computational models that can account for the complex nature of sports injury aetiology. Alongside traditional forms of scientific inquiry , the use of ABM and other simulation-based techniques could be considered as a complementary and alternative methodological approach in sports injury research.
