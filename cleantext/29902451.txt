  KIAA0101 functions as a regulator of centrosome number in breast cancer. Here , we identify the role of KIAA0101 in breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. KIAA0101 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth , colony formation and G1/S phase transition. Further investigation indicated that KIAA0101 silencing suppressed the expression of CCNE2 , CDK6 and CDKN1A. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay demonstrated that Sp1 positively regulated the transcription of CCNE2 , CDK6 and CDKN1A. KIAA0101 knockdown promoted the interaction between p53 and Sp1 , inhibiting the transcriptional activation of Sp1 on CCNE2 , CDK6 and CDKN1A. Knockdown of p53 counteracted the inhibitory effect of KIAA0101 knockdown on breast cancer cells proliferation and cell cycle progression while Sp1 knockdown mimicked the effect of KIAA0101 knockdown. These results suggested that KIAA0101 knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by promoting the formation of p53/Sp1 complex in breast cancer.
