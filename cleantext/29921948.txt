  Standard treatment for advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM) is a cisplatin/pemetrexed ( MTA) regimen; however , this is confronted by drug resistance. Proteotoxic stress in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) is a hallmark of cancer and some rely on this stress signalling in response to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. We hypothesise that ER stress and the adaptive unfolded protein response ( UPR) play a role in chemotherapy resistance of MPM. In vitro three-dimensional ( 3D) and ex vivo organotypic culture were used to enrich a chemotherapy-resistant population and recapitulate an in vivo MPM microenvironment , respectively. Markers of ER stress , the UPR and apoptosis were assessed at mRNA and protein levels. Cell viability was determined based on acid phosphatase activity. MPM cells with de novo and/or acquired chemotherapy resistance displayed low ER stress , which rendered the cells hypersensitive to agents that induce ER stress and alter the UPR. Bortezomib , an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor , selectively impairs chemotherapy-resistant MPM cells by activating the PERK/eIF2Î±/ATF4-mediated UPR and augmenting apoptosis. We provide the first evidence for ER stress and the adaptive UPR signalling in chemotherapy resistance of MPM , which suggests that perturbation of the UPR by altering ER stress is a novel strategy to treat chemotherapy-refractory MPM.
