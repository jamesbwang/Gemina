  Aim: The offspring cancer needs instrument ( OCNI) was developed specifically for assessing unmet psychosocial needs of adolescents and young adults who have a parent with cancer. The aim of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of this instrument. Methods: For this methodological study , translation of OCNI into Persian was conducted using translation and back-translation and revision in line with the developer of the instrument. Then , face and content validity , construct validity , internal consistency and stability of the Persian version of the instrument were examined with a population of 188 adolescents and young people having a parent with cancer in five hospitals in Tehran , Iran. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 and LISREL 8.5. Results: The final Persian version of the instrument demonstrated face and content validity proven by expert and participant reviews. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed construct validity of the instrument and its seven subscales. Cronbach 's alpha was 0.96 for the total instrument and 0.76-0.93 for its seven subscales. The intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) calculated to evaluate the test-retest reliability , was 0.83. Conclusions: The Persian version of OCNI has acceptable psychometric properties. It can be used for measuring psychosocial unmet needs in adolescents and young adults in Persian language populations who have a parent with cancer.
