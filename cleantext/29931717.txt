  A highly selective Cu ( II)- catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative ortho-aminomethylation of phenols with aniline derivatives is described. The corresponding C ( sp2)- C ( sp3) coupling products were obtained in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions and with a broad substrate scope. A radical mechanism is proposed.
