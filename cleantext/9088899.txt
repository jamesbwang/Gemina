  Captive breeding programmes are increasingly relied upon for threatened species management. Changes in morphology can occur in captivity , often with unknown consequences for reintroductions. Few studies have examined the morphological changes that occur in captive animals compared with wild animals. Further , the effect of multiple generations being maintained in captivity , and the potential effects of captivity on sexual dimorphism remain poorly understood. We compared external and internal morphology of captive and wild animals using house mouse (
