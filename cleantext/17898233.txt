  Enkephalin expression is high in mesocorticolimbic areas associated with psychostimulant-induced behavioral and neurobiological effects , and may also modulate local neurotransmission in this circuit network. Psychostimulant drugs , like amphetamine and cocaine , significantly increase the content of enkephalin in these brain structures , but we do not yet understand the specific significance of this drug-induced adaptation. In this review , we summarize the neurochemical and molecular mechanism of psychostimulant-induced enkephalin activation in mesocorticolimbic brain areas , and the contribution of this opioid peptide in the pivotal neuroadaptations and long-term behavioral changes underlying psychostimulant addiction. There is evidence suggesting that adaptive changes in enkephalin content in the mesocorticolimbic circuit , induced by acute and chronic psychostimulant administration , may represent a key initial step in the long-term behavioral and neuronal plasticity induced by these drugs.
