  Upregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism is a hallmark in the differentiation of stem cells. However , the mechanism underlying the metabolic reprogramming and upregulation of mitochondrial function during the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) is largely unclear. Sirt3 has emerged as a sensor in regulating mitochondrial function and antioxidant defence system in cellular response to energy demand or environmental stimuli , but its roles in stem cell differentiation have not been fully understood. In this study , we used adipose-derived hMSCs ( ad-hMSCs) to investigate the role of Sirt3 in adipogenic differentiation and in the function of mature adipocytes. We showed that at the early stage of adipogenic differentiation , Sirt3 upregulation is essential for the activation of biogenesis and bioenergetic function of mitochondria. In addition , we found that induction of Forkhead Box O 3a ( FoxO3a) , an upstream factor that regulates MnSOD gene transcription , is involved in the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes at the early stage of adipogenic differentiation. Silencing of Sirt3 by shRNA decreased the protein level of FoxO3a and subsequently downregulated a number of FoxO3a-mediated antioxidant enzymes and increased oxidative stress in ad-hMSCs after adipogenic induction. Importantly , depletion of Sirt3 compromised the ability of ad-hMSCs to undergo adipogenic differentiation and led to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance. These findings suggest that Sirt3-mediated protein deacetylation plays an important role in regulating oxidative metabolism and antioxidant defence in stem cell differentiation , and that Sirt3 deficiency may be related to insulin resistance.
