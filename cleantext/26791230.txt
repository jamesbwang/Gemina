  PYNOD , a nod-like receptors ( NLR)- like protein , was indicated to inhibit NF-κB activation , caspase-1-mediated interleukin ( IL) -1 β release and cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous addition of recombinant PYNOD to mixed glial cultures may suppress caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion induced by Aβ. However , to the best of our knowledge , there no study has focused on the immunoregulatory effects of PYNOD specifically in microglia. The present study aimed to explore the roles of PYNOD involved in the lipopolysaccharides ( LPS)- induced microglial inflammation<symptom> and consequent neurotoxicity. Murine microglial BV-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-PYNOD ( 0-5.0 µg/ml) for 24 h and incubated with or without LPS ( 1 µg/ml) for a further 24 h. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay and the secretion of nitric oxide ( NO) , IL-1β and caspase-1 was measured using the Griess method or ELISA. Protein expression levels of NF-κB p65 and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) were detected by immunofluorescent staining and/or western blot analysis. Co-culture of BV-2 cells with human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH was performed in Transwell plates and the cell viability and apoptosis ( using flow cytometry) of SK-N-SH cells were determined. Results indicated that PYNOD overexpression inhibited NO secretion and iNOS protein expression induced by LPS in BV-2 cells , with no detectable cytotoxicity. PYNOD overexpression also reduced the secretion of IL-1β and caspase-1 from BV-2 cells upon LPS stimulation. These effects were dose-dependent. Additionally , PYNOD overexpression prevented LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in BV-2 cells. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-promoting effects of BV-2 cells towards SK-N-SH cells were alleviated as a result of PYNOD overexpression. In conclusion , PYNOD may mitigate microglial inflammation<symptom> and consequent neurotoxicity.
