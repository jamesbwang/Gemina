  New therapies , monitoring , and revolutionary enabling technologies applied to healthcare represent an historic opportunity to improve the lives of people with diabetes. These advances enable more meaningful monitoring of blood glucose values with the facilitation of more optimal insulin dosing and delivery. Newer insulins and delivery systems are in development that seek to mitigate both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and increase time in range. Information systems now exist that may be leveraged to merge data from previously discrete systems into new models of connected care. This review highlights important developments that serve to increase effectiveness while reducing the burden of diabetes care in the near future.
