  The current study uses an ecological model of biopsychosocial vulnerability to guide the description of risk and protective factors for the mental health of gender minority ( i.e. , transgender and gender non-conforming) adolescents at the individual , family , community , and societal levels. Minority stress is the vulnerability of youth who are lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT) to adverse mental health outcomes due to stigma. In addition , unlike cisgender ( non-transgender) LGB individuals , gender minorities may experience internal stress related to gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria may lead to interaction with health care providers who may not be educated in the care of gender minority youth. The ecological model is an organizing framework for understanding domains of health risks that affect such youth to assist nurses in intervening to promote the health of gender minority adolescents. Specific attention is paid to the potential contributions of psychiatric-mental health nurses to the care of gender minority adolescents.
