  The aim of this study is to describe a surgical technique for successful treatment of posteromedial talar body fractures and establish treatment recommendations for fractures of the posterior aspect of the talus. Ten patients treated operatively for a posteromedial talar body fractures entering both the subtalar and ankle articulations with a minimum of 1-year followup were identified from a trauma database. Age , mechanism of injury , associated injuries , time to surgery , complications , the range of motion , secondary procedures , and need for arthrodesis were evaluated. Followup averaged 4.8 years ( 1-10). Eight of ten patients had high-energy mechanisms of injury. Six patients had associated medial subtalar dislocations with two open. Associated injuries were common. No surgical complications occurred. The range of motion was present but decreased. No arthrodesis procedures were performed. Operative fixation of posteromedial talus fractures with the described surgical technique resulted in acceptable outcomes in this series of patients with improved outcomes when compared to prior reports in the literature.
