  Tryptophan is reportedly the most potent agonist for GPR142. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS) from pancreatic beta cells are enhanced by GPR142-mediated signal. It is not clear , however , if GPR142-mediated signals is solely attributable to GSIS enhancement after tryptophan load in various pathophysiological settings. This study aims to reveal the significance of GPR142 signaling in tryptophan-mediated GSIS enhancement in normal and obese mice. Tryptophan significantly improved glucose tolerance in both lean and DIO mice , but the extent of improvement was bigger in DIO mice with augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS) enhancement. The same results were obtained in ob/ob mice. GPR142 deletion almost completely blocked tryptophan actions in lean mice , suggesting that GPR142 signaling was solely responsible for the GSIS enhancement. In obese GPR142KO mice , however , a significant amount of tryptophan effects were still observed. Calcium-sensing receptors ( CaSR) are also known to recognize tryptophan as ligand. Expression levels of CaSR were significantly elevated in the pancreas of DIO mice , and CaSR antagonist further blocked tryptophan 's actions in DIO mice with GPR142 deletion. Although GPR142 signaling had a major role in tryptophan recognition for the enhancement of GSIS in lean mice , other pathways including CaSR signaling also had a significant role in obese mice , which seemed to contribute to the augmented enhancement of GSIS by tryptophan in these animals.
