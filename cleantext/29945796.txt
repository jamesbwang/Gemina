  Fipronil is a phenyl pyrazole molecule widely used across the world as both insecticide and veterinary drug. The main goal of this work was to synthesize a fluorescently labeled fipronil derivative for cellular imaging without affecting its intrinsic properties. We selected fluorescein as fluorescent probe and we investigated different strategies for stable chemical ligation between both entities , such as thiourea and direct peptide bond. While thiourea bond displayed low stability , direct peptide bond was difficult to achieve due to problems of steric hindrance. The best result was obtained by conjugation using click chemistry , which allowed to obtain fipronil stably labeled with the fluorescent probe.
