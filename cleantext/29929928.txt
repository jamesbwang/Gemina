  The association of sleep duration/quality with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is inconclusive. Several important covariates were not adjusted concomitantly in some studies , and the severity of NAFLD was not considered. Furthermore , the gender impact of sleep duration or sleep quality on NAFLD remains unclear. We thus aimed to examine the association of sleep duration and quality with NAFLD by gender in a Taiwanese population. A total of 6663 subjects aged 18 years or more were enrolled. The severity of NAFLD was divided into mild , moderate , and severe degrees based on ultrasound findings. The sleep duration was classified into three groups: short ( < 6h) , normal ( 6-8h) , and long ( > 8h). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality , and poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score greater than 5. After adjustment for potential confounders , multinomial logistic regression showed that poor sleep quality was negatively associated with both mild and moderate-to-severe NAFLD in males , but sleep duration was not independently related to NAFLD. In females , sleep condition was not related to NAFLD. Poor<symptom> sleep quality but not sleep duration was associated with a lower risk of not only moderate to severe but also mild NAFLD in males. In females , the association of sleep quality and duration with the risk of NAFLD was insignificant.
