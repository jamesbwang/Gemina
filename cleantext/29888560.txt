  To observe the correlation between the referred pain regions of stable angina pectoris ( SAP) and the acupoints in coronary heart disease ( CHD) patients and to investigate the rule of regional sensitized point distribution in rats. A total of 1 046 CHD patients with SAP from 8 hospitals in China were recruited in the present study. The tenderness<symptom> was palpated along the left and right chest , back , shoulder , upper limb , etc. by a specially-assigned researcher in each hospital. Among them , 77 patients accepted pain threshold ( PT) measurement by using a hand-held esthesiometer. In animal experiments , 14 SD rats were subjected to occlusion of the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery for 4 h for establishing myocardial ischemia ( MI) model , and other 4 normal rats were used as the sham-operation control group. Four hours after MI , all the rats accepted tail venous injection of 5 % Evans blue ( 50 mg/kg) for examining the distribution of the blue dye exudation spots at the body surface where the mechanical PT was also detected by a von Frey. In 1 046 CHD patients , 987 ( 94.36 %) were found to have at least one tenderness<symptom> spot. The tenderness<symptom> spots were found at the left chest ( 87.47 %) , right chest ( 13.67 %) , left arm ( ulnar side , 41.30 %) , right upper limb ( 4.68 %) , left shoulder back ( 30.21 %) , right shoulder back ( 7.07 %) , etc. , accompanied with rash<symptom> or pigmentation , subcutaneous induration , cord-like tissue contracture , skin sag , etc.. The mechanical PT level was significantly lower at the tenderness<symptom> spots of the left upper limb than at non-tender points of the right upper limb in CHD patients ( In the case of MI , a regular `` referred sensitization '' response frequently occurs in the dermatomere area innervated by the corresponding segments ( T 1 Ôºç T 5) in both CHD patients and MI rats , which may be closely associated with the formation of acupoints in ancient China.
