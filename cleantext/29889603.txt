  The maximization principle-that people aspire to the highest possible level of something good if all practical constraints are removed-is a common yet untested assumption about human nature. We predict that in holistic cultures-where contradiction , change , and context are emphasized-ideal states of being for the self will be more moderate than in other cultures. In two studies ( Ns = 2,392 and 6,239) , we asked this question: If participants could choose their ideal level of happiness , pleasure , freedom , health , self-esteem , longevity , and intelligence , what level would they choose? Consistent with predictions , results showed that maximization was less pronounced in holistic cultures; members of holistic cultures aspired to less happiness , pleasure , freedom , health , self-esteem , longevity , and IQ than did members of other cultures. In contrast , no differences emerged on ideals for society. The studies show that the maximization principle is not a universal aspect of human nature and that there are predictable cultural differences in people 's notions of perfection.
