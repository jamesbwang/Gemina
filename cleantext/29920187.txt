  Epithelial cell dysfunction is postulated as an important component in the pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary<disease> Fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). Mutations in the Surfactant Protein C ( SP-C) gene ( SFTPC) , an alveolar type 2 ( AT2) cell restricted protein , have been found in sporadic and familial IPF. To causally link these events , we developed a knock-in mouse model capable of regulated expression of an IPF-associated Isoleucine to Threonine substitution at codon 73 ( I73T) in Sftpc ( SP-CI73T). Tamoxifen treated SP-CI73T cohorts developed rapid increases in SftpcI73T mRNA and misprocessed proSP-CI73T protein accompanied by increased early mortality ( days 7-14). This acute phase was marked by diffuse parenchymal lung injury , tissue infiltration by monocytes , polycellular alveolitis , and elevations in bronchoalveolar lavage and AT2 mRNA contents of select inflammatory cytokines. Resolution of alveolitis ( 2-4 weeks) , commensurate with a rise in TGFB1 , was followed by aberrant remodeling marked by collagen deposition , AT2 cell hyperplasia<disease> , a-SMA positive cells , and restrictive lung physiology. The translational relevance of the model was supported by detection of multiple IPF biomarkers previously reported in human cohorts. These data provide proof of principle that mutant SP-C expression in vivo causes spontaneous lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> strengthening the role of AT2 dysfunction as a key upstream driver of IPF pathogenesis.
