  Maintaining body temperature is a unique challenge with burn care. We sought to describe core temperature goals in the operating room ( OR) and the methods used to achieve and maintain these goals , along with current methods of warming in the intensive care unit ( ICU) , the perception of effect of increased ambient temperature on work performance , and concerns with contamination of sterile fields due to increased ambient temperature. A 24 question survey was disseminated to burn centers in the United States and Canada. The questions included demographics , target core and ambient temperatures , warming methods , and beliefs on ambient temperature 's effects. Of 121 burn centers , 52 questionnaires were completed ( 43 % response rate). The majority of centers targeted a core temperature between 36 and 38 °C in the OR and an ambient temperature between 75 and 95 °F in the ICU. The most common methods for maintaining core temperature included warmed ambient temperature , forced air devices , and intravenous fluids. Although the majority of centers reported the belief that increased ambient temperature benefits patients , many also reported that there is a negative impact on staff performance and risk of staff perspiration contaminating sterile fields. Burn centers reported a range of target core temperatures and methods to reach target temperatures. More than a third of respondents perceived a negative impact work performance while more than half acknowledged the potential for contamination of sterile fields. A prospective observational study is needed to determine actual temperature regulation practice patterns and its impact on outcomes.
