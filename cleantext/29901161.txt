  In the present study , a lipid-polymer hybrid drug carrier system was developed to encapsulate psoralen ( PSO) , a multidrug resistance reversal agent and traditional Chinese medicine. Emphasis was focused the parameters that influence physicochemical characteristics , and then the drug release profile , stability , cytotoxicity and drug resistance reversal effect of the lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles ( LPNs) were investigated. It was found that various formulation parameters affected NP size , drug loading ( DL) and release characteristics. Hydrophilic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-carboxy ( polyethylene glycol) 2000 increased the Î¶ potential and thus the stability of the NPs , but also enlarged their diameter. The amount of PSO influenced their DL and encapsulation efficiency , but did not show any effect on drug release kinetics. Next , the stability of the LPNs in different media and their storage characteristics were assessed. Finally , the cytotoxicity and multidrug resistance reversal effect was studied in the K562 and HepG2 cell lines. The analysis of half maximal inhibitory concentration values demonstrated that combination therapy with doxorubicin ( DOX) and PSO-loaded LPNs ( P-LPNs) was 14- and 23-fold more effective than a single-dose DOX treatment in resistant K562 and HepG2 cells , respectively , and 2.2- and 2.1-fold more effective than a single-dose combination regimen of DOX and PSO in solution , respectively. These data indicate that the LPNs have superior properties compared with a combination therapy in solution.
