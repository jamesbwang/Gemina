  Polar materials are of great technical interest but challenging to effectively synthesize. That is especially true for iodates , an important class of visible and mid-IR transparent nonlinear optical ( NLO) materials. Aiming at developing a new design strategy for polar iodates , we successfully synthesized two sets of polymorphic early transition-metal ( ETM) oxide-fluoride iodates , α- and β-Ba ( VFO
