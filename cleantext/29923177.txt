  Genome-wide association studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) have identified regions of association at PIP4K2A and upstream of BMI1 at chromosome 10p12.31-12.2. The contribution of both loci to ALL risk and underlying functional variants remain to be elucidated. We carried out single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) imputation across chromosome 10p12.31-12.2 in Latino and non-Latino white ALL cases and controls from two independent California childhood leukemia<disease> studies , and additional Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging study controls. Ethnicity-stratified association analyses were performed using logistic regression , with meta-analysis including 3133 cases ( 1949 Latino , 1184 non-Latino white) and 12,135 controls ( 8584 Latino , 3551 non-Latino white). SNP associations were identified at both BMI1 and PIP4K2A. After adjusting for the lead PIP4K2A SNP , genome-wide significant associations remained at BMI1 , and vice-versa ( P
