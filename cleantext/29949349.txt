  Well-characterized promoters with variable strength form the foundation of heterologous pathway optimization. It is also a key element that bolsters the success of microbial engineering and facilitates the development of biological tools like biosensors. In comparison to microbial hosts such as Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , the promoter repertoire of Cupriavidus<pathogen> necator H16 is highly limited. This limited number of characterized promoters poses a significant challenge during the engineering of C. necator H16 for biomanufacturing and biotechnological applications. In this article , we first examined the architecture and genetic elements of the four most widely used constitutive promoters of C. necator H16 ( i.e. , P
