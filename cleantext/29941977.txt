  The hippocampus contains one of the few neurogenic niches within the adult brain-the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. The functional significance of adult-born neurons in this region has been characterized using context fear conditioning , a Pavlovian paradigm in which animals learn to associate a location with danger. Ablation or silencing of adult-born neurons impairs both acquisition and recall of contextual fear conditioning , suggesting that these neurons contribute importantly to hippocampal memory. Lesion<symptom> studies indicate that CFC depends on neural activity in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus , subregions with unique extrahippocampal connectivity and behavioral functions. Because most studies of adult neurogenesis have relied on methods that permanently ablate neurogenesis throughout the entire hippocampus , little is known about how the function of adult-born neurons varies along the dorsal-ventral axis.
