  Izenamides A , B , and C ( 1-3) , new linear depsipeptides , were isolated from a taxonomically distinct marine cyanobacterium. Izenamides A and B contain a statine moiety ( ( 3 S ,4 S) -4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid) and inhibited the activity of cathepsin D , an aspartic peptidase. Meanwhile , izenamides did not show growth-inhibitory activity against HeLa , HL60 , or MCF-7 cells at up to 10 Î¼M.
