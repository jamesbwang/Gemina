  A 57-year-old man had a diagnosis of a bronchial mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in the left lung and monoclonal gammopathy. The patient underwent whole-body C-methionine PET/CT , in order to evaluate the amino acid avidity of the lesion<symptom> and to stage the bronchial mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. C-methionine uptake was detected in the lung lesion<symptom> and in the mediastinal lymph nodes.
