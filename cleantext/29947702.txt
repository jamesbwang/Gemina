  Analyzing how the nursing team performs in facing the sexuality in the daily lives of institutionalized elderly women. A qualitative and descriptive study carried out in a Nursing Home in the southern region of Brazil. Data were collected from April to July 2016 through a semi-structured interview and submitted to the French Discourse Analysis of Michel PÃªcheux. The study complied with the norms of the Brazilian legislation for research on human beings. Eighteen ( 18) nursing professionals participated in the study. Ideological and imaginary formations permeated the subjects ' discourse , evoking the understanding of sexuality , its institutional conformation and the performance demanded under manifestations of this sexuality. Thus , considering the professionals ' performance , it became possible to identify difficulties such as embarrassment , discomfort or prevalence of personal beliefs and strategies. These strategies have diversified ranging from the use of humor to direct repressive actions. Understanding the dynamics of professionals ' performance towards sexuality allows us to glimpse the need for comprehensiveness in care related to social , ideological and imaginary formations which demand an imperative strengthening of academic and professional training.
