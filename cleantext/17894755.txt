  In Mediterranean ecosystems , climate change is projected to increase fire danger and summer drought , thus reducing post-fire recruitment of obligate seeder species , and possibly affecting the population genetic structure. We performed a genome-wide genetic marker study , using AFLP markers , on individuals from one Central Spain population of the obligate post-fire seeder Cistus ladanifer L. that established after experimental fire and survived during four subsequent years under simulated drought implemented with a rainout shelter system. We explored the effects of the treatments on marker diversity , spatial genetic structure and presence of outlier loci suggestive of selection. We found no effect of fire or drought on any of the genetic diversity metrics. Analysis of Molecular Variance showed very low genetic differentiation among treatments. Neither fire nor drought altered the small-scale spatial genetic structure of the population. Only one locus was significantly associated with the fire treatment , but inconsistently across outlier detection methods. Neither fire nor drought are likely to affect the genetic makeup of emerging C. ladanifer , despite reduced recruitment caused by drought. The lack of genetic change suggests that reduced recruitment is a random , non-selective process with no genome-wide consequences on this keystone , drought- and fire tolerant Mediterranean species.
