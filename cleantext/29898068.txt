  This study investigated the bond strength of two experimental root canal sealers based on MTA and butyl ethylene glycol disalicylate: MTAe and MTAe-HA. The reference materials used for comparison were AH Plus and MTA Fillapex. Twenty human upper incisors were selected and one 1 mm slice was obtained from the cervical third of each root. On the coronal surface of each slice , four 0.9 mm wide holes were drilled through the dentine. Standardized irrigation was performed and holes were filled with one of the four tested sealers: AH Plus , MTA Fillapex , MTAe , and MTAe-HA. The filled slices were stored in a PBS solution ( pH 7.2) for 7 days at 37 Â°C. A push-out assessment was performed with a 0.7 mm plunger tip. Load was applied at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until sealer displacement. The results were expressed in MPa. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to assess the effect of each sealer on the push-out bond strength. Mann-Whitney with Bonferroni correction was used to isolate the differences. The alpha-type error was set at 0.05. Significant differences among medians values obtained by materials were observed ( p < 0.001). AH Plus displayed the highest value of bond strength ( p < 0.001). In contrast , MTA Fillapex presented the lowest bond strength among all tested sealers ( p < 0.001). Experimental sealers showed intermediary bond strength values , with no statistical differences between them ( p > 0.05). In conclusion , experimental root canal sealers presented suitable bond strength outcomes when compared to MTA Fillapex.
