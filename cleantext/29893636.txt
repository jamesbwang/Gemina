  Child sexual abuse ( CSA) is a prevalent problem in many societies across the globe. There have been several discussions of the subject and attempts have been made to explain its incidence and find ways to prevent and/or control it. However , despite these efforts , the problem seems to persist in developing countries like Ghana with dire consequences for the children and society at large. This paper sought to glean insights about the persistence of the problem by focusing on the discourse surrounding the subject. Using Focus Group Discussions with adult members in the Ga communities in Accra namely La , Teshie , and James Town where the phenomenon is relatively pervasive , the paper sought to understand the reasoning and the implications of accusing children who were sexually abused in the Ga community of seducing the perpetrators and engaging in sex for money. The paper posits that the labeling of victims of CSA as `` gbɛkɛfɔŋs '' ( children of bad character) disempowers children and perpetuates the abuse of children. Thus , introducing and situating this notion of `` gbɛkɛfɔŋs '' in the center of the discourse largely results in a victimization of the victims and a vicious cycle of CSA. The conclusions from this study point to the need for a reorientation of parental and communal roles and an empowering of children to identify and resist sexual abuse.
