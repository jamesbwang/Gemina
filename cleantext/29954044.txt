  Although many pregnant women experience fear , worry , or anxiety<symptom> relating to the upcoming birth , little is known regarding the psychological mechanisms contributing to these experiences. In this study , we wanted to take a first step in trying to identify mechanisms of potential interest. The objective of this cross-sectional study was thus to investigate pain catastrophizing , intolerance of uncertainty , positive worry beliefs , and cognitive avoidance as potential mechanisms predicting fear of birth among pregnant women. A sample of 499 pregnant women , recruited in antenatal health care settings in 2 Swedish regions , completed the Fear of Birth Scale , along with measurements of the mechanisms of interest. Linear and logistic hierarchical regression analyses were used to investigate the extent to which pain catastrophizing , intolerance of uncertainty , positive worry beliefs , and cognitive avoidance predicted fear of birth , both as a continuous and a dichotomous measure. Logistic regression analysis showed high levels of pain catastrophizing and intolerance of uncertainty to be the best predictors of fear of birth , OR 3.49 ( 95 % CI 2.17-5.61) and OR 3.25 ( 95 % CI 2.00-5.27) , respectively. Positive beliefs about worry and cognitive avoidance were both correlated with fear of birth as a continuous measure , but did not contribute to the logistic regression model. Pain catastrophizing and intolerance of uncertainty were the most evident predictors of fear of birth. Although preliminary , the findings suggest that interventions targeting catastrophic cognitions and intolerance of uncertainty might be relevant to psychological treatment for fear , worry , or anxiety<symptom> relating to giving birth.
