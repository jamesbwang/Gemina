  The RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling is important in the regulation of bone turnover. The aim of the present work was to analyze the rs3018362 and rs12585014 polymorphisms in the RANK and RANKL genes , as well as risk factors in postmenopausal women. Women with hip fracture , with femoral neck osteoporosis and controls ( n = 646) were recruited. From these , 303 women who fulfill the inclusion criteria were genotyped using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. There were no associations of the rs3018362 and rs12585014 with osteoporosis or fracture. When women were divided by age at menarche , the rs12585014 GG genotype was strongly associated with age at menarche > 13 years ( p = .00774 , OR = 6.429 ( 1.907-21.103)) in women with hip fracture. Significant differences in risk factors such as body mass index , age at menopause , use of estrogens , the presence of hypertension , and diabetes mellitus were found. Carrying the GG genotype of rs12585014 entails a higher risk of having menarche later ( > 13 years) , which could involves a greater risk of fractures. The rs3018362 and rs12585014 do not seem to be associated with hip osteoporosis or hip fracture in Mexican women.
