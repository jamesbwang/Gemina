  To establish a time-resolved fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for quantitative determination of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9) in serum , we prepared CA19-9 test strips by integrating double-antibody sandwich method and fluorescence immunochromatography technique. Carboxy fluorescent microspheres and nitrocellulose membrane were used as carriers for labeling and coating CA19-9 pairing antibodies. We optimized the process by adjusting the amount of labeling and coating antibody. According to the linear range , lowest detection limit and precision , We evaluated the time-resolved fluorescence immunochromatographic assay of CA19-9. When the amount of labeled antibody was 80 μg for 20 μL fluorescent microspheres , and the concentration of coated antibody on the test line was 1.5 mg/mL , the optimal reaction time was 15 minutes. Assay linear range was 12.5 to 800 U/mL and the minimum detection limit was 6.32 U/mL. The Within-run and between-run coefficient of variation were less than 15 %. Average recovery rate was 101 %. By detecting 50 clinical samples in parallel with Roche electrochemical luminescence detection kit , correlation coefficient was 0.980 6. The experiment , initially established a fluorescence immunochromatographic detection method to quantitative detection of serum CA19-9 , which has a good clinical application prospect.
