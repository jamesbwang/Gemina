  Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD) are a major complication in COPD patients which can be triggered by bacterial or viral<disease> infections<disease> , environmental pollutants and other causes. Procalcitonin ( PCT) , a peptide that markedly increases in cases of bacterial infection , has been extensively investigated as a biomarker in the diagnosis , prognosis and treatment in patients with AECOPD. A number of studies published in the last decade , tried to investigate whether PCT levels can differentiate between bacterial and other causes of exacerbations , if they can be used as a guide for optimal antibiotic therapy and if they can be a tool in the assessment of the severity and the need for further interventions in the management of those patients. This review aims to gather , summarize and critically present all the available data to date.
