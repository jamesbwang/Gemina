  Acute lung injury ( ALI) is an acute<symptom> failure<symptom> of the respiratory system with unacceptably high mortality , for which effective treatment is urgently necessary. Infiltrations by immune cells , such as leukocytes and macrophages , are responsible for the inflammatory response in ALI , which is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators in lung tissues exposed to various pathogen-associated molecules such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) from microbial organisms. α-Ketoglutarate ( α-KG) is a key metabolic intermediate and acts as a pro-inflammatory metabolite , which is responsible for LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production through NF-κB signaling pathway.
