  Over the past decade , biopharmaceutical companies have been progressively establishing global frameworks across their capabilities. It is well recognized that the Medical Information ( MI) department is a key externally facing function that needs to maintain a consistent focus on optimizing its capabilities of addressing product medical inquiries worldwide. In the United States , a consortium named Pharma Collaboration for Transparent Medical Information , phactMI , a collaboration of pharmaceutical company MI departments dedicated to supporting health care professionals in their commitment to provide quality patient care , has provided a forum to benchmark and share best practices across the companies. In May 2017 , phactMI conducted a survey inclusive of 25 biopharmaceutical companies to gain insight into the globalization of respective MI departments and relevant trends. We found increased trends in various aspects of globalization across large , mid , and small size companies , and identified key drivers for success. Overall , 16 of the 25 companies had globalized their MI department , 5 had only partially globalized , and the remaining 4 had not globalized. The findings of this survey will further help inform the MI community as to globalization approaches for a successful outcome.
