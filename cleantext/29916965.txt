  Spontaneous pneumomediastinum ( SP) is an uncommon disorder but has been described in cases with connective tissue diseases ( CTDs) , most commonly dermatomyositis and polymyositis. We aimed to explore this relationship by analyzing the characteristics of CTD patients with SP.. Using a computer-assisted search , we identified 25 patients with CTD and SP evaluated between January 1997 and December 2016 at our institution. Clinicoradiologic characteristics , treatment , and outcomes were extracted and chest computed tomography studies analyzed. We identified 25 patients with CTD and SP.. Median ( range) age at SP occurrence was 55 ( 18-82) years , and 60 % of the patients were women. Smoking history was present in 37 %. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was symptomatic in 56 % of patients. Eighteen patients ( 72 %) had a known CTD diagnosis , and 20 patients ( 80 %) manifested radiologic evidence of interstitial lung disease. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosis was achieved with chest radiography in 20 % of cases and chest computed tomography in the other cases. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was managed with expectant observation alone in 22 cases ( 88 %). Four patients ( 16 %) had concomitant pneumothorax , 1 of whom required chest tube drainage. There were no deaths attributable to SP during the median ( range) follow-up of 13 ( 0-174) months. Cumulative survival was 52 % at 1 year and 40 % at 2 years. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon manifestation of CTD and usually occurs in the presence of interstitial lung disease. Although SP seems to be associated with a relatively benign short-term course , occurrence of SP in CTD patients may be a poor prognostic factor.
