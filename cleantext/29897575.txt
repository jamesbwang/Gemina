  Synaptic adhesion molecules play a crucial role in the regulation of synapse development and maintenance. Recently , several families of leucine-rich repeat ( LRR) domain-containing neuronal adhesion molecules have been characterised , including netrin-G ligands , LRRTMs and the synaptic adhesion-like molecule ( SALM) family proteins. Most of these are expressed at the excitatory glutamatergic synapses , and dysfunctions of these genes are genetically linked with cognitive disorders , such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The SALM family proteins SALM3 and SALM5 , similar to SLITRKs , have been shown to bind to the presynaptic receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP) family ligands. Here , we present the 3.1 Ã… crystal structure of the SALM5 LRR-Ig-domain construct and biophysical studies that verify the crystallographic results. We show that SALM1 , SALM3 and SALM5 form similar dimeric structures , in which the LRR domains form the dimer interface. Both SALM3 and SALM5 bind to RPTP immunoglobulin domains with micromolar affinity. SALM3 shows a clear preference for the RPTP ligands with the meB splice insert. Our structural studies and sequence conservation analysis suggests a ligand-binding site and mechanism for RPTP binding via the dimeric LRR domain region.
