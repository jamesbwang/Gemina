  Dao-di herbs have been recognized as `` quality models '' with a firmly stable status. The formation of Dao-di herbs quality is involved from the genetic inheritance on the molecular level to the metabolic phenotype of final products , and the full material-based biosynthetic pathway remains unknown. In recent years , an increasing variety of omics technologies has provided new methods and ideas for the analysis of complex life systems and are suitable for explanation of quality formation in Dao-di herbs as well. In order to alleviate the scarcity of natural resources and offer scientific guidance of transplanting varieties , achievements of omics in the aspects of Dao-di herbs from genetics to phenotyping , the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites , the interaction with human body and the new methods of quality evaluation have been summarized. It will be a fundamental work for protection and utilization of Chinese medicine resources.
