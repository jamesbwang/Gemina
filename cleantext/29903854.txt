  The active debate about the return of incidental or secondary findings in research has primarily focused on return to research participants , or in some cases , family members. Particular attention has been paid to return of genomic findings. Yet , research may generate other types of findings that warrant consideration for return , including findings related to the pathology of donated biospecimens. In the case of deceased biospecimen donors who are also organ and/or tissue transplant donors , pathology incidental findings may be relevant not to family members , but to potential organ or tissue transplant recipients. This paper will describe the ethical implications of pathology incidental findings in the Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx) project , the process for developing a consensus approach as to if/when such findings should be returned , possible implications for other research projects collecting postmortem tissues and how the scenario encountered in GTEx fits into the larger return of results/incidental findings debate.
