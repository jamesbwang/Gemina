  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM) is a complex and relatively common genetic cardiac disease that has been the subject of intense investigation for over 50 years. Most patients with HCM are asymptomatic , but some develop symptoms , often many years after the appearance of electrocardiographic or echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Symptoms due to the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction frequently worsen over time , requiring septal reduction therapy ( SRT) despite optimal medical therapy. Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation ( PTSMA) and surgical myectomy are collectively known as SRT. In this review , we will focus on the emerging concept and practical implication of SRT and the available evidence on either PTSMA or surgical myectomy in the literature.
