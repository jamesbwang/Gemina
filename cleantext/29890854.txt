  Oligopeptide transporter 1 ( PepT1) has been a striking prodrug-designing target. However , the underlying mechanism of PepT1 as a target to facilitate the oral absorption of nanoparticles ( NPs) remains unclear. Herein , we modify Poly ( lactic-co-glycolic acid) ( PLGA) NPs with the conjugates of dipeptides ( L-valine-valine , L-valine-phenylalanine) and polyoxyethylene ( PEG Mw: 1000 , 2000) stearate to facilitate oral delivery of docetaxel ( DTX) to investigate the oral absorption mechanism and regulatory effects on PepT1 of the dipeptide-modified NPs. The cellular uptake of the dipeptide-modified NPs is more efficient than that of the unmodified NPs in the stably transfected hPepT1- Hela cells and Caco-2 cells , suggesting the involvement of PepT1 in the endocytosis of NPs. The internalization of the dipeptide-modified NPs is proved to be a proton-dependent process. Moreover , the L-valine-valine modified NPs with shorter PEG chain exhibit distinct advantages in terms of intestinal permeability and oral absorption , resulting in significantly improved oral bioavailability of DTX. In summary , PepT1 could serve as a desirable target for oral nanoparticulate drug delivery and the dipeptide-modified NPs represent a promising nanoplatform to facilitate oral delivery of hydrophobic drugs with low bioavailability.
