  Insulin is an effective therapeutic for diabetes , and the level of insulin in vivo is directly related to the health of diabetic patients. Traditionally , the concentrations of insulin in vivo were determined by the RIA method. In this study , we developed an LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of human insulin in dog plasma and directly compared the RIA and LC-MS/MS methods. Our LC-MS/MS method exhibited superior accuracy , efficiency and cost-effective for the PK assessment of human insulin. The LC-MS/MS method can quantitate human insulin and canine insulin simultaneously without cross-reactivity , making the analysis more efficient. The LLOQ of our LC-MS/MS method was 38.5 pg/mL , which was necessary to fully describe the PK profiles of endogenous and exogenous insulin in vivo. The direct comparison of PK data obtained from the two methods demonstrated that LC-MS/MS could be an alternative to RIA method and should be widely used for the quantification of insulin drugs , especially in preclinical studies.
