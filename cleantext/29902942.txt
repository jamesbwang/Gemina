  Women during perimenopausal period experience a range of symptoms , which interfere with physical , sexual , and social life. About 65-75 % of symptoms connected with postmenopausal period are vasomotor symptoms ( VMS) , such as hot flushes and night<symptom> sweats<symptom>. Hot flushes are subjective sensation of heat associated with cutaneous vasodilatation and drop in core temperature. It is suspected that VMS are strongly correlated with pulsatile oversecretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) and subsequently luteinizing hormone ( LH). Evidence has accumulated in parallel showing that lack of negative feedback of steroid hormones synthesized in ovary causes overactivation of hypertrophied kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin ( KNDy) neurons , located in infundibular nucleus. Oversecretion of both kisspeptin ( KISS1) and neurokinin B ( NKB) , as well as downregulation of dynorphin , plays dominant role in creation of GnRH pulses. This in turn causes VMS. Administration of senktide , highly potent and selective NK3R agonist , resulted in increase of serum LH concentration , induction of VMS , increase in heart rate , and skin temperature in postmenopausal women. These finding suggest that modulation of KNDy neurons may become new therapeutic approach in the treatment of VMS.
