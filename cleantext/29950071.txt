  In order to optimize the prescription and preparation process of norcantharidin/tetrandrine dual loaded liposomes , the dual drug loaded liposomes were prepared by film dispersion-ultrasonic method using norcantharidin-mesoporous silica nanoparticles （ MSN-NCTD ） and tetrandrine （ Tet ）. With particle size and encapsulation efficiency as comprehensive indexes , the influences of phospholipid cholesterol amount , ultrasonic time and ultrasonic power on prescription process were investigated by orthogonal test; the
