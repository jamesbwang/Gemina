  To assess the oral health-related quality of life ( OH-QoL) in patients under supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT) and the influence of the individual periodontal risk as well as different degrees of adherence during SPT on OH-QoL. 309 patients with at least 5 years of SPT were re-examined. Periodontal risk profile ( according to Lang and Tonetti) was assessed and the adherence to SPT-appointments within the last 30 ( ± 6) months was reviewed for each patient ( fully adherent: adherence to all appointments ± 6 weeks , partially adherent: SPT-interval not extended more than half of the recommended interval , insufficiently adherent: SPT-interval extended more than half of the recommended interval , non-adherent: recommended SPT-interval interruption ≥ 12 months). OH-QoL was measured using the German short-version of the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-G14). Differences between groups ( Mann-Whitney U test , Kruskal-Wallis test) , association between total OHIP-scores and the predictors age , mean periodontal probing depth and oral hygiene parameters were tested ( Spearman 's correlation). A multivariable linear regression model was fitted using all categorical predictors with a univariable p value < .1. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in OHIP-G14 scores for gender , periodontal diagnosis and prosthetic status. Patients with deep periodontal pockets ( ≥ 6 mm) showed significantly higher OHIP-G14 scores compared to patients without deep pockets ( p = .049). Adherence and periodontal surgery were statistically significant predictors for the OHIP-G14 score. OH-QoL of patients under long-term SPT seems to be influenced by periodontal status. Good compliance with SPT-intervals based on the individual periodontal risk profile seems to contribute to a better OH-QoL compared to irregular attendance of SPT.
