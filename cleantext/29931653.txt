  The molting cycle of feathers includes an anagen ( growth) stage , a likely catagen stage where the feather follicles degenerate , and a resting stage where fully grown feathers remain in their follicles and are functional before molting. However , the cytological changes involved in the resting and molting stages are poorly known , so the results of an ultrastructural analysis of these processes in adult chick feathers are presented here. The study showed that the dermal papilla shrinks , and numerous cells present increased heterochromatin and free collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix. Degeneration of the germinal epithelium of the follicle-the papillary collar-occurs with an initial substantial contraction of cells followed by an increase in heterochromatin , vesicle and lipid accumulation , and membrane and organelle degeneration. Desmosomes are still present between degenerating epithelial cells , but ribosomes and tonofilaments disappear. This suggests that cell necrosis<symptom> initially proceeds as a major contraction resembling apoptosis-a process termed necroptosis , which was previously also shown to occur during the formation of barbs and barbules in mature down and pennaceous feathers. This study suggests that , aside from apoptosis , the collar epithelium degenerates due to external factors , in particular the retraction of blood vessels supplying the dermal papilla. In contrast , revascularization of the dermal papilla triggers a new phase of feather growth ( anagen).
