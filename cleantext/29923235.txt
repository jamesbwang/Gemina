  To examine the association between interpersonal relationships , nursing leadership and patient safety culture and the impact on the efficiency of hospitals. Hospitals are still affected by the increased complexity of the treatments offered and by the diverse knowledge of professionals involved , which has made this assistance model ineffective , expensive and unsustainable over time. A qualitative study of 32 professionals from three large hospitals in Southern Brazil was made. Semi-structured interviews , document analysis and analysis of electronic records were used. All the hospitals had infection rates and an average stay higher than their goal. Lack of interpersonal relationships and physicians failing to commit to organisational objectives were demonstrated. Nursing leadership styles are not definitive factors to improving patient safety and efficiency. The flaws in consolidating interpersonal relationships seem to be related to difficulties in consolidating patient safety culture , which prevented hospitals reaching their efficiency indicators. Professionals who work at the patients ' bedside should be involved in the development of strategies , in order to commit them to the organisational objectives. The consolidation of interpersonal relationships of nursing professionals can lead to improvements with medical professionals , with positive impacts on patient safety and efficiency.
