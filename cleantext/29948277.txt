  This review aimed at evaluating the effects of chronic periodontitis<disease> ( CP) treatment with local statins as adjuncts to scaling and root planing ( SRP) , compared with SRP alone or with placebo. Electronic and hand searches were conducted in three databases to select randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing SRP + statins versus SRP alone. Random effects models were conducted to determine the clinical attachment level ( CAL) gain as the primary outcome variable , and probing pocket depth ( PPD) reduction , modified sulcus bleeding index ( mSBI) , and intrabony defect depth ( IBD) as the secondary outcomes. Of the 526 papers identified , 15 articles met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review , and 13 in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant CAL gain ( mean differences ( MD) = 1.84 mm , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.45 to 2.23; p = 0.000) , PPD reduction ( MD = 1.69 mm , 95 % CI = 1.37 to 2.04; p = 0.000) , mSBI change ( MD = 0.70 , 95 % CI = 0.57 to 0.84; p = 0.000) , and IBD ( MD = 1.48 , 95 % CI = 1.30 to 1.67; p = 0.000) attributed to SRP + statin treatment ( 6 months). Within the limitations of this study , the collective evidence emerging from this systematic review and meta-analysis may support the use of locally applied statins as adjuncts to SRP in CP treatment , based on being an easy , low-cost alternative , with lesser adverse effects on bacterial resistance. These results should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians might consider the use of SRP + statins as an adjunct over other alternative approaches , based on the results of the present review. The informed decision should be taken , considering the patient 's values and preferences , and the intervention to be implemented by the clinician.
