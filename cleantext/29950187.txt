  Diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis ( CE) is at present mainly based on imaging techniques. Serology has a complementary role , partly due to the small number of standardized and commercially available assays. Therefore we examined the clinical performance of the SERION ELISA classic Echinococcus IgG test. Using 10 U/ml as a cut-off point , and serum samples from 50 CE patients and 105 healthy controls , the sensitivity and specificity were 98.0 % and 96.2 % , respectively. If patients with other infectious<disease> diseases<disease> were used as negative controls , the specificity decreased to 76.9 % , which causes poor positive predictive values. However , if results between 10 and 15 U/ml are classified as indecisive , the specificity of positive results ( â‰¥ 15 U/ml) increased to 92.5 % without greatly affecting the sensitivity ( 92.0 %). Using this approach in combination with imaging studies , the SERION ELISA classic Echinococcosis IgG test can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of CE.
