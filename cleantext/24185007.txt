  Predictive biomarkers are important for selecting appropriate patients for particular treatments. Comprehensive genomic , transcriptomic , and pharmacological data provide clues for understanding relationships between biomarkers and drugs. However , it is still difficult to mine biologically meaningful biomarkers from multi-omics data. Here , we developed an approach for mining multi-omics cell line data by integrating joint non-negative matrix factorization ( JNMF) and pathway signature analyses to identify candidate biomarkers. The JNMF detected known associations between biomarkers and drugs such as BRAF mutation with PLX4720 and HER2 amplification with lapatinib. Furthermore , we observed that tumours with both BRAF mutation and MITF activation were more sensitive to BRAF inhibitors compared to tumours with BRAF mutation without MITF activation. Therefore , activation of the BRAF/MITF axis seems to be a more appropriate biomarker for predicting the efficacy of a BRAF inhibitor than the conventional biomarker of BRAF mutation alone. Our biomarker discovery scheme represents an integration of JNMF multi-omics clustering and multi-layer interpretation based on pathway gene signature analyses. This approach is also expected to be useful for establishing drug development strategies , identifying pharmacodynamic biomarkers , in mode of action analysis , as well as for mining drug response data in a clinical setting.
