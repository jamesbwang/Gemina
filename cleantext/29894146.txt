  Printed graphene microsupercapacitors ( MSCs) are attractive for scalable and low-cost on-chip energy storage for distributed electronic devices. Although electronic devices have experienced significant scaling to smaller formats , the corresponding miniaturization of energy storage components has been limited , with a typical resolution of ∼ 30 μm for printed graphene patterns to date. Transfer printing is demonstrated here for patterning graphene electrodes with fine line and spacing resolution less than 5 μm. The resulting devices exhibit an exceptionally small footprint ( ∼ 0.0067 mm
