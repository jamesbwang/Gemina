  Developmental research on flexible attentional control in young children has often focused on the role of attention in task-switching in a unimodal context. In real life , children must master the art of switching attention not only between task demands , but also between sensory modalities. Previous study has shown that young children can be efficient at switching between unimodal tasks when the situation allows , incurring no greater task-switching costs than adults. However , young children may still experience a greater demand to shift attention between modalities than older participants. To address this , we tested 4-year-olds , 6-year-olds and adults on a novel cross-modal task-switching paradigm involving multisensory detection tasks. While we found age differences in absolute reaction time and accuracy , young children and adults both exhibited strikingly similar effects in task-switching , modality-shifting , and the interaction between them. Young children did not exhibit a greater attentional bottleneck on either the task level , or on the modality level; thus , the evidence suggests that young children engaged in similar cognitive operations in the current cross-modal tasks to adult participants. It appears that cognitive operations in multisensory task configuration are relatively mature between 4 and 6 years old.
