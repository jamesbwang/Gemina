  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) is associated with several malignancies and autoimmune diseases in humans. The following EBV infection and establishment of latency , recurrences frequently occur resulting in potential viral DNA shedding , which may then trigger the activation of immune pathways. We have previously demonstrated that levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 , which is associated with several autoimmune diseases , are increased in response to EBV DNA injection in mice. Whether other pro-inflammatory pathways are induced in EBV DNA pathobiology remains to be investigated. The complexity of mammalian immune systems presents a challenge to studying differential activities of their intricate immune pathways in response to a particular immune stimulus. In this study , we used
