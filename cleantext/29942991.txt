  This study focused on the potential therapeutic effect of Baicalin on collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) in mice and the underlying mechanisms. Baicalin ( 200 mg/kg) was administrated after the induction of CIA for 42 days. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by arthritic scores , X-rays and assessment of histopathological joint destruction. The production of TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-17 , IL-1β were also measured. The percentage of Th17 cells in splenocytes were determined by flow cytometry analysis. Our results showed that Baicalin treatment attenuated the severity of arthritis<disease> of CIA mice and reduced the levels of several cytokines. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that Baicalin suppressed the expression and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 protein in splenocytes tissue. Moreover , the percentage of Th17 cells in splenocytes also downregulated by Baicalin. Our experiment indicate that CIA mice can be alleviated by Baicalin treatment via inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 signaling and regulation of Th17 cells in mice.
