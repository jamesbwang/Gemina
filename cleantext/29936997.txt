  Adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs) are capable of secreting regenerative growth factors and replacing multiple tissue types. Although current literature suggests that ASCs accelerate wound<disease> healing and reduce scarring , the dose-response relationship has not been adequately investigated in large animals. We sought to establish a porcine model to optimize dose and delivery. Four-centimeter circular , full thickness excisional wounds<disease> were created on the backs of Yorkshire pigs. Fluorescently labeled allogeneic porcine ASCs were injected into the superficial wound<disease> bed and around the wound<disease> perimeter at high ( 3.0 × 10 Labeled ASCs integrated into treated wounds<disease> by 1 wk in a dose-dependent fashion. Epithelial coverage was achieved by 14 d in all wounds<disease>. Wounds<disease> receiving high-dose ASCs exhibited thicker granulating neodermis at 7 d and greater wound<disease> contraction at 14 d. real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed improved collagen 1: collagen 3 ( Col1: Col3) ratio in the medium-dose group and enhanced α-smooth muscle actin in the high-dose group at 14 d. Western blot demonstrated increased cluster of differentiation 31 protein at 2 wk in wounds<disease> receiving > 10 Doses up to 3.0 × 10
