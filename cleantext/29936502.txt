  Infantile hemangiomas ( IH) are frequent ( 4-5 % of the childhood population) benign vascular tumors that involve accumulation , proliferation , and differentiation of aberrant vascular cells. Typically , IH are innocuous and spontaneously disappear , but they represent a potential risk for harmful effects in the body ( e.g. , permanent disfigurement) and health ( e.g. , ulcerations) in some patients. From a serendipitous discovery , the nonselective β-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol ( which blocks β1-adrenoceptors , β2-adrenoceptors , and β3-adrenoceptors) emerged as an alternative therapy to treat this pathology and it quickly became a first-line treatment for IH. Nevertheless , its specific mechanisms of action remain thus far unknown. In this respect , several studies have suggested that β1-adrenoceptors and β2-adrenoceptors play a role in proliferative and angiogenic mechanisms. However , current basic research studies suggest that β3-adrenoceptors could be also involved. Notably , β3-adrenoceptors stimulate multiple intracellular pathways related to vascular function ( e.g. , blood flow , angiogenesis , etc.). This review compiles some lines of evidence suggesting that β3-adrenoceptors may: ( 1) play a role in the pathophysiology of IH and ( 2) represent a potential therapeutic target for IH treatment. Hence , clinical evidence is mandatory to decide whether incorporation of β3-adrenoceptor blockers into the therapeutic armamentarium may increase effectiveness in the treatment of IH and other vascular anomalies.
