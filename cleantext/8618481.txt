  The association of major depressive disorder ( MDD) with myocardial infarction ( MI) and vice versa is not unknown. Depression<symptom> , along with many other systemic factors like atherosclerosis , obesity , diabetes and vascular dysfunction , contributes to the development of adverse cardiac events in the future and , has always been a topic of interest in the fields of cardiology and psychosomatics. We wrote this review article to elaborate this relationship in detail. This article suggests that the individuals with type D personality who already had cardiovascular disease had undergone more serious myocardial damage. In addition , we elucidated the effects of depression<symptom> on sympathetic activity and remodeling of myocardium after MI. The alterations in the neuroendocrine factors , which included the changes in levels of Serotonin ( 5-HT) , Norepinephrine and Corticosterone , also geared towards the changes associated with depression-induced myocardial injury. However , we need more studies in the near future to further dig into this association process. Therefore , we recommend more research to explore the relationship of psychological factors and adverse cardiac outcomes.
