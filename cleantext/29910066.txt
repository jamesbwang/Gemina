  Comparative study between the effect of LSG and LMGB on patients with type 2 DM and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m A prospective comparative study which included 40 obese patients with type 2 DM ( 20 patients were operated for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) and 20 patients for laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass ( LMGB)) , with mean age at LSG group 42.95 ± 7.63 with range of 31-59 years , at LMGB group was 42.9 ± 6.17 with range of 34-58 years. In SG cases; complete remission occurred in 11 patients with percentage of 55 % and failure of remission occurred in 9 patients with percentage of 45 %. No cases developed partial remission in SG cases. In MGB cases; 15 developed diabetic remission with percentage of 75 % ( 11 ( 55 %) patients developed complete remission , 4 ( 20 %) patients developed partial remission). Failure of remission occurs in 5 patients in MGB cases with percentage of 25 %. Based on our results , LSG and LMGB are efficient operations for reducing weight in morbidly obese patients and also in diabetic control in T2DM. LMGB might be superior to LSG in % EWL and T2DM remission after 1.5 year follow up.
