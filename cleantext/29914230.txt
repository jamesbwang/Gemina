  We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a weekly schedule of docetaxel and cisplatin as a first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( R/M HNSCC). In this study , 18 patients with previously diagnosed R/M HNSCC were treated with combination chemotherapy of weekly docetaxel 35 mg/m2 ( day 1 and 8) and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 ( day 1) as first-line chemotherapy , repeated every 3 weeks. Partial response and stable disease were observed in six patients ( 33.3 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 11.1 % to 55.6 %) and six patients ( 33.3 %; 95 % CI , 11.1 % to 55.6 %) , respectively. The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 11.26 months ( 95 % CI , 8.87 to 15.83) and 5.68 months ( 95 % CI , 4.80 to 6.51) , respectively. The major toxicity was grade 1/2 anemia<symptom> ( 50 %). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in one patient ( 5.6 %). Among the non-hematologic toxicities , grade 1/2 hepatotoxicity was most common ( 22.2 %) , and grade 3/4 infection was observed in one patient ( 5.6 %). There was no treatment-related mortality. For patients with R/M HNSCC , a cisplatin and weekly docetaxel regimen showed high efficacy with tolerable toxicity as a first-line treatment.
