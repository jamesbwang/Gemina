  Synthetic cannabinoids ( SCs) are consumed as legal alternative to cannabis and often allow passing drug-screening tests. Their rapid transience on the drug scene , combined with their mostly unknown metabolic profiles , creates a scenario with constantly moving analytical targets , making their monitoring and identification challenging. The development of fast screening strategies for SCs , not directly focused on their chemical structure , as an alternative to the commonly applied target acquisition methods , would be highly appreciated in forensic and public health laboratories. An innovative untargeted metabolomics approach , focused on herbal components commonly used for ` spice ' products , was applied. Saliva samples of healthy volunteers were collected at pre-dose and after smoking herbal components and analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The data obtained , combined with appropriate statistical analysis , allowed to highlight and elucidate two markers ( scopoletin and N,N-bis ( 2-hydroxyethyl) dodecylamine) , which ratio permitted to differentiate herbal smokers from non-smokers. The proposed strategy will allow discriminating potential positives , on the basis of the analysis of two markers identified in the herbal blends. This work is presented as a step forward in SC drug testing , promoting a smart first-line screening approach , which will allow reducing the number of samples to be further investigated by more sophisticated HRMS methods. Graphical abstract The development of an alternative , generic screening methods of synthetic cannabinoids , not directly based on the chemical structure , in order to provide fast response on its potential consumption.
