  To explore the intrinsic connection between activation of classical nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) pathway and gefitinib resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma H1650 cells. Human lung adenocarcinoma H1650 cells were exposed to gefitinib continuously for 60 days to obtain resistant H1650 cells. The expressions of P-IκBα , P-p50 and P-p65 in the cytoplasm or nuclei were detected using Western blotting in human lung adenocarcinoma HCC827 cells , parental H1650 cells and gefitinib-resistant H1650 cells. The effects of gefitinib alone or in combination with PDTC on the survival rate and expressions of NF-κB P-p50 and P-p65 were compared among the 3 cell lines. Gefitinib-resistant H1650 cells showed increased cytoplasmic and nuclear P-IκBα expressions. The expressions of P-p50 and P-p65 differed significantly among the 3 cell line , decreasing in the order of resistant H1650 cells , parental H1650 cells , and gefitinib sensitive HCC827 cell lines ( P < 0.05 or 0.01). Treatment with gefitinib alone resulted in a significantly lower cell inhibition rate in resistant H1650 cells than in the parental H1650 cells ( P < 0.05) and HCC827 cells ( P < 0.01). The resistant H1650 cells had a significantly higher expression of P-p50 and P-p65 than other two cell lines ( P < 0.05). In both the resistant and parental H1650 cells , gefitinib significantly lowered P-p50 and P-p65 expressions ( P < 0.05 or 0.01) , and the combined treatment with gefitinib and PDTC significantly decreased the cell survival rate and further lowered the cytoplasmic and nuclear expressions of P-p50 and P-p65 ( P < 0.01 or 0.01). The activation of classical NF-κB pathway is a key factor contributing to transformation of the parental H1650 cells into gefitinib-resistant cells. Gefitinib combined with PDTC can inhibit P-IκBα production and NF-κB P-p50 and P-p65 activation to suppress the survival of residual H1650 cells and the generation of gefitinib-resistant cells.
