  In addition to its well-known role in pattern vision , light influences a wide range of non-image forming , subconscious visual behaviors including circadian photoentrainment , sleep , mood , learning , and the pupillary light reflex. Each of these behaviors is thought to require input from the M1 subtype of melanopsin-expressing , intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell ( ipRGC). Recent work has demonstrated that the M1 subtype of ipRGC can be further subdivided based on expression of the transcription factor Brn3b. Brn3b-positive M1 ipRGCs project to the olivary pretectal nucleus and are necessary for the pupillary light reflex , while Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) and are sufficient for circadian photoentrainment. However , beyond the circadian and pupil systems , little is known about the projection patterns of M1 ipRGC subtypes. Here we show that Brn3b-positive M1 ipRGCs comprise the majority of sparse M1 ipRGC inputs to the thalamus , midbrain , and hypothalamus. Our data demonstrate that very few brain targets receive convergent input from both M1 ipRGC subpopulations , suggesting that each subpopulation drives a specific subset of light-driven behaviors.
