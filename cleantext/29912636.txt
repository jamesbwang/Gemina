  Nuclear envelopathies/laminopathies yield tissue-specific pathologies , yet arise from mutation of ubiquitously-expressed genes. One possible explanation of this tissue specificity is that tissue-specific partners become disrupted from larger complexes , but a little investigated alternate hypothesis is that the mutated proteins themselves have tissue-specific splice variants. Here , we analyze RNA-Seq datasets to identify muscle-specific splice variants of nuclear envelope genes that could be relevant to the study of laminopathies , particularly muscular dystrophies , that are not currently annotated in sequence databases. Notably , we found novel isoforms or tissue-specificity of isoforms for: Lap2 , linked to cardiomyopathy; Nesprin 2 , linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Lmo7 , a regulator of the emerin gene that is linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Interestingly , the muscle-specific exon in Lmo7 is rich in serine phosphorylation motifs , suggesting an important regulatory function. Evidence for muscle-specific splice variants in non-nuclear envelope proteins linked to other muscular dystrophies was also found. Tissue-specific variants were also indicated for several nucleoporins including Nup54 , Nup133 , Nup153 and Nup358/RanBP2. We confirmed expression of novel Lmo7 and RanBP2 variants with RT-PCR and found that specific knockdown of the Lmo7 variant caused a reduction in myogenic index during mouse C2C12 myogenesis. Global analysis revealed an enrichment of tissue-specific splice variants for nuclear envelope proteins in general compared to the rest of the genome , suggesting that splice variants contribute to regulating its tissue-specific functions.
