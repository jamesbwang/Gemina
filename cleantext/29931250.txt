  To determine the effectiveness of colonic fluid absorption as a route for fluid resuscitation of a major burn. In order to assess the feasibility and performance of colonic resuscitation , the authors compared plasma volume expansion and hemodynamic parameters of animals submitted to colonic or intravenous fluid resuscitation. Twelve anesthetized swine were submitted to a 40 % full thickness flame burn. Thirty minutes later fluid resuscitation was initiated with either intravenous or colonic infusion of crystalloid based on the Parkland formula. This treatment lasted 4.5 hours. The volume of fluid infused was 86 ± 18 ml/kg for the intravenous treatment and 89 ± 14 ml/kg for the colonic treatment. The percentage of fluid absorbed by the colon at the end of the protocol was 30 ± 13 % of the infused fluid. Enteral resuscitation was equally effective in expanding plasma volume at the end of the protocol. Laboratorial and hemodynamic parameters were similar between the two resuscitation strategies throughout the study. Urine output was significantly higher in the intravenous group ( 7.9 ± 4.2 ml/kg/hr vs 0.9 ± 0.3 ml/kg/hr , P = .03). This study demonstrates that colonic infusion of normal saline in a severe burn injury model can restore hemodynamic stability and expand plasma volume to a degree that rivals the effect of direct intravenous infusion for early burn resuscitation in a swine model.
