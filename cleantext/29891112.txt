  Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL) is an aggressive lymphoma with a poor prognosis , for which accurate and timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. Unfortunately , diagnosis of PCNSL can be challenging and a brain biopsy ( gold standard for diagnosis) is an invasive procedure with the risk of major complications. Thus , there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to diagnose and monitor these lymphomas. Currently , liquid biopsies from cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) are used for cytomorphologic and flow cytometric analysis. Recently , new biomarkers such as genetic mutations and interleukins have been identified in these liquid biopsies , further expanding the diagnostic armamentarium. In this review we present an overview of genetic aberrations ( > 70) reported in this unique lymphoma. Of these genes , we have selected those that are reported in ≥ 3 studies. Half of the selected genes are implicated in the NFκB pathway ( CARD11 , CD79B , MYD88 , TBL1XR1 and TNFAIP3) , while the other half are not related to this pathway ( CDKN2A , ETV6 , PIM1 , PRDM1 and TOX). Although this underlines the crucial role of the NFκB pathway in PCNSL , CD79B and MYD88 are at present the only genes mentioned in liquid biopsy analysis. Finally , a stepwise approach is proposed for minimally invasive liquid biopsy analysis and work-up of PCNSL , incorporating molecular analysis. Prioritization and refinements of this approach can be constructed based upon multidisciplinary collaboration as well as novel scientific insights.
