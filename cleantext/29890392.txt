  Nanocomposite materials have provided a wide range of conductivity , sensitivity , selectivity and linear response for electrochemical biosensors. However , the detection of rare cells at single cell level requires a new class of nanocomposite-coated electrodes with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. We recently developed a construct of gold nanoparticle-grafted functionalized graphene and nanostructured polyaniline ( PANI) for high-performance biosensing within a very wide linear response and selective performance. Further , replacing the expensive gold nanoparticles with low-cost silver nanoparticles as well as optimizing the nanocomposite synthesis and functionalization protocols on the electrode surface in this work enabled us to develop ultrasensitive nanocomposites for label-free detection of breast cancer cells. The sensor presented a fast response time of 30 min within a dynamic range of 10- 5 Ã— 10
