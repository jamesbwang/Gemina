  Microvessel density is an indicator of tumor-driven neoangiogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC) have distinct vascular patterns , which are also reflected in their imaging characteristics. Since a significant proportion of HCC are treated without biopsy confirmation , it is essential to discriminate HCC and ICC radiologically. The aim of our study was therefore to compare microvessel density and expression of VEGFR-2 in HCC and ICC , since these data may ultimately help us to better understand their imaging characteristics. Whereas CD31 documents vessel density , VEGFR-2 expression is an indicator of tumor-related neoangiogenesis. CD31 and VEGFR-2 expressing microvessels were quantified on tissue microarrays of 95 resection specimens of HCC and 47 cases of ICC. Microvessel density was evaluated by counting immuno-reactive vascular structures both within the tumor and adjacent liver control tissue , respectively. Further 16 cases of ICC were immunostained for CD31 and VEGFR-2 on full sections. The frequency of VEGFR-2 ( 46.2/ HPF; range 0-150) and CD31 ( 61.2/ HPF; range 2.6-140) expressing vascular structures was significantly increased in HCC compared to adjacent liver parenchyma ( VEGFR-2 33.3/ HPF , range 0-87 , CD31 21.4/ HPF , range 0-78 , both p < 0,001). ICC revealed significantly less VEGFR2-positive microvessels ( 15.4/ HPF; range 2-77) compared to matched control tissue ( 42.3/ HPF; range 4.6-109) , whereas microvessel density with CD31 was comparable between ICC and adjacent liver ( 32.1/ HPF; range 5.3-78 versus 28.0/ HPF; range 5.3-57; p = 0.89). In ICC , the tumor-to-normal microvessel density ratio was 0.38 for VEGFR-2 and 1.24 for CD31. These ratios were nearly identical ( VEGFR: 0.38; CD31: 0,97) for the 16 cases of ICC studied on whole sections , confirming the validity of the TMA approach. In contrast , ratios of VEGFR-2 and CD31 in HCC vs. adjacent liver were significantly higher ( VEGFR: 2.23; CD31: 6.57). Expression of VEGFR-2 by tumor cells was not observed in any of the cases. HCC and ICC differ significantly in their microvessel density , confirming the hypovascular nature of ICC as compared to the hypervascularity of HCC. Of note , inverse tumor-to-normal ratios of microvascular VEGFR-2 expression between the two neoplasms indicate distinct features of neoangiogenesis. Whether these differences can be exploited for improvements in imaging of hepatic tumors and may play a role for anti-angiogenic treatment strategies requires further studies.
