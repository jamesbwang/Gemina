  Statins , which are lipid-lowering agents , have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that may affect the occurrence of various infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. We assessed whether statins increase the risk of herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( HZ) with propensity score-matching. The study was based on the National Health Insurance database and its subset database of the `` medical check-up '' population of South Korea. These cohorts consist of about one million and 570,000 people , respectively , representative of the entire population of South Korea. We identified 103,930 statin users and 430,685 non-statin users. After propensity score-matching , 25,726 statin users and the same number of non-statin users were finally analyzed. The development of HZ was monitored in these matched pairs over the 11 years from 2003 to 2013. Statin users had a significantly higher risk of HZ than non-statin users: hazard ratio ( HR) 1.25 ( 95 % CI , 1.15 to 1.37) ( p < .0001). The risk of HZ associated with statins was especially high in the elderly: HR 1.39 ( 95 % CI , 1.12 to 1.73) in the over 70-year-olds ( p = 0.003) and HR 1.18 ( 95 % CI , 1.00 to 1.39) in the 60-to-69-year-olds ( p = 0.056). Furthermore , there was a significant p for trend in terms of cumulative dose effect between the risk of HZ and the duration of statin use ( p < .0001). These epidemiologic findings provide strong evidence for an association between HZ and statin use , and suggest that unnecessary statins should be avoided.
