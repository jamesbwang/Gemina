  We investigated task-set control processes and chunking in 16 novices and 16 amateur musicians , who produced unimanual rhythms in three experimental conditions: low-level timing tasks required isochronous tapping at constant target durations; sequencing tasks consisted of individual rhythmic patterns comprising multiple target durations; the task-set control condition required alternations between two rhythmic patterns. According to our hierarchical timing control model conditions differed in their task-set control demands necessary to provide rhythm programs for the sequencing of individual intervals. Transitions at predicted chunk boundaries were marked by increased frequencies of sequence errors , relative lengthening of intervals preceding the switch to a new rhythm chunk , and increased variabilities in intervals immediately following a switch. Amateur musicians showed superior timing ( less variability) in complex rhythm tasks. Moreover , they made fewer sequence errors than novices at set-switch points with their error patterns suggesting that they relied on larger chunks compared with novices. Our findings elucidate the time course of task reconfiguration processes in rhythm production<symptom> and the role of chunking in the context of musical skill.
