  We aim to describe trends in antenatal HIV<pathogen> prevalence in India , at a national and regional level from consistent sentinel surveillance sites ( 2003-2015) among Antenatal Clinic ( ANC) attendees. Data were analyzed from a total of 1,885,207 ANC attendees recruited at ANC sites. The consistent sites were grouped by years of initiation ( Group 1: 2003-2005 and Group 2: 2006-2008) and according to six regions. Chi-square test for linear trend was applied to test the statistical significance of the trend. Nationally , at Group 1 sites , HIV<pathogen> prevalence was 0.93 % in 2003 , which declined to 0.36 % in 2015 ( P < 0.001). Similarly , at Group 2 sites , prevalence ranged from 0.25 % to 0.23 % during 2006-2015 ( P > 0.05). The findings suggest that HIV<pathogen> is conclusively declining at old sites , nationally as well as in most of the other regions but increasing in the northern region. At newer sites , the conclusive declining trend is evident only in the southern region. National AIDS response must consider these variations to allow locally appropriate responses to the epidemic.
