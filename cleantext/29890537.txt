  This article describes the sonoelastographic features of the patellar ligament of sound dogs and tests feasibility , reproducibility and repeatability. Clinically healthy medium-to-large breed dogs were enrolled. Sonoelastographic images of the patellar ligaments were obtained in lateral recumbency<symptom> with the stifle flexed by an experienced operator and by a senior veterinary student. The elasticity colour map included red ( soft) , green ( intermediate) and blue ( hard). Tissue elasticity was measured by calculating the percentage of softness with dedicated software. Categorical , qualitative data analysis was performed using a weighted kappa statistic for repeatability and reproducibility. A categorical qualitative assessment was performed based on a grading scale of 1 to 5 ( soft , mostly soft , intermediate , mostly hard and hard). Fourteen clinically normal dogs were considered. A total of 28 patellar ligaments were examined. Overall , 25 of the patellar ligaments were graded as soft or mostly soft and the remaining 3 as intermediate. Repeatability was 86.2 % , with a weighted kappa of 0.64 ( good) , for the well-trained sonographer and 83.3 % , with a weighted kappa of 0.53 ( moderate) , for the senior student. Reproducibility was 86.2 % , with a weighed kappa of 0.65 ( good). Sonoelastography of the canine patellar ligament is a feasible and reproducible technique. Patellar ligaments in clinically normal dogs showed highly elastic biomechanical properties.
