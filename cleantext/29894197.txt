  Superconducting field-effect transitor ( SuFET) and Josephson field-effect transistor ( JoFET) technologies take advantage of electric-field-induced control of charge-carrier concentration to modulate the channel superconducting properties. Despite the fact that the field-effect is believed to be ineffective for superconducting metals , recent experiments showed electric-field-dependent modulation of the critical current ( I
