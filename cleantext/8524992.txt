  Our objective was to investigate the capacity to control a P3-based brain-computer interface ( BCI) device for communication and its related ( temporal) attention processing in a sample of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) patients with respect to healthy subjects. The ultimate goal was to corroborate the role of cognitive mechanisms in event-related potential ( ERP)- based BCI control in ALS patients. Furthermore , the possible differences in such attentional mechanisms between the two groups were investigated in order to unveil possible alterations associated with the ALS condition. Thirteen ALS patients and 13 healthy volunteers matched for age and years of education underwent a P3-speller BCI task and a rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP) task. The RSVP task was performed by participants in order to screen their temporal pattern of attentional resource allocation , namely: ( i) the temporal attentional filtering capacity ( scored as T1 %); and ( ii) the capability to adequately update the attentive filter in the temporal dynamics of the attentional selection ( scored as T2 %). For the P3-speller BCI task , the online accuracy and information transfer rate ( ITR) were obtained. Centroid Latency and Mean Amplitude of N200 and P300 were also obtained. No significant differences emerged between ALS patients and Controls with regards to online accuracy (
