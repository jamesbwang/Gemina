  Ideal diameter for tibial interference screw fixation of the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) graft remains controversial. Tibial graft fixation with screws matching the tunnel diameter vs. one-millimetre oversized screws were compared. In 32 cadaveric porcine tibiae , bovine extensor tendons with a diameter of eight millimetres were fixed in ( I) a primary ACL reconstruction scenario with eight-millimetre tibial tunnels ( pACL) , with eight-millimetre ( pACL-8) vs. nine-millimetre ( pACL-9) screws , and ( II) a revision ACL reconstruction scenario with enlarged tunnels of 10 mm ( rACL) , with 10-mm ( rACL-10) vs. 11-mm ( rACL-11) screws. Specimens underwent cyclic loading with low and high load magnitudes followed by a load-to-failure test. Graft slippage and ultimate failure load were recorded. In comparison with matched-sized screws ( pACL-8) , fixation with oversized screws ( pACL-9) showed with significantly increased graft slippage during cyclic loading at higher load magnitudes ( 1.19 ± 0.23 vs. 1.98 ± 0.67 mm; P = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the two screw sizes in the revision scenario ( rACL-10 vs. rACL-11; P = 0.38). Graft fixation in the revision scenario resulted in significantly increased graft slippage in comparison with fixation in primary tunnels at higher loads ( pACL vs. rACL; P = 0.004). Pull-out strengths were comparable for both scenarios and all screw sizes ( P > 0.316). Matched-sized interference screws provided better ACL graft fixation in comparison with an oversized screw diameter. In revision cases , the fixation strength of interference screws in enlarged tunnels was inferior to the fixation strength in primary tunnels.
