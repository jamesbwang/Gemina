  Many bacteria in biofilm surround themselves by an extracellular matrix composed mainly of extracellular polysaccharide ( EP) , proteins such as amyloid-like fibers ( ALF) and nucleic acids. While the importance of EP in attachment and acceleration of biofilm by a number of different bacterial species is well established , the contribution of ALF to attachment in multispecies biofilm remains unknown. The study presented here aimed to investigate the role of TasA , a precursor for ALF , in cell-cell interactions in dual-species biofilms of Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> Expression of major B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> matrix operons was significantly up-regulated in the presence of S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> during different stages of biofilm formation , suggesting that the two species interacted and modulated gene expression in each other. Wild-type B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> expressing TasA adhered strongly to S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> biofilm , while a TasA-deficient mutant was less adhesive and consequently less abundant in the dual-species biofilm. Dextran , a biofilm polysaccharide , induced aggregation of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and stimulated adhesion to S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> biofilms. This effect was only observed in the wild-type strain , suggesting that interactions between TasA and dextran-associated EP plays an important role in inter-species interactions during initial stages of multispecies biofilm development.
