  The purpose of this work was to obtain ( Formula: see text) factors for microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors in very small ( less than 5 mm) circular fields. We also investigated the impact of possible variations in microDiamond detector design schematics on the calculated ( Formula: see text) factors. Output factors ( OF 's) of 6 MV beams from TrueBeam linac collimated with 1.27-40 mm diameter cones were measured with EBT3 films , microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors as well as calculated ( in water) using Monte Carlo ( MC) methods. Based on EBT3 measurements and MC calculations ( Formula: see text) factors were derived for these detectors. MC calculations were performed for microDiamond detector in parallel and perpendicular orientations relative to the beam axis. Furthermore , ( Formula: see text) factors were calculated for two microDiamond detector models , differing by the presence or absence of metallic pins. The measured OFs agreed within 2.4 % for fields ⩾ 10 mm. For the cones of 1.27 , 2.46 , and 3.77 mm maximum differences were 17.9 % , 1.8 % and 9.0 % , respectively. MC calculated output factors in water agreed with those obtained using EBT3 film within 2.2 % for all fields. MC calculated ( Formula: see text) factors for microDiamond detector in fields ⩾ 10 mm ranged within 0.975-1.020 for perpendicular and parallel orientations. MicroDiamond detector ( Formula: see text) factors calculated for the 1.27 , 2.46 and 3.77 mm fields were 1.974 , 1.139 and 0.982 with detector in parallel orientation , and these factors were 1.150 , 0.925 and 0.914 in perpendicular orientation. Including metallic pins in the microDiamond model had little effect on calculated ( Formula: see text) factors. EBT3 and MC obtained ( Formula: see text) factors agreed within 3.7 % for fields of ⩾ 3.77 mm and within 5.9 % for smaller cones. Including metallic pins in the detector model had no effect on calculated ( Formula: see text) factors. Our results show that microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors can be used in very small ( 1.27-3.77 mm) fields once ( Formula: see text) corrections determined in this work are applied. Expected uncertainty of such measurements will be in the range of 8 % -2.5 %.
