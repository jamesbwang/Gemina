  Drug abuse is an increasing problem among young adults in European countries. We wanted to assess the prevalence of methamphetamine and cannabis use in young people and to ask for their socioeconomic , parental and emotional background. All pupils ( n = 1,087) in the final class of 3 school types (- general school ( in Germany: Hauptschule/Regelschule mit Hauptschulabschluss) class 9 , regular school ( in Germany: Regelschule) class 10 , high school ( in Germany: Gymnasium) class 10) and the first 2 classes of the vocational school ( in Germany: Berufsschule) in the entire rural district of Altenburger Land , a Thuringian county in Germany with a total of 92,344 inhabitants were asked to fill out a 2-page questionnaire. In all , 920 questionnaires could be finally evaluated ( mean age: 16.6 Â± 0.07 years; mode value: 16; maximum range: 13-29). In the entire group , 5.81 % ( 33 females , 20 males) reported the use of methamphetamine , while 42.8 % stated that they have used it only once , the remaining 57.2 % specified that they have used it on a more regular basis , mostly once a month , but 14.2 % had used it almost daily. With regard to the socioeconomic background , 55 % of the parents of the methamphetamine users were employees and 10 % of the parents were in a leading position. This was not different from the non-user group ( p = 0.193). Unemployment of the parents was found in 6.5 % of the methamphetamine users and in 4.7 % of the non-users. Overall , 67.92 % had a basic knowledge of the side effects of this drug. In 55.32 % of the methamphetamine users , the parents lived alone , were divorced or widowed , while this was only 33.1 % in the non-user group. Of all the methamphetamine users , 69 % had friends who also consumed the drug , which may give a hint on the impact of a peer group. In the entire group , 29.84 % were smokers ( female group: 28.47 %; male group 31.25 %) and 25.5 % consumed cannabis. Ecstasy was used by a total of 4.05 % and cocaine by 1.53 %. No participant mentioned that they have used opiates. Among pupils aged about 16 years nearly 6 % reported to have consumed methamphetamine. This group has a middle socioeconomic background. Two factors were strongly associated with methamphetamine usage: a family with only a single parent and friends who were used to taking methamphetamine. The self-perception of users was generally considered to be a disadvantage as compared to the other factors.
