  Valosin-containing protein ( VCP)/ p97/Cdc48 is one of the best-characterised type II cytosolic AAA + ATPases most known for their role in ubiquitin-dependent protein quality control. Here , we provide functional insights into the role of the Leishmania<pathogen> VCP/p97 homologue ( LiVCP) in the parasite intracellular development. We demonstrate that although LiVCP is an essential gene , Leishmania<pathogen> infantum promastigotes can grow with less VCP. In contrast , growth of axenic and intracellular amastigotes is dramatically affected upon decreased LiVCP levels in heterozygous and temperature sensitive ( ts) LiVCP mutants or the expression of dominant negative mutants known to specifically target the second conserved VCP ATPase domain , a major contributor of the VCP overall ATPase activity. Interestingly , these VCP mutants are also unable to survive heat stress , and a ts VCP mutant is defective in amastigote growth. Consistent with LiVCP 's essential function in amastigotes , LiVCP messenger ribonucleic acid undergoes 3 ` Untranslated Region ( UTR)- mediated developmental regulation , resulting in higher VCP expression in amastigotes. Furthermore , we show that parasite mutant lines expressing lower VCP levels or dominant negative VCP forms exhibit high accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and increased sensitivity to proteotoxic stress , supporting the ubiquitin-selective chaperone function of LiVCP. Together , these results emphasise the crucial role LiVCP plays under heat stress and during the parasite intracellular development.
