  To analyze the clinical impact of the Flash glucose monitoring system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII). A 24-week retrospective cohort study in CSII-treated T1DM patients exposed ( 1:1) to the Flash glucose monitoring system vs. self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose ( SMBG). The primary outcome was the difference in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) levels between both groups at the end of the study. Thirty-six patients with a mean age of 38.2 years ( range 22-55) and a mean T1DM duration of 20.9 ± 7.8 years , treated with CSII for 7.1 ± 5.4 years , were enrolled into the study. At the end of the study , mean HbA1c levels improved in patients in the Flash group ( 7.1 ± 0.7 vs. 7.8 ± 1.0 , p = 0.04). Only the Flash group showed a significant decrease in HbA1c levels of -0.4 % ( 95 % CI , -0.6 , -0.2; p = 0.004) during follow-up. Flash patients captured 93.9 % of data through 17.8 ± 9.9 scans daily. In fact , the Flash cohort showed a three-fold increase in daily self-monitoring of glucose , while daily frequency of SMBG decreased during the study ( -1.8 tests/24h ( 95 % CI -3 , -0.7; p = 0.01). No safety issues related to Flash use were recorded. The Flash glucose monitoring system is a novel approach to improve blood glucose control in CSII-treated T1DM patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of this system in CSII-treated T1DM patients.
