  To test the feasibility of two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms ( FFT)- based imaging metrics in differentiating solid , non-macroscopic fat containing , enhancing renal masses using contrast-enhanced CT images. We quantify image-based intratumoral textural variations ( indicator of tumor heterogeneity) using frequency-based ( FFT) imaging metrics. In this Institutional Review Board approved , Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act- compliant , retrospective case-control study , we evaluated 156 patients with predominantly solid , non-macroscopic fat containing , enhancing renal masses identified between June 2009 and June 2016. 110 cases ( 70 %) were malignant RCC , including clear cell , papillary and chromophobe subtypes and , 46 cases ( 30 %) were benign renal masses: oncocytoma and lipid-poor angiomyolipoma. Whole lesions<symptom> were manually segmented using Synapse 3D ( Fujifilm , CT) and co-registered from the multiphase CT acquisitions for each tumor. Pathological diagnosis of all tumors was obtained following surgical resection. Matlab function , FFT2 was used to perform the image to frequency transformation. A Wilcoxon rank sum test showed that FFT-based metrics were significantly ( p < 0.005) different between 1. benign vs malignant renal masses , 2. oncocytoma vs clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 3. oncocytoma vs lipid-poor angiomyolipoma. Receiver operator characteristics analysis revealed reasonable discrimination ( area under the curve > 0.7 , p < 0.05) within these three groups of comparisons. In combination with other metrics , FFT-metrics may improve patient management and potentially help differentiate other renal tumors. Advances in knowledge: We report for the first time that FFT-based metrics can differentiate between some solid , non-macroscopic fat containing , enhancing renal masses using their contrast-enhanced CT data.
