  The presence of carotid atherosclerosis accompanied by coronary artery disease is associated with poor prognosis. A subset of patients who take aspirin continue to have recurrent cardiovascular events , which may be due to aspirin resistance ( AR). Also , carotid plaques may cause turbulent flow which in turn may lead to platelet activation and poor antiplatelet response. In our study , we aimed to show the prevalence of AR and its relationship between high-risk carotid images in young patients with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction ( STEMI). In our study , we included 112 patients younger than 45 years with STEMI. Aspirin response test was evaluated 1 hour after aspirin intake using multiplate platelet function analyzer , and carotid ultrasonography has been performed to determine carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT) and the presence of carotid plaque. We identified 30.3 % AR in young patients with STEMI. Carotid intima-media thickness ( P = .002) , carotid plaque ( P = .012) , and high-risk carotid image ( P = .015) values are significantly high in patients who have AR. Independent of other risk factors , the presence of carotid plaque and being in the high-risk carotid group were associated with 3.7 times and 3.2 times increased odds for AR , respectively. In young patients with STEMI , physicians should be careful about AR , especially in patients who have carotid plaque and thicker CIMT.
