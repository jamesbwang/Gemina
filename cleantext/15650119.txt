  European eel ( Anguilla anguilla) is a euryhaline species , that has adapted to cope with both , hyper- and hypo-osmotic environments. This study investigates the effect of salinity , from a morphological and molecular point of view on European eel larvae reared from 0 to 12 days post hatch ( dph). Offspring reared in 36 practical salinity units ( psu; control) , were compared with larvae reared in six scenarios , where salinity was decreased on 0 or 3 dph and in rates of 1 , 2 or 4 psu/day , towards iso-osmotic conditions. Results showed that several genes relating to osmoregulation ( nkcc2α , nkcc2β , aqp1dup , aqpe) , stress response ( hsp70 , hsp90) , and thyroid metabolism ( thrαA , thrαB , thrβB , dio1 , dio2 , dio3) were differentially expressed throughout larval development , while nkcc1α , nkcc2β , aqp3 , aqp1dup , aqpe , hsp90 , thrαA and dio3 showed lower expression in response to the salinity reduction. Moreover , larvae were able to keep energy metabolism related gene expression ( atp6 , cox1) at stable levels , irrespective of the salinity reduction. As such , when reducing salinity , an energy surplus associated to reduced osmoregulation demands and stress ( lower nkcc , aqp and hsp expression) , likely facilitated the observed increased survival , improved biometry and enhanced growth efficiency. Additionally , the salinity reduction decreased the amount of severe deformities such as spinal curvature and emaciation<symptom> but also induced an edematous state of the larval heart , resulting in the most balanced mortality/deformity ratio when salinity was decreased on 3 dph and at 2 psu/day. However , the persistency of the pericardial<symptom> edema<symptom> and if or how it represents an obstacle in further larval development needs to be further clarified. In conclusion , this study clearly showed that salinity reduction regimes towards iso-osmotic conditions facilitated the European eel pre-leptocephalus development and revealed the existence of highly sensitive and regulated osmoregulation processes at such early life stage of this species.
