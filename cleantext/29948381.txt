  The epidemic of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infections has spread markedly in Yunnan province of China in recent years due to an increase in the number of imported dengue cases. To the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first to report a whole genome sequence and molecular characterization of an imported DENV-4 isolate from Thailand. The current strain , 2013JH285 , has an RNA genome of 10,772 nucleotides that shares 99.0 % nucleotide and 99.7 % amino acid sequence identity with the 2013 Thailand strain CTI2-13. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed that the 2013JH285 strain belongs to genotype I of DENV-4. Recombination analysis suggested that the 2013JH285 strain originated from inter-genotypic recombination of DENV-4 strains. The new complete DENV-4 genome sequence reported here might contribute to further understanding of the molecular epidemiology and disease surveillance of DENV-4 in China.
