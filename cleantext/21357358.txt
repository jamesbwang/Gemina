  Charcot neuroarthropathy is a rare but serious complication of diabetes , causing progressive destruction of the bones and joints of the foot leading to deformity , altered biomechanics and an increased risk of ulceration. Management is complicated by a lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria and an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis. In this review , we consider recent insights into the development of Charcot neuroarthropathy. It is likely to be dependent on several interrelated factors which may include a genetic pre-disposition in combination with diabetic neuropathy. This leads to decreased neuropeptides ( nitric oxide and calcitonin gene-related peptide) , which may affect the normal coupling of bone formation and resorption , and increased levels of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand , potentiating osteoclastogenesis. Repetitive unrecognized trauma due to neuropathy increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( interleukin-1β , interleukin-6 , tumour necrosis<symptom> factor α) which could also contribute to increased bone resorption , in combination with a pre-inflammatory state , with increased autoimmune reactivity and a profile of monocytes primed to transform into osteoclasts- cluster of differentiation 14 ( CD14). Increased blood glucose and loss of circulating Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products ( AGLEPs) , leading to increased non-enzymatic glycation of collagen and accumulation of AGLEPs in the tissues of the foot , may also contribute to the pathological process. An understanding of the relative contributions of each of these mechanisms and a final common pathway for the development of Charcot neuroarthropathy are still lacking.
