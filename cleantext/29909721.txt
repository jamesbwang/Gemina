  This study aims to assess the accuracy of a novel high density surface electromyogram ( SEMG) decomposition method , namely automatic progressive FastICA peel-off ( APFP) , for automatic decomposition of experimental electrode array SEMG signals. A two-source method was performed by simultaneous concentric needle EMG and electrode array SEMG recordings from the human first dorsal interosseous ( FDI) muscle , using a protocol commonly applied in clinical EMG examination. The electrode array SEMG was automatically decomposed by the APFP while the motor unit action potential ( MUAP) trains were also independently identified from the concentric needle EMG. The degree of agreement of the common motor unit ( MU) discharge timings decomposed from the two different categories of EMG signals was assessed. A total of 861 and 217 MUs<pathogen> were identified from the 114 trials of simultaneous high density SEMG and concentric needle EMG recordings , respectively. Among them 168 common ( MUs<pathogen>) were found with a high average matching rate of ( Formula: see text) for the discharge timings. The outcomes of this study show that the APFP can reliably decompose at least a subset of MUs<pathogen> in the high density SEMG signals recorded from the human FDI muscle during low contraction levels using a protocol analog to clinical EMG examination.
