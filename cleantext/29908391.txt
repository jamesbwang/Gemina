  Walking down ramps is a demanding task for transfemoral-amputees and terminating gait on ramps is even more challenging because of the requirement to maintain a stable limb so that it can do the necessary negative mechanical work on the centre-of-mass in order to arrest ( dissipate) forward/downward velocity. We determined how the use of a microprocessor-controlled limb system ( simultaneous control over hydraulic resistances at ankle and knee) affected the negative mechanical work done by each limb when transfemoral-amputees terminated gait during ramp descent. Eight transfemoral-amputees completed planned gait terminations ( stopping on prosthesis) on a 5-degree ramp from slow and customary walking speeds , with the limb 's microprocessor active or inactive. When active the limb operated in its ` ramp-descent ' mode and when inactive the knee and ankle devices functioned at constant default levels. Negative limb work , determined as the integral of the negative mechanical ( external) limb power during the braking phase , was compared across speeds and microprocessor conditions. Negative work done by each limb increased with speed ( p < 0.001) , and on the prosthetic limb it was greater when the microprocessor was active compared to inactive ( p = 0.004). There was no change in work done across microprocessor conditions on the intact limb ( p = 0.35). Greater involvement of the prosthetic limb when the limb system was active indicates its ramp-descent mode effectively altered the hydraulic resistances at the ankle and knee. Findings highlight participants became more assured using their prosthetic limb<symptom> to arrest centre-of-mass velocity.
