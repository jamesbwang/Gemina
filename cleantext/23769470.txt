  Cement augmentation ( CA) of humeral head screws in locked plating of proximal humeral fractures ( PHF) was found to be biomechanically beneficial. However , clinical outcomes of this treatment have not been well evaluated to date. To assess outcomes of locked plating of PHF with additional CA and to compare them with outcomes of conventional locked plating without CA. 24 patients ( mean age , 74.2 ± 10.1 years; 22 female) with displaced PHF were prospectively enrolled and treated with locked plating and additional CA. The Constant score ( CS) , the Simple Shoulder Test ( SST) , and the Simple Shoulder Value ( SSV) were assessed 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Fracture healing and potential complications were evaluated on postoperative radiographs. The CS and complications were compared with the outcomes of a matched group of 24 patients ( mean age , 73.9 ± 9.4 years; 22 female) with locked plating of displaced PHF without CA. At the 3‑month follow-up , the mean CS was 59.9 ± 15.6 points , the mean SST was 7.5 ± 2.7 points , and the mean SSV was 63.9 ± 21.7 %. All scores significantly improved by the 12-month follow-up ( Locked plating of proximal humeral fractures with trauma cement augmentation of humeral head screws could be translated from the ex-vivo lab setting into the clinical situation without additional complications. Locked plating of displaced PHF with additional cement augmentation showed similar clinical outcomes but reduced the rate of early implant-related complications compared to locked plating without additional CA.
