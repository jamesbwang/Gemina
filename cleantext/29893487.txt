  The utility of combined assessment of both frailty and cognitive impairment in hospitalized heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) patients for incremental post-discharge risk stratification , using handgrip strength and Mini-Cog as feasible representative parameters , was investigated. A prospective , single-centre cohort study of older adults ( age ≥ 65) hospitalized for HF being discharged to home was performed. Pre-discharge , grip strength was assessed using a dynamometer ( Jamar hydrolic hand dynamometer , Lafayette Instruments , Lafayette , IN , USA) and was defined as weak if the maximal value was below the gender-derived and body mass index-derived cut-offs according to Fried criteria. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Cog. The presence of impairment was defined as a score of < 2. Outcome measures were all-cause readmission or emergency department visit ( primary) or all-cause mortality ( secondary) at 6 months. A total of 56 patients ( mean age 77 ± 7 years , 73 % male) were enrolled. The majority ( n = 33 , 59 %) had weak grip strength , either with ( n = 5) or without ( n = 28) cognitive impairment. The highest risk for both readmission and mortality occurred in those with weak grip strength and cognitive impairment in combination ( log-rank P < 0.0001 and P = 0.01 , respectively). Patients who are frail by grip strength assessment and cognitively impaired according to severely reduced Mini-Cog performance show the worst midterm post-discharge outcomes after HF hospitalization.
