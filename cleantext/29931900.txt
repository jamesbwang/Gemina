  To investigate the expression of miR-148a in the process of myocardial differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) induced by 5-azacytidine ( 5-aza) and study the effects of miR-148a on myocardial differentiation of hMSCs. The immunofluorescence analysis was used to detect the expressions of the associated mark genes of cardiac specific protein ( α-MHC) in the process of myocardial differentiation of hMSCs induced by 5-aza. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to analysis the expressions of miR-148a and DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1) after myocardial differentiation of hMSCs , respectively. The expression of α-MHC after transfection with synthetic miR-148 mimics and miR-148a inhibitor was examined by Western blot. We used bioinformatics analysis to predict the potential target of miR-148a , and the dual luciferase report gene system was used to verify the predication. After co-transfected with DNMT1 shRNA and miR-148a inhibitors , hMSCs were used to explore the regulatory role and mechnism of miR-148a in the process of myocardial differentiation of hMSCs. α-MHC was increased significantly after induced by 5-azacytidine. miR-148a was increased significantly in cardiomyocyte differentiation of hMSCs , while the gene and protein expression levels of DNMT1 were decreased significantly in this progress ( miR-148a was upregulated in cardiomyocyte differentiation of hMSCs , and miR-148a promoted myocardial differentiation of hMSCs
