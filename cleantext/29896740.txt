  To apply high-throughput sequencing for the detection of potential mutation in a methylmalonic academia pedigree for which no proband was available. For a couple who had previously given birth to an affected child , 14 genes were re-sequenced by high-throughput sequencing. Suspected mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Specific mutations were tested for amniotic fluid sample from the fetus. High-throughput sequencing suggested that the husband has carried a heterozygous mutation of the MUT gene ( Exon 3: c. 729_730insTT; p.Asp244Leufs * 39) , while the wife also carried a heterozygous mutation of the MUT gene ( Exon 5: c. 914T > C; p.Leu305Ser). Both mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Testing of amniotic sample suggested that the fetus has carried neither mutation. Follow-up has found no sign of methylmalonic academia in the neonate. High-throughput sequencing is a sensitive method to screen a bunch of genes in a single test. For autosomal recessive diseases , when no proband is available , carrier testing for both parents with high-throughput sequencing can provide an alternative approach , though great caution should be taken in the setting of prenatal diagnosis.
