  In numerate societies , early arithmetic development is associated with visuospatial working memory , executive functions , nonverbal intelligence , and magnitude-comparison abilities. To what extent do these associations arise from cultural practices or general cognitive prerequisites? Here , we administered tests of these cognitive abilities ( Corsi Blocks , Raven 's Colored Progressive Matrices , Porteus Maze) to indigenous children in remote northern Australia , whose culture contains few counting words or counting practices , and to nonindigenous children from an Australian city. The indigenous children completed a standard nonverbal addition task; the nonindigenous children completed a comparable single-digit addition task. The correlation matrices among variables in the indigenous and nonindigenous children showed similar patterns of relationships , and parallel regression analyses showed that visuospatial working memory was the main predictor of addition performance in both groups. Our findings support the hypothesis that the same cognitive capacities promote competence for learners in both numerate and nonnumerate societies.
