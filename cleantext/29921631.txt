  Increasing access to effective postpartum contraceptive methods can reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and short inter-birth intervals. The need for an additional postpartum visit can be a barrier to women accessing intrauterine contraception after childbirth. Immediate postpartum intrauterine contraception ( PPIUC) provision is known to be safe , but is not routinely available in the UK. Establishing this service requires multidisciplinary support , including from community and maternity stakeholders. The aim of this study was to determine the views of community sexual health providers towards PPIUC implementation. A questionnaire was distributed to attendees at two UK sexual health conferences. Research questions focused on ( 1) views on PPIUC ( 2) perceived role of the sexual health provider in PPIUC service and ( 3) potential challenges anticipated in providing PPIUC aftercare. Free-text boxes were provided for further comment. Analysis was by a mixed methods approach. A total of 240 questionnaires were distributed with 156 completed ( response rate 65 %). Some 128 respondents ( 82 %) felt ` positive ' towards the PPIUC implementation. Most respondents ( 67.9 %) indicated they would be happy to promote PPIUC and provide thread checks. Perceived challenges in providing PPIUC aftercare included staff time , experience in managing clinical issues , and access to ultrasound. Community sexual health providers were positive towards PPIUC implementation , and perceived their role predominantly in the aftercare of women. Several clinical and practical challenges were identified , some of which differ from those previously expressed by other groups. Stakeholder involvement is key to successful implementation of PPIUC , and wider recognition of potential barriers can assist in developing strategies to overcome these.
