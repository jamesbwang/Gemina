  Metastatic bone disease in castrate-resistant prostate cancer risks significant morbidity , including symptomatic skeletal events. We estimated the healthcare resource costs of managing skeletal events. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who died from or were treated palliatively for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer from 2006-2013 at Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal ( Montreal) , Princess Margaret Cancer Centre ( Toronto) , or Vancouver General Hospital ( Vancouver). Of 393 patients , 275 ( 70 %) experienced 833 events ( 85 per 100 patient-years) , with a median ( 95 % confidence interval) time ( months) to first event of 17.6 ( 15.3 , 21.7). The mean metastatic bone disease-related healthcare resource use cost ( 2014 Canadian dollars) estimate for patients without symptomatic skeletal events was $ 9550 and between $ 22 101 ( observed) and $ 34 615 ( adjusted) for patients with at least one event. Fewer patients in Montreal ( 55 %) experienced events compared to Toronto ( 79 %) or Vancouver ( 76 %). Median time ( months) to first event was longer in Montreal ( 25.0 ( 18.5 , 32.6)) than in Toronto ( 14.6 ( 9.7 , 16.8) or Vancouver ( 17.3 ( 14.8 , 24.0)). More patients received bone-targeted therapy in Montreal ( 64 %) and Toronto ( 60 %) than in Vancouver ( 24 %). Bone-targeted therapy was mostly administered every 3-4 weeks in Montréal and every 3-4 months in Toronto. Metastatic bone disease-related healthcare resource use costs for Canadian castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients are high. Symptomatic skeletal events occurred frequently , with the incremental cost of one or more events estimated between $ 12 641 and $ 25 120. Symptomatic skeletal event incidence and bone-targeted therapy use varied considerably between three Canadian uro-oncology centres. An important limitation is that only patients who died from prostate cancer were included , potentially overestimating costs.
