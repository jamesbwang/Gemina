  Mosses are critical components of boreal ecosystems where they typically account for a large proportion of net primary productivity and harbor diverse bacterial communities that can be the major source of biologically-fixed nitrogen in these ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance , we have limited understanding of how microbial communities vary across boreal moss species and the extent to which local site conditions may influence the composition of these bacterial communities. We used marker gene sequencing to analyze bacterial communities associated with seven boreal moss species collected near Fairbanks , AK USA. We found that host identity was more important than site in determining bacterial community composition and that mosses harbor diverse lineages of potential N
