  Highly porous 45S5 bioactive glass-based scaffolds were fabricated by the foam replica technique and coated with collagen by a novel method. After an initial cleaning step of the bioactive glass surface to expose reactive ‚Åª OH groups , samples were surface functionalized by ( 3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTS). Functionalized scaffolds were immersed in a collagen solution , left for gelling at 37 & deg; C , and dried at room temperature. The collagen coating was further stabilized by crosslinking with 1-ethyl-3- ( 3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide ( EDC) and
