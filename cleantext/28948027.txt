  Evidence for long-term translational effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in minority populations is scarce. This article reports long-term outcomes , for up to 10 years , of such an intervention to prevent diabetes in American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN) communities. From January 2006 to July 2016 , the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program implemented the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention among 46 AI/AN health care programs. Enrolled participants underwent a thorough clinical assessment at baseline , after completing the Lifestyle Balance<symptom> Curriculum ( postcurriculum assessment) , and annually thereafter. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between diabetes incidence and postcurriculum weight<symptom> loss<symptom> status<symptom>. Of 8,652 enrolled participants , 65 % finished the postcurriculum assessment. The assessment completion rate diminished over time to 13 % in year 10. Among those with postcurriculum weight measurements , 2,028 ( 36 %) lost > 5 % of their initial weight , 978 ( 17 %) lost 3-5 % , whereas 2,604 ( 47 %) had < 3 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( average weight<symptom> loss<symptom> 3.8 %). Compared with those with < 3 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , participants with > 5 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> had a 64 % ( 95 % CI 54-72) lower risk of developing diabetes during the first 6 years of follow-up , whereas those with 3-5 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> had 40 % ( 95 % CI 24-53) lower risk. Moderate to small weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was associated with substantially reduced long-term risk of diabetes in diverse AI/AN communities. High participant attrition rates and nonoptimal postcurriculum weight<symptom> loss<symptom> are important challenges found in this translational effort implemented in an underserved population.
