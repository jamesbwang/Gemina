  Screen-printed electrodes ( SPEs) are ubiquitous with the field of electrochemistry allowing researchers to translate sensors from the laboratory to the field. In this paper , we report an electrochemically driven intercalation process where an electrochemical reaction uses an electrolyte as a conductive medium as well as the intercalation source , which is followed by exfoliation and heating/drying via microwave irradiation , and applied to the working electrode of screen-printed electrodes/sensors ( termed EDI-SPEs) for the first time. This novel methodology results in an increase of up to 85 % of the sensor area ( electrochemically active surface area , as evaluated using an outer-sphere redox probe). Upon further investigation , it is found that an increase in the electroactive area of the EDI-screen-printed based electrochemical sensing platforms is critically dependent upon the analyte and its associated electrochemical mechanism ( i.e. adsorption vs. diffusion). Proof-of-concept for the electrochemical sensing of capsaicin , a measure of the hotness of chillies and chilli sauce , within both model aqueous solutions and a real sample ( Tabasco sauce) is demonstrated in which the electroanalytical sensitivity ( a plot of signal vs. concentration) is doubled when utilising EDI-SPEs over that of SPEs.
