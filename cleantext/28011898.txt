  Damage to memory circuits may lead to dementia symptoms in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and Parkinson 's disease dementia ( PDD). Recently , deep brain stimulation ( DBS) has been shown to be a novel means of memory neuromodulation when critical nodes in the memory circuit are targeted , such as the nucleus basalis of Meynert ( NBM) and fornix. Potential memory improvements have been observed after DBS in patients with AD and PDD. DBS for the treatment of AD and PDD may be feasible and safe , but it is still preliminary. In this review , we explore the potential role of DBS for the treatment of dementia symptoms in AD and PDD. Firstly , we discuss memory circuits linked to AD and PDD. Secondly , we summarize clinical trials and case reports on NBM or fornix stimulation in AD or PDD patients and discuss the outcomes and limitations of these studies. Finally , we discuss the challenges and future of DBS for the treatment of AD and PDD. We include the latest research results from Gratwicke et al. ( 2017) and compare them with the results of previous relevant studies , and this would be a worthy update of the literature on DBS for dementia. In addition , we hypothesize that the differences between AD and PDD may ultimately lead to different results following DBS treatment.
