  As a traditional Chinese herbal formula , Shengui Sansheng San ( SSS) has been employed for stroke treatment more than 300 years. We hypothesize that SSS extraction is an angiogenic switch in penumbra post-stroke , and corresponding mechanisms are investigated. In present study , rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model ( MCAo) and were treated with low , middle and high doses of SSS extraction. We assessed neurological function and survival rate , and measured infarct volume by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining on day 7 after ischemia. von Willebrand factor ( vWF) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha ( SDF-1α)/ chemokine ( C-X-C motif) receptor 4 ( CXCR4) axis , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)/ VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2) as well as protein kinase B ( AKT)/ mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR)/ hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF-1α) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2) and Notch1 signaling pathways were respectively investigated by immunofluorescence assay or western blotting in vivo and oxygen-glucose-deprived ( OGD) brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMECs); simultaneously , wound<disease> healing of BMECs and tube formation assay were administrated. Compared to MCAo group , SSS extraction could significantly improve neurological functional scores , survival rate and cerebral infarct volume , enhance vWF Our study firstly demonstrates that SSS extraction is an angiogenic switch. Due to suppressed VEGFR2/Notch1 cascades and activated AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signals in BMECs , a feedback loop of angiogenic homeostasis is established. Furthermore , the comprehensive mediations of SDF-1α/ CXCR4 axis , AKT/mTOR/HIF-α , ERK1/2 and Notch1 pathways in penumbra contribute to the improvements of neurological function , survival rate and infarct volume post-stroke.
