  Haloalkane dehalogenases degrade halogenated compounds to corresponding alcohols by a hydrolytic mechanism. These enzymes are being intensively investigated as model systems in experimental and in silico studies of enzyme mechanism and evolution , but also hold importance as useful biocatalysts for a number of biotechnological applications. Haloalkane dehalogenases originate from various organisms including bacteria ( degraders , symbionts , or pathogens) , eukaryotes , and archaea. Several members of this enzyme family have been found in marine organisms. The marine environment represents a good source of enzymes with novel properties , because of its diverse living conditions. A number of novel dehalogenases isolated from marine environments show interesting characteristics such as high activity , unusually broad substrate specificity , stability , or selectivity. In this chapter , the overview of haloalkane dehalogenases from marine organisms is presented and their characteristics are summarized together with an overview of the methods for their identification and biochemical characterization.
