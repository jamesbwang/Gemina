  In the present study , we have constructed an interaction network of 29 antibiotic resistant genes along with 777 interactions in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7. Gene ontology analysis reveals that 94 , 89 and 67 genes have roles in the cellular process , biological process and molecular function respectively. Gene complexes related to tripartite efflux pumps mdtEF-tolC and ABC family efflux pump macAB-tolC play key roles in multidrug efflux systems. It is noteworthy to mention that , 19 genes are involved in multi-efflux pumps and they play a significant role in multidrug resistance ( MDR); while 18 genes are vital for fatty acid synthesis. Interestingly , we found that the four genes arnABCD are involved in both MDR and in fatty acid synthesis. Hence these genes could be targeted for new drug discovery. On the whole , our results provide a detailed understanding of the mode of MDR mechanisms in E.coli O157: H7.
