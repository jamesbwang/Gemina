  Mentors require competence at a diverse array of skills to mentor students during clinical practice. According to the latest evidence , competence at mentoring includes: knowledge , skills and attributes of individual students ' learning objectives , core elements of nursing , learning processes , a reciprocal and trustful relationship , feedback , evaluation , cooperation with stakeholders , and the mentor 's personal qualities. The purpose of the study was to test psychometric properties of a mentor 's competence instrument developed to self-evaluate mentors ' competence at mentoring nursing students in clinical practice. A cross-sectional , descriptive , explorative study design was used. Data were collected from mentors at five university hospitals in Finland in 2016. A total of 576 mentors participated in this study. The instrument was developed through systematic review , experts ' evaluations , and pilot versions of the instrument tested in previous studies. The construct validity and reliability of the instrument were tested using exploratory factor analysis ( EFA) with promax rotation and Cronbach 's alpha. A 10-factor model showed that the instrument has acceptable construct validity. Cronbach 's alpha values for the subscales observed ranged from 0.76 to 0.90. The instrument exhibited acceptable psychometric properties , thereby proving itself a valuable tool for evaluating mentors ' competence at mentoring students. Further assessments of its reliability , validity and generality for measuring mentor 's competence for mentoring students in different contexts and cultures are recommended.
