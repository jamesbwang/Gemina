  Current feeding advice to prevent pediatric obesity focuses on caregiver feeding behaviors. This review integrates newer data showing that child appetitive traits also have a genetic component. Caregiver feeding behaviors robustly correlate with child eating behaviors; however , there is also a strong heritable component. The satiety cascade delineates the biological drive underlying hunger , satiation , and satiety. Innate individual differences exist for the components of the satiety cascade , which may explain the heritability of child eating behaviors. However , given the correlation of caregiver feeding behaviors with child eating behaviors , any etiological model should include both genetic/biological components and environmental. Integrating the biological etiology of child eating behaviors into the current environmental model has implications for tailoring feeding advice which needs to move from a `` one size fits all '' approach to one that is tailored to individual differences in children 's biological drives to
