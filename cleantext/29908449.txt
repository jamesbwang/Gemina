  Based on 2015 annual report of foreign spouse populations were above 507,266 people in Taiwan. Most of them ( 68 %) came from Mainland China , 29 % from south-east Asia. 92 % of foreign spouses were female ( 2015). Therefore , a challenge arises for nursing students to provide care to clients with multiple cultural variations in Taiwan. The study objectives were to explore the related factors of cultural care competence and estimate the effects of a short-term reinforced cultural course. The study used a quasi-experimental design. All participants were investigated to measure that changed in cultural competence before and after the community practice period. Of 95 participants , 46 experimental group students engaged with 3 times workshops. The study was conducted from May to August in 2015 at Southern Taiwan. The study results showed a significantly improvement of transcultural nursing competence from comparing control group with experimental group by ANCOVA analysis ( p < .05). The study approved that the cultural workshop along with the community health nursing practice curriculum might develop students ' transcultural nursing competence. In the future , in order to providing cultural sensitively care , a sustained transcultural curriculum should be advocated at Nursing schools in Taiwan.
