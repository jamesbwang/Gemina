  Obesity is a serious problem among children in Mexico. In 2010 , the government implemented a national food and physical activity policy in elementary schools , to prevent obesity. The goal of this study is to assess the implementation of this policy , using the logic model from a descriptive survey with national representativeness at the elementary school level and based on a stratified cluster design. We used a systematic random sampling of schools ( n = 122) , stratified into public and private. We administered questionnaires to 116 principals , 165 members of the Food and Physical Activity Committees , 132 food school food vendors , 119 teachers , 348 parents. This study evidences a significant deviation in implementation from what had been planned. Our lessons learned are the importance to: base the design/implementation of the policy on a theoretical framework , make programs appealing to stakeholders , select concrete and measurable objective or goals , and support stakeholders during the implementation process.
