  A highly efficient and mild glycosylation reaction between 3,4- O-carbonate glycal and N-tosyl functionalized aliphatic and aromatic amines via palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative allylation is disclosed. A wide range of highly functionalized 2,3-unsaturated Î²- N-glycosides are furnished in good to excellent yields and complete regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. In addition , applications of the glycosyl sulfonamides as the precursor to assemble functional derivatives have also been explored , including glycosylation , dihydroxylation , and nucleophilic addition to the N-glycosides.
