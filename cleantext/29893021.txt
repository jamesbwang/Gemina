  Lowland tropical forests with chronic nitrogen ( N) deposition and/or abundant N-fixing organisms are commonly rich in N relative to other nutrients. The tropical N richness introduces a paradoxical relationship in which many tropical forests sustain high rates of asymbiotic N fixation despite the soil N richness and the higher energy cost of N fixation than of soil N uptake. However , the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Our study aims to test this phenomenon and examine potential mechanisms of nutrient concentrations vs. substrate stoichiometry in regulating N fixation using multiple linear regression models. We hypothesized that the rates of asymbiotic N fixation would be low in an N-rich forest<disease> under N deposition and substrate stoichiometry would explain the variation in N fixation better than nutrient concentrations. We conducted a chronic N-addition experiment in an N-saturated tropical forest<disease> in southern China and measured the N fixation rates , carbon ( C) , N , and phosphorus ( P) concentrations , and stoichiometry in different substrates ( soil , forest<disease> floor , mosses , and canopy leaves). Total N fixation rates were high ( 10.35-12.43 kg N Â· ha
