  The Prototype Willingness Model is a dual-processing ( i.e. , intentional and socially reactive) health-risk behavior model. The socially reactive path includes behavioral willingness , descriptive normative perceptions , and favorable images of individuals who engage in health-risk behavior ( prototype favorability) as important predictors of health behaviors. Individual differences ( such as consideration of future consequences) may potentiate the effects of behavioral willingness on health-risk outcomes , such as marijuana use. Given limited research investigating marijuana use and the Prototype Willingness Model , the goals of the current study were: 1) examine consideration of future consequences and Prototype Willingness Model social reaction pathway variables in relation to behavioral willingness to use marijuana longitudinally; and 2) determine if consideration of future consequences moderated the behavioral willingness-marijuana use relation prospectively. Young adults ( N = 769) from a larger longitudinal study completed baseline and 3 follow-up assessments ( Months 3 , 4 , 5). Behavioral willingness was positively related to a higher likelihood of use , more days having used marijuana , and more consequences prospectively , over and above baseline use. Consideration of future consequences moderated the association between behavioral willingness and hours high in a typical week. These findings support the willingness-behavior association of the Prototype Willingness Model and preliminarily demonstrate consideration of future consequences ' differential impact on behavioral willingness-future marijuana use relation. Intervention and prevention implications are discussed.
