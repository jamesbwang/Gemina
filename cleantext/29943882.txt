  Lamin A/C mutations are generally believed to be associated with a severe prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate disease expression in three affected families carrying different LMNA missense mutations. Furthermore , the potential molecular disease mechanisms of the mutations were investigated in fibroblasts obtained from mutation carriers. A LMNA-p. Arg216Cys missense mutation was identified in a large family with 36 mutation carriers. Disease expression was unusual with a late onset and a favourable prognosis. Two smaller families with severe disease expression were shown to carry a LMNA-p. Arg471Cys and LMNA-p. Arg471His mutation , respectively. LMNA gene and protein expression was investigated in eight different mutation carriers by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , Western blotting , immunohistochemistry , and protein mass spectrometry. The results showed that all mutation carriers incorporated mutated lamin protein into the nuclear envelope. Interestingly , the ratio of mutated to wild-type protein was only 30:70 in LMNA-p. Arg216Cys carriers with a favourable prognosis while LMNA-p. Arg471Cys and LMNA-p. Arg471His carriers with a more severe outcome expressed significantly more of the mutated protein by a ratio of 50:50. The clinical findings indicated that some LMNA mutations may be associated with a favourable prognosis and a low risk of sudden death. Protein expression studies suggested that a severe outcome was associated with the expression of high amounts of mutated protein. These findings may prove to be helpful in counselling and risk assessment of LMNA families.
