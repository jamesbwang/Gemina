  A simple , fast , and cost-effective technique to obtain highly oriented thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystal ( LC) phases using a simple nanoscratching method is presented. Highly aligned linear nanogrooves are fabricated by scratching substrates such as normal , indium tin oxide ( ITO) , curved glasses , and ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate ( PET) film using diamond lapping films. To demonstrate the feasibility of the platform , typical thermotropic and lyotropic LC materials in the nematic phase are used to demonstrate the well-aligned domains along with the resulting scratched nanogrooves. The polarised optical microscopy ( POM) images show excellent dark and bright states depending on the sample rotation , proving that the LC molecules are well aligned. The electro-optical performance of the twisted nematic ( TN) mode LC display fabricated using the nanogrooves is also measured and indicates reliable results compared with that of the conventional device. Indeed , scratch-induced nanogrooves are well generated on the curved substrate and ITO-coated PET film to show versatility of our technique. Our platform can suggest a new nanofabrication way to make various electro-optical devices as well as other patterning applications.
