  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT) is most frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). Whether patients should routinely receive consolidation chemotherapy before proceeding to transplant after achieving first complete remission ( CR1) has been a subject of debate. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the impact of post-remission chemotherapy before allo-HSCT in patients with AML in CR1. Six studies including 1659 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled hazard ratio ( HR) for overall survival was 0.9 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.77-1.05 , P = 0.182) , and the pooled HR for leukemia-free survival was 0.87 ( 95 % CI 0.75-1.0 , P = 0.07). No survival advantage was observed for post-remission chemotherapy before reduced-intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning ( MAC) allo-HSCT for AML in CR1. The pooled relative risk for relapse incidence ( RI) was 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.82-1.28 , P = 0.834). Post-remission chemotherapy before allo-HSCT did not significantly affect the RI in patients with AML in CR1. The analyses revealed no significant benefit of post-remission consolidation chemotherapy in patients who received allo-HSCT. We recommend proceeding to allo-HSCT as soon as CR1 is attained.
