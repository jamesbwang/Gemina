  Evidence supporting the role of nutrition in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) incidence and severity is growing. A comprehensive search of online databases was conducted using relevant keywords to identify human studies including diet and HF. Several plant-based diets have consistently been associated with decreased HF incidence and severity , notably the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) and Mediterranean diets. Several other plant-based dietary patterns , including low-fat diets and the rice diet , also show promise. Higher dietary quality , as assessed using different scores , seems to provide protective qualities. Fruit , vegetables , legumes and wholegrains appear to be beneficial , whereas red/processed meats , eggs and refined carbohydrates appear harmful. Some evidence suggests detrimental effects of dairy products and poultry , but more research is needed. There is observational and interventional evidence that a plant-based diet high in antioxidants , micronutrients , nitrate and fibre but low in saturated/trans fats may decrease the incidence and severity of HF. Potential mechanisms for this include decreased oxidative stress , homocysteine and inflammation<symptom> levels , as well as higher antioxidant defence and nitric oxide bioavailability with gut microbiome modulation. Well-designed randomised , controlled nutrition intervention trials specific to HF are urgently required.
