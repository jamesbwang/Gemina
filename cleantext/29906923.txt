  When a spatially uniform system that displays a liquid-crystal ordering on a two-dimensional surface is confined inside a rectangular box , the liquid crystal direction field develops inhomogeneous textures accompanied by topological defects because of the geometric frustrations. We show that the rich variety of nematic textures and defect patterns found in recent experimental and theoretical studies can be classified by the solutions of the rather fundamental , extended Onsager model. This is critically examined based on the determined free energies of different defect states , as functions of a few relevant , dimensionless geometric parameters.
