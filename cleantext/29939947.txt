J Strength Cond Res 32 ( 7): 1937-1947 , 2018-The purpose of this investigation was to examine kinetic , kinematic , and temporal parameters during vertical jump landings ( VJL) and step-off landings ( STL) from equal heights. Five men ( 25.0 ± 1.6 years; 1.7 ± 0.4 m; 79.7 ± 7.1 kg) and 5 women ( 20.8 ± 1.6 years; 1.6 ± 0.4 m; 68.5 ± 7.1 kg) performed 15 VJL and 15 STL. Paired-samples t-tests ( α = 0.05) compared impact velocity and the times to the first ( F1) and second ( F2) peak vertical ground reaction force magnitudes ( tF1 and tF2) and the end of impact. Two-way analyses of variance ( α = 0.05) compared limb and task differences in F1 , F2 , hip , knee , and ankle joint angles at ground contact , F1 , F2 , and the end of impact , and hip , knee , and ankle joint displacements between contact and F1 , F1 and F2 , and F2 and the end of impact. Impact velocity was not different between STL and VJL , although STL produced a greater F1 and a more rapid tF2. Greater hip , knee , and ankle flexion/dorsiflexion occurred during STL throughout the majority of impact regardless of limb. Lesser hip , knee , and ankle joint displacements occurred during STL regardless of limb between F1 and F2 , whereas greater joint displacement occurred between F2 and the end of impact. Lastly , knee joint angles at ground contact differed between limbs during STL only. Strength and conditioning professionals aiming to improve an athlete 's performance during sport-specific jump landings should consider the likely impact attenuation outcomes before selecting STL or VJL in training.
