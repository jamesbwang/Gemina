  Although studies on the relation between arrhythmias and the action potential duration ( APD) have been carried out , most of them are based only on electrophysiological factors of the heart and lack experiments that consider cardiac mechanical and electromechanical characteristics. Therefore , we conducted this study to clarify the relevance of the shortening of APD of a cell in relation to the mechanical contraction activity of the heart and the associated risk of arrhythmia. The human ventricular model used in this study has two dynamic characteristics: electrophysiological conduction and mechanical contraction. The model simulating electrophysiological characteristics was consisted of lumped parameter circuit that can mimic the phenomenon of ion exchange through the cell membrane of myocyte and consisted of 214,319 tetrahedral finite elements. In contrast , the model simulating mechanical contraction characteristics was constructed to mimic cardiac contraction by means of the crossbridge of a myofilament and consisted of 14,720 hermite-based finite elements to represent a natural 3D curve of the cardiac surface. First , we performed a single cell simulation and the electrophysiological simulation according to the change of the APD by changing the electrical conductivity of the I The APD and the sum of the intracellular Ca The shortening of APD owing to increased electrical conductivity of a protein channel on myocardial cells likely decreases the wavelength and the pumping efficiency of the ventricles. Additionally , it may increase tissue sensitivity to ventricular fibrillation , including reentry , and cause symptoms such as dyspnea<symptom> and
