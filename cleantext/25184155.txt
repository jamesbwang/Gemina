  The Lower<symptom> Silurian Longmaxi Shale in Southeast Chongqing of Sichuan Basin in China is considered to be a potential shale gas reservoir by many scholars in recent years. The special shale gas well , namely , Pengye-1 well , was selected as a case study to evaluate the characteristics of the shale gas reservoir. A series of experiments were performed to analyze the geochemical , mineralogical , and petrophysical features and gas content using samples of the Longmaxi Shale from Pengye-1 well. The results show that the organic and inorganic porosities of these samples are range of 0.08-2.73 % and 0.06-2.65 % , with the average of 1.10 % and 1.76 % , respectively. The inorganic pores primarily contribute to the porosity until the TOC content is more than 3 %. Organic matter plays an important role in adsorbed gas content. The adsorbed gas is dominant in the Longmaxi Shale of Pengye-1 well , which ranges from 0.46 to 2.24 cm3/g , with an average of 1.38 cm3/g. The free gas content ranges from 0.45 to 0.84 cm3/g with an average of 0.68 cm3/g , and is 24.4-49.7 percent of total gas with an average of 37.5 %. The bottom part of the Longmaxi Shale is the most favorable for shale gas exploring , which is higher of brittleness mineral content , porosity and gas content. Compare with the other five shales in America , the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Shale is derived from older sedimentary periods with significantly higher thermal maturity and has experienced several periods of intense tectonic , which are unfavorable for the shale gas enrichment.
