  Hybrid molecules have been developed which are comprised of a tyrosine kinase-targeted , quinazoline-based scaffold and a flexibly linked dia ( m) minechloridoPt ( ii) moiety. The target compounds maintain high affinity and selectivity for ErbB family kinase proteins and one of the derivatives induces platinum adducts with a pharmacologically important cysteine residue.
