  Dysregulation of microRNA ( miRNA) is closely related to cancer development and progression. Our previous study has been identified that miR-129-5p suppresses the proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer cells. In this study , we aimed to explore the target gene of miR-129-5p. We found that CBX4 , a member of CBXs , is a target of miR-129-5p. CBX4 is up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and overexpression of CBX4 promotes cell proliferation , whereas knockdown of CBX4 suppresses cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore , CBX4 mediates miR-129-5p-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and is negatively related to the expression of miR-129-5p. Taken together , our data suggested that CBX4 is an oncogene in breast cancer cells , which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of breast cancer.
