  The second-generation cryoballoon ( CB2) provides effective and durable pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI) associated with encouraging and reproducible clinical outcome data. The latest-generation cryoballoon ( CB3) incorporates a 40 % shorter distal tip , thus allowing for an increased rate of PVI real-time signal recording and facilitating individualized ablation strategies taking the time-to-effect ( TTE) into account. However , whether this characteristic translates into favorable clinical success has not been evaluated yet. Herein was investigated one-year clinical success after CB3 in comparison to CB2 based-PVI. 110 consecutive patients with paroxysmal or short-standing persistent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) underwent CB2 ( n = 55 patients)- or CB3 ( n = 55 patients)- based PVI. The freeze-cycle duration was set to TTE + 120 s if TTE could be recorded , otherwise a fixed freeze-cycle duration of 180 s was applied. A total of 217/218 ( 99 % , CB3) and 217/217 ( 100 % , CB2) pulmonary veins ( PV) were successfully isolated. The real-time PVI visualization rate was 69.2 % ( CB3) and 54.8 % ( CB2; p = 0.0392). The mean freeze-cycle duration was 194 ± 77 s ( CB3) and 206 ± 85 s ( CB2; p = 0.132) , respectively. During a median follow-up of 409 days ( interquartile range ( IQR) 378-421 , CB3) and 432 days ( IQR 394-455 , CB2) 73.6 % ( CB3) and 73.1 % of patients ( CB2) remained in stable sinus rhythm after a single procedure ( p = 0.806). A higher rate of real-time electrical PV recordings was seen using the CB3 as compared to CB2. There was no difference in 1-year clinical follow-up.
