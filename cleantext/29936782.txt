  Objective: The biological characteristics of circulating prostate cells ( CPCs) are probably more important than their mere presence. CD82 is a tumor suppressor , we present the outcome of radical prostatectomy ( RP) in men with CD82 positive CPCs. Methods and Patients: consecutive men treated with RP were studied , age , total PSA , Gleason , stage , the presence of extra-capsular extension , positive surgical margens and infiltration of the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes were registered. Biochemical failure was defined as a PSA > 0.2 ng/ml. Immediately before the RP , 8 ml of venous blood was taken to detect CPCs. Mononuclear cells were separated using differential gel centrifugation and CPCs identified using immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA and anti-CD82. The men were divided into three groups; 1) CPC (-) , 2) CPC ( +) CD82 ( +) and 3) CPC ( +) CD82 (-). The groups were compared with respect to clinical-pathological findings and biochemical free survival using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression models. Results: 285 men , mean age 65.9 years participated , 61 ( 21 %) were CPC (-); 57 ( 20 %) were CPC ( +) CD82 ( +) and 167 ( 59 %) were CPC ( +) CD82 (-). Group 1 had low grade small volume cancer , in Group 2 , low grade but a larger volume than Group 1 and Group 3 high grade cancer. Kaplan Meier biochemical free survival curves at 36 , 60 and 120 months were; Group 1 98 % , 96 % and 90 %; for Group 2 93 % , 93 % and 69 % and for Group 3 62 % , 44 % and 16 % respectively. Conclusions: Kaplan Meier survival curves for Group 1 and Group 2 were similar , although Group 2 men had higher PSA values , more advanced staging but a similar Gleason score. Group 3 men had a worse prognosis. The results support that biological characteristics of CPCs are more important than their mere presence identifying men with a high risk of biochemical failure.
