  To evaluate relevance of clinical and molecular factors in adult low-grade gliomas ( LGG) and to correlate with survival. We reviewed records from adult LGG patients from 1991 to 2015 who received surgery and had sufficient tissue to molecular biomarkers characterization. 213 consecutive LGG patients were included: 17.4 % were low-risk , according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG) risk assessment. IDH 1/2 mutation , 1p/19q co-deletion , MGMT methylation were found in 93 , 50.8 and 65.3 % of patients. Median follow-up was 98.3 months. In univariate analysis , overall survival was influenced by extent of resection ( p = 0.011) , IDH mutation ( p < 0.001) , 1p/19q co-deletion ( p = 0.015) and MGMT methylation ( p = 0.013). In multivariate analysis , RTOG clinical risk ( p = 0.006) , IDH mutation ( p < 0.001) and 1p/19q co-deletion ( p = 0.035) correlated with overall survival. RTOG clinical risk ( p = 0.006) , IDH mutation ( p < 0.001) and 1p/19q co-deletion ( p = 0.035) correlated with overall survival. Both clinical and molecular factors are essential to determine prognosis and treatment strategies.
