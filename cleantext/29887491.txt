  To evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) in children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). Drug-naïve children who met the DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a day care center , specialized in long-term treatment of children and adolescents with ASD. Symptom assessment was performed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC) before ( base-line) and after 12 months ( follow-up) of CBT. Nine boys with a mean age of 6 ( ± 2.0) years were included. Compared to baseline , significant improvements of symptoms of irritability<symptom> ( p = 0.012) , hyperactivity ( p = 0.008) and lethargy<symptom> ( p = 0.008) were observed at follow-up. Results indicate that CBT is an effective therapy for children with ASD. Larger studies are needed to give more details about which symptoms respond best in these patients.
