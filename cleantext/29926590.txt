  To investigate the effects of curcumin on motor function , and to explore the neuroprotective mechanism of curcumin after the spinal cord injury in rats. The study will theoretical and experimental evidence for curcumin 's clinical treatment. HI-0400 spinal cord impactor was used to prepare animal models of acute of spinal cord injury. One hundred and five clean and healthy rats were randomly divide into three groups: sham operation group ( Sham) spinal cord injury group ( SCI) and curcumin group ( SCI+CUR). Intragastric administration was administrated after 30 min of the spinal cord injury model , after 1 time a day , until the death. SCI+CUR group was intragastric administration with curcumin ( 100 mg/kg) of 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose sodium , and Sham and SCI group were treated with the same dose of 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose sodium. The motor function recovery of 3,7,14,21 and 28 days after spinal cord injury were evaluated by basso , beatlie , bresnahan ( BBB) score. The spinal cord tissue and blood samples were collected at postoperative 12 h , 1 d , 3 d and 7 d respectively , NF-kappa B was detected by immunofluorescence , Bcl-2 , Bax and Caspase-3 were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by Elisa. The statistic difference of BBB score between SCI group and CUR group in 3 day was not statistically significant. It was found that the 7,14,21 and 28 days BBB score in CUR group were statistically significant higher than that in SCI group ( Curcumin can promote the recovery of hindlimb motor function after spinal cord injury in rats.The mechanism is through inhibition of NF-K B to prevent inflammation<symptom>; And inhibition the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 , and promotion the expression of Bcl-2 to prevent apoptosis , so as to accelerate the recovery of motor function in the rats after spinal cord injury.
