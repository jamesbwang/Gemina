  While several empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) have been developed , these treatments are neither widely available nor universally efficacious. This pilot , proof of concept study evaluated a computerized imaginal exposure Script-Driven Imagery Training ( SDI-T) for individuals with elevated trauma reactivity. The training was supplemented with two forms of linguistic processing , affect labeling ( SDI-T + AL) and distraction ( SDI-T + D) , to determine whether linguistic inhibitory regulation augmented the effects of SDI-T. Participants ( n = 64) with trauma-related distress were randomized to SDI-T , SDI-T + AL , or SDI-T + D. Physiology and self-reported trauma distress were measured at pre- and post-training. The training was acceptable to participants and effective at reducing self-reported distress ( d = -0.41) , and physiological activation from pre- to post-training ( d = -0.49 , ps < .01) , with some evidence that linguistic processing ( SDI-T + AL and SDIT-T + D) conferred a benefit over SDI-T. The linguistic processing groups had significantly steeper reduction in physiology relative to the non-linguistic processing group ( p < .05 , d = 0.59). There was no benefit of SDI-T + AL over SDI-T + D. This pilot study provides initial support for the acceptability and efficacy of computerized imaginal exposure training for PTSD. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.
