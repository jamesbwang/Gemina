  To explore the therapeutic outcome and significance of preoperative percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) via the central venous catheter in combination with two-step hard ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the treatment of ureteral stones in the middle-upper segment. The success rate and the occurrence of severe infection and perirenal hematoma were analyzed retrospectively in 37 patients who received preoperative PCNL via the central venous catheter in combination with two-step hard ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the treatment of ureteral stones in the middle-upper segment in our hospital between July 2012 and November 2014. The operation duration was 12-38 min with a mean of 18.5 min. The procedure was performed successfully in all patients without the postoperative occurrence of perirenal hematoma in any patient. No severe infection occurred in any patient according to the Surviving Sepsis<disease> Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis<disease> ( 2012). Preoperative PCNL via the central venous catheter can significantly improve the success rate of ureteroscopic lithotripsy for the treatment of ureteral stones in the middle-upper segment , and reduce postoperative occurrences of severe infection and perirenal hematoma.
