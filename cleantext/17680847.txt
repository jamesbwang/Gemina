  In patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT) , baseline malnutrition and its progression have been shown to be associated with a poor outcome. We conducted this study to determine the variation in four blood test parameters including serum albumin level ( ALB) , creatinine ( Cre) , hemoglobin ( Hb) and platelet ( Plt) during CCRT for stage III esophageal cancer patients and its effect on patients ' outcome. One hundred eighty-three patients diagnosed with stage III esophageal cancer were retrospectively investigated. In addition to known prognostic factors , baseline level of the four blood test parameters and their variation at day 105 ( ΔALB , ΔCre , ΔHb and ΔPlt , respectively) were analyzed. The median observation period for patients who survived was 57.2 months , and the 5-year overall survival rate was 35.6 % ( 95 % CI 34.2-36.9 %). In multivariate analyses , baseline ALB ( ≥ 3.6 g/dL) , higher ΔALB ( ≥ + 0.3 g/dL) were independent predictors for overall survival ( p = 0.001 and < 0.001 , respectively) , in addition to other clinical factors including T stage and overall treatment time ( OTT). For disease-free survival , ΔALB was only a predictor in hematological parameters ( p = 0.001) in addition to T stage and OTT. No hematological and clinical parameters had significant correlation with local control in multivariate analysis. Furthermore , ΔALB showed significant correlation with OS and DFS in log-rank test ( p = 0.002 and 0.002 , respectively). Our results suggest improvement in ALB after treatment might be a favorable prognostic factor in esophageal cancer patients treated by CCRT.
