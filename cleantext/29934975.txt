  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) comprises a group of neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in social interactions , interpersonal communication , repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and may be associated with intellectual disabilities. The description of ASD as a synaptopathology highlights the importance of the synapse and the implication of ion channels in the etiology of these disorders. A narrative and critical review of the relevant papers from 1982 to 2017 known by the authors was conducted. Genome-wide linkages , association studies , and genetic analyses of patients with ASD have led to the identification of several candidate genes and mutations linked to ASD. Many of the candidate genes encode for proteins involved in neuronal development and regulation of synaptic function including ion channels and actors implicated in synapse formation. The involvement of ion channels in ASD is of great interest as they represent attractive therapeutic targets. In agreement with this view , recent findings have shown that drugs modulating ion channel function are effective for the treatment of certain types of patients with ASD. This review describes the genetic aspects of ASD with a focus on genes encoding ion channels and highlights the therapeutic implications of ion channels in the treatment of ASD.
