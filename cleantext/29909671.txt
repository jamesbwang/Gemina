  Introduction In 2014 our centre started a dedicated clinic for developmental dysplasia of the hip ( DDH). The aim of the clinic was to streamline DDH referrals , enabling timely review , imaging and multidisciplinary treatment. Ongoing audit has been carried out based on the UK National Screening Committee newborn and infant physical examination ( NIPE) guidelines , first published in 2008. Methods A three-year prospective audit was undertaken between 2014 and 2016 assessing compliance with NIPE standards ( ST2b and ST2d) relating to timeliness of expert consultation following positive ultrasonography findings of DDH with positive examination or risk factors. Results A total of 257 babies born between January 2014 and December 2016 were seen in our dedicated DDH clinic , with 106 with abnormalities on ultrasonography and 54 requiring treatment. Compliance with ` expert consultation within 4 weeks of age for babies with an abnormality detected on clinical examination and positive ultrasonography ' improved from 50 % in 2014 to 53 % in 2015 and 71 % in 2016. Compliance with ` expert consultation within 8 weeks of age for babies with positive risk factors , negative examination and positive ultrasonography ' improved from 65 % in 2014 to 93 % in 2015 and 100 % in 2016. Conclusions This prospective audit assessing timeliness of expert consultation has demonstrated ongoing improvements between 2014 and 2016. A greater proportion of babies with ultrasonography evidence of DDH have been seen at the appropriate time. In the majority of cases , this has enabled timely non-invasive treatment with a Pavlik harness rather than surgery.
