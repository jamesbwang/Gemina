  Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) is a noninvasive diagnostic technique providing cross-sectional images of biologic structures based on the differences in tissue optical properties. OCT has been widely used in numerous clinical applications and is becoming popular as a promising technology in dentistry. Today , dental hard ( tooth) and soft ( hard palate mucosa and gingiva mucosa) tissues are visualized with OCT.. With new developments in technology , the applications of OCT are being investigated in various fields in dentistry , such as to detect microleakage around restoration , tooth cracks/fractures , examination of periodontal tissues/pockets , early detection of oral cancerous tissues , and in endodontics for location of pulp canal.
