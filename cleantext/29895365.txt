  In this study , live weight , live weight gain , plasma GPx , GR , LDH , ALT activities , triglyceride , total protein , albumin and LPO levels , also liver and brain SOD and GPx activities were investigated after administration of boron ( 0.10 , 0.20 and 0.30 mg/day) into male mice with drinking water for 60 days. Blood albumin and triglyceride levels were not affected with boron ( p > 0.05) where triglyceride levels , with increasing amounts of boron , displayed a slight decrease within the normal ranges. From the antioxidant-oxidant balance<symptom> parameters , LPO and GR levels were not affected from boron , where GPx activity was increased significantly ( p < 0.001) comparing the groups of boron and control. LDH and ALT activities were affected significantly ( p < 0.001) with decreased ALT and increased LDH levels with increasing amounts of boron. In regards of liver and brain GPx and SOD activities , significant increases were determined. Liver GPx and SOD activities were increased within the groups with the increasing amount of boron , where in brain , SOD ( p < 0.05) was affected significantly but GPx ( p > 0.05) displayed a gradual insignificant increase. As regards live weight gain , a gradual increase was determined during experimental period , but only the 45th day , the increase was statistically significant ( p < 0.05). It is suggested that , new studies on the effects of different doses and compounds of boron in laboratory animals in regards of antioxidant and metabolic effects may be helpful for the understanding of the subject.
