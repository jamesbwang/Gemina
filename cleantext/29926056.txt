  Inspired by the excellent device performance of triindole-based semiconductors in electronic and optoelectronic devices , the relationship between the solid-state organization and the charge-transporting properties of an easily accessible series of triindole derivatives is reported herein. The vacuum-evaporated organic thin-film transistors ( OTFTs) exhibited a non ideal behaviour with a double slope in the saturation curves. Moreover , the treatment of the gate insulator of the OTFT device with either a self-assembled monolayer ( SAM) or a polymer controls the molecular growth and the film morphology of the semiconducting layer , as shown by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) analyses , atomic force microscopy ( AFM) and theoretical calculations. N-Trihexyltriindole exhibited the best device performance with hole mobilities up to 0.1 cm2 V-1 s-1 at the low VG range and up to 0.01 cm2 V-1 s-1 at high VG , as well as enhanced Ion/Ioff ratios of around 106. The results suggest that the non-ideal behaviour of the here studied OTFT devices could be related to the higher interfacial disorder in comparison to that in the bulk.
