  The cardiovascular benefits of regular exercise are well established. A mortality benefit has clearly been demonstrated for those that participate in light and moderate exercise. Less is known regarding the long-term effects of vigorous regular running over an extended period. In recent years , myocardial fibrosis<disease> , arrhythmias , and coronary artery calcium have been demonstrated in high-intensity exercisers. However , the prognostic implication of these findings remains unknown , and thus , there is insufficient evidence , and potentially not a need , to recommend a maximal running dose or limit for healthy individuals who already train intensively. For those otherwise healthy individuals who wish to run for cardiovascular health benefits , following the standard guidelines of 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 min of vigorous exercise weekly is recommended. Prevention and screening remain as key to lowering morbidity and mortality in all individuals.
