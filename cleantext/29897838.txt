  Compassion fatigue<symptom> among health care professionals has negative effects on patient care. Providing end-of-life care , hospice nurses may be particularly at risk for compassion fatigue<symptom>. The purpose of this study was to investigate self-esteem and affect as mediators between psychological distress and compassion fatigue<symptom> among hospice nurses ( N = 90). Hospice nurses working in a health care setting were recruited to complete a survey. Multiple mediation analysis was used to explore associations between variables of interest. Psychological distress was associated with greater compassion fatigue<symptom> and had an indirect effect on compassion fatigue<symptom> through lower self-esteem and higher negative affect , but not through positive affect. Among hospice nurses , psychological distress may reduce self-esteem and create negative feelings , thereby increasing the risk of compassion fatigue<symptom>. Interventions that target both the cognitive and affective links between psychological distress and compassion fatigue<symptom> may be most effective.
