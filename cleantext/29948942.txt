  Ischemia-reperfusion injury ( I/R injury) is a common feature of ischemic stroke which occurs when blood supply is restored after a period of ischemia. Although stroke is an important cause of death in the world , effective therapeutic strategies aiming at improving neurological outcomes in this disease are lacking. Various studies have suggested the involvement of different mechanisms in the pathogenesis of I/R injury in the nervous system. These mechanisms include oxidative stress , platelet adhesion and aggregation , leukocyte infiltration , complement activation , blood-brain barrier ( BBB) disruption , and mitochondria-mediated mechanisms. Curcumin , an active ingredient of turmeric , can affect all these pathways and exert neuroprotective activity culminating in the amelioration of I/R injury in the nervous system. In this review , we discuss the protective effects of curcumin against I/R injury in the nervous system and highlight the studies that have linked biological functions of curcumin and I/R injury improvement.
