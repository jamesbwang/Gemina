  Unlike lower organisms , mammals have 2 C-terminal binding protein ( Ctbp) isoforms , Ctbp1 and Ctbp2. Ctbp2 is revealed as a key factor involved in determining cell fate decisions by regulating the epigenetic state in active embryonic stem cell ( ESC) genes. However , the molecular mechanism underlying how Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 have different roles remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Ctbp isoform abundance is important for mouse embryonic ESCs ( mESCs) to exit from pluripotency. Temporal expression patterns of Ctbp isoforms were quite different; Ctbp2 is more highly expressed in mESCs and decreases during differentiation , while Ctbp1 is constantly expressed at a lower level. Ctbp2 knockdown , but not Ctbp1 knockdown , in mESCs resulted in impaired exit from pluripotency. Interestingly , Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 overexpression in Ctbp2-knockdown mESCs leads to exiting from pluripotency in a manner similar to that of wild-type mESCs. Quantification of Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 revealed that differentiation ability correlates with abundance of Ctbp isoform in undifferentiated mESCs , suggesting that a sufficient amount of Ctbp isoform is a prerequisite for exiting from pluripotency. The results support the contention that 2 redundant Ctbp isoforms regulate elaborate differentiation via temporally distinctive regulatory patterns in mESCs.-Suh , M. Y. , Kim , T.
