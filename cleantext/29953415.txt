  The circadian clock is a fundamental and pervasive biological program that coordinates 24-hour rhythms in physiology , metabolism and behaviour , and it is essential to health. Whereas time-of-day adapted therapy is increasingly reported to be highly successful , it needs to be personalized since internal circadian time is different for each individual. In addition , internal time is not a stable trait , but is influenced by many factors including genetic predisposition , age , gender , environmental light levels and season. An easy and convenient diagnostic tool is currently missing. To establish a validated test , we followed a three-stage biomarker development strategy: ( i) using circadian transcriptomics of blood monocytes from 12 individuals in a constant routine protocol combined with machine learning approaches , we identified biomarkers for internal time; ( ii) these biomarkers were migrated to a clinically relevant gene expression-profiling platform ( NanoString) , and ( iii) externally validated using an independent study with 28 early or late chronotypes. We developed a highly accurate and simple assay ( BodyTime) to estimate the internal circadian time in humans from a single blood sample. Our assay needs only a small set of blood-based transcript biomarkers and is as accurate as the current gold standard dim light melatonin onset method at smaller monetary , time and sample number cost. The BodyTime assay provides a new diagnostic tool for personalization of healthcare according to the patient 's circadian clock.
