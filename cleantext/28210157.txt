  Gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract. In order to investigate a new treatment fot GIST , we hypothesized the effect of miR-374b targeting PTEN gene-mediated PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway on proliferation and apoptosis of human gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST) cells. We obtained GIST tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 143 patients with GIST to measure the levels of miR-374b , PTEN , PI3K , Akt , caspase9 , Bax , MMP2 , MMP9 , ki67 , PCNA , P53 and cyclinD1. Finally , cell viability , cell cycle and apoptosis were detected. According to the KFGG analysis of DEGs , PTEN was involved in a variety of signaling pathways and miRs were associated with cancer development. The results showed that MiR-374b was highly expressed , while PTEN was downregulated in the GIST tissues. The levels of miR-374b , PI3K , AKT and PTEN were related to tumor diameter and pathological stage. Additionally , miR-374b increased the mRNA and protein levels of PI3K , Akt , MMP2 , MMP9 , P53 and cyclinD1 , suggesting that miR-374b activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in GIST-T1 cells. Moreover , MiR-374b promoted cell viability , migration , invasion , and cell cycle entry , and inhibited apoptosis in GIST cells. Taken together , the results indicated that miR-374b promotes viability and inhibits apoptosis of human GIST cells by targeting PTEN gene through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus , this study provides a new potential target for GIST treatment.
