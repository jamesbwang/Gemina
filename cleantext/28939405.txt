  Gemcitabine resistance is currently the main problem of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. The resistance is thought to be caused by altered drug metabolism or reduced apoptosis of cancer cells. However , the underlying mechanism of Gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study , we established Gemcitabine resistant PANC-1 ( PANC-1-GR) cell lines and compared the circular RNAs ( circRNAs) profiles between PANC-1 cells and PANC-1-GR cells by RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed circRNAs were demonstrated using scatter plot and cluster heatmap analysis. Gene ontology and pathway analysis were performed to systemically map the genes which are functionally associated to those differentially expressed circRNAs identified from our data. The expression of the differentially expressed circRNAs picked up by RNAseq in PANC-1-GR cells was further validated by qRT-PCR and two circRNAs were eventually identified as the most distinct targets. Consistently , by analyzing plasma samples form pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) patients , the two circRNAs showed more significant expression in the Gemcitabine non-responsive patients than the responsive ones. In addition , we found that silencing of the two circRNAs could restore the sensitivity of PANC-1-GR cells to Gemcitabine treatment , while over-expression of them could increase the resistance of normal PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cells , suggesting that they might serve as drug targets for Gemcitabine resistance. Furthermore , the miRNA interaction networks were also explored based on the correlation analysis of the target microRNAs of these two circRNAs. In conclusion , we successfully established new PANC-1-GR cells , systemically characterized the circRNA and miRNA profiles , and identified two circRNAs as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for Gemcitabine non-responsive PDAC patients.
