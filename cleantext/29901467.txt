  Nurses who provide care in the community to women with a history of repeated incarceration may struggle to understand the full extent of the barriers faced by this population and as a result risk giving suboptimal care to an already underserved group. This narrative inquiry study of stories told by 10 women with histories of repeated incarceration fulfilled 2 purposes: to demonstrate how women 's shelter-seeking stories exposed uniquely complex patterns of health opportunity and risk and to demonstrate how storytelling might serve as an informative mode of nursing health assessment for this population.
