  Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) results suggest that true memories , but not false memories , activate early sensory cortex. It is thought that false memories , which reflect conscious processing , do not activate early sensory cortex because these regions are associated with nonconscious processing. We posited that false memories may activate the earliest visual cortical processing region ( i.e. , V1) when task conditions are manipulated to evoke conscious processing in this region. In an fMRI experiment , abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation during encoding. During retrieval , old shapes were presented at fixation and participants characterized each shape as previously on the `` left '' or `` right '' followed by an `` unsure ''- `` sure ''- `` very sure '' confidence rating. False memories for spatial location ( i.e. , `` right ''/ left or `` left ''/ right trials with `` sure '' or `` very sure '' confidence ratings) were associated with activity in bilateral early visual regions , including V1. In a follow-up fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) experiment that employed the same paradigm , we assessed whether V1 activity was necessary for false memory construction. Between the encoding phase and the retrieval phase of each run , TMS ( 1 Hz , 8 min) was used to target the location of false memory activity ( identified in the fMRI experiment) in left V1 , right V1 , or the vertex ( control site). Confident false memories for spatial location were significantly reduced following TMS to V1 , as compared to vertex. The results of the present experiments provide convergent evidence that early sensory cortex can contribute to false memory construction under particular task conditions.
