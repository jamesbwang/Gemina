  Photodynamic therapy ( PDT) is a therapeutic modality that has shown effectiveness in the inactivation of cancer cell lines and microorganisms. Treatment consists of activating the photosensitizer ( PS) upon light irradiation of adequate wavelength. After reaching the excited state , the PS can handle the intersystem conversion through energy transfer to the molecular oxygen , generating reactive oxygen species. This especially applies to singlet oxygen (
