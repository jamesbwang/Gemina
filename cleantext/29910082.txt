  The case concerns an 81-year-old woman on treatment with a topical fixed combination of timolol and brimonidine who was diagnosed in the Emergency Department with acute anterior granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. The patient responded favourably to the withdrawal of the eye drops without showing any subsequent relapse. Uveitis due to brimonidine is a rare adverse effect , but it must be known. Once the diagnosis is suspected , the effective treatment is the withdrawal of brimonidine , with or without the addition of topical corticosteroids to control inflammation<symptom> depending on the severity of the condition. It is a process with an excellent prognosis.
