  Copper-doped zeolite imidazole framework-8 ( Cu/ZIF -8) is prepared and its peroxidase-like oxidative catalytic activity is examined with a demonstration of its applicability for cancer cell imaging. Through simple solution chemistry at room temperature , Cu/ZIF -8 nanocrystals are produced that catalytically oxidize an organic substrate of o-phenylenediamine in the presence of H2O2. In a similar manner to peroxidase , the Cu/ZIF -8 nanocrystals oxidize the substrate through a ping-pong mechanism with an activation energy of 59.2 kJ Â· mol-1. The doped Cu atoms work as active sites in which the active Cu intermediates are expected to be generated during the catalysis , whereas the undoped ZIF-8 does not show any oxidative activity. Cu/ZIF -8 nanocrystals exhibit low cell toxicity and display catalytic activity through interaction with H2O2 among various reactive oxygen species in a cancer cell. This oxidative activity in vitro allowed cancer-cell imaging exploiting the photoluminescence emitted from the oxidized product of o-phenylenediamine , which was insignificant in the absence of the Cu/ZIF -8 nanocrystals. The results of this study imply that the Cu/ZIF -8 nanocrystal is a promising catalyst for the analysis of the microbiological systems.
