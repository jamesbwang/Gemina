  Bisphenol A ( BPA) , a well-known xenoestrogen , is ubiquitously utilized in manufacturing of polycarbonated plastics. Convincing evidence suggests that BPA induces neurotoxicity and certain behavioral deficits. α-Lipoic acid ( ALA) supplementation has shown protective effect against heart and liver diseases , diabetes , and neurological debility associated with aging. We studied the neuromodulatory effect of ALA against neurotoxicity of BPA in vitro in C8-D1A mouse astrocyte cell line and in vivo in C57BL/6J male mice. In vitro ALA ( 100 μM) protected cells from BPA ( 30 μM)- induced reactive oxygen species generation and increased activity of glial fibrillary acidic protein. ALA showed reduction in cell death in astrocytes treated with BPA. In vivo ALA ( 50 mg/kg) increased the neurospecific acetylcholinesterase activity and decreased the monoamine oxidase activity altered by BPA exposure ( 10 mg/kg , per os x 30 days). In addition to neuroprotective effects , ALA also showed protective effects against BPA-induced oxidative stress. We observed that ALA significantly replenished the declined neurobehavioral and cognitive performances , decreased muscle coordination and alerted short-term recognition memory in mice exposed to BPA. Our results suggest that ALA has a promising role in modulating BPA-induced neurotoxicity in C8-D1A mouse astrocyte cells as well as neurochemical and neurobehavioral deficits in C57BL/6J male mice and its antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities may in part be responsible for such an effect.
