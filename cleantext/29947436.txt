  What is the central question of this study? Does inspiratory resistance breathing improve tolerance to simulated haemorrhage in individuals with elevated internal temperatures? What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that inspiratory resistance breathing modestly improves tolerance to a simulated progressive haemorrhagic challenge during heat stress. These findings demonstrate a scenario in which exploitation of the respiratory pump can ameliorate serious conditions related to systemic hypotension<symptom>. Heat exposure impairs human blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control and markedly reduces tolerance to a simulated haemorrhagic challenge. Inspiratory resistance breathing enhances blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control and improves tolerance during simulated haemorrhage in normothermic individuals. However , it is unknown whether similar improvements occur with this manoeuvre in heat stress conditions. In this study , we tested the hypothesis that inspiratory resistance breathing improves tolerance to simulated haemorrhage in individuals with elevated internal temperatures. On two separate days , eight subjects performed a simulated haemorrhage challenge ( lower-body negative pressure ( LBNP)) to presyncope after an increase in internal temperature of 1.3 ± 0.1 °C. During one trial , subjects breathed through an inspiratory impedance device set at 0 cmH
