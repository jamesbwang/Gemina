  Here , we report efficient composition-tunable Cu-doped ZnInS/ZnS ( core and core/shell) colloidal nanocrystals ( CNCs) synthesized by using a colloidal non-injection method. The initial precursors for the synthesis were used in oleate form rather than in powder form , resulting in a nearly defect-free photoluminescence ( PL) emission. The change in Zn/In ratio tunes the percentage incorporation of Cu in CNCs. These highly monodisperse Cu-doped ZnInS CNCs having variable Zn/In ratios possess peak emission wavelength tunable from 550 to 650 nm in the visible spectrum. The quantum yield ( QY) of these synthesized Cd-free CNCs increases from 6.0 to 65.0 % after coating with a ZnS shell. The CNCs possessing emission from a mixed contribution of deep trap and dopant states to only dominant dopant-related Stokes-shifted emission are realized by a careful control of stoichiometric ratio of different reactant precursors during synthesis. The origin of this shift in emission was understood by using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence ( TRF) spectroscopy studies. As a proof-of-concept demonstration , these blue excitable Cu-doped ZnInS/ZnS CNCs have been integrated with commercial blue LEDs to generate white-light emission ( WLE). The suitable combination of these highly efficient doped CNCs results led to a Commission Internationale de l'Enclairage ( CIE) color coordinates of ( 0.33 , 0.31) at a color coordinate temperature ( CCT) of 3694 K , with a luminous efficacy of optical radiation ( LER) of 170 lm/W
