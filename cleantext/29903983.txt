  Advanced glycation end products ( AGEs) could interact with the receptor for AGE ( RAGE) as a sterile danger signal to induce inflammation<symptom>. 4 & prime;- methoxyresveratrol ( 4 & prime; MR) , a polyphenol derived from Dipterocarpaceae , has not been studied for its anti-inflammation effects. In the present study , we sought to explore the protective role of 4 & prime; MR in AGEs-induced inflammatory model using RAW264 .7 macrophages. 4 & prime; MR significantly inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , such as interleukin 1 & beta; ( IL-1 & beta ;-RRB- , interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF- & alpha ;-RRB- and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1) , as well as two typical pro-inflammatory enzymes , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX2). Besides , 4 & prime; MR significantly decreased oxidative stress , demonstrated by levels of ROS production , protein carbonyl and advanced oxidation protein product via down-regulation of NADPH oxidase. Further analysis showed that 4 & prime; MR attenuated the RAGE overexpression induced by MGO-BSA. It also blocked the downstream signal of AGE-RAGE , particularly , MAPKs including p38 and JNK , and subsequently reduced NF- & kappa; B activation. Additionally , 4 & prime; MR significantly abated the activation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3) inflammasome including NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 and reduced the secretion of mature IL-1 & beta;. Taken together , our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of 4 & prime; MR is mainly through suppressing RAGE-mediated MAPK/NF- & kappa; B signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 4 & prime; MR could be a novel therapeutic agent for inflammation-related diseases.
