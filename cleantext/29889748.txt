  To evaluate efficacy , endometrial safety , and overall safety of a single-capsule 17Î²-estradiol-progesterone ( TX-001HR) for treating menopausal moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. REPLENISH was a phase 3 , 12-month , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial. Women ( aged 40-65 years) with vasomotor symptoms and a uterus were randomized to daily estradiol ( mg)- progesterone ( mg) ( 1/100 , 0.5/ 100 , 0.5/ 50 , or 0.25/ 50) , and women in the vasomotor symptoms substudy ( women with moderate-to-severe hot flushes ( seven or greater per day or 50 or greater per week)) to those estradiol-progesterone doses or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was endometrial hyperplasia<disease> incidence at 12 months in all women ( the total population) , and the primary efficacy endpoints were frequency and severity changes ( from daily diaries) in moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms with estradiol-progesterone compared with placebo at weeks 4 and 12 in the vasomotor symptoms substudy. A sample size of 250 women in each active treatment arm with two or less endometrial hyperplasia<disease> cases would result in 1 % or less annual incidence ( upper bound 2.5 % or less , one-sided 95 % CI). One thousand eight hundred forty-five women were enrolled and randomized from August 2013 to October 2015; 1,835 received medication ( safety population); 1,255 were eligible for the endometrial safety population; 726 comprised the vasomotor symptoms substudy; their mean age and body mass index were 55 years and 27 , respectively; one third were African American. No endometrial hyperplasia<disease> was found. Frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms significantly decreased from baseline with 1 mg estradiol and 100 mg progesterone and 0.5 mg estradiol and 100 mg progesterone compared with placebo at week 4 ( frequency: by 40.6 and 35.1 points ( 1 mg and 100 mg and 0.5 mg and 100 mg , respectively) vs 26.4 points ( placebo); severity: by 0.48 and 0.51 vs 0.34 points) and week 12 ( by 55.1 and 53.7 vs 40.2; severity: by 1.12 and 0.90 vs 0.56); 0.5 mg estradiol and 50 mg progesterone improved ( P < .05) frequency and severity at week 12 , and 0.25 mg estradiol and 50 mg progesterone frequency but not severity at weeks 4 and 12. No endometrial hyperplasia<disease> was observed while single-capsule estradiol-progesterone provided clinically meaningfully improvements in moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. This estradiol-progesterone formulation may represent a new option , using naturally occurring hormones , for the estimated millions of women using nonregulatory-approved , compounded hormone therapy.
