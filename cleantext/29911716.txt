  Using molecular dynamics simulation , we study the impact of the degree of supercooling on the crystal nucleation of ultra-soft particles , modeled with the Gaussian core potential. Focusing on systems with a high number density , our simulations reveal dramatically different behaviors as the degree of supercooling is varied. In the moderate supercooling regime , crystal nucleation proceeds as expected from classical nucleation theory , with a decrease in the free energy of nucleation , as well as in the size of the critical nucleus , as supercooling is increased. On the other hand , in the large supercooling regime , we observe an unusual reversal of behavior with an increase in the free energy of nucleation and in the critical size , as supercooling is increased. This unexpected result is analyzed in terms of the interplay between the glass transition and the crystal nucleation process. Specifically , medium range order crystal-like domains , with structural features different from that of the crystal nucleus , are found to form throughout the system when the supercooling is very large. These , in turn , play a pivotal role in the increase in the free energy of nucleation , as well as in the critical size , as the temperature gets closer to the glass transition.
