  Quite a lot of research is available on the relationships between survey response scales ' characteristics and the quality of responses. However , it is often difficult to extract practical rules for questionnaire design from the wide and often mixed amount of empirical evidence. The aim of this study is to provide first a classification of the characteristics of response scales , mentioned in the literature , that should be considered when developing a scale , and second a summary of the main conclusions extracted from the literature regarding the impact these characteristics have on data quality. Thus , this paper provides an updated and detailed classification of the design decisions that matter in questionnaire development , and a summary of what is said in the literature about their impact on data quality. It distinguishes between characteristics that have been demonstrated to have an impact , characteristics for which the impact has not been found , and characteristics for which research is still needed to make a conclusion.
