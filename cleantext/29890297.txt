  This focus article addresses the issue of the proper use of terminology in pain research. A review and some revisions on the definitions of pain and nociception , in relation to consciousness<symptom> is presented. From a behavioral viewpoint , it is argued that pain is a conscious assessment of the failure of the organism to protect the body from injury ( actual or potential); while continuously-ongoing sub/pre-conscious nociceptive processes protect the body from injuries. Thus , pain perception/behavior requires a subjective ability to evaluate the environment and form coordinated responses. Yet , too often our literature conflates the two concepts , resulting in a confusion<symptom> that impacts on society. The issue is especially topical as the US Senate has been voting a bill called: Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The title of the bill itself does not make sense , if we adhere to the strict definitions commonly accepted in our field. Thus , this article concludes with a plea to properly constrain the narrative with which we describe our research , and minimize potential abuse of the science of pain for political interests. Perspective The focus article goes over the classic definitions of pain and nociception; incorporates novel concepts recently advances as to their functional differentiation; and is a plea for our research and clinical society to adhere to the proper use of these terms to minimize misinterpretation by society at large.
