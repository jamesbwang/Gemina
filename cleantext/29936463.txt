  Adipocyte gene expression is altered in obese individuals through multiple metabolic and biochemical pathways. In this study , we aimed to examine the expression of resistin ( Retn) , amylin ( Iapp) , and dopamine receptor domain 5 ( Drd5) genes previously suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity , albeit controversially. We also aimed to determine the effects on short and long-term mRNA levels of these genes in obese mice , induced with high-fat diet ( HFD). Two obesity models were created in our study: group T1 ( 20 mice) was fed with HFD ( 60 % fat) for 3 months , and group T2 ( 20 mice) was fed with HFD ( 60 % fat) for 6 months. The control group T0 ( 20 mice) was fed with a diet of 10 % kcal fat supplement for 6 months. At the end of the experiment , their adipose tissues were dissected surgically. Tissue samples of each group were pooled for RNA isolation , cDNA synthesis was carried out and the mRNA levels were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum resistin levels were measured using multiplex bead ( luminex) technology for validation. In T2 mice , the mRNA expression of Retn showed a moderate up-regulation ( fold change = 8.32; p = 0.0019) in the adipose tissues. Iapp expression was also significantly up-regulated ( fold change = 9.78; p = 0.012). Moreover , a 6.36-fold up-regulation for Drd5 was observed in the adipose tissues of T2 mice ( p < 0.001). At the same time , serum levels of resistin were found to be high in T1 and T2 mice compared to the control group ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.024 , respectively). Our study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the genetic markers considered to play a role in adipogenesis were different in short- and long-term obesity models formed in C57BL/6J mice using HFD.
