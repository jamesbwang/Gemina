  Hyper-accumulator biomass , Pteris vittata L. , was hydrothermally converted into bio-oils via hydrothermal liquefaction ( HTL) in sub-supercritical water. The distributions and characterizations of various products as well as energy recovery under different temperatures ( 250-390 °C) were investigated. The highest bio-oil yield of 16.88 % was obtained at 350 °C with the hydrothermal conversion of 61.79 % , where the bio-oil was dominated by alcohols , esters , phenols , ketones and acidic compounds. The higher heating values of bio-oil were in the range of 19.93-35.45 MJ/kg with a H/C ratio of 1.26-1.46 , illustrating its high energy density and potential for use as an ideal liquid fuel. The main gaseous products were CO
