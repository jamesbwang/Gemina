  An index of biomarkers derived from dietary factors ( diet-biomarker-related index) identifies foods and nutrients that encompass physiological potentials and provides scientific evidence for dietary patterns that increase the risk of disease associated with specific biomarkers. Although men and women have different dietary patterns and physiological characteristics , sex is not often considered when investigators develop a diet-biomarker-related index. We aimed to review whether epidemiological studies developed diet-biomarker-related indices in a sex-specific way. We systematically searched for epidemiological studies that developed diet-biomarker-related indices , including ( i) biomarker prediction indices that include dietary factors as explanatory variables and ( ii) dietary patterns to explain biomarker variations , in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. We qualitatively reviewed the sex consideration in index development. We identified seventy-nine studies that developed a diet-biomarker-related index. We found that fifty-four studies included both men and women. Of these fifty-four studies , twenty-nine ( 53 路 7 %) did not consider sex , eleven ( 20 路 3 %) included sex in the development model , seven ( 13 路 0 %) considered sex but did not include sex in the development model , and seven ( 13 路 0 %) derived a diet-biomarker-related index for men and women separately. A list of selected dietary factors that explained levels of biomarkers generally differed by sex in the studies that developed a diet-biomarker-related index in a sex-specific way. Most studies that included both men and women did not develop the diet-biomarker-related index in a sex-specific way. Further research is needed to identify whether a sex-specific diet-biomarker-related index is more predictive of the disease of interest than an index without sex consideration.
