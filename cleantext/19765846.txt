  This is a dosimetric comparative study intended to establish appropriate low-to-intermediate dose-constraints for the rectal wall ( R Ten prostate cancer patients , simulated with and without an ERB , were planned to receive 36.25 Gy ( 7.25 Gyx5) to the planning treatment volume ( PTV) and 32.5 Gy to the urethral planning risk volume ( uPRV). Reference plans with and without the ERB , optimized with respect to PTV and uPRV coverage objectives and the organs at risk dose constraints , were further optimized using a standardized stepwise approach to push down dose constraints to the R Vm Further optimization to the R
