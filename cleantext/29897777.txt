  Computationally guided semirational design has significant potential for improving the aggregation kinetics of protein biopharmaceuticals. While improvement in the global conformational stability can stabilize proteins to aggregation under some conditions , previous studies suggest that such an approach is limited , because thermal transition temperatures ( T
