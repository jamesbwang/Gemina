  Integrin-linked kinase ( ILK) has emerged as a critical adaptor and mediator protein in cell signaling pathways that is commonly deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). This has led to the expectation that therapeutic targeting of ILK may be a useful option in treating leukemia<disease>. Although ILK can regulate many cellular processes , including cell differentiation , survival , migration , apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , its role in promoting AML is still unclear. However , its ability to mediate phosphorylation and regulate the important hematopoietic stem cell regulators protein kinase B ( AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² supports ILK as an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. In this review , we summarize the existing knowledge of ILK signaling and its impact on cytokines , paying particular attention to the relevance of ILK signaling in AML. We also discuss the rationale for targeting ILK in the treatment of AML and conclude with perspectives on the future of ILK-targeted therapy in AML.
