  First mentioned almost 100 years ago , neuroresearch has linked microglia to the initiation and/or maintenance of most central nervous system pathologies. Since their discovery , we learned that the microglia immune status is often correlated directly to their morphology. However , only recently , have we realized that , in vivo microglia are extremely dynamic cells capable to respond within minutes. Therefore , the name `` resting '' microglia is replaced slowly with surveilling microglia. Even more recent , it has been shown that microglia change their morphology and/or immune status depending on the way the tissue is obtained , processed and imaged , making labeling microglia , based on their morphology alone , as active or surveying even more difficult. All these observations correlated with a better understanding of cellular and subcellular process that microglia undergo in pathological conditions , could have profound implications on the time window and/or targets used to ensure the best outcome , when treating brain disease.
