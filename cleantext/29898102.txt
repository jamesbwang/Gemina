  We described the karyotypes of five snake taxa from Argentina: Erythrolamprus almadensis , E. ceii , E. poecilogyrus caesius , E. p. schotti and E. p. sublineatus , and also intergrading individuals between the last two subspecies by conventional staining , chromosome bandings and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH) with 28S ribosomal DNA probes. Erythrolamprus ceii and E. almadensis share a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 28 , whereas in E. poecilogyrus intraspecific variations were observed: E. p. caesius has 2n = 28 , E. p. schotti and E. p. sublineatus as well as in the intergrading individuals have 2n = 32. In E. almadensis and E. p. caesius , the 2nd and 6th chromosome pairs respectively are heteromorphic by size , morphology and C-banding pattern. These results allow us to suggest that these chromosome pairs might be considered as the ZW sex chromosomes in these species. The present comparative cytogenetic analyzes contributes to the already remarkable karyotypic variability in Erythrolamprus genus and propose a hypothesis about potential mechanisms involved in the chromosome evolution among taxa analyzed. Furthermore , the karyotypic differences observed between E. p. caesius ( 2n = 28) and E. p. schotti and E. p. sublineatus ( 2n = 32) might play a causal role in speciation.
