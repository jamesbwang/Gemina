  Liquid phase exfoliation of 2D materials has issues related to the sorption of the solvent , the oxidation of the sample during storage , and the topographical inhomogeneity of the exfoliated material. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( NMP) , a common solvent for black phosphorus ( BP) exfoliation , has additional drawbacks like the formation of by-products during sonication and poor solvent volatility. Here we demonstrate an improvement in the topographical homogeneity ( i.e. thickness and lateral dimensions) of NMP-exfoliated BP flakes after resuspension in acetone. The typical size of monolayers and bilayers stabilised in acetone was 99.8 ± 27.4 nm and 159.1 ± 57 nm , respectively. These standard deviations represent a threefold improvement over those of the NMP-exfoliated originals. Phosphorene can also be exfoliated directly in acetone by very long ultrasonication. The product suspension enjoys the same dimensional homogeneity benefits , which confirms that this effect is an intrinsic property of the acetone-BP system. The quality and stability of the exfoliated flakes was checked by XRD , TEM , electron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Thermal expansion coefficients of the ( Formula: see text)
