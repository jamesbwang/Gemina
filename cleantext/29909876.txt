  To evaluate the current practice of companies and agencies to assess the changes made in aligning regulatory and health technology assessment ( HTA) stakeholders; to identify areas of commonality of evidentiary requirements that could occur; and to identify strategic issues and trends of regulatory and HTA synergy. Two separate questionnaires were developed to assess stakeholders ' perceptions on regulatory and HTA alignment , one for pharmaceutical companies and the other for regulatory and HTA agencies. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Seven regulatory and 8 HTA agencies from Australia , Canada , and Europe and 19 international companies developing innovative medicine responded to the survey. This study provided a snapshot of the current regulatory and HTA landscape. Changes made over the past 5 years were reflected in three main areas: there is an increasing interaction between regulatory and HTA agencies; current conditional regulatory approvals are not always linked with flexible HTA approaches; and companies are more supportive of joint scientific advice. Four types of evidentiary requirements were identified as building blocks for better alignment: acceptable primary end points , inclusion of an active comparator , use of patient-reported outcomes , and choice and use of surrogate end point. The study showed that the gap between regulatory and HTA requirements has narrowed over the past 5 years. All respondents supported synergy between regulatory and HTA stakeholders , and the study provided several recommendations on how to further improve evidentiary alignment including the provision of joint scientific advice , which was rated as a key strategy by both agencies and companies.
