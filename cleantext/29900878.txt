  Volatile organic compound ( VOC) profiles emitted in trace concentrations from bacteria or cells has gained increasing importance over the decades. Analysis of VOCs in the headspace does not interfere with in vitro systems and , therefore , offers new options for non-invasive monitoring of cultures. Currently there is not any available standardized in vitro sampling system which considers effects of dilution and contamination onto ppbV to pptV VOC concentrations during. In this study a new in vitro system for online and offline headspace measurement of biological cultures was designed. The system was built from inert materials , equipped with universal sampling ports and easily adjustable volume options. Standard VOC mixtures in the system were analyzed by means of proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and needle-trap-microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with a variance of 5 % -14 % and 10 % -15 % , respectively. In a proof of concept setup volatile emissions over cell cultures and pure media were assessed. The newly developed system enabled reliable and reproducible headspace analyses of in vitro cultures. As parallel application of different analytical methods is possible and confounding factors could be minimized , this set-up represents an important step towards standardization of headspace analysis over biological cultures.
