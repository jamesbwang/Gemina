  An epidermoid cyst<symptom> is a benign tumor , accounting for 0.2-1.8 % of all brain tumors. Histologically , an epidermoid cyst<symptom> has a wall consisting of squamous epithelium with keratinization and without skin components. An epidermoid cyst<symptom> tends to develop in the cerebellopontine angle ( CPA) , middle cranial fossa , pituitary fossa , spinal cord , and other locations. We describe a rare case of malignant transformation of an epidermoid cyst<symptom> with cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) dissemination. A 54-year-old man was referred to our hospital with chief complaints of dysesthesia of the right leg , persisting for 6 months , and dizziness<symptom> and dysarthria<symptom> for 2 months. Magnetic resonance ( MR) imaging showed multiple neoplastic lesions<symptom> with lobulated margins in the left frontal and temporal lobes , left cerebellum , right brainstem , and right CPA. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed a hyperintense cord-like lesion<symptom> in the right CPA. Blood examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) antigen positivity; however , systemic examination revealed no neoplastic lesion<symptom> , except for the head lesion<symptom>. Intracranial lesions<symptom> were considered unlikely to be metastatic brain tumors. We performed surgical removal of the tumor in the left CPA via a left lateral suboccipital craniotomy. The histopathological diagnosis was SCC. MR imaging for the headache<symptom> was taken at another hospital 2 years before the surgery , revealed an epidermoid cyst<symptom> in the right CPA. The current MR imaging showed enhancement in part of the epidermoid cyst<symptom> in the right CPA , strongly suggesting that the epidermoid cyst<symptom> in the right CPA had disseminated to the left frontal and temporal lobes , left cerebellum , and right brainstem via the CSF.
