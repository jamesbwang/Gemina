  Microscopic smear examination is the most common test in tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) detection. It is , however , not strong enough to identify TB in the majority of afflicted individuals; thus , a significant number of TB patients are smear negative and capable of transmitting the infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of smear-negative TB in northwest Iran. In this cross-sectional study , 329 TB-confirmed patients were evaluated through culture up to March 1 , 2015 , in northwest Iran. The demographic and clinical features of the smear-negative and smear-positive TB patients were compared. The Ï‡2 test was used to compare the frequency of the variables. All the statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS , version 16 ( Chicago , IL , USA). Seventy-five cases were smear negative and 254 were smear positive. Smokers , asthmatics , and extra-pulmonary TB patients were primarily among the smear-negative cases. The rate of mortality was also relatively higher among the smear-negative TB patients. Totally , 22.8 % of the TB cases in northwest Iran were smear negative , with a relatively higher rate of mortality than those with positive smears. A delay in these patients ' return to TB diagnosis and treatment centers increases the chance of transmission to others. This is a very sensitive issue in centers where there is no equipment for TB cultivation. Thus , it is essential to equip centers without TB cultivation facilities and to use appropriate diagnostic techniques in centers with those facilities to help rapidly detect smear-negative cases.
