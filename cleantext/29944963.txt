  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) surgery is a highly effective weight-loss intervention that often reduces preference and intake of high-energy foods. Research into the neural mechanisms behind this shift has mainly focused on reward processing of food cues. However , the ability to successfully control food intake and thereby weight-loss also depends on inhibitory control capacity. We investigated whether RYGB leads to alterations in neural inhibitory control in response to food cues. A food-specific go/no-go task with pictures of high-energy ( desserts) and low-energy foods ( vegetables) , was used to assess neural inhibition responses before and after RYGB with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data from 18 morbidly obese patients ( 15 females; age 41 ± 11 years; BMI 42 ± 4 kg/m Response inhibition to high-energy foods was associated with increased activation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex ( PFC) , right medial PFC , dorsolateral PFC , right middle cingulate cortex and the right inferior frontal operculum ( involved in inhibitory control) , after compared to before surgery. Response inhibition to low-energy foods elicited diminished post- compared to pre-surgery responses in the left superior temporal pole , right parahippocampal gyrus and right hypothalamus ( involved in metabolic control). Neural changes indicate improved response inhibition towards high-energy food cues , altered influence of metabolic control during response inhibition towards low-energy food cues and a more positive attitude to both high-energy and low-energy food after RYGB. Alterations in neural circuits involved in inhibitory control , satiety signalling and reward processing may contribute to effective weight-loss after RYGB.
