  1,4-Dioxane is one of the most common and persistent artificial pollutants in petrochemical industrial wastewaters and chlorinated solvent groundwater plumes. Despite its possible biological treatment in natural environments , the identity and dynamics of the microorganisms involved are largely unknown. Here , we identified active and diverse 1,4-dioxane-degrading microorganisms from activated sludge by high-sensitivity stable isotope probing of rRNA. By rigorously analyzing 16S rRNA molecules in RNA density fractions of
