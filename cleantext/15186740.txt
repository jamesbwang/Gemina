  Axonal growth and guidance rely on correct growth cone responses to guidance cues. Unlike the signaling cascades that link axonal growth to cytoskeletal dynamics , little is known about the crosstalk mechanisms between guidance and membrane dynamics and turnover. Recent studies indicate that whereas axonal attraction requires exocytosis , chemorepulsion relies on endocytosis. Indeed , our own studies have shown that Netrin-1/ Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ( DCC) signaling triggers exocytosis through the SNARE Syntaxin-1 ( STX1). However , limited in vivo evidence is available about the role of SNARE proteins in axonal guidance. To address this issue , here we systematically deleted SNARE genes in three species. We show that loss-of-function of STX1 results in pre- and post-commissural axonal guidance defects in the midline of fly , chick , and mouse embryos. Inactivation of VAMP2 , Ti-VAMP , and SNAP25 led to additional abnormalities in axonal guidance. We also confirmed that STX1 loss-of-function results in reduced sensitivity of commissural axons to Slit-2 and Netrin-1. Finally , genetic interaction studies in Drosophila show that STX1 interacts with both the Netrin-1/ DCC and Robo/Slit pathways. Our data provide evidence of an evolutionarily conserved role of STX1 and SNARE proteins in midline axonal guidance in vivo , by regulating both pre- and post-commissural guidance mechanisms.
