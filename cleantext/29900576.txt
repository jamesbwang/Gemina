  The tumour necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α -238 and -308 polymorphisms are potential candidate genes that may serve as modulators in susceptibility to acne. We performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies to assess the association of the TNF-α -238 and -308 polymorphisms with acne susceptibility. The PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus , SinoMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to identify eligible studies. OR and 95 % CI were calculated to evaluate the association. We identified seven independent case-control studies up to September 2017. The results revealed an association between the A allele of the TNF-α -238 polymorphism and increased susceptibility to acne in Asian ( OR = 1.61 , 95 % CI 1.08-2.40) but not in European ( OR = 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.63-1.93) populations. For the TNF-α -308 polymorphism , the minor A allele was associated with increased acne susceptibility in Asian ( OR = 1.93 , 95 % CI 1.15-3.24) and Turkish ( OR = 4.14 , 95 % CI 2.25-7.61) populations , but not in European ( OR = 1.17 , 95 % CI 0.66-2.06) or Arab ( OR = 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.64-1.22) populations. Egger test found no evidence of publication bias. Our findings suggest that the TNF-α -238 A allele is associated with increased susceptibility to acne in Asian but not in European populations , while the TNF-α -308 A allele is associated with increased susceptibility to acne in Asian and Turkish populations but not in European or Arab populations.
