  Furfuryl alcohol ( FFA) is a heat-induced food contaminant. Conversion by sulfotransferases ( SULT) yields 2-sulfoxymethylfuran , which is prone to react with DNA and proteins. In order to monitor the internal FFA exposure we developed a technique for the mass spectrometric quantification of the adduct N- ( ( furan-2-yl) methyl)- valine ( FFA-Val) after cleavage from the N-termini of hemoglobin. In the current study the method was applied to investigate the influence of different SULT forms on the adduct formation in wild-type mice and three genetically modified mouse models treated with FFA. Two lines were devoid of endogenous Sult1a1 or Sult1d1 , while another mouse line carried a transgene of human SULT1A1/1A2 in the Sult1a1/1d1 double knockout background. The Sult1d1 knockout did not influence adduct formation , whereas the lack of Sult1a1 reduced mean FFA-Val levels by 80 % and 58 % in male and female mice , respectively , in comparison to FFA-treated wild-type mice. The levels of FFA-Val in the humanized mice were elevated by factors of 2.7 ( males) and 2.2 ( females) as compared to the wild-type , indicating that SULT1A1/1A2 play a central role for FFA bioactivation also in humans. The excellent correlation between adduct levels in hepatic DNA and hemoglobin ( r
