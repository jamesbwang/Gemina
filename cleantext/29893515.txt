  The aim of this review is to present data from the available literature concerning CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 , as well as their receptor 3 ( CXCR3) in selected diseases of the central nervous system ( CNS) , such as tickborne encephalitis<disease> ( TBE) , neuroborreliosis ( NB) , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , and multiple sclerosis ( MS). CXCL9 , CXCL10 , and CXCL11 lack glutamic acid-leucine-arginine ( ELR) , and are unique , because they are more closely related to each other than to any other chemokine. The aforementioned chemokines are especially involved in Th1-type response and in various diseases , as their expression correlates with the tissue infiltration of T cells. Their production is strongly induced by interferon gamma ( IFN-Ï…) , the most typical Th1 cytokine. They act by binding to the CXC3 receptor. Knowledge about the action mechanism of CXCR3 and its ligands may be useful in the treatment of CNS diseases. However , data in the literature concerning the evaluation of CXCL9 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , and their receptor with the use of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) method is limited.
