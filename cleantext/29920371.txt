  Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) characterized by nocturnal intermittent hypoxia ( IH) is associated with atherosclerosis and cysteinyl-leukotrienes ( CysLT) pathway activation. We aimed to identify the determinants of CysLT pathway activation and the role of CysLT in OSA-related atherosclerosis. Determinants of the urinary excretion of LTE IH-related CysLT pathway activation contributes to OSA-induced atherogenesis. In the era of personalized medicine , U-LTE
