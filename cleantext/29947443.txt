  The study aims to examine the prevalence and common themes of unfinished business ( UB) and its associations with distress among advanced cancer patients. A total of 223 patients from a larger randomized controlled trial of Individual Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy ( IMCP) completed self-report questionnaires that assessed UB and UB-related distress , hopelessness , desire for hastened death , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , quality of life , spiritual well-being , and purpose/meaning. Unfinished business themes were identified by qualitative analysis of open-ended data. A total of 161 ( 72 %) patients reported the presence of UB. The mean UB-related distress score was 7.01 ( SD = 2.1) out of 10. Results of independent t tests showed that patients with UB reported significantly higher levels of anxiety<symptom> and lower levels of existential transcendence than patients without UB. Linear regression equations indicated that UB-related distress significantly predicted hopelessness ( F Unfinished business was both prevalent and distressing in our sample. Findings underscore the need to develop and implement interventions designed to help patients resolve or find solace with UB.
