  Gait disturbance is commonly associated with stroke , which is a serious neurological disease. With current technology , various exoskeletons have been developed to provide therapy , leading to many studies evaluating the use of such exoskeletons as an intervention tool. Although these studies report improvements in patients who had undergone robotic intervention , they are usually reported with clinical assessment , which are unable to characterize how muscle activations change in patients after robotic intervention. We believe that muscle activations can provide an objective view on gait performance of patients. To quantify improvement of lateral symmetry before and after robotic intervention , muscle synergy analysis with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization was used to evaluate patients ' EMG data. Eight stroke patients in their acute phase were evaluated before and after a course of robotic intervention with the Hybrid Assistive Limb ( HAL) , lasting over 3 weeks. We found a significant increase in similarity between lateral synergies of patients after robotic intervention. This is associated with significant improvements in gait measures like walking speed , step cadence , stance duration percentage of gait cycle. Clinical assessments ( Functional Independence Measure-Locomotion ( FIM-Locomotion) , FIM-Motor ( General) , and Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower Extremity ( FMA-LE)) showed significant improvements as well. Our study shows that muscle synergy analysis can be a good tool to quantify the change in neuromuscular coordination of lateral symmetry during walking in stroke patients.
