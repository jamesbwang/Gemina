  Removal of parasite free-living stages by predators has previously been suggested an important factor controlling parasite transmission in aquatic habitats. Experimental studies of zooplankton predation on macroparasite larvae are , however , scarce. We tested whether trematode cercariae , which are often numerous in shallow waters , are suitable prey for syntopic zooplankters. Feeding rates and survival of freshwater cyclopoids ( Megacyclops viridis , Macrocyclops distinctus) , calanoids ( Arctodiaptomus paulseni) , cladocerans ( Sida crystallina) and rotifers Asplanchna spp. , fed with cercariae of Diplostomum pseudospathaceum , a common fish trematode , were studied. In additional long-term experiments , we studied reproduction of cyclopoids fed with cercariae. All tested zooplankton species consumed cercariae. The highest feeding rates were observed for cyclopoids ( 33 Â± 12 cercariae ind-1 h-1) , which actively reproduced ( up to one egg clutch day-1) when fed ad libitum with cercariae. Their reproductive characteristics did not change significantly with time , indicating that cercariae supported cyclopoids ' dietary needs. Mortality of rotifers and cladocerans was high ( 25-28 % individuals) when exposed to cercariae in contrast to cyclopoids and calanoids ( < 2 %). Cercariae clogged the filtration apparatus of cladocerans and caused internal injuries in predatory rotifers , which ingested cercariae. Observed trophic links between common freshwater zooplankters and cercariae may significantly influence food webs and parasite transmission in lentic ecosystems.
