  In contrast to the guidelines of World Health Organization ( WHO) and United States-Centers for Disease Control and prevention ( US-CDC) , the Chinese national guidelines recommend the use of steroids , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG) , or traditional Chinese herbs ( TCHs) in hand-foot-mouth disease ( HFMD) management. Their use and therapeutic efficacies are , however , unclear. We aimed to describe their use in and the clinical outcomes of hospitalized HFMD cases. A retrospective review of hospital medical records for HFMD cases during 2008-2016 was conducted in a medical school-affiliated tertiary hospital in Shantou , Guangdong , China. Hospitalized children with the discharge diagnosis of HFMD ( n = 3778) , comprising mild ( 58.4 %) , severe ( 41.5 %) , and very severe ( 0.1 %) cases , were enrolled in the study. Steroids , IVIG , and antiviral TCH Lan-Qin were respectively prescribed in 60.5 , 37.1 , and 71.0 % of cases. Most cases ( 99.8 %) recovered and six died. Recovery rate was lower with the use of IVIG and higher with Lan-Qin ( alone or in combination with steroid) in the mild cases ( Ps < 0.05). Longer hospital stay was observed with steroid/IVIG with or without Lan-Qin in the severe cases ( Ps < 0.05). This nine-year retrospective review shows 1) an increase in the incidence of HFMD as well as the use of steroids , IVIG , and TCH over time , 2) no significant advantage of using steroids and IVIG , either alone or in combination , in the management of mild HFMD cases , and 3) a higher recovery rate in mild HFMD cases with the use of antiviral TCH ( Lan-Qin). Our findings need verification in a larger prospect study with cases from hospitals in other regions of China. Lan-Qin efficacy should be evaluated in randomized trials. Meanwhile , caution should be exercised in the extensive use of steroids and IVIG in HFMD management.
