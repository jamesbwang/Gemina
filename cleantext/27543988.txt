  The alteration of age-related molecules in the bone<disease> marrow microenvironment is one of the driving forces in osteoporosis. These molecules inhibit bone formation and promote bone resorption by regulating osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity , contributing to age-related bone loss. Here , we observed that the level of microRNA-31a-5p ( miR-31a-5p) was significantly increased in bone<disease> marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs) from aged rats , and these BMSCs demonstrated increased adipogenesis and aging phenotypes as well as decreased osteogenesis and stemness. We used the gain-of-function and knockdown approach to delineate the roles of miR-31a-5p in osteogenic differentiation by assessing the decrease of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 ( SATB2) levels and the aging of BMSCs by regulating the decline of E2F2 and recruiting senescence-associated heterochromatin foci ( SAHF). Notably , expression of miR-31a-5p , which promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption , was markedly higher in BMSCs-derived exosomes from aged rats compared to those from young rats , and suppression of exosomal miR-31a-5p inhibited the differentiation and function of osteoclasts , as shown by elevated RhoA activity. Moreover , using antagomiR-31a-5p , we observed that , in the bone<disease> marrow microenvironment , inhibition of miR-31a-5p prevented bone loss and decreased the osteoclastic activity of aged rats. Collectively , our results reveal that miR-31a-5p acts as a key modulator in the age-related bone<disease> marrow microenvironment by influencing osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation and that it may be a potential therapeutic target for age-related osteoporosis.
