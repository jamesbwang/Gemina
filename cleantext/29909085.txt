  An increasing demand for directed assembly of biomaterials has inspired the development of bioprinting , which facilitates the assembling of both cellular and acellular inks into well-arranged three-dimensional ( 3D) structures for tissue fabrication. Although great advances have been achieved in the recent decade , there still exist issues to be addressed. Herein , a review has been systematically performed to discuss the considerations in the entire procedure of bioprinting. Though bioprinting is advancing at a rapid pace , it is seen that the whole process of obtaining tissue constructs from this technique involves multiple-stages , cutting across various technology domains. These stages can be divided into three broad categories: pre-bioprinting , bioprinting and post-bioprinting. Each stage can influence others and has a bearing on the performance of fabricated constructs. For example , in pre-bioprinting , tissue biopsy and cell expansion techniques are essential to ensure a large number of cells are available for mass organ production. Similarly , medical imaging is needed to provide high resolution designs , which can be faithfully bioprinted. In the bioprinting stage , compatibility of biomaterials is needed to be matched with solidification kinetics to ensure constructs with high cell viability and fidelity are obtained. On the other hand , there is a need to develop bioprinters , which have high degrees of freedom of movement , perform without failure concerns for several hours and are compact , and affordable. Finally , maturation of bioprinted cells are governed by conditions provided during the post-bioprinting process. This review , for the first time , puts all the bioprinting stages in perspective of the whole process of bioprinting , and analyzes their current state-of-the art. It is concluded that bioprinting community will recognize the relative importance and optimize the parameter of each stage to obtain the desired outcomes.
