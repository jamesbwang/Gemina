  Burkitt lymphoma , a subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , is an aggressive neoplasm with three variants that are endemic , sporadic , and immunodeficiency associated. We present an unusual case of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma in a 6-year-old boy who initially presented with hypermobile teeth and no other specific signs or symptoms. On dental radiography , the patient was found to have alveolar bone resorption adjacent to the maxillary first molars , with the appearance of floating teeth. In addition , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) showed extensive soft tissue masses involving four quadrants of the jaws. A definitive diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma was made based on tissue and bone<disease> marrow biopsy. Subsequent images , including abdominal computed tomography ( CT) and bone scan , revealed wide dissemination of the lymphoma into the abdominal cavity , pancreas , and numerous bones. This case suggests the possibility of dental complaints as an initial clinical manifestation of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma and emphasizes the role of dentists in early detection of the disease to improve prognosis.
