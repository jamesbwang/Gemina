  Arguably the most important goal of prion research is the discovery of a safe and effective treatment for the human<disease> diseases<disease>. The final stages of the pathway to develop a treatment require clinical trials. Choices about how a trial is designed and conducted have a large impact on the chances of success. The gold-standard large randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study , which minimizes sources of bias and has been incredibly successful in other diseases , has been hard to achieve in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease principally because of the rarity and rapidity of the clinical syndrome<disease>. To date , clinical trials have been restricted to repurposed compounds , doxycycline , quinacrine , pentosan polysulfate ( PPS) , and flupertine. In most cases , these trials have used survival as an endpoint , which , whilst clearcut , has limitations. Biomarkers have played a strong role in diagnosis and entry criteria , but only a limited role as secondary outcome measures. Recent developments suggest some possible improvements in trial design by use of new outcome measures that have more favorable properties , and biomarkers of neuronal damage and/or prion seeding activity. Alternative patient populations , including those at risk of genetic forms of prion disease , warrant more consideration. In the future , improved trial designs will be employed to test compounds designed specifically to treat prion diseases.
