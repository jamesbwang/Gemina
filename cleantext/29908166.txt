  Combining the essential oils ( ESSOs) with the chemotherapeutic agent , mitomycin C ( MMC) , in nanoparticle can be beneficial in cancer therapy. The aim of the current study was to in vitro evaluate the antineoplastic effect of MMC , formulated in two different nanoemulsions ( NE) based on two ESSOs , chamomile ( Ch) and garlic ( Gar) , on HeLa cervical cancer cells. The z-average diameter of Ch-NE has slightly increased from 83.39 ± 12.85 nm to 91.18 ± 5.79 nm when mixed with MMC ( Ch-MMC) whereas the z-average diameter of Gar-NE has markedly increased from 50.6 ± 1.96 nm to 75.64 ± 7.13 nm when loaded with MMC ( Gar-MMC). The zeta potentials of both of Ch-NE and Ch-MMC , which were -1.91 ± 4.38 mV and -5.44 ± 5.26 mV , respectively , have differed from Gar-NE and Gar-MMC , which were 11.4 ± 2.29 mV and 11.5 ± 2.28 mV , respectively. Compared to MMC solution , the cell viabilities of HeLa cells , measured by the MTT assay , were reduced 42 and 20 times when subjected into Ch-MMC and Gar-MMC , respectively. The light microscopy images revealed that the cell membrane of the HeLa cells treated with Gar-NE or Gar-MMC were more altered relative to the cells treated with Ch-NE or Ch-MMC. In contrast , the nuclei of the HeLa cells , stained with DAPI and treated with Ch-NE or Ch-MMC , were more fragmented than the cells treated with Gar-NE or Gar-MMC , indicating that both of Ch-NE and Ch-MMC have passed the cell membrane and affected the nucleus directly whereas Gar-NE and Gar-MMC have got attached to the cell membrane causing damage to the cell. In conclusion , combining MMC with NE-based ESSOs has increased the cytotoxic effect of the MMC on the HeLa cells with different mechanism of actions.
