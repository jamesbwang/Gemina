  Travel restrictions were implementeded on an unprecedented scale in 2015 in Sierra Leone to contain and eliminate Ebola<disease> virus<disease> disease<disease> However , the impact of epidemic travel restrictions on mobility itself remains difficult to measure with traditional methods. New ` big data ' approaches using mobile phone data can provide , in near real-time , the type of information needed to guide and evaluate control measures. We analysed anonymous mobile phone call detail records ( CDRs) from a leading operator in Sierra Leone between 20 March and 1 July in 2015. We used an anomaly detection algorithm to assess changes in travel during a national ` stay at home ' lockdown from 27 to 29 March. To measure the magnitude of these changes and to assess effect modification by region and historical Ebola<disease> burden , we performed a time series analysis and a crossover analysis. Routinely collected mobile phone data revealed a dramatic reduction in human mobility during a 3-day lockdown in Sierra Leone. The number of individuals relocating between chiefdoms decreased by 31 % within 15 km , by 46 % for 15-30 km and by 76 % for distances greater than 30 km. This effect was highly heterogeneous in space , with higher impact in regions with higher Ebola<disease> incidence. Travel quickly returned to normal patterns after the restrictions were lifted. The effects of travel restrictions on mobility can be large , targeted and measurable in near real-time. With appropriate anonymization protocols , mobile phone data should play a central role in guiding and monitoring interventions for epidemic containment.
