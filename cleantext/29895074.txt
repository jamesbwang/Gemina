  The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperprolactinemia and high levels of insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I) on bone resorption and their relation with receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand ( RANKL) and osteoprotegerin ( OPG) in patients with prolactinoma and acromegaly. Thirty-one patients with acromegaly , 28 patients with prolactinoma , and 33 healthy individuals were included in the study. Serum concentrations of RANKL , OPG , bone alkaline phosphatase ( bone ALP) , osteocalcin ( OC) , C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen ( CTX) , procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide ( P1NP) and urine deoxypyridinoline ( DPD) levels were detected and bone mineral density ( BMD) was measured. Groups were not statistically different from each other with regard to serum levels of RANKL and OPG. The RANKL/OPG ratio was higher in the prolactinoma group than in the control group ( p = 0.046). A positive correlation between OPG and increasing age was detected in both the prolactinoma and control groups ( r = 0.524 , p = 0.004 and r = 0.380 , p = 0.029 , respectively). An inverse correlation was observed between IGF-I and OPG after excluding age in the prolactinoma group ( r = -0.412 , p = 0.046). OC and bone ALP were negatively associated with RANKL in the acromegaly group ( r = -0.384 , p = 0.036 and r = -0.528 , p = 0.003 , respectively). There was an inverse correlation between OPG and BMD at the femoral neck in the acromegaly group ( r = -0.422 , p = 0.02). The effect of IGF-I on bone remodeling may be partly mediated by RANKL and OPG. The RANKL/OPG ratio plays an important role in prolactinoma. A positive correlation of OPG with age and an inverse correlation with IGF-I favor the compensatory response of OPG against bone loss in the aging skeleton.
