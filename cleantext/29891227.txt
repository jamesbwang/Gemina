  Whole-genome sequencing has made a significant impact on cancer research , but traditional bulk methods fail to detect information from rare cells. Recently developed single-cell sequencing methods have provided new insights and unprecedented details about cancer progression and diversity. These advancements also enable the investigation of rare cells , such as circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) derived from cancer patients. In this review , we outline various single-cell sequencing techniques that can elucidate the molecular properties of CTCs. In addition , we explain the drawbacks that need to be overcome for each method.
