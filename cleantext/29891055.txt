  Ataxia<symptom> is one of the most frequent symptoms of mitochondrial disease. In most cases it occurs as part of a syndromic disorder and the combination of ataxia<symptom> with other neurologic involvement such as epilepsy is common. Mitochondrial ataxias<symptom> can be caused by disturbance of the cerebellum and its connections , involvement of proprioception<symptom> ( i.e. , sensory ataxia<symptom> or a combination of both ( spinocerebellar). There are no specific features that define an ataxia<symptom> as mitochondrial , except perhaps the tendency for it to occur together with involvement of multiple other sites , both in the nervous system and outside. In this review we will concentrate on the mitochondrial disorders in which ataxia<symptom> is a prominent and consistent feature and focus on the clinical features and genetic causes.
