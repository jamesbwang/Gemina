  The aim of the study was to compare the frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) and pregnancy outcomes in women diagnosed by WHO 1999 and IADPSG criteria. This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 1508 women who underwent a 75-g OGTT after the 24th week of gestation at the University Hospital of Bialystok between 2004 and 2012. GDM was diagnosed by WHO 1999 criteria in 486 ( 32.2 %) patients and by IADPSG criteria in 397 ( 26.3 %) women. Three hundred fifty five ( 23.5 %) patients fulfilled both criteria , whereas 111 ( 7.4 %) and 39 ( 2.6 %) subjects met only WHO 1999 or IADPSG criteria , respectively. Isolated fasting hyperglycemia was found in 3.4 % of patients fulfilling WHO 1999 criteria and in 17.6 % of women who met IADPSG criteria. In total , fasting glycemic value was diagnostic in 42.8 % of the participants fulfilling the new criteria. The main risk factor for GDM was family history of diabetes ( OR 2.285 ( 95 % CI: 1.772-2.945) , p = 0.00001). The rates of cesarean section and macrosomia were higher in the group with GDM than in the healthy women ( 54.7 % vs 41.9 % and 18.9 % vs 13.9 % , respectively) , but the differences were not significant. Three months postpartum the disturbances of glucose tolerance were found in 21 % of the patients with GDM. The introduction of the IADPS criteria did not increase the prevalence of GDM , but increased the number of patients with fasting hyperglycemia. Twelve weeks postpartum the patients with prior GDM had significantly higher post-load glucose levels than the healthy women.
