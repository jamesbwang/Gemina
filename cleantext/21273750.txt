  Thoracic disk herniation comprises 0.15 % of all disk herniation and has various and confusing manifestations. Among them , radicular pain down the leg could be the rarest presentation , especially if it is the only complaint. On the other hand , finding the relationship between clinical and paraclinical needs require high index of suspension and it is demanding. A 34-year-old patient , who had a history of intermittent back pain , with lower thoracic disk herniation presented by acute leg sciatica-like pain , is reported. He suffered 3 weeks of acute<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> prior to admission , which radiated down to buttock and leg , with a vague left abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , whose clinical examination indicated a distal lumbar problem. MRI showed T-12 L-1 disk herniation. Lower thoracic disc herniation can compress lumbosacral roots immediately after exiting from cord thickening in the lower thoracic area , so they can incite lower lumbar radiculopathy and cause discordance between MRI findings and clinical presentation , suggesting a lumbar problem , and this can lead to delayed diagnosis. However , the acute<symptom> pain<symptom> was completely improved after open discectomy.
