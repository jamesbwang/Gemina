  To examine the effects of different sensitivities on the effectiveness of acupuncture analgesia by observing activation change characteristics of cerebral areas resulting from the influences of constitutions on analgesia effects and to discuss the response mechanism of central nervous system ( CNS) to determine the factor of constitutions on acupuncture efficacy using cerebral functional magnetic resonance imaging arterial spin labeling ( fMRI-ASL). Participants with different sensitivities were assessed according to standard screening and grouped into two groups: insensitivity group ( VAS score in the sensitivity group was significantly higher than that in the insensitivity group ( Different sensitivity to acupuncture is one of the crucial factors influencing analgesia effects. The sensitivity group had superior analgesia effect than the insensitivity group. Acupuncture might deactivate cerebral functional areas to generate analgesic effects.The superior frontal gyrus and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex , because of deactivation , play a positive role in sensitive patients , which is probably one of the CNS cerebral areas responding to acupuncture analgesia of people who are sensitive to acupuncture.
