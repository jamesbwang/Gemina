  Diffusion of Tibeto-Burman populations across the Tibetan Plateau led to the largest human community in a high-altitude environment and has long been a focus of research on high-altitude adaptation , archeology , genetics , and linguistics. However , much uncertainty remains regarding the origin , diversification , and expansion of Tibeto-Burman populations. In this study , we analyzed a 7.0 M bp region of 285 Y-chromosome sequences , including 81 newly reported ones , from male samples from Tibeto-Burman populations and other related Eastern Asian populations. We identified several paternal lineages specific to Tibeto-Burman populations , and most of these lineages emerged between 6000 and 2500 years ago. A phylogenetic tree and lineage dating both support the hypothesis that the establishment of Tibeto-Burman ancestral groups was triggered by Neolithic expansions from the middle Yellow River Basin and admixtures with local populations on the Tibetan Plateau who survived the Paleolithic Age. Furthermore , according to the geographical distributions of the haplogroups , we propose that there are two Neolithic expansion origins for all modern Tibeto-Burman populations. Our research provides a clear scenario about the sources , admixture process and later diffusion process of the ancestor population of all Tibeto-Burman populations.
