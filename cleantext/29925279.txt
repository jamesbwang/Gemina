  Blue light cystoscopy improves the detection of bladder cancer at time of transurethral resection of bladder tumor for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. This has translated to decreased tumor recurrence. Given this improvement in rigid cystoscopy , the question remains whether the use of blue light flexible cystoscopy ( BLFC) in the surveillance setting provides the same benefits. This review aims to evaluate the recently reported Phase III prospective multicenter study of BLFC which evaluated the detection of bladder cancer during surveillance , which in its earliest reporting demonstrated improved detection of bladder cancer. This study evaluated 304 patients with findings of 63 confirmed malignancies , with 13 ( 20.6 %) only identified by BLFC ( p < 0.0001). The question still remains whether the improved detection rate will translate to improved clinical outcomes. Further , studies will be necessary to determine which patients will benefit from BLFC , optimal ways to incorporate into surveillance strategies and cost-effectiveness.
