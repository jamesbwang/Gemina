  Since 1981 , Gordon Research Conferences have been held on the topic of Oxygen Radicals on a biennial basis , to highlight and discuss the latest cutting edge research in this area. Since the first meeting , one special feature of this conference has been the awarding of the so-called Iron Bolt , an award that started in jest but has gained increasing reputation over the years. Since no written documentation exists for this Iron Bolt award , this perspective serves to overview the history of this unusual award , and highlights various experiences of previous winners of this `` prestigious '' award and other interesting anecdotes.
