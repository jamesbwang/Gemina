  Imaging plays a key role throughout the renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) patient pathway , from diagnosis and staging of the disease , to the assessment of response to therapy. This review aims to summarise current knowledge with regard to imaging in the RCC patient pathway , highlighting recent advances and challenges. A literature review was performed using Medline. Particular focus was paid to RCC imaging in the diagnosis , staging and response assessment following therapy. Characterisation of small renal masses ( SRM) remains a diagnostic conundrum. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS) has been increasingly applied in this field , as have emerging technologies such as multiparametric MRI , radiomics and molecular imaging with The diagnosis and characterisation of SRM and response assessment following targeted therapy for advanced RCC are key challenges which warrant further research.
