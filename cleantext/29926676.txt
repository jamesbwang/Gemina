  To investigate the effect of two kinds of fermented food , noni juice and natto , on blood glucose and lipids in induced diabetic mice. Female ( ICR) mice were induced into diabetes by an injection of alloxan ( 55 mg/kg , i. v.). After 72 hours , those mice whose fasting blood glucose levels were over 12.00 mmol/L and urine sugar was strongly positive ( + + +) were regarded as diabetical model and were randomly divided into three groups ( Compared to the NC group , the water-drinking amount and food-intake , GSP and total cholesterol ( TC) , triglyceride ( TG) and low density lipoprotein ( LDL) in DM group were increased significantly ( Both noni juice and natto could reduce the blood glucose levels in induced diabetical mice and improve blood lipids , which suggested that they may have certain application value in prevention and treatment of diabetic mellitus.
