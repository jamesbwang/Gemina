  We assessed resting central/peripheral blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , postexercise BP and hemodynamic responses ( stroke volume ( SV) , cardiac output ( CO) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR)) after acute exercise and 2 wk of aerobic training in lean and centrally obese men matched for BP. Eight lean ( body mass index ( BMI) < 25 kg/m; visceral fat = 279 ± 224 cm) and eight centrally obese ( BMI > 30 kg/m; visceral fat = 1,471 ± 374 cm) men performed 6 training sessions ( 3d/wk for 40 min at 65-70 % HRmax). Resting BP and hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline , following exercise for 60 min , and at 24h and 48h after the last training session. Postexercise brachial and central systolic and mean arterial BP decreased 3-4 mmHg below resting in lean ( P < 0.001) , and increased by 3 mmHg in obese ( P < 0.02). Post-training resting brachial/central systolic BPs were reduced by 3-4 mmHg only in lean men ( P < 0.05). Pretraining PEH was significantly correlated with the training-induced change in resting brachial SBP at 48h ( r = 0.58 , P = 0.02) , but not at 24h ( r = 0.38 , P = 0.15). Similar correlations were observed between acute reductions in central systolic BP ( SBP) and central SBP at 24h ( r = 0.43 , P = 0.09) and 48h ( r = 0.54 , P = 0.03) post-training. In contrast to the consistent results for lean men , PEH was not observed in centrally obese men , and resting SBP was not reduced after a short aerobic training program. Considerable individual variation in postexercise BP response among obese men may have implications for design of exercise interventions to lower BP in these individuals.
