  Detection of cell proliferation based on the incorporation of 5 '- bromo-2 '- deoxyuridine ( BrdU) has become a standard approach for studying stem cell and progenitor cell populations in developing and adult tissue. In this chapter , we describe three BrdU administration methods for planarians and a staining protocol combining BrdU detection with whole-mount fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH). Collectively , these protocols enable the combined analysis of BrdU-incorporation and endogenous gene expression , as for example during lineage tracing applications.
