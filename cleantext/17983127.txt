  Temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) is one of the most used joint of the body. Moreover , it is common knowledge that TMJ may show degenerative changes 10 years earlier than other joints. Recently , the use of arthroscopic surgery is revolutionizing the classic management of TMJ pathologies. In fact , the minimal invasiveness of this procedure allows faster results and fewer complications than other procedures. In this article , we present our arthroscopic technique. In this line , we would like to emphasize that we used this approach in different temporomandibular disorders such as anchored disk syndrome<disease> , habitual dislocation of TMJ , and internal derangement. Furthermore , we wish to underline that our efforts have been rewarded with great results.
