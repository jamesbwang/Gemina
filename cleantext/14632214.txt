  Stretching is a common method used to prevent muscle shortening and improve limited mobility. However , the effect of different time periods on stretching-induced adaptation of the extracellular matrix and its regulatory elements have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the expression of fibrillar collagens , sarcomerogenesis , metalloproteinase ( MMP) activity and gene expression of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) regulators in the soleus ( SOL) muscle of rats submitted to different stretching periods. The soleus muscles were submitted to 10 sets of passive stretching over 10 ( St 10d) or 15 days ( St 15d) ( 1 min per set , with 30 seconds ' rest between sets). Sarcomerogenesis , muscle cross-sectional area ( CSA) , and MMP activity and mRNA levels in collagen ( type I , III and IV) , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) , growth factor-beta ( TGF-β) , and lysyl oxidase ( LOX) were analyzed. Passive stretching over both time periods mitigated COL-I deposition in the SOL muscle of rats. Paradoxically , 10 days of passive stretching induced COL-I and COL-III synthesis , with concomitant upregulation of TGF-β1 and CTGF at a transcriptional level. These responses may be associated with lower LOX mRNA levels in SOL muscles submitted to 10 passive stretching sessions. Moreover , sarcomerogenesis was observed after 15 days of stretching , suggesting that stretching-induced muscle adaptations are time-dependent responses.
