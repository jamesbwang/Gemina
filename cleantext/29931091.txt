  The photoautotrophic Synechocystis sp.. PCC 6803 ( hereafter Synechocystis) is known for its α-polyglucan ( glycogen) synthesis to serve as a carbon storage compound. In this study , the glgC and glgA overexpressing Synechocystis strain with the disruption of polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB) synthesis ( ▲ GCAX-ΔBK) showed an increased glycogen production. This engineered strain had highest glycogen content of 38.3 % ( g/g dry cell weight) as compared to 27.4 % in the phaA knockout strain ( ΔBK) and 34.8 % in the glgC/glgA overexpressing strain ( ▲ GCAX) after 20 days growth. Under nitrogen-deprived growth conditions of 3 days , the ▲ GCAX-ΔBK strain showed a further increase in glycogen content from 27.0 to 36.0 %. Furthermore , the engineered strains grown under ionic , osmotic or oxidative stress condition had an increase of glycogen accumulation whereas no increase was observed in the wild type. The maximum glycogen content was 54.0 % in ▲ GCAX-ΔBK strain treated with 3 mM H2O2. Overall results indicated that in the absence of PHB synthesis , Synechocystis cells redirected the carbon flow towards the synthesis of glycogen as an alternative physiological responsive compound especially under stress conditions.
