  We employ a free-energy lattice-Boltzmann method to study the dynamics of a ternary fluid system consisting of a liquid drop driven by a body force across a regularly textured substrate , infused by a lubricating liquid. We focus on the case of partial wetting lubricants and observe a rich interplay between contact line pinning and viscous dissipation at the lubricant ridge , which become dominant at large and small apparent angles , respectively. Our numerical investigations further demonstrate that the relative importance of viscous dissipation at the lubricant ridge depends on the drop to lubricant viscosity ratio , as well as on the shape of the wetting ridge.
