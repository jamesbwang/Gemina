  The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a Nitric oxide ( NO) donor , S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO) , on apoptosis and the improvement of preservation quality in apheresis platelets. A GSNO solution- to make the final GSNO concentration of 100 uM was added into fresh apheresis platelets , and the parameters associated with platelet morphology , metabolism , and apoptosis were dynamically monitored for seven days. The results showed that the NO level was remarkably higher during the whole storage stageafter GSNO injection. The number of depolarized platelets and platelets with phosphatidylserine valgus were significantly reduced in the GSNO group compared to that of the control group at some time point. The expression of Bcl-xL mRNA on day 5 of storage in the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group , but the expression of Bcl-xL protein was not significantly higher than that in the control group. In addition , Bak and Bax mRNA expression levels in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group , but Bak and Bax protein expression levels were not statistically different. Meanwhile , caspase-3 activity was significantly inhibited. These data suggest that the addition of a certain dose of GSNO as a NO donor during platelet storage could inhibit platelet apoptosis and reduce platelet storage lesion<symptom> ( PSL) to a certain extent.
