  Nitric oxide ( NO) may cause serious environmental problems , such as acid rain , haze weather , global warming and even death. Herein , a new low-cost , highly efficient and green method for the elimination of NO using zirconium nitride ( ZrN) is reported for the first time , which does not produce any waste or any by-product. Relevant experimental parameters , such as reaction temperature and gas concentration , were investigated to explore the reaction mechanism. Interestingly , NO can be easily decomposed into nitrogen ( N
