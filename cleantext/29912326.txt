  Freshwater bacterioplankton communities are influenced by the inputs of material and bacteria from the surrounding landscape , yet few studies have investigated how different terrestrial inputs affect bacterioplankton. We examined whether the addition of soils collected under various tree species combinations differentially influences lake bacterial communities. Lake water was incubated for 6 days following addition of five different soils. We assessed the taxonomic composition ( 16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolic activity ( Biolog Ecoplates) of lake bacteria with and without soil addition , and compared these to initial soil communities. Soil bacterial assemblages showed a strong influence of tree composition , but such community differences were not reflected in the structure of lake communities that developed during the experiment. Bacterial taxa showing the largest abundance increases during incubation were initially present in both lake water and across most soils , and were related to Cytophagales , Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales. No clear metabolic profiles based on inoculum source were found , yet soil-amended communities used 60 % more substrate than non-inoculated communities. Overall , we show that terrestrial inputs influence aquatic communities by stimulating the growth and activity of certain ubiquitous taxa distributed across the terrestrial-aquatic continuum , yet different forest<disease> soils did not cause predictable changes in lake bacterioplankton assemblages.
