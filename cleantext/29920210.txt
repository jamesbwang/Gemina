  There has been an increasing interest during recent years in the role of the gut microbiome on health and disease. Therefore , metabolites in human feces related to microbial activity are attractive surrogate marker to track changes of microbiota induced by diet or disease. Such markers include 5α/β-stanols as microbiome-derived metabolites of sterols. Currently , reliable , robust , and fast methods to quantify fecal sterols and their related metabolites are missing. We developed a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/HRMS) method for the quantification of sterols and their 5α/β-stanols in human fecal samples. Fecal sterols were extracted and derivatized to N , N-dimethylglycine esters. The method includes cholesterol , coprostanol , cholestanol and sitosterol , 5α/β-sitostanol , campesterol and 5α/β-campestanol. Application of a biphenyl column permits separation of isomeric 5α- and 5β-stanols. Sterols are detected in parallel reaction monitoring ( PRM) mode and stanols in full scan mode. HRMS allows differentiation of isobaric β-stanols and the ( M + 2) isotope peak of the coeluting sterol. Performance characteristics meet the criteria recommended by Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and European Medicines Agency ( EMA) guidelines. Analysis of fecal samples from healthy volunteers revealed high interindividual variability of sterol and stanol fractions. Interestingly , cholesterol and sitosterol showed similar fractions of mainly 5β-stanols. In contrast , campesterol is substantially converted to 5α-campestanol and might be a poorer substrate for bacterial metabolism. Robust and fast quantification of fecal sterols and their related stanols by LC-MS/HRMS offers great potential to find novel microbiome-related biomarker in large-scale studies.
