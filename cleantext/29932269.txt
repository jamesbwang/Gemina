  Uterine and placental macrophages play critical roles in maintaining a normal pregnancy. The majority of these macrophages are believed to be alternatively activated macrophages ( M2). Mouse bone<disease> marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages and polarized to M2 in vitro by treatment with IL-4 ( M2a) or IL-10 ( M2c) and M1 with LPS/IFN-Î³ as controls. Macrophage subtypes were confirmed by surface markers and characterized by gene expression profiles. Compared to M1 , M2 showed strong pro-angiogenic activity by expressing higher mRNA for angiogenic-associated factors ( Cxcl12 , Vegfa , PlGF , Mmp2). M2c produced the highest levels of PlGF , Mmp2 , and Cxcr4. To mimic the normal placental microenvironment , M2 were exposed to hypoxia and sex hormones ( progesterone , estrogen). In both M2c and M2a , severe hypoxic ( 1 % -3 % O M2 , particularly M2c , displayed strong pro-angiogenic potential , which decreased under severe hypoxia such as in early pregnancy. Thus , conditions that alter the placental oxygen microenvironment or macrophage response in early pregnancy might cause aberrant angiogenesis and vascular remodeling , and lead to abnormal placental vascular development.
