  Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that has no available targeted therapies. Previously , we have shown that caloric restriction ( CR) can augment the effects of radiation therapy in a TNBC mouse model. To build upon this , we now present data regarding the combination of chemotherapy and CR in the same 4T1 model. Chemotherapy can induce inflammation<symptom> that breeds resistance to therapy. We propose CR as a mechanism to decrease chemotherapy-induced inflammation<symptom> and increase efficacy of therapy. 12-week old Balb/c mice were orthotopically injected with a syngeneic triple negative breast cancer cell line ( 4T1) and were treated in one of six cohorts: ad lib fed ( AL) , 30 % reduction in calorie intake ( CR) , cisplatin or docetaxol alone or a combination CR + cisplatin/docetaxol. Mice in the cohorts receiving chemotherapy + CR had longer overall survival ( 12 +/- 2 days) as compared to the AL group. These mice also demonstrated less lung metastases at the final time point of in vivo imaging. In addition , downregulation of the IGF-1R and IRS signaling pathways were noted most significantly in those mice receiving combination therapy. Lastly , serum from these mice demonstrated an increase in inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1B in response to chemotherapy alone. This increase was dampened by the addition of CR. Taken together , these data suggest that while chemotherapy is effective in TNBC , it can cause inflammation<symptom> , which can be a driver of resistance to therapy. This chemotherapy-induced inflammation<symptom> can be reversed with the use of CR as a nontoxic adjunct to treatment.
