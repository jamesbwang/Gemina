  Renal<symptom> anemia<symptom> is a serious and common complication in hemodialysis ( HD) patients. The introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs) has dramatically improved hemoglobin levels and outcomes. Several interventional studies reported that excessive correction of anemia<symptom> and the massive use of ESA can trigger cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , and consequently may worsen the prognosis of patients undergoing HD. Therefore , it has been widely recognized that large doses of ESA should be used with caution. An effective use of iron preparations is required to yield the optimal effect of ESA. It is well-known that iron utilization is inhibited under pathological conditions , such as chronic inflammation<symptom> , resulting in ESA resistance. It is postulated that a new class of therapeutic agents for renal<symptom> anemia<symptom> , hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase ( HIF-PH) inhibitors , will have beneficial treatment effects in patients on HD. HIF is induced by hypoxia and promotes erythropoietin production. In the absence of a hypoxic state , HIF is decomposed by the HIF catabolic enzyme. HIF-PH inhibitors inhibit this degrading enzyme and stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production via HIF induction. Additionally , HIF-PH inhibitors promote effective utilization of iron and raise erythropoietin to physiological concentrations. Accordingly , HIF-PH inhibitors improve anemia<symptom> and iron metabolism. It appears that this effect persists irrespective of chronic inflammatory conditions. HIF-PH inhibitors do not overshoot erythropoietin above physiological concentrations like ESAs. Therefore , it is hypothesized that HIF-PH inhibitors would not increase the risk of CVD in patients undergoing HD.
