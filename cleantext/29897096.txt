  The rotary motor of bacteria is a natural nano-technological marvel that enables cell locomotion by powering the rotation of semi-rigid helical flagellar filaments in fluid environments. It is well known that the motor operates essentially at constant torque in counter-clockwise direction but past work have reported a large range of values of this torque. Focusing on Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> cells that are swimming and cells that are stuck on a glass surface for which all geometrical and environmental parameters are known ( N. C. Darnton et al. , J. Bacteriol. , 2007 , 189 , 1756-1764) , we use two validated numerical methods to compute the value of the motor torque consistent with experiments. Specifically , we use ( and compare) a numerical method based on the boundary integral representation of Stokes flow and also develop a hybrid method combining boundary element and slender body theory to model the cell body and flagellar filament , respectively. Using measured rotation speed of the motor , our computations predict a value of the motor torque in the range 440 pN nm to 829 pN nm , depending critically on the distance between the flagellar filaments and the nearby surface.
