  Humans learn the rules that govern how the elements of their language are organized over an input that is often not homogeneous ( it might contain noise , or even include rules from different linguistic systems , as it might be the case for bilinguals). In the present study we explore the conditions under which participants can learn an abstract rule when it is presented in a heterogeneous context. Results from six experiments show that listeners can learn a token-independent rule even if it is presented together with some exemplars that implement a different regularity ( Experiment 1a and 1b). In fact , learning rules from an input containing several patterns does not seem to differ from learning them from an input containing only one ( Experiment 1c). More surprisingly , we observed that listeners can even learn an abstract rule that is only implemented over 10 % of the exemplars that compose a familiarization stream ( Experiments 2a and 2b). When the proportion of tokens implementing the target and the non-target rules is balanced , we did not observe any learning ( Experiment 3). Our results suggest that listeners use differences in relative frequency to keep separate linguistic rules apart. This allows them to learn different abstract regularities from a non-homogeneous linguistic signal.
