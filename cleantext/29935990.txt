  Cardiac hypertrophy in Fabry disease can be assessed using the left ventricular mass index ( LVMI) with either echocardiography ( LVMI-ECHO) or magnetic resonance imaging ( LVMI-CMR). A retrospective case series of patients with Fabry disease in Alberta involved a cross-sectional analysis of 32 patients and a longitudinal analysis of 14 of these patients with at least 4 serial CMR measurements. The cross-sectional analysis showed the mean LVMI-ECHO was 97.8 Â± 26.0 g/m We propose the preferred method for measuring LVMI is CMR in patients with Fabry disease.
