  The present article describes the synthesis , in vitro urease inhibition and in silico molecular docking studies of a novel series of bi-heterocyclic bi-amides. The synthesis of title compounds was initiated by benzoylation , with benzoyl chloride ( 1) , of the key starter ethyl 2- ( 2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) acetate ( 2) in weak basic aqueous medium followed by hydrazide formation , 4 , and cyclization with CS
