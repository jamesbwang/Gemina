  The past decades have witnessed a paradigm shift from the traditional drug discovery shaped around the idea of & ldquo; one target , one disease & rdquo; to polypharmacology ( multiple targets , one disease). Given the lack of clear-cut boundaries across disease ( endo) phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity across patients , a natural extension to the current polypharmacology paradigm is to target common biological pathways involved in diseases via endopharmacology ( multiple targets , multiple diseases). In this study , we present proximal pathway enrichment analysis ( PxEA) for pinpointing drugs that target common disease pathways towards network endopharmacology. PxEA uses the topology information of the network of interactions between disease genes , pathway genes , drug targets and other proteins to rank drugs by their interactome-based proximity to pathways shared across multiple diseases , providing unprecedented drug repurposing opportunities. Using PxEA , we show that many drugs indicated for autoimmune disorders are not necessarily specific to the condition of interest , but rather target the common biological pathways across these diseases. Finally , we provide high scoring drug repurposing candidates that can target common mechanisms involved in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer & rsquo; s disease , two conditions that have recently gained attention due to the increased comorbidity among patients.
