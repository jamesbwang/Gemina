  The expression of chemical compounds by individual plants of the same species in different locations may be affected by abiotic factors resulting in differences in the production of allelopathic compounds. The objective of this study was to compare the phytochemical profiles of plant species from two different forest<disease> formations in the state of Paran√° , Brazil. The forest<disease> formations were Seasonal Semideciduous Forest<disease> ( SSF) and Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest<disease> ( LODF) , and the five study species were Jacaranda micrantha , Cecropia pachystachya , Mimosa bimucronata , Schinus terebinthifolius and Cedrela fissilis. Secondary metabolites were extracted by exhaustive extraction with methanol , and the crude extract was fractionated using column chromatography. The fractions were used to calculate the retention factor of the main compounds using thin layer chromatography and phytochemical tests. The classes of compounds identified were practically the same among the analyzed species , however , at different levels of concentration. The type of tannins found in S. terebinthifolius differed between the two forest<disease> formations.
