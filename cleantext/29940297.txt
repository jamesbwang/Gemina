  Porous microspheres have interconnective external and internal pores leading to very low mass density and enormous specific surface area , enabling them to have excellent adsorption capabilities. Due to this uniqueness over traditional microsphere , they find extensive pharmaceutical applications. Porous microspheres are very promising for gastro retentive drug delivery , alveoli targeted drug delivery , high-speed chromatography , development of tissue regeneration scaffolds and as carrier of biopharmaceuticals. Pore structure and porosity are the main factors that govern their applications. There are different well-established methods for their synthesis , like seed swelling , solvent evaporation , polymerization , spray drying and phase separation. But most of the methods are time consuming and consists of numbers of complicated steps. The size , shape and pore structure of the particles depend on many experimental variables like temperature , pH , stirring speed , type and concentration of porogen , polymer and its concentration. Thus , synthesis of porous microparticle with predefined porosity is really challenging.
