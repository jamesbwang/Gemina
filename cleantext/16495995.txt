  An overview of the processing , characterization and magnetostructural properties of ferromagnetic NiMnX ( X = group IIIA ‚Åª VA elements) Heusler alloys is presented. This type of alloy is multiferroic-- exhibits more than one ferroic property-- and is hence multifunctional. Examples of how different synthesis procedures influence the magnetostructural characteristics of these alloys are shown. Significant microstructural factors , such as the crystal structure , atomic ordering , volume of unit cell , grain size and others , which have a bearing on the properties , have been reviewed. An overriding factor is the composition which , through its tuning , affects the martensitic and magnetic transitions , the transformation temperatures , microstructures and , consequently , the magnetostructural effects.
