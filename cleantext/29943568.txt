  Two synthetic routes have been developed for the asymmetric syntheses of ( 2 R ,3 S)- and ( 2 S ,3 S) -3-hydroxyproline. The key synthetic step in each of these strategies is the conversion of protected α,δ-dihydroxy-β-amino esters ( either 2,3- anti- or 2,3- syn-configured) into β,δ-dihydroxy-α-amino esters ( protected forms thereof) , via the intermediacy of the corresponding aziridinium ions. The products of these stereospecific rearrangements were then cyclized and deprotected to afford ( 2 R ,3 S) -3-hydroxyproline and ( 2 S ,3 S) -3-hydroxyproline as single diastereoisomers ( > 99:1 dr) in > 26 % overall yield.
