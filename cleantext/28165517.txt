  A hybrid of ZnO nanorods grown onto three-dimensional ( 3D) reduced graphene oxide ( RGO) @Ni foam ( ZnO/RGO @NF) is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The as-prepared hybrid material is physically characterized by SEM , XRD , Raman , and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS). When the as-prepared 3D hybrid is investigated as a photocatalyst , it demonstrates significant high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue ( MB) , rhodamine ( RhB) , and mixed MB/RhB as organic dye pollutants. In addition , the practical application and the durability of the as-prepared catalyst to degradation of malachite green ( MG) in seawater are firstly assessed in a continuous flow system. The catalyst shows a high degradation efficiency and stable photocatalytic activity for 5 h continuous operation , which should be a promising catalyst for the degradation of organic dyes in seawater.
