  454-Pyrosequencing and lipid fingerprinting were used to link anaerobic digestion ( AD) process parameters ( pH , alkalinity , volatile fatty acids ( VFAs) , biogas production and methane content) with the reactor microbial community structure and composition. AD microbial communities underwent stress conditions after changes in organic loading rate and digestion substrates. 454-Pyrosequencing analysis showed that , irrespectively of the substrate digested , methane content and pH were always significantly , and positively , correlated with community evenness. In AD , microbial communities with more even distributions of diversity are able to use parallel metabolic pathways and have greater functional stability; hence , they are capable of adapting and responding to disturbances. In all reactors , a decrease in methane content to < 30 % was always correlated with a 50 % increase of Firmicutes sequences ( particularly in operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) related to Ruminococcaceae and Veillonellaceae). Whereas digesters producing higher methane content ( above 60 %) , contained a high number of sequences related to Synergistetes and unidentified bacterial OTUs. Finally , lipid fingerprinting demonstrated that , under stress , the decrease in archaeal biomass was higher than the bacterial one , and that archaeal Phospholipid etherlipids ( PLEL) levels were correlated to reactor performances. These results demonstrate that , across a number of parameters such as lipids , alpha and beta diversity , and OTUs , knowledge of the microbial community structure can be used to predict , monitor , or optimise AD performance.
