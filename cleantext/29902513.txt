  A guinea pig model for new HEC methods is proposed. Two targets for HEC ( Hormonal Emergency Contraception) , ovulation and conception ( post-mating study) , were investigated using adjusted PRM treatments: ( a) Ovulation inhibition study: Injections on cycle days 10-17 , study of ovarian histology on day 18; ( b) post-mating study: Injections on cycle days 1 and 2; rate of pregnant females was recorded at autopsy on day 18. P plasma levels permitted assessment of effects on ovulation in non-conceiving animals. ( a) All controls had recently ovulated. Statistically significant anti-ovulatory effects ( p < 0.05 , Fisher 's Exact Test) were seen at 10 mg UPA ( ulipristal acetate , CDB2914) and ≥ 0.3 mg EC317; 100 % inhibition was found for EC317 at 10 , 3 , and 1 mg/day. No dosage of UPA was 100 % effective. ( b) In post-mating studies , 16 of 30 controls were pregnant. Both PRMs ( progesterone receptor modulator) exerted inhibitory effects on conception , none on imminent ovulation; 1 of 10 animals had living conceptuses after 10 mg UPA , none following 10 and 1 mg EC317/day , respectively. At pairwise comparison with controls , 10 mg was the lowest effective dosage for UPA ( p < 0.05) , and 1 mg for EC317 ( p < 0.01). P plasma levels: Significantly lower P ( p < 0.05) in subsequently pregnant vs non-pregnant controls was found on cycle day 3 or 4; this difference disappeared on day 8 or 9. This stage thus appears vulnerable to hormonal constellations and possibly PRM effects. HEC model: Effects on ovulation and conception were seen at the same dose levels of both PRM. Superior and more consistent effects of EC317 vs UPA ( factor ≥ 10) suggest higher efficacy using EC317 for HEC.
