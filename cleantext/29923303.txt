  The fate of tropical forests under climate change is unclear as a result , in part , of the uncertainty in projected changes in precipitation and in the ability of vegetation models to capture the effects of drought-induced mortality on aboveground biomass ( AGB). We evaluated the ability of a terrestrial biosphere model with demography and hydrodynamics ( Ecosystem Demography , ED2-hydro) to simulate AGB and mortality of four tropical tree plant functional types ( PFTs) that operate along light- and water-use axes. Model predictions were compared with observations of canopy trees at Barro Colorado Island ( BCI) , Panama. We then assessed the implications of eight hypothetical precipitation scenarios , including increased annual precipitation , reduced inter-annual variation , El Ni√±o-related droughts and drier wet or dry seasons , on AGB and functional diversity of the model forest<disease>. When forced with observed meteorology , ED2-hydro predictions capture multiple BCI benchmarks. ED2-hydro predicts that AGB will be sustained under lower rainfall via shifts in the functional composition of the forest<disease> , except under the drier dry-season scenario. These results support the hypothesis that inter-annual variation in mean and seasonal precipitation promotes the coexistence of functionally diverse PFTs because of the relative differences in mortality rates. If the hydroclimate becomes chronically drier or wetter , functional evenness related to drought tolerance may decline.
