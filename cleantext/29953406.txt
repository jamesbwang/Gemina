  Albeit their practical implications , psychosocial correlates of physical activity and related weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in the treatment of extreme obesity have been only sparsely addressed in adults; and even more minimally focused upon in adolescents. This research contrasted results of a 6-month social cognitive theory-based physical activity-support protocol along with standard nutrition counseling in groups of adolescents ( n = 19; agemean = 15.4 years) and adults ( n = 26 , agemean = 44.7 years) with class 3 ( extreme obesity ( overall body mass index ( BMI) mean = 53.4 kg/m2 , standard deviation ( SD) = 8.2). Although baseline total mood disturbance scores were significantly greater in both groups when contrasted with age-corresponding normative values , between-group scores did not significantly differ. BMI and physical activity changes over 3 and 6 months were significantly more favorable in the adult group. There were significant overall improvements in exercise self-efficacy , physical activity self-regulation and total mood disturbance scores , however , the self-efficacy and self-regulation increases were significant in only the adult group. Inverse relationships between changes in physical activity and BMI were stronger in the adult group. Regardless of group , simultaneous entry of changes in exercise self-efficacy , physical activity self-regulation and total mood disturbance scores , over both 3 and 6 months , significantly predicted physical activity changes ( R2-values = 0.45-0.75 , p-values < 0.001). In each model , self-regulation change was the most salient of those three psychosocial predictors. Although findings suggested that psychosocial correlates of physical activity , leading to weight change , are similar in adolescents and adults with extreme obesity , facilitation of larger effect sizes and/or foci on additional theory-based determinants may be required for clinically meaningful treatment outcomes in adolescents.
