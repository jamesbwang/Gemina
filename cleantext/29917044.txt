  Using multi-modal neuroimaging methods the current study was designed to examine the relationship between white matter microstructural integrity ( WMI) and changes in prefrontal cortex ( PFC) oxygenated hemoglobin ( HbO2) during active walking in older adults. Consistent with neural inefficiency , we hypothesized that worse WMI would be associated with a greater increase in PFC HbO2 from single- to dual-task walking in the context of worse or similar gait performance. 55 cognitively-healthy older adults ( mean age = 74.76 years , 49 % women) underwent Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI) to derive a whole-brain measure of Fractional Anisotropy ( FA) and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS) , which measured PFC HbO2 during walking tasks. Gait velocity was assessed using an instrumented walkway. A linear mixed effects model revealed that HbO2 levels increased from single to dual-task walking ( p < 0.01) given the greater cognitive demands inherent in the latter condition. Moreover , WMI moderated the effect of dual-tasking on PFC HbO2 ( p < 0.05). Specifically , worse WMI was associated with a larger increase in PFC HbO2 levels from single to dual-task walking in the context of similar gait velocity. Results suggest that compromised WMI may be a mechanism underlying inefficient brain response to cognitive demands of locomotion.
