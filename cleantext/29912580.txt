  Nonnutritive sucking<symptom> ( NNS) has been identified as having many benefits for preterm infants. NNS may improve the efficacy of oral feeding , reduce the length of time spent in orogastric ( OG) tube feeding , and shorten the length of hospital stays for preterm infants. This study aimed to assess the effect of pacifiers on preterm infants in the transition from gavage to oral feeding , their time to discharge , weight gain , and time for transition to full breastfeeding. A prospective , randomized controlled trial was conducted in our center. Ninety infants were randomized into two groups: a pacifier group ( PG) ( n = 45) and a control group ( n = 45). Eligibility criteria included body<symptom> weight less than or equal to 1,500 g , gestational age ( GA) younger than 32 weeks , tolerating at least 100 kcals/kg/day by OG feeding , growth parameters appropriate for GA , and a stable clinical condition. Mean GAs were 29.2 ± 1.86 versus 28.4 ± 1.84 weeks ( p = 0.46) , and birth weights were 1,188.2 ± 272 versus 1,112.8 ± 267 g ( p = 0.72) in the PG and CG groups , respectively. The time for transition to full oral feeding ( 38 ± 19.2 days) , time to transition to full breastfeeding ( 38.1 ± 20 days) , and time to discharge ( 48.4 ± 19.2 days) in the PG were significantly shorter compared with the control group ( 49.8 ± 23.6 , 49.1 ± 22 , 65.3 ± 30.6 days , respectively) ( p < 0.05). For preterm infants with gastrointestinal motility disturbance , similar symptoms ( regurgitation , vomiting , abdominal distension) ( n = 6 , 22 %) in the PG were significantly lower than the control group ( n = 21 , 77.8 %) ( p < 0.05). In this study , we determined that the method of giving pacifiers to preterm infants during gavage feeding reduced the infants ' transition period to oral feeding and the duration of hospital stay. In addition , the pacifiers could be used during gavage feeding and in the transition from gavage to oral/breastfeeding in preterm infants to encourage the development of sucking ability.
