  Ten years have passed since Yamanaka et al. reported the establishment of human iPS cells , which became one of the triggers to make national efforts in Japan to promote research and translation of regenerative medicine and cell therapy ( regenerative medicine etc.). However , it has been unreasonable in many cases to directly apply the existing regulation to cells processed for the purpose of use in regenerative medicine etc. , which have quite different properties from conventional pharmaceuticals and medical devices. For this reason , in recent years , drastic reforms of various regulations of medical and pharmaceutical affairs have been vigorously pursued for efficient translation of regenerative medicine etc.. Regarding medical affairs , `` The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine '' was established for the purpose of providing safe regenerative medicine etc. to patients promptly and smoothly , establishing standards for regenerative medicine providing agencies and cell culture processing facilities. Regarding pharmaceutical affairs , a new chapter and an early approval system ( conditional/term-limited approval system) for `` regenerative medical products '' , which consists of cellular and gene therapy products , were introduced into `` Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act '' , a revised and renamed version of `` Pharmaceutical Affairs Law ''. In this review article , we overview the current perspectives of regulations and challenges for translation of regenerative medicine etc. in Japan.
