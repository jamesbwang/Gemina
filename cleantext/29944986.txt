  Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs) are organ resident APCs capable of antigen presentation and subsequent tolerization of T cells under physiological conditions. In this study , we investigated whether LSEC pretreatment with NOD-like receptor ( NLR) agonists can switch the cells from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state and promote the development of T cell immunity. LSECs constitutively express NOD1 , NOD2 and RIPK2. Stimulation of LSECs with DAP induced the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases and upregulated the expression of chemokines ( CXCL2/9 , CCL2/7/8) and cytokines ( IFN-γ , TNF-α and IL-2). Pretreatment of LSECs with DAP induced signiﬁcantly increased IFN-γ and IL-2-production by HBV-stimulated CD8
