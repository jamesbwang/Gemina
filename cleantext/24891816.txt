  Research has shown that exposure to a concussion definition ( CD) increases self-reported concussion history ( SRCH) immediately , however , no research has been performed that examines the effects of exposure to a CD on SRCH over time. Collegiate recreational student-athletes ( RSAs) have limited access to monitoring and supervision by medical staff. As such , recognition of concussion symptoms and need for medical management oftentimes falls upon the RSA<pathogen>. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a novel questionnaire on the SRCH of RSAs. A two-part questionnaire was sent to RSAs participating is sports with a greater than average risk of concussion at a university in Arizona. Data from 171 RSAs were analyzed to assess the change in RSAs ' suspected concussion estimates pre- and post-exposure to a CD and concussion symptom worksheet , as well as over the short-term ( 2.5 months). Approximately one-third of RSAs reported an increase in suspected concussion estimates immediately following exposure to the questionnaire , but the change was not maintained over the short-term. The results suggest that a single exposure to a CD is ineffective at increasing short-term SRCH estimates.
