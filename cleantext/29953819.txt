  HIV<pathogen> resistance emerging against antiretroviral drugs represents a great threat to the continued prolongation of the lifespans of HIV-infected patients. Therefore , methods capable of predicting resistance susceptibility in the development of compounds are in great need. By targeting the major reverse transcription residues Y181 , K103 , and L100 , we used the biological activities of compounds against these enzymes and the wild-type reverse transcriptase to create Na√Øve Bayes Networks. Through this machine learning approach , we could predict , with high accuracy , whether a compound would be susceptible to a loss of potency due to resistance. Also , we could perfectly predict retrospectively whether compounds would be susceptible to both a K103 mutant RT and a Y181 mutant RT.. In the study presented here , our method outperformed a traditional molecular mechanics approach. This method should be of broad interest beyond drug discovery efforts , and serves to expand the utility of machine learning for the prediction of physical , chemical , or biological properties using the vast information available in the literature.
