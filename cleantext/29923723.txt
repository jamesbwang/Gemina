  Equations relating the radiative and nonradiative decay rate constants of singlet excitons in super-radiant aggregates to the relative intensities of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks in the emission spectrum were derived and tested against experimental data. In many instances , these equations eliminate the need for a time-dependent fluorescence decay measurement. They can also be useful in determining the fluorescence quantum yield.
