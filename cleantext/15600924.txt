  Recently , a mechanism of formation of light bullets ( LBs) in wide-aperture passively mode-locked lasers was proposed. The conditions for existence and stability of these bullets , found in the long cavity limit , were studied theoretically under the mean field ( MF) approximation using a Haus-type model equation. In this paper , we relax the MF approximation and study LB formation in a model of a wide-aperture three section laser with a long diffractive section and short absorber and gain sections. To this end , we derive a non-local delay-differential equation ( NDDE) model and demonstrate by means of numerical simulations that this model supports stable LBs. We observe that the predictions about the regions of existence and stability of the LBs made previously using MF laser models agree well with the results obtained using the NDDE model. Moreover , we demonstrate that the general conclusions based upon the Haus model that regard the robustness of the LBs remain true in the NDDE model valid beyond the MF approximation , when the gain , losses and diffraction per cavity round trip are not small perturbations anymore.This article is part of the theme issue ` Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry , photonics and biology ( part 1) '.
