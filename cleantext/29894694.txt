  Chromatin-modifying enzymes , and specifically the protein arginine methyltransferases ( PRMTs) , have emerged as important targets in cancer. Here , we investigated the role of CARM1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using conditional knockout mice , we show that loss of CARM1 has little effect on normal hematopoiesis. Strikingly , knockout of Carm1 abrogates both the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) driven by oncogenic transcription factors. We show that CARM1 knockdown impairs cell-cycle progression , promotes myeloid differentiation , and ultimately induces apoptosis. Finally , we utilize a selective , small-molecule inhibitor of CARM1 to validate the efficacy of CARM1 inhibition in leukemia<disease> cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively , this work suggests that targeting CARM1 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML.
