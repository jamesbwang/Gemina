  A variety of techniques currently exist for ulnar collateral ligament ( UCL) reconstruction in symptomatic overhead athletes , all with the potential complication of fracture about the humeral or ulnar tunnels. Far cortical button fixation is a reproducible , biomechanically attractive option; however , no clinical series has been published on this technique to date. This study reports the clinical outcomes , with minimum 2-year follow-up , of a dual far cortical button suspension technique for UCL reconstruction in athletes. A retrospective evaluation was performed of 23 consecutive athletes who underwent UCL reconstruction with the use of ulnar and humeral-sided far cortical button fixation with minimum 2 years of follow-up. Data were collected from electronic medical records and patient telephone calls. The primary outcome was return to sport. Secondary outcomes included Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand score , range of motion , and complications. We included 23 athletes with a mean follow-up of 47.2 months ( range , 24-81 months). Autograft was used in 22 patients ( 16 palmaris , 6 gracilis<pathogen> , 1 semitendinosus , and 1 gracilis<pathogen> allograft). Overall , 82.6 % ( 19 of 23) of patients returned to sport. At final follow-up , the average Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand score was 3.8 , and range of motion averaged 0 ° to 140 ° , with 87 % ( 20 of 23) of patients achieving full motion. The visual analog scale score improved from 3.8 preoperatively to 0.2 at the final follow-up ( P < .0001). There was 1 reconstruction failure. The humeral and ulnar far cortical button suspension technique provides a new UCL fixation option with theoretically lower concern for tunnel fracture and with predictable return to sport and good functional outcomes.
