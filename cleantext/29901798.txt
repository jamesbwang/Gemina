  Burn injury results in a severe systemic inflammatory response which is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) , even without associated inhalation injury. Venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( VV-ECMO) has been implemented in various cases of ARDS to provide support and allow for protective lung ventilation strategies. We report the case of a 27-year-old man presenting with a 60 % total body surface area partial thickness burn who developed refractory ARDS with Murray Score of 3.75. ECMO was initiated on hospital day 9 for a total of 10 days with concurrent lung-protective ventilation. He subsequently recovered and was discharged on hospital day 48. ECMO should be considered as an adjunctive strategy in burn patients without inhalation injury to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury when high levels of support are needed to achieve adequate ventilation in patients with ARDS.
