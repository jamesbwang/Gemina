  To compare the optic nerve head morphology among primary open-angle glaucoma , non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy eyes , their fellow healthy eyes and control eyes , using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging. Observational cross-sectional study including 88 eyes of 68 patients. In this study , 23 non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy eyes , 17 fellow unaffected eyes , 25 primary open-angle glaucoma eyes , and 23 age-matched control eyes were included. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and optic disk area were evaluated. Bruch 's membrane opening diameter , optic cup depth , anterior lamina cribrosa depth , and prelaminar tissue thickness were assessed. Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and primary open-angle glaucoma eyes had similar visual field mean deviation and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ( P = 0.6 and P = 0.56 , respectively). Bruch 's membrane opening diameter was significantly larger in primary open-angle glaucoma eyes than in control eyes ( P = 0.02). Lamina cribrosa and disk cup were deeper in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma than both control and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy eyes ( P < 0.001). Prelaminar tissue thickness was significantly thinner in primary open-angle glaucoma eyes than in non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy eyes ( P < 0.001). Lamina cribrosa was shallower in both non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and unaffected fellow eyes compared to healthy eyes ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.04 , respectively). No differences were found in the optic disk area. A forward lamina cribrosa placement and not a smaller disk could be involved in the pathogenesis of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. A significantly larger Bruch 's membrane opening diameter was found in primary open-angle glaucoma eyes compared with control eyes. This issue has clinical implications because Bruch 's membrane opening has been considered a stable reference for disk-related measures.
