  There is a great concern regarding the possible adverse effects of electromagnetic radiation ( EMR). This study investigated the effects of EMR induced by Wi-Fi ( 2.45 GHz) on insulin secretion and antioxidant redox systems in the rat pancreas. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in the weight range of 230 to 260 g were divided into control , sham , Wi-Fi exposed groups. After long term exposure ( 4 h/day for 45 days) to Wi-Fi electromagnetic radiation , plasma levels of glucose and insulin during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test were measured. Islet insulin secretion and content , lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in pancreas of rats were determined. Our data showed that the weight gain in the WI-FI exposed group was significantly lower than the control group ( p < 0.05). Wi-Fi ( 2.45 GHz) exposed group showed hyperglycemia. Plasma insulin level and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islet were significantly reduced in the Wi-Fi exposed group. EMR emitted from Wi-Fi caused a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and a significant decrease in GSH level , SOD and GPx activities of the pancreas. these data showed that EMR of Wi-Fi leads to hyperglycemia , increased oxidative stress and impaired insulin secretion in the rat pancreatic islets.
