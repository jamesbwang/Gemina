  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of an automated kilo-voltage selection software for the reduction of lens dose in pediatric CT scans. Two metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor ( MOSFET) detectors measured the lens dose in two anthropomorphic 1- and 5-year-old phantoms. These phantoms were scanned using a clinical pediatric brain protocol at 120 kVp as a control with the MDCT scanner. Scans were then repeated using automated kilovoltage software. The automated kilovoltage was set to operate at tube potentials of 120 , 110 , and 100 kVp. Dose savings were compared with the average lens dose of both eyes between automated kilovoltage and the control setting. Image quality was studied by contrast-to-noise ratios ( CNRs) for each setting. The mean ( ± SD) lens dose from the routine brain scan without automated kilovoltage was 0.92 ± 0.03 cGy and 0.81 ± 0.03 cGy for the 1- and 5-year-old phantoms , respectively. Use of the automated kilovoltage software at 120 kVp , 110 kVp , and 100 kVp resulted in dose reductions of 9.8 % , 17.4 % , and 19.6 % , respectively , for the 1-year-old phantom and 1.2 % , 8.6 % , and 17.3 % , respectively , for the 5-year-old phantom. The CNR for all automated kilovoltage scans was within 11 % of the control scans for the 1-year-old and within 6 % for the 5-year-old phantom. Our results show that automated kilovoltage software is effective for reducing the radiation dose to the lens of the eye in pediatric patients. Furthermore , the image quality by CNR remained acceptable within 11 % of the baseline for all kilovoltage settings used.
