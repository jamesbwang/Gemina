  According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine , acupuncture points are very important in the treatment of various clinical conditions. This paper focuses on the correlation and connotation of two scientific propositions , i ï¼Ž e. , the primordial state and sensitized state of acupoints. We hold that the modern concept of acupuncture point may be not the same as the traditional one in the connotations. The current acupuncture points are probably referred to the spots for acupuncture stimulation , rather than simple acupoints , while the sensitized state is possibly one of its characteristics. The sensitized acupuncture point in fact may not be the main treatment locus for strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors. Contemporary research and establishment of theoretical framework should aim at developing a complete knowledge system pertaining to acupuncture-moxibustion medicine rather than deviating or separating it from the fundamental principles of the overall regulation of acupuncture or moxibustion treatment.
