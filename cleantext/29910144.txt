  This pilot study aimed at assessing the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS) of the occipital nerve ( ON) to treat chronic refractory headache<symptom> secondary to intracranial endovascular procedures ( iEVP) in 4 patients. The duration of ON-TENS therapy was only 1 month ( n = 2) or longer than 4 months ( n = 2). Overall , pain intensity decreased from 7.8 ( on a 0-10 scale) at baseline to 0.8 at 6 months after ON-TENS therapy initiation ( -90 %) , while drug treatment was reduced from 34.3 to 0.8 ( -98 %) on the medication quantification scale. ON-TENS is a simple technique that may benefit patients with post-iEVP refractory
