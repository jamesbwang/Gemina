  Solid-state nanopores ( ssNPs) are extremely versatile single-molecule sensors and their potential have been established in numerous biomedical applications. However , the fabrication of ssNPs remains the main bottleneck to their widespread use. Herein , we introduce a rapid and localizable ssNPs fabrication method based on feedback-controlled optical etching. We show that a focused blue laser beam irreversibly etches silicon nitride ( SiN
