  Neurons in the lateral intraparietal ( LIP) area of Macaques exhibit both sensory and oculomotor preparatory responses. During perceptual decision making , the preparatory responses have been shown to track the state of the evolving evidence leading to the decision. The sensory responses are known to reflect categorical properties of visual stimuli , but it is not known whether these responses also track evolving evidence. We recorded neural responses from lateral intraparietal area of 2 female rhesus monkeys during a direction discrimination task. We compared sensory and oculomotor-preparatory responses in the same neurons when either the discriminandum ( random dot motion) or an eye movement<symptom> choice-target was in the neuron 's response field. The neural responses in both configurations reflected the strength and direction of motion and were correlated with the animal 's choice , albeit more prominently when the choice-target was in the response field. However , the variance and autocorrelation pattern of only the motor preparatory responses reflected the process of evidence accumulation. Simulations suggest that the task related activity of sensory responses could be inherited through lateral interactions with neurons that are carrying evidence accumulation signals in their motor-preparatory responses. The results are consistent with the proposal that evolving decision processes are supported by persistent neural activity in the service of actions or intentions , as opposed to high-order representations of stimulus properties.
