  Multimodal fusion has been regarded as a promising tool to discover covarying patterns of multiple imaging types impaired in brain diseases , such as schizophrenia ( SZ). In this article , we aim to investigate the covarying abnormalities underlying SZ in a large Chinese Han population ( 307 SZs , 298 healthy controls ( HCs)). Four types of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) features , including regional homogeneity ( ReHo) from resting-state functional MRI , gray matter volume ( GM) from structural MRI , fractional anisotropy ( FA) from diffusion MRI , and functional network connectivity ( FNC) resulted from group independent component analysis , were jointly analyzed by a data-driven multivariate fusion method. Results suggest that a widely distributed network disruption appears in SZ patients , with synchronous changes in both functional and structural regions , especially the basal ganglia network , salience network ( SAN<pathogen>) , and the frontoparietal network. Such a multimodal coalteration was also replicated in another independent Chinese sample ( 40 SZs , 66 HCs). Our results on auditory verbal hallucination ( AVH) also provide evidence for the hypothesis that prefrontal hypoactivation and temporal hyperactivation in SZ may lead to failure of executive control and inhibition , which is relevant to AVH. In addition , impaired working memory performance was found associated with GM reduction and FA decrease in SZ in prefrontal and superior temporal area , in both discovery and replication datasets. In summary , by leveraging multiple imaging and clinical information into one framework to observe brain in multiple views , we can integrate multiple inferences about SZ from large-scale population and offer unique perspectives regarding the missing links between the brain function and structure that may not be achieved by separate unimodal analyses.
