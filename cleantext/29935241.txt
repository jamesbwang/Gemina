  This work reports on the valorization of residues from Posidonia oceanica leaves for the purpose of obtaining lignocellulosic fractions of interest for the development of bio-based materials for food packaging. The lignocellulosic fractions were characterized , thereby confirming the purification of cellulose and showing increases in crystallinity and thermal stability after the consecutive extraction steps. Subsequently , pure lignocellulosic films were obtained and characterized and the pure cellulose film showed the best properties in terms of mechanical performance and water vapor permeability. Finally , composite starch films containing lignocellulosic fractions were developed by melt compounding and characterized. Although the film containing the pure cellulose additive showed the optimum improvement in terms of mechanical properties ( with an increase of 85 % in the elastic modulus and 38 % in the tensile strength) , similar water vapor permeability reduction ( ~ 40 %) was achieved with the least purified fractions , explained by their effect on starch gelatinization , as evidenced by SAXS/WAXS.
