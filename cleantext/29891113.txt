  Paraoxonase-1 ( PON1) is a lipolactonase implicated in the elimination of carcinogenic free radicals and in the scavenging mechanisms to maintain oxidative balance<symptom>. The objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate possible alterations in serum PON1 activity in patients with cancer. A systematic search of the observational studies in humans published in the last 15 years was performed through Medline databases following the PRISMA and STARLITE statements. Further , a keyword-based computerized search with restrictions on publication date , and a meta-analysis of case-control studies was performed. In total , 23 studies were included most of which reported decreased PON1 activity in patients with cancer. This could indicate impaired defense ability against oxidative stress with potential implications in cell proliferation , promotion of genetic instability , and alterations in cellular sensitivity to chemotherapy. This systematic review and meta-analysis confirms a consistent association between cancer and decreased serum PON1 activities. These findings may open fruitful lines of research with clinical relevance , and an understanding of molecular alterations underlying carcinogenesis.
