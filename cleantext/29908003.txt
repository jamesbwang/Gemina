  Recently , members of the MATE family have been implicated in aluminium ( Al) tolerance by facilitating citrate efflux in plants. The aim of the present work was to perform a molecular characterisation of the MATE2 gene in bread wheat. Here , we cloned a member of the MATE gene family in bread wheat and named it TaMATE2 , which showed the typical secondary structure of MATE-type transporters maintaining all the 12 transmembrane domains. Amplification in Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines revealed that TaMATE2 is located on the long arm of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. The transcript expression of TaMATE2 homoeologues in two diverse bread wheat genotypes , Barbela 7/72/92 ( Al-tolerant) and Anahuac ( Al-sensitive) , suggested that TaMATE2 is expressed in both root and shoot tissues of bread wheat , but mainly confined to root rather than shoot tissues. A time-course analysis of TaMATE2 homoeologue transcript expression revealed the Al responsive expression of TaMATE2 in root apices of the Al-tolerant genotype , Barbela 7/72/92. Considering the high similarity of TaMATE2 together with similar Al responsive expression pattern as of ScFRDL2 from rye and OsFRDL2 from rice , it is likely that TaMATE2 also encodes a citrate transporter. Furthermore , the TaMATE2-D homoeologue appears to be near the previously reported locus ( wPt0077) on chromosome 1D for Al tolerance. In conclusion , molecular cloning of TaMATE2 homoeologues , particularly TaMATE2-D , provides a plausible candidate for Al tolerance in bread wheat that can be used for the development of more Al-tolerant cultivars in this staple crop.
