  Intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) causes blood-brain barrier ( BBB) damage along with altered element levels in the brain. BBB permeability was quantified at 3 , 7 , and 14 days with Evans Blue dye after collagenase-induced ICH in rat. At peak permeability ( day 3) , a gadolinium ( Gd)- based contrast agent was injected to further characterize BBB disruption , and X-ray fluorescence imaging ( XFI) was used to map Gd , Fe , Cl , and other elements. XFI revealed that Ca , Cl , Gd , and Fe concentrations were significantly elevated , whereas K was significantly decreased. Therefore , using Gd-XFI , we co-determined BBB dysfunction with alterations in the metallome , including those that contribute to cell death and functional outcome. Warfarin was administered 3 days post-ICH to investigate whether additional or new bleeding occurs during peak BBB dysfunction , and hematoma volume was assessed on day 4. Warfarin administration prolonged bleeding time after a peripheral cut-induced bleed , but warfarin did not worsen hematoma volume. Accordingly , extensive BBB leakage occurred after ICH , but did not appear to affect total hematoma size.
