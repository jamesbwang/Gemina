  This report uses routinely collected data in the Defense Medical Surveillance System ( DMSS) to characterize the incidence and burden of medical conditions throughout the careers of service members separating from the active component of the U.S. Armed Forces between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015. Three surveillance periods between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2015 were defined by each individual 's time in service: early ( first 6 months) , middle ( middle 6 months) , and late ( last 6 months). Overall , separating service members were most often aged 25-34 years ( 59.4 %) , male ( 84.0 %) , non-Hispanic white ( 64.0 %) , junior enlisted ( 52.4 %) , in the Marine Corps ( 33.1 %) , serving in a repair/engineering occupation ( 33.0 %) , and had never deployed ( 52.5 %). The top five burden of disease categories across surveillance periods by sex were remarkably similar , including mental health disorders , which exhibited similar upward trends across the three surveillance periods ( males: 1.3 % , 17.0 % , and 35.6 %; females: 1.8 % , 15.1 % , and 32.4 % , respectively). The most common diagnoses exhibiting upward , downward , or bimodal trends by incidence rate differences were mental health disorders , respiratory infections/diseases , and musculoskeletal diseases , respectively.
