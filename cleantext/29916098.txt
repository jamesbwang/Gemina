  Hyperuricemia has a close relationship with cardiovascular diseases including heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , it is controversial whether xanthine oxidase inhibition has benefits for patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. We designed the Effect of Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitor in Chronic<symptom> Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Patients Complicated with Hyperuricemia study ( Excited-UA study) to compare the beneficial effects between a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor , topiroxostat , and a conventional agent , allopurinol , in patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and hyperuricemia. We focus on serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) level , echocardiography-based cardiac function , vascular endothelial function , renal function , inflammation<symptom> , and oxidative stress. The excited-UA is a prospective , randomized , open-label , blinded-endpoint clinical trial designed to prove our hypothesis that topiroxostat is more effective than allopurinol in patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and hyperuricemia. A total of 140 patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and hyperuricemia ( plasma brain natriuretic peptide level ≥ 40 pg/mL and serum uric acid level ≥ 7.0 mg/dL) are randomly assigned ( ratio 1:1) into either the topiroxostat group ( 40-160 mg/day) or allopurinol group ( 100-300 mg/day) , to achieve the target uric acid level of 6.0 mg/dL. According to the protocol , all patients are followed up annually for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is percent change in serum NT-proBNP level at 24 weeks from baseline. The Excited-UA study would provide novel evidence for the clinical relevancy of xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor treatment in patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and hyperuricemia.
