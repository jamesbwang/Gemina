  Individuals differ in how they perceive , remember , and think. There is evidence for the existence of distinct subgroups that differ in cognitive performance within the older population. However , it is less clear how individual differences in cognition in old age are linked to differences in brain-based measures. We used latent-profile analysis on n-back working-memory ( WM) performance to identify subgroups in a large sample of older adults ( n = 181; age = 64-68 years). Our analysis identified one larger normal subgroup with higher performance ( n = 113; 63 %) , and a second smaller subgroup ( n = 55; 31 %) with lower performance. The low-performing subgroup showed weaker load-dependent BOLD modulation and lower connectivity within the fronto-parietal network ( FPN) as well as between FPN and striatum<pathogen> during n-back , along with lower FPN connectivity at rest. This group also exhibited lower FPN structural integrity , lower frontal dopamine D2 binding potential , inferior performance on offline WM tests , and a trend-level genetic predisposition for lower dopamine-system efficiency. By contrast , this group exhibited relatively intact episodic memory and associated brain measures ( i.e. , hippocampal volume , structural , and functional connectivity within the default-mode network). Collectively , these data provide converging evidence for the existence of a group of older adults with impaired WM functioning characterized by reduced cortico-striatal coupling and aberrant cortico-cortical integrity within FPN.
