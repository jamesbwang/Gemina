  A discussion with regard to the most optimal surgical procedure in nontoxic multinodular goitre ( NTMNG). We assessed and compared three main types of operations in 2032 patients with NTMNG. This is a retrospective study of 2032 patients operated on in one center due to NTMNG. The observation period was 48 to 120 months ( mean and SD: 87 Â± 20). The early complications included uni- and bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve<symptom> paralysis<symptom> ( URLNP , BRLNP) , overt tetany ( OT) , and postoperative bleeding ( POB). We observed after TT , STT , and DO URLNP: 15 ( 1.73 %) , 3 ( 0.64 %) , and 2 ( 0.28 %) , respectively ( Performing less radical surgery in NTMNG is associated with a significantly lower risk of early and late URLNP and OT. In the case of BRLNP ( early and persistent) and POB , no statistically significant differences are seen. The occurrence of ITC is higher following more radical surgeries. Less radical surgery is connected with a higher risk of RG.
