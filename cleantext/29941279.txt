  Injury to the bladder and/or ureters is the cause of significant morbidity , and efforts to reduce these injuries are important. This debate presents arguments that both support , and refute , the value of routine cystoscopy at the time of benign hysterectomy. Proponents of routine cystoscopy state that injuries are more likely to be detected and repaired when cystoscopy is routinely performed. Dissenters counter that the available evidence does not support routine cystoscopy at the current rates of lower urinary tract injury , and the cystoscopy should be performed only when injury is suspected or when performing hysterectomy with concurrent procedures that increase the risk of lower urinary tract injury.
