  Energy metabolism is essential for T cell function. However , how persistent antigenic stimulation affects T cell metabolism is unknown. Here , we report that long-term in vivo antigenic exposure induced a specific deficit in numerous metabolic enzymes. Accordingly , T cells exhibited low basal glycolytic flux and limited respiratory capacity. Strikingly , blockade of inhibitory receptor PD-1 stimulated the production of IFNγ in chronic T cells , but failed to shift their metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis , as observed in effector T cells. Instead , chronic T cells appeared to rely on oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation ( FAO) to produce ATP for IFNγ synthesis. Check-point blockade , however , increased mitochondrial production of superoxide and reduced viability and effector function. Thus , in the absence of a glycolytic switch , PD-1-mediated inhibition appears essential for limiting oxidative metabolism linked to effector function in chronic T cells , thereby promoting survival and functional fitness.
