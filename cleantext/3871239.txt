  Patients with inner ear damage associated with bilateral vestibular impairment often ask `` how much damage do I have. '' Although there are presently three clinical methods of measuring semicircular canal vestibular function; electronystagmography ( ENG or VENG) , rotatory chair and video head-impulse ( VHIT) testing; none of these methods provides a method of measuring total vestibular output. Theory suggests that the slow cumulative eye position can be derived from the rotatory chair test by multiplying the high frequency gain by the time constant , or the `` Gain
