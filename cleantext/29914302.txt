  The role of sex on the association of plasma prolactin levels with risperidone ( R) and 9-hydroxyrisperidone ( 9-OHR) concentrations is investigated. Plasma R and prolactin concentrations , CYP2D6 and exon 21 and 26 ABCB1 gene variants were studied in 110 patients. In females , a 1 ng/ml increase in R levels was associated with a significant 1.02 % increase in prolactin levels. In males , a 1 ng/ml increase in 9-OHR levels was associated with a significant 1.18 % increase in prolactin levels. ABCB1 haplotype 12 had significant but opposite effects in males and females. In the combined sample , 9-OHR , but not R levels had significant effects on prolactin levels. Genes had sex-specific effects on risperidone-associated prolactin elevations.
