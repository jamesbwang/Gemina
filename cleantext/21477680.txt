  Incorporating thorough contraception counselling into an abortion<disease> consultation is challenging. We compared contraceptive choices and methods received between two counselling models: ( 1) telephone counselling separate from the abortion<disease> consultation and ( 2) face-to-face counselling integrated into the consultation. We obtained de-identified data on demographic characteristics and contraceptive methods that had been chosen and received by women who had an abortion<disease> at British Pregnancy Advisory Service between 2011 and 2014 and had a choice of counselling models. We compared the characteristics of women who chose each model of counselling and the contraceptive methods they chose and received using Fisher 's exact test , and used logistic regression to explore associations between counselling model and choice and receipt of Tier 1 contraceptive methods ( intrauterine contraception , implant , sterilisation) , controlling for covariates. The sample included 18573 women. Women choosing telephone counselling were more likely to be non-White ( 34 % vs 22 % , P < 0.001) , to report prior difficulty obtaining contraception ( 40 % vs 3 % , P < 0.001) , and to have not used contraception at conception ( 37.1 % vs 33.8 % , P < 0.001). Overall , 93 % of women chose a contraceptive method after counselling. Telephone counselling was significantly associated with both choosing and receiving a Tier 1 method ( OR 1.80 , 95 % CI 1.66 to 1.96 and OR 1.60 , 95 % CI 1.42 to 1.71 , respectively). Fewer women who had telephone counselling received a less effective method ( eg , condom , diaphragm) compared with those who chose integrated counselling ( 6.0 % vs 19.2 % , P < 0.001). Telephone-based contraception counselling separate from the abortion<disease> consultation may serve some women better than integrated counselling , particularly those reporting past difficulty obtaining contraception.
