  In the current study , we sought to determine whether or not the endogenous retroviral ev21 influences feathering type of chickens , and if one mutation locus in the unoccupied repeat ( UR) region can be used to predict the corresponding feathering type and genotype. The distribution of ev21 as well as the mutation locus in UR and occupied site ( OR) regions was detected in HY-line gray progenitor ( HYGP) 4 lines , HY-line brown ( HYB) and Taihang chickens ( TH). Furthermore , a detection method for the genotype resulting in late feathering ( LF) phenotype was developed by double PCR using C line of HYGP , C line of Dawu progenitor , commercial line of HY-line gray ( HYG) males , LF males of TH and Bashang long-tail chickens ( BS). Results indicated that a product of 7590 bp from the long fragment amplification was observed to be a partial segment of ev21 , and was linked with the LF phenotype in HYGP but not in HYB and TH chickens. A total of 2 of 35 males and 10 of 29 females of TH LF chickens were found to be ev21 negative. HaeIII RFLP mutations of 1450 bp of UR , 1440 bp of OR , and 538 bp in the UR and OR common region were analyzed , and genotypic features at the locus correlated with the feathering type phenotype in HYGP , but exhibited no significant effects in HYB and TH chickens. The cut-off of relative intensity of 857 and 1305 bp from the double PCR for distinction between homozygous and heterozygous LF males was 1.37. In conclusion , ev21 and the HaeIII RFLP patterns within the locus in UR can not be used for prediction of feathering type phenotypes in Chinese heritage chickens. However , the partial duplication of PRLR and SPEF2 were able to predict the LF phenotype. Therefore , the double PCR detecting products of 857 and 1305 bp described herein could be used for the accurate identification of genotypes influencing feathering type.
