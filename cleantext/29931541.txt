  Previous studies suggested that right ventricular pacing was associated with pacing-induced cardiac dysfunction ( PICD). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics including the incidence of undiagnosed cardiac sarcoidosis ( CS) in patients with atrioventricular block ( AVB) who manifest PICD. We retrospectively investigated consecutive patients with permanent pacemaker ( PPM) undergoing a first-generator replacement surgery with a new PPM or an upgrade procedure to a cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) device between December 1 , 2011 and June 30 , 2017. Patients with AVB showing normal echocardiographic findings before PPM implantation were included and divided into 2 groups: patients with post-PPM left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) < 40 % and/or undergoing an upgrade procedure to CRT ( PICD group) and patients with post-PPM LVEF â‰¥ 40 % who underwent replacement surgery with a new PPM ( no-PICD group). There were 15 and 41 patients in the PICD and no-PICD groups , respectively. A wider-paced QRS duration just after the PPM implantation and/or lower pre-PPM LVEF was observed in the PICD group. Furthermore , 46.7 % of the PICD patients ( 7/15) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for CS according to the guideline of the Japanese Circulation Society , although no patients fulfilled these criteria before PPM implantation. In conclusion , a high incidence of CS was observed in patients with AVB who had PICD. However , none of these patients was diagnosed with CS before PPM implantation.
