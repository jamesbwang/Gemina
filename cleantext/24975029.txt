  Glucose is the central nervous system 's only energy source. Imaging techniques capable to detect pathological alterations of the brain metabolism are useful in different diagnostic processes. Such techniques are also beneficial for assessing the evaluation efficacy of therapies in pre-clinical and clinical stages of diseases. Chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a possible alternative to positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging that has been widely explored in cancer research in humans and animal models. We propose that pathological alterations in brain 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2DG) uptake , typical of neurodegenerative diseases , can be detected with CEST MRI. Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of amyloid precusrsor protein ( APP23) , a model of Alzheimer 's disease , analyzed with CEST MRI showed a clear reduction of 2DG uptake in different brain regions. This was reminiscent of the cerebral condition observed in Alzheimer 's patients. The results indicate the feasibility of CEST for analyzing the brain metabolic state , with better image resolution than PET in experimental models.
