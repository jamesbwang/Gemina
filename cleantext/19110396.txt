  The nursing shortage and its impact on patient care are well-documented global issues. Patients living with cancer as a chronic illness have many psychosocial problems and often lack adequate support as a result of ineffective nurse-patient communication. A review of the literature on factors influencing the delivery of psychosocial care to cancer patients indicates that the delivery of psychosocial care in routine cancer nursing within a biomedical healthcare system has not been widely explored. To explore patients ' perceptions of their experiences with nurse-patient communication in an oncological clinical environment. A focused ethnographic study was undertaken in two oncology wards of a hospital in Hong Kong. Data were collected through observations of the ward environment , the activities and instances of nurse-patient communication , semi-structured interviews with patients , and a review of nursing documents. Two main themes were identified: 1. Nurses ' workload and the environment and 2. Nurse-patient partnership and role expectations. Within these two themes were related subthemes on: Sympathy for the busy nurses; Prioritizing calls to the nurses; Partnership through relationship; Nurses ' role in psychosocial care; and Reduction of psychosocial concerns through physical care. Many cancer patients do not expect to receive psychosocial care in the form of emotional talks or counseling from busy nurses , but appreciate the attention paid by nurses to their physiological and physical needs. Nurse-patient partnerships in cancer care may reduce the potential workload of nurses. The psychosocial needs of cancer patients could be optimized by providing good physical care through effective communication within a time-constrained oncology setting.
