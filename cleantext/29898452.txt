  <br> To assess the role of pharmacist in modifying CVDs risk factors among Lebanese adults in urban and rural areas. <br> Materials ( Subjects) and Methods <br> In a prospective survey , 865 out of 1000 participants aged â‰¥ 45 , previously interviewed , agreed to be followed at 1 and 2 year time points. Parameters including blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , lipid profile , blood glucose , average number of risk factors , and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD) risk were assessed and evaluated at the beginning of the study , then after 1 and 2 years. <br> Results: <br> After patient 's education and during both follow ups , the mean average body mass index ( BMI) and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) statistically decreased significantly. The lipid profile as well statistically improved significantly during both follow-ups. to around 9 %. Further statistically significant improvements in ASCVD risk occurred during the second follow-up to around 8 %. Monitoring parameters revealed statistical significant improvements as well. <br> Conclusion: <br> This study showed that a plan that includes pharmacists , who regularly monitor and follow-up patients , could improve CVD prevention through reduction of risk factors. <br>.
