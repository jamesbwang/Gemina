  Cowper 's gland syringoceles are rare cystic dilations of the Cowper 's gland duct. They are typically diagnosed in childhood but occasionally occur in adults. We report the case of a 28-year-old man who presented with a painful perineal and inferior scrotal mass and was found to have a large Cowper 's gland syringocele extending into the scrotum associated with a scrotal abscess<disease> Treatment consisted of surgical excision. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of this case are described.
