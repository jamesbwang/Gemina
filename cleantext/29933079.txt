  Post-transplant hypertension ( PTH) is a common complication in cyclosporine immunosuppressed patients; however choosing the right antihypertensive medication is challenging. In a long-term observational study ( ≤ 13y) we examined different antihypertensive medications on graft/patient survival of kidney recipients with pre-existing and PTH. Altogether thirty-three co-variables were analyzed including dose and type of immunosuppressive and antihypertensive medication , co-medications , serum biochemistries and the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR). A Cox-proportional hazard multivariable survival model was developed to detect a Hazard Ratio ( HR) of 3.0 at the Bonferroni corrected level α = 0.0015. Importantly , a significant relationship between immunosuppressive cyclosporine dose/serum concentration , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and GFR ( p < 0.001) was observed with post-transplant hypertension being a major risk factor ( HR6 .1) for graft/patient survival. Although all medications lowered effectively elevated SBP the risk of graft failure/death was significantly increased when hypertension was treated with ACE inhibitors or β-blockers ( HR3 .3 and 3.1) but not with angiotensin receptor- and/or Ca-channel blockers. Antihypertensive medication was associated with a decline in GFR but β-blockers alone or in combination with ARB and/or CCB improved GFR. Neither BMI nor any of the drug combinations used in immunosuppression , i.e. prednisolone , mycophenolic acid , azathioprine and/or sirolimus influenced patient and/or graft survival while decision tree analyses informed on complex dependencies between immunosuppressive medications , dose of anti-hypertensive drug and diuretics in the management of hypertension. In conclusion , our study is suggestive for graft/patient survival to be influenced by the class of antihypertensive medication. A prospective randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm the results.
