  Mass spectrometry is the science and technology of ions. As such , it is concerned with generating ions , measuring their properties , following their reactions , isolating them , and using them to build and transform materials. Instrumentation is an essential element of these activities , and analytical applications are one driving force. Work from the Aston Laboratories at Purdue University 's Department of Chemistry is described here , with an emphasis on accelerated reactions of ions in solution and small-scale synthesis; ion/surface collision processes , including surface-induced dissociation ( SID) and ion soft landing; and applications to tissue imaging. Our special interest in chirality and the chemistry behind the origins of life is also featured together with the exciting area of tissue diagnostics.
