  Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β ( Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal-cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats , a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features , including age-dependent Aβ accumulation , tauopathy , neuronal loss , and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia , TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition , the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally , these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal-cortical network dynamics , and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles , which occur during awake , behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing , having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats , which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients , may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.
