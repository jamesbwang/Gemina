  Results from experimental studies suggest that psychosis and psychosis liability are associated with increased cortisol levels and blunted cortisol reactivity , and that use of antipsychotics may reduce these aberrations. Here , we report on overall cortisol , diurnal slope , and cortisol stress reactivity in everyday life in psychosis and psychosis liability using the experience sampling method ( ESM). Our sample consisted of individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorder currently on ( MPD; n = 53) or off antipsychotic medication ( NMPD; n = 20) , first-degree relatives of psychotic patients ( REL; n = 47) , and healthy volunteers ( HV; n = 67). Saliva samples were collected throughout the day on six consecutive days and analyzed for cortisol levels. Simultaneously , stressfulness of the current activity was assessed with ESM questionnaires. We found no group differences in overall cortisol level between groups , but REL had a steeper diurnal slope than HV; in MPD a trend was found in the same direction. Regarding reactivity to stressful activities , results indicated attenuation of the cortisol response in both patient groups compared to HV. These results do not confirm reports of increased cortisol levels in psychosis , but provide evidence of stress-related cortisol alterations in everyday life.
