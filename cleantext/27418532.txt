  Thymic carcinoma is prone to early metastasis and invasion , while its metastasis to the breast is particularly unique. We describe a case of thymic epithelial tumor metastatic to the breast fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria. A 47-year-old female patient diagnosed with stage IV thymic carcinoma and previously treated with chemoradiation was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer during a periodic review. Color Doppler ultrasonography showed a low-echo real occupancy in the breast. Pathological examination of the breast mass confirmed the diagnosis of thymic carcinoma metastasis. Hematogenous metastasis of thymic carcinoma to the breast is rare but not exceptional , and long-term survival can be expected with appropriate treatment.
