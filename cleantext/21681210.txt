  Pooled CRISPR libraries are widely used in high-throughput screening to study various biological processes. Various pooled CRISPR libraries have been shared for CRISPR screens and useful tools have been developed to construct researcher 's own libraries , however , many researchers are struggling to create their own pooled CRISPR libraries: it is a time-consuming , labor-intensive , and expensive process. In this study , we develop a simple method to customize conventional pooled CRISPR libraries using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We show that conventional pooled CRISPR libraries can be modified by eliminating gRNAs that target positive genes , enabling the identification of unknown target genes in CRISPR screening. CRISPR/Cas9 system can be applied as a precise tool for customizing conventional pooled CRISPR libraries and will broaden the scope of high-throughput screening technology.
