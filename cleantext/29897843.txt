  The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate positively charged nanoparticles of aceclofenac for ocular delivery. The nanoparticles were prepared by the nanoprecipitation method using Eudragit RS 100. The optimized nanoparticles were found to have narrow particle size range ( 238.9 ± 8 nm) with nearly spherical shape , positive zeta potential ( 40.3 ± 3.8). Higher entrapment efficiency of aceclofenac ( 94.53 ± 1.0 %) with prolonged in vitro drug release profiles was also observed. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry studies indicated decrease in crystallinity of drug within the nanoparticulate polymeric matrix. The formulation was found to have higher permeation as compared to aceclofenac aqueous solution. Nanoparticle formulation was found to be quite stable and well tolerated with no signs of corneal damage. The in vivo studies involving the arachidonic acid-induced ocular inflammation<symptom> in rabbits showed optimal efficacy of the nanoparticles with significantly higher inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocytes migration ( p < 0.05) and lid closure scores.
