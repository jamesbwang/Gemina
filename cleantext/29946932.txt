  Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota ( formerly named Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group , MCG) are globally occurring archaea playing potential roles in nitrogen and carbon cycling , especially in marine benthic biogeochemical cycle. Information on their distributional and compositional patterns could provide critical clues to further delineate their physiological and biochemical characteristics. Profiles of thaumarchaeotal and the total archaeal community in the northern South China Sea surface sediments revealed a successively transitional pattern of Thaumarchaeota composition using MiSeq sequencing. Shallow-sea sediment enriched phylotypes decreased gradually along the slope from estuarine and coastal marine region to the deep-sea , while deep-sea sediment enriched phylotypes showed a trend of increasing. Proportion of Thaumarchaeota within the total archaea increased with seawater depth. Phylotypes enriched in shallow- and deep-sea sediments were affiliated to OTUs originated from similar niches , suggesting that physiological adaption not geographical distance shaped the distribution of Thaumarchaeota lineages. Quantitative PCR also depicted a successive decrease of thaumarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene abundance from the highest at shallow-sea sites E708S and E709S ( 2.57 Ã— 10
