  To identify prenatal and perinatal predictors of surgery and describe surgical findings/outcomes of neonates with Meconium Ileus ( MI) secondary to Cystic<disease> Fibrosis<disease> ( CF). Potential risk factors ( prenatal bowel echogenicity , CF genotype , birthweight , prematurity and sex) for MI and surgery were examined in a retrospective cohort of neonates with CF presenting to a tertiary center between 1997 and 2015. Following univariable analysis , predictors of MI and surgery were determined using multivariable logistic regression. For surgical patients , detailed operative findings and outcomes were examined. MI was diagnosed in 26/120 ( 21.7 %) neonates with CF and 19/26 ( 73.0 %) required surgery. Prematurity was significantly associated with increased risk of MI and operative intervention ( p-value 0.022 and p-value 0.016 respectively); lower birthweight was associated with operative intervention ( p-value 0.039); genotype and echogenic bowel were associated with neither. Surgical data were available for 17/19 patients; median age at surgery was 2 days ( IQR1-3) , 4/17 had an atresia and 6/17 received an ostomy. Median NICU and hospital stays were 34.5 and 70 days while median time on TPN and time to ostomy reversal were 28.5 and 97 days , respectively. In patients with CF , prematurity and lower birthweight were identified as risk factors for meconium ileus and need for surgery. Specific genotypes and echogenic bowel were not predictors of either.
