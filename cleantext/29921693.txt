  Cancer invasion and metastasis are driven by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , yet the exact mechanisms that account for EMT in clinical prostate cancer are not fully understood. Expression of N-cadherin is considered a hallmark of EMT in clinical prostate cancer. In this study , we determined the molecular mechanisms associated with N-cadherin expression in prostate cancer patients. We performed laser capture micro-dissection of matched N-cadherin-positive and- negative prostate cancer areas from patient samples ( n = 8) followed by RNA sequencing. N-cadherin expression was significantly associated with an immune regulatory signature including profound upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO1) ( log2 fold change = 5.1; p = 2.98E-04). Fluorescent immune stainings of patient samples confirmed expression of IDO1 protein and also its metabolite kynurenine in primarily N-cadherin-positive areas. N-cadherin-positive areas also exhibited a local decrease of intraepithelial cytotoxic ( CD8 +) T cells and an increase of immune suppressive regulatory T cells ( CD4 +/ FoxP3 +). In conclusion , EMT in clinical prostate cancer is accompanied by upregulated expression of IDO1 and an increased number of regulatory T cells. These data indicate that EMT , which is an important step in tumor progression , can be protected from effective immune control in prostate cancer patients.
