  The dysregulation of transcription factors plays a vital role in tumor initiation and progression. Sex determining region Y-box 5 ( SOX5) encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box family of transcription factors involved in the determination of the cell fate and the regulation of embryonic development. However , its functional roles in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) remain unclear. Herein , we report that SOX5 sustains stem-like traits and enhances the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. We determine that SOX5 is preferentially expressed by cancer stem-like cells ( CSLCs) of human NSCLC.
