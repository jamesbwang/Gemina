  2D nanomaterials , particularly graphene , offer many fascinating physicochemical properties that have generated exciting visions<symptom> of future biological applications. In order to capitalize on the potential of 2D nanomaterials in this field , a full understanding of their interactions with biointerfaces is crucial. The uptake pathways , toxicity , long-term fate of 2D nanomaterials in biological systems , and their interactions with the living systems are fundamental questions that must be understood. Here , the latest progress is summarized , with a focus on pathogen , mammalian cell , and tissue interactions. The cellular uptake pathways of graphene derivatives will be discussed , along with health risks , and interactions with membranes-including bacteria and viruses-and the role of chemical structure and modifications. Other novel 2D nanomaterials with potential biomedical applications , such as transition-metal dichalcogenides , transition-metal oxide , and black phosphorus will be discussed at the end of this review.
