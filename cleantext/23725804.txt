  Preimplantation genetic screening ( PGS) detects chromosomal aneuploidy from DNA extracted from trophectodermal biopsy of the embryos before implantation. Although a controlled study showed no difference in pregnancy rates between this invasive cell biopsy technique and a non-biopsied control group , the potential long-term damage by the current PGS method has not be completely ruled out. We therefore tested a less-invasive protocol which utilizes spent culture medium combining with blastocoel fluid ( ECB) to assess chromosomal aneuploidy. We compared the new protocol with the currently employed trophectodermal biopsy method against chromosomal information obtained from the remaining embryo. We found that the new technique generated information about aneuploidy that was not entirely identical to obtained from the biopsied trophectoderm or the remaining embryo. As the origins of the DNA extracted from the three sample types were not the same , the significance and interpretation of each result would have its own meaning. The possible implications derived from the ECB results as well as those from cell biopsy were discussed. The effectiveness of this new approach in selecting the best embryo for uterine implantation awaits further long term evaluation.
