  High-risk human papillomaviruses ( HPVs) possess transforming activity leading to development of the cancer , including oropharyngeal<disease> , anal , penile , vulvar , vaginal , and cervical cancer. The stability of E6 is essential for its complete function as an oncoprotein. Using the yeast two-hybrid system , we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 15 ( USP15) as an HPV16 E6-interacting protein. USP15 cleaves polyubiquitin chains of HPV16 E6 and/or ubiquitin precursors. Our results indicate that USP15 could increase the level of HPV16 E6 by inhibiting E6 degradation. USP15 inhibited the degradation of HPV16 E6 in dose-dependent manner. In contrast , catalytically inactive mutants of USP15 had a reduced inhibitory effect on E6 degradation. In particular , USP15 mutants of all three cysteine boxes and the NHL mutant of the KRF box had a drastically reduced inhibitory effect on HPV16 E6 degradation. In addition , HPV16 E6 mRNA was not induced by USP15; therefore , HPV16 E6 appears to be post-translationally regulated. These results suggest that USP15 has the ability to stabilize E6 as a deubiquitinating enzyme , and as an oncoprotein affects biological functions in infected human cells.
