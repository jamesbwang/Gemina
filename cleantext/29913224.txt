  Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the metabolism , immune response , cellular proliferation , and other processes; however , the attention has been focused on the study of its ability to induce the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant defense. Nrf2 is mainly regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( Keap1) , an adapter substrate of Cullin 3 ( Cul3) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Keap1 represses Nrf2 activity in the cytoplasm by its sequestering , ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Nrf2 activation , through the canonical mechanism , is carried out by electrophilic compounds and oxidative stress where some cysteine residues in Keap1 are oxidized , resulting in a decrease in Nrf2 ubiquitination and an increase in its nuclear translocation and activation. In the nucleus , Nrf2 induces a variety of genes involved in the antioxidant defense. Recently a new mechanism of Nrf2 activation has been described , called the non-canonical pathway , where proteins such as p62 , p21 , dipeptidyl peptidase III ( DPP3) , wilms tumor gene on X chromosome ( WTX) and others are able to disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 complex , by direct interaction with Keap1 decreasing Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its nuclear translocation and activation. In this review , the regulatory mechanisms involved in both canonical and non-canonical Nrf2 activation are discussed.
