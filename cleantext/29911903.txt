  Ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) may require systemic corticosteroid ( CS) treatment often without a reliable predictable response , except the Ho-index , used to predict severe cases. The present study aims to determine CS-efficacy and CS-free remission for different courses and longer follow-ups , and a predictive value of CS-outcomes , by the Ho-index and the analysis of clinical variables. An observational retrospective study performed with 136 patients was based on clinical and analytical characteristics , before successive CS-therapies. The age of UC onset showed three peaks. After the first course , 55.6 % were CS-responders , and 39 % had CS-free remission by the 3-5-year follow-up. Successive CS-courses presented less efficacy and CS-free remissions , associated with increased CS-use dependence. The Ho-index might only predict the first course of CS and low-score patients with severe UC. Logistic regression analysis gave a predictive response mainly due to the age at diagnosis , the interval from diagnosis to CS-therapy , and C-reactive protein ( CRP) or hemoglobin values. One-third of the cases were CS-free remission UC. Successive courses showed decreased efficacy and increased CS-dependence , limiting CS-treatment. An older age at diagnosis , longer interval from diagnosis to CS-therapy , lower CRP and higher hemoglobin predicted better prognosis. The accuracy of prediction should be validated and include additional markers.
