  The long-term clinical success of all-ceramic restorations requires sufficient bond strength between the veneering ceramic and substructure. The present study compared the effects of three methods of surface treatment on the microtensile bond strength of the veneering porcelain to zirconia. Twelve zirconia blocks were randomly divided into four groups of aluminum oxide ( Al The highest and lowest microtensile bond strength values were recorded in the Al Al
