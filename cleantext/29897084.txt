  The preparation of cost-effective , stable catalysts for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide ( CO2) to C1 products such as methanol is extremely important because methanol can be used directly as a fuel or it can be converted into other value-added products. However , the catalysts currently used for the reduction of CO2 to methanol exhibit poor selectivity , poor stability and very low faradaic efficiency. Herein , we used low-cost , stable cuprous oxide/polypyrrole ( Cu2O/Ppy) particles having structures of octahedra and icosahedra ( microflowers) that were prepared on linen texture ( LT) papers for the selective reduction of CO2 to form a value-added single C1 product , methanol. The Cu2O/Ppy particles possessing both octahedral and microflower shapes with exposed low-index ( 111) facets and high-index ( 311) and ( 211) facets are denoted as Cu2O ( OL-MH)/ Ppy particles. The as-prepared Cu2O ( OL-MH)/ Ppy particles exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at -0.85 V vs. RHE to form methanol , with a faradaic efficiency of 93 ± 1.2 % and an average methanol formation rate of 1.61 ± 0.02 μmol m-2 s-1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) analysis revealed that the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms present in the Ppy shell played a dominant role as active sites for CO2 molecules. The Raman bands of Ppy and Cu2O did not shift even after being subjected to electrolysis for several hours , suggesting superior stability of the Cu2O ( OL-MH)/ Ppy particles. The high resolution microscopic , spectroscopic , diffraction and electrochemical analysis results clearly revealed that the Ppy shell protected the Cu2O particles and avoided corrosion , dissolution , and structural and crystal facet changes , leading to greater stability. The low-cost , durable , flexible , and catalytically active Cu2O ( OL-MH)/ Ppy LT paper holds great potential for catalytic , photocatalytic and energy storage applications.
