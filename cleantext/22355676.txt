  Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers despite extensive research. Further understanding of precursor lesions<symptom> may enhance the ability to treat and prevent pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cystic lesions<symptom> ( PCLs) with malignant potential include: mucinous PCLs ( intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasm) , solid pseudopapillary tumors and cystic neuroendocrine tumors. This review summarizes the latest literature describing what is known about the pathogenesis and malignant potential of these PCLs , including unique epidemiological , radiological , histological , genetic and molecular characteristics.
