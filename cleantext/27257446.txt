  The purpose of this review is to define axillary web syndrome<disease> ( AWS) and describe its diagnosis and management. The following databases were searched through July 2017: PubMed , EMBASE ( OvidSP) , Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature , Physiotherapy Evidence Database , and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search terms included ` axillary web syndrome<disease> ' , ` axillary cording ' , and ` lymphatic cording '. 49 articles were identified; 8 did not relate to breast cancer , and 3 were not in English. Of the remaining articles , the majority were case reports , case series , or descriptive reviews. 2 systematic reviews were located as well as 1 randomized trial , 6 prospective cohort studies , and 2 retrospective cohort studies. Although a common sequela after axillary surgery for breast cancer staging , AWS has been poorly described in the medical literature as to the underlying pathophysiology , diagnosis , and management. Interventions range from patient education and simple reassurance that the syndrome<disease> will resolve spontaneously to active physical or manual therapies to maintain upper extremity range-of-motion , especially adequate motion for undergoing radiation therapy. Oncologists , breast surgeons , family physicians , and oncology nurse practitioners that work with patients with breast cancer should educate them about this prevalent complication and inform them preoperatively about what to anticipate.
