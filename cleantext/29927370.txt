  The Papillomaviridae is a family of small , non-enveloped viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes of 5 748 to 8 607 bp. Their classification is based on pairwise nucleotide sequence identity across the L1 open reading frame. Members of the Papillomaviridae primarily infect mucosal and keratinised epithelia , and have been isolated from fish , reptiles , birds and mammals. Despite a long co-evolutionary history with their hosts , some papillomaviruses are pathogens of their natural host species. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV) Report on the taxonomy of the Papillomaviridae , which is available at http://www.ictv.global/report/papillomaviridae.
