  Onset of progression even during therapy with novel drugs remains an issue in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). Thus , there is ongoing demand for novel agents. Approaches targeting cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK) have reached the clinical trial stage. CDK9 mediating RNA transcriptional elongation is the evolving pivotal CLL CDK inhibitor target. However , more CDK9 selective compounds are desirable. Here , we describe the CDK9 inhibitor LDC526 displaying a low nanomolar biochemical activity against CDK9 and an at least 50-fold selectivity against other CDKs. After demonstrating
