  Sensory experience rating ( SER) is a recently developed subjective lexical index that reflects the extent to which a word evokes a sensory and/or perceptual experience in a reader ( Juhasz & Yap , 2013; Juhasz , Yap , Dicke , Taylor , & Gullick , 2011). In the present study , SERs for a set of 5,500 Spanish words were collected , which makes this the largest set of norms for SER in the Spanish language to date. Additionally , with the aim of further exploring the implications of this new indicator and its relations with other psycholinguistic variables , a variety of correlational and regression analyses are provided. The results showed that SERs significantly correlated with imageability , age of acquisition , and a number of variables related to perception and emotion. In addition , SERs predicted a significant amount of variance in lexical decision times when other variables were controlled.
