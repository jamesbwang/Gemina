  There is a paucity of contemporary data on the characteristics and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) in patients on maintenance dialysis. We used the nationwide inpatient sample to examine contemporary trends in the incidence , management patterns , and outcomes of AIS in dialysis patients. A total of 930 010 patients were admitted with AIS between 2003 and 2014 , of whom 13 642 ( 1.5 %) were on dialysis. Overall , the incidence of AIS among dialysis patients decreased significantly ( Dialysis patients have 8-folds higher incidence of AIS compared withnon-dialysis patients. They also have higher risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality , sepsis<disease> and blood transfusion , longer hospitalizations , and higher cost. There is a need to identify preventative strategies to reduce the risk of AIS in the dialysis population.
