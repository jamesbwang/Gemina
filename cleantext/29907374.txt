  Although Developmental Coordination Disorder ( DCD) is primarily a motor disorder , it can also impact emotional and psychosocial functioning of children with this condition. Evidence suggests that children with DCD experience lower quality of life than their peers , but few studies have explicitly examined the health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) of these children. To: ( 1) describe HRQOL of children with DCD compared to typically-developing children; ( 2) compare HRQOL from the perspectives of children with DCD and their parents; and ( 3) explore predictors of HRQOL for children with DCD. Data from the KidScreen-52 and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire were collected from 50 children with DCD ( Mean ( SD) age: 9.8 ( 1.2) years) and their parents and compared to normative data. Children with DCD and their parents report significantly lower HRQOL compared to published norms. Caregivers have a significantly lower perception of their child 's HRQOL than their child 's self-report in many domains. Parents of children with DCD report that their children experience significantly more emotional and behavioral disturbances compared to norms. Poor<symptom> motor function and attentional difficulties predict HRQOL. DCD appears to contribute to lower perceived HRQOL. Findings inform therapeutic targets for children with DCD , beyond motor skill intervention.
