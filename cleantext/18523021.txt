  Depending on its geometry , a spherical shell may exist in one of two stable states without the application of any external force: there are two ` self-equilibrated ' states , one natural and the other inside out ( or ` everted '). Though this is familiar from everyday life-an umbrella is remarkably stable , yet a contact lens can be easily turned inside out-the precise shell geometries for which bistability is possible are not known. Here , we use experiments and finite-element simulations to determine the threshold between bistability and monostability for shells of different solid angle. We compare these results with the prediction from shallow shell theory , showing that , when appropriately modified , this offers a very good account of bistability even for relatively deep shells. We then investigate the robustness of this bistability against pointwise indentation. We find that indentation provides a continuous route for transition between the two states for shells whose geometry makes them close to the threshold. However , for thinner shells , indentation leads to asymmetrical buckling before snap-through , while also making these shells more ` robust ' to snap-through. Our work sheds new light on the robustness of the ` mirror buckling ' symmetry of spherical shell caps.
