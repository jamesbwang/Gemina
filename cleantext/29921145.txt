  The authors sought to determine the long-term impact of sudden parental death on youths and pathways between youth bereavement and impairment. Youths ( N = 216) who lost a parent to suicide , accident , or sudden natural death and nonbereaved youths ( N = 172) were followed periodically for up to 7 years. The incidence and prevalence of disorder and of functional impairment , as well as pathways to impairment , were assessed using Cox and mixed-effects logistic regression and structural equation modeling. Prior to parental death , bereaved youths had higher rates of psychiatric disorder , parental psychiatric disorder , and maltreatment. Even after adjustment for predeath risk factors , bereavement was associated with an increased incidence of depression<symptom> , posttraumatic stress disorder , and functional impairment. The peak incidence of depression<symptom> was in the first 2 years postbereavement , with incident depression<symptom> occurring mainly in those who lost a parent at age 12 or younger. Youths bereaved by all three causes of death showed higher rates of impairment at all time points. Structural equation modeling found that bereavement had a direct effect on impairment and was also linked to impairment via its effects on early and later depression<symptom> and through negative life events. Child psychiatric disorder prior to parental loss also contributed to functional impairment. Parental death increased the incidence of depression<symptom> in offspring early in the course of bereavement. Early identification and treatment of depression<symptom> in bereaved youths and augmentation of family resilience may protect against later sequelae of functional impairment.
