  Wastewater biological treatment with microalgae can be an effective technology , removing nutrients and other contaminants while reducing chemical oxygen demand. This can be particularly interesting for the meat producing industry which produces large volumes of wastewater from the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of their facilities. The main purpose of this research was the treatment of poultry wastewater using Scenedesmus obliquus in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. Two wastewaters were collected from a Portuguese poultry slaughterhouse ( poultry raw- PR and poultry flocculated- PF) and the bioremediation was evaluated. The performance of microalga biomass growth and biochemical composition were assessed for two illumination sources ( fluorescent vs LEDs). S. obliquus achieved positive results when grown in highly contaminated agro-industrial wastewater from the poultry industry , independently of the light source. The wastewater bioremediation revealed results higher than 97 % for both ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency , for a cultivation time of 13 days. The saponifiable matter obtained from the biomass of the microalga cultures was , on average , 11 % and 27 % ( m/m
