  Flame retardants ( FRs) are added to foams and plastics to comply with flammability standards and test requirements in products for household and industrial uses. When these regulations were implemented , potential health and environmental impacts of FR use were not fully recognized or understood. Extensive research in the past decades reveal that exposure to halogenated FRs , such as those used widely in furniture foam , is associated with and/or causally related to numerous health effects in animals and humans. While many of the toxic FRs have been eliminated and replaced by other FRs , existing products containing toxic or potentially toxic chemical FRs will remain in use for decades , and new products containing these and similar chemicals will permeate the environment. When such products reach the end of their useful life , proper disposal methods are needed to avoid health and ecological risks. To minimize continued human and environmental exposures to hazardous FR chemicals from discarded products , waste management technologies and processes must be improved. This review discusses a wide range of issues associated with all aspects of the use and responsible disposal of wastes containing FRs , and identifies basic and applied research needs in the areas of responsible collection , pretreatment , processing , and management of these wastes.
