  The authors previously demonstrated that brief ischemia elicits cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) release and myocyte apoptosis in the absence of necrosis<symptom>. It remains uncertain whether other pathophysiological stresses can produce apoptosis and transient cTnI release without ischemia. This study sought to determine whether a transient increase in left ventricular ( LV) preload elicits cTnI release in the absence of ischemia. Propofol-anesthetized swine ( N = 13) received intravenous phenylephrine ( PE) ( 300 μg/min) for 1 h to increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( LVEDP) to ∼ 30 mm Hg. Serial cTnI and echocardiographic function were assessed for 24 h , and myocardial tissue was analyzed for apoptosis and necrosis<symptom>. PE infusion increased systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> from 137 ± 14 mm Hg to 192 ± 11 mm Hg ( mean ± SD; p < 0.001) and increased LVEDP from 17 ± 2 mm Hg to 30 ± 5 mm Hg ( p < 0.001). Myocardial flow measurements demonstrated no evidence of ischemia. Hemodynamics normalized rapidly after PE , but LV ejection fraction remained depressed ( 32 ± 21 % vs. 58 ± 7 %; p < 0.01) with normalization after 24 h ( 51 ± 16 %; p = 0.31). Baseline transcoronary cTnI release was low ( 16 ± 20 ng/l) but increased to 856 ± 956 ng/l ( p = 0.01) 1 h after LVEDP elevation. Circulating cTnI rose above the 99th percentile within 30 min and remained elevated at 24 h ( 1,462 ± 1,691 ng/l). Pathological analysis demonstrated myocyte apoptosis at 3 h ( 31.3 ± 11.9 myocytes/cm Transient elevations of LVEDP lead to cTnI release , apoptosis , and reversible stretch-induced stunning in the absence of ischemia. Thus , preload-induced myocyte injury may explain many cTnI elevations seen in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia.
