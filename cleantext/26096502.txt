  Characterization of protein- protein interactions is a vital aspect of molecular biology as multi-protein complexes are the functional units of cellular processes and defining their interactions provides valuable insights into their function based on a `` guilt by association '' concept. To identify the components in complexes , purification of the latter near homogeneity is required. The tandem affinity purification ( i.e. , TAP) method , coupled with mass spectrometry have been extensively used to define native protein complexes and transient protein-protein interactions under near physiological conditions ( i.e. , conditions approximate of the internal milieu) in
