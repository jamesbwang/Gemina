  Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection<pathogen> in humans can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations , from mild<pathogen> fever<pathogen> to potentially fatal dengue shock<pathogen> syndrome.<pathogen> The incidence of dengue<pathogen> fever<pathogen> is on the rise in tropical countries. Due to the increasing incidence of dengue<pathogen> fever<pathogen> worldwide , atypical manifestations of the disease<pathogen> are increasingly reported. In this article we report a patient with dengue haemorrhagic fever<pathogen> who presented with reversible splenial lesion<pathogen> syndrome.<pathogen> A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man who presented with fever<pathogen> and confusion<pathogen> was eventually diagnosed to have reversible splenial lesion<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> based on brain imaging. Clinical , serological and haematological parameters confirmed a diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever.<pathogen> His presentation , assessment , and management are described in this case report. Reversible splenial lesion<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> is a condition which is radiologically characterized by reversible lesion<pathogen> in the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is associated with infectious and non-infectious aetiologies. This case report highlights the occurrence of reversible splenial lesion<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> as a presenting feature of the expanding list of unusual neurological manifestations of dengue
