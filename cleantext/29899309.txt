  A triple-decker SYML-Dy2 single-molecule magnet ( SMM) was synthetized and grafted onto the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles ( IO-NPs) coated by an oleic acid monolayer. The magnetism of the SYML-Dy2 complex , and the hybrid system , NP-Dy2 , were studied by a superconducting quantum interference device ( SQUID). Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations were carried out to study both the energetics of the interaction between SYML-Dy2 complex to the organic capping , and the assembly presented by the oleic acid chains.
