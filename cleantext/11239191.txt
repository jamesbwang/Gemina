  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture therapy for children with cerebral palsy. We conducted electronic searches of PUBMED ( 1950/2017) , EMBASE ( 1974/2017) , ScienceDirect ( 1986/2017) , Academic Source Premier ( 1887/2017) , the Cochrane Library ( Issue 4 , April 2017) , Science Citation Index Expanded ( 1900/2017) , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( 1915/2017) , China Biological Medicine ( 1990/2017 - 04) , WanFang ( 1980/2017) , VIP ( 1989/2017) , and Chinese Science Citation Database ( 1989/2017). We included randomized controlled trials that aimed to compare the effect of acupuncture plus rehabilitation training versus rehabilitation training alone. Data about functional motor abilities , daily activity/social participation , effective rate , intellectual development , and adverse effects were included. We used Revman 5.2 software for statistical analysis. The primary outcomes included functional motor abilities , daily activity , and effective rate. The secondary outcomes included intellectual development and adverse effects. Twenty-one studies with a total of 1718 participants met the inclusion criteria. The effect size of gross motor function ( SMD = 0.64 , 95 % CI: 0.52 to 0.76 , P < 0.00001; I Acupuncture plus rehabilitation training improved gross motor function , reduced muscle spasms , and enhanced daily life activities in children with cerebral palsy. However , this conclusion should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of randomized controlled trials available and the small sample sizes. More high-quality and large-scale studies are needed.
