  Herein we present a combined study of the evolution of both the photoluminescence ( PL) and the surface chemical structure of organic metal halide perovskites as the environmental oxygen pressure rises from ultrahigh vacuum up to a few thousandths of an atmosphere. Analyzing the changes occurring at the semiconductor surface upon photoexcitation under a controlled oxygen atmosphere in an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) chamber , we can rationalize the rich variety of photophysical phenomena observed and provide a plausible explanation for light-induced ion migration , one of the most conspicuous and debated concomitant effects detected during photoexcitation. We find direct evidence of the formation of a superficial layer of negatively charged oxygen species capable of repelling the halide anions away from the surface and toward the bulk. The reported PL transient dynamics , the partial recovery of the initial state when photoexcitation stops , and the eventual degradation after intense exposure times can thus be rationalized.
