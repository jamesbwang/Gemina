  In light of data finding that postoperative pain , nausea<symptom> , and vomiting<symptom> worsen outcomes , a renewed emphasis has been placed on optimizing the perioperative period. Use of preoperative paravertebral block ( PVB) has been shown to reduce opioid administration and postoperative nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> ( PONV) in many surgical populations , though its role in reduction mammaplasty remains undefined. Therefore , we seek to evaluate PVB as an adjunct to general anesthesia ( GA) for reduction mammaplasty. We reviewed records for patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty at our institution from 2010 to 2015. Patients were categorized into two groups: GA alone and GA + PVB ( GA with PVB adjunct). Demographic information , opioid administration , phase I/II pain scores , presence of PONV , and anesthesia time were analyzed. Analysis was performed using t-tests and Fisher 's exact test , with P-values less than 0.05 statistically significant. We identified 264 patients meeting criteria: 209 ( 79 %) received GA alone and 55 ( 21 %) received GA + PVB. Intraoperative opioid administration were lower for GA + PVB patients ( morphine equivalent of 44 mg versus 35 mg , P = 0.019) , though there was no difference in postoperative opioid administration ( P = 0.915). Phase I and II pain scores were significantly lower for those receiving PVB ( 2.9 versus 3.9 , P = 0.012 , and 3.0 versus 4.2 , P = 0.001 , respectively). GA + PVB was associated with less PONV ( 14 % versus 33 % , P = 0.007) and longer anesthesia times ( 271 min versus 236 min; P = 0.001). By improving pain control and reducing PONV , factors known to be associated with poor patient satisfaction and inferior outcomes , PVB is an attractive anesthetic adjunct in elective breast surgery.
