  In an open field trial on two agricultural soils in NW Italy , the impact of two seed-applied biostimulants on the rhizosphere bacterial community of young maize plants was evaluated. The 16S rDNA profiling was carried out on control and treated plant rhizosphere samples collected at the 4-leaf stage and on bulk soil. In both soils , the rhizospheres were significantly enriched in Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , and Bacteriodetes , while the abundances of Acidobacteria , Cloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes decreased compared with bulk soil. Among the culturable bacteria genera that showed an increase by both biostimulants , most are known to be beneficial for nutrient uptake , such as
