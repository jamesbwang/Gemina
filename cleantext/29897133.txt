  Ustilaginoidea ( U.) virens grows on rice grains and leads to significant rice yield losses in most of the major rice producing areas. Meanwhile , ustiloxins produced by U. virens are a serious hazard to human health and ecological safety of farmlands. The other key point is that ustiloxins have been regarded as a novel resource with their potential in the treatment of cancers. There is no better way to extract ustiloxins than from pure culture of the high ustilotoxin-producing strains. U. virens has become a key research organism. However , due to the presence of some interference components , it is a certain difficulty in the successful isolation of the strain from the false smut balls. We present here a detailed study based on the separation , screening and identification of high ustiloxins-producing strains of U. virens. Through this study , we got a satisfactory success rate of separation and provided a good solution to the problem of separation. At the same time , this study provides quality resources for researchers interested in ustiloxins as anticancer agents.
