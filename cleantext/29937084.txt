  The Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) is a self-administered instrument for outpatients , but its behaviour differs according to the clinical population to which it is applied. In Mexico it is not validated in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD). To validate the HADS scale in the Mexican population with IBD. 112 patients with IBD from the `` Salvador Zubir√°n '' National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition were included , to whom the HADS was applied and some demographic and clinical characteristics of the disease were evaluated. An exploratory factor analysis was performed and factorial congruence was calculated to determine the construct validity of the HADS , while reliability was evaluated using Cronbach 's alpha. The result of the varimax rotation of the 14 items of the HADS explained 50.1 % of the variance , having two main factors. Ten items showed high factor loading for the dimensions originally proposed. The internal consistency of the HADS was high ( alpha = 0.88) with high values for the congruence coefficients. The HADS scale is a valid instrument to detect possible cases of Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> in Mexican patients with IBD. The validation of this instrument allows its routine use for the integral evaluation of the patient and their timely referral to mental health.
