  Uterine leiomyomas are one of the most common tumors affecting reproductive-age women. Leiomyomas can present as an intrauterine mass or rarely as an extrauterine tumor. Depending on its location , the diagnosis of extrauterine leiomyoma can be challenging , and multiple imaging modalities may be needed for correct identification and differentiation from malignant entities. We report the case of a 48-year-old-postmenopausal female who presented with a painful left inguinal mass , which was clinically diagnosed as inguinal hernia. Ultrasound , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , and percutaneous biopsy were used to characterize the mass. Surgical resection and histopathological analysis revealed the mass to be a parasitic leiomyoma , a very rare cause of inguinal hernia , especially in a postmenopausal woman.
