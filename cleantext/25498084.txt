  Hepatic vein occlusive disease ( HVOD) is a rare complication after liver transplantation , which is characterized by nonthrombotic , fibrous obliteration of the small centrilobular hepatic veins by connective tissue and centrilobular necrosis<symptom> in zone 3 of the acini. HVOD after solid organ transplantation has been reported; recently , most of these reports with limited cases have documented that acute cell rejection and immunosuppressive agents are the major causative factors. HVOD is relatively a rare complication of liver transplantation with the incidence of approximately 2 %. A 59-year-old male patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis underwent liver transplantation in our center. He suffered ascites , renal impairment 3 months after the surgery while liver enzymes were in normal range. Imagining and pathology showed no evidence of rejection or vessels complications. HVOD was diagnosed with pathology biopsy. Tacrolimus was withdrawn and the progression of HVOD was reversed. Now , this patient has been followed up for 6 months after discharge with normal liver graft function. The use of tacrolimus in patients after liver transplantation may cause HVOD. Patients with jaundice , body<symptom> weight gain , and refractory ascites should be strongly suspected of tacrolimus related HVOD.
