  Mycotoxins are produced by a number of fungal genera spp as e.g. Aspergillus<pathogen> , Penicillium , Alternaria , Fusarium<pathogen> and Claviceps. 3-Acetyl-Deoxynivalenol ( 3-A-DON) and 15-Acetyl-Deoxynivalenol ( 15-ADON) which are produced by Fusarium<pathogen> , chemically belong to trichothecenes and occur in significant amounts as modified forms of deoxynivalenol ( DON) in various cereal crops and processed grains. This study aims to determine the cytotoxicity , cell cycle and genotoxicity of the mycotoxins DON , 3-A-DON and 15-A-DON on HepG2 cells. Cytotoxic concentration range studied was from 100 to 3.1 μM for DON and 12.5 to 0.04 μM for 3-A-DON and 15-A-DON by the Neutral Red ( NR) assay , over 24 , 48 and 72 h. Potential of toxicity of 3-ADON in HepG2 cells was the highest at all times assayed. Cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 and G2/M phase was detected for all mycotoxins either in individually or in combined treatment in HepG2 cells. Genotoxicity was performed through micronuclei ( MN) induction ( TG 487) revealing significant effects for 3-ADON mycotoxin and in several combinations. It was evidenced that cell cycle alterations detected were associated to MN induction at all doses assayed , reaching the highest induction in tertiary combinations and in the binary combination 3-ADON + 15-ADON.
