  Dry mouth<symptom> sensation , also known as xerostomia , is a common clinical problem with an increasing prevalence. Although recent studies have reported promissory results of malic acid , none have evaluated the impact of malic acid on the oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) of patients with xerostomia. Thus , this study aimed to evaluate the impact of 1 % malic acid , combined with fluoride and xylitol , on the OHRQoL of patients with xerostomia. We enrolled 70 patients and randomly allocated them into two groups: the intervention group ( applied topical sialogogue with 1 % malic acid) and the control group ( applied a placebo). We assessed the OHRQoL and severity of xerostomia before and after treatment with the Spanish version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 questionnaire ( OHIP-14sp) and a visual analogue scale ( VAS) , respectively. In addition , stimulated and non-stimulated salivary flow rates before and after treatments were also measured. In total , 60 patients completed the study. According to the VAS , both sprays significantly improved dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> sensation ( P < 0.001). However , OHIP-14sp total scores decreased significantly in the intervention group from 20.8 ± 10.4 to 16.5 ± 9.5 ( P < 0.001) , indicating an improvement in the OHRQoL. No significant differences were observed in the control group ( P > 0.05). Furthermore , non-stimulated salivary flow rates significantly increased in the intervention group from 0.25 ± 0.22 to 0.33 ± 0.33 mL/min ( P < 0.001). Overall , this study demonstrated that malic acid improves the OHRQoL and dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> sensation in patients with xerostomia.
