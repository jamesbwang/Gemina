  The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic hepatectomy ( LH) versus open hepatectomy ( OH) for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) between well-matched patient groups. We retrospectively reviewed data from 1535 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent liver resection between January 2002 and December 2016 at two Chinese centres. Propensity score matching of patients in a ratio of 1:1 was conducted and 157 patients were matched. The median blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 150 vs 380 ml , P < 0.001) was significantly less with LH. The laparoscopic group had shorter hospital stay ( 6 vs 10 days , P < 0.001) and less complication rate ( 6.4 % vs 24.2 % , P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in overall survival and disease-free survival between LH and OH. There were no significant differences in perioperative and long-term outcomes. Laparoscopic hepatectomy is technically feasible and safe in selected patients. LH showed similar long-term outcomes , associated with less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , shorter hospital stay , and fewer postoperative complications in selected patients with HCC compared with OH.
