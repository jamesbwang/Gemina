  Adiponectin , the most prevalent adipo-cytokine in plasma plays critical metabolic and anti-inflammatory roles is fast emerging as an important molecular target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Adiponectin action is critical in multiple organs including cardio-vascular system , muscle , liver , adipose tissue , brain and bone. Adiponectin signaling in bone has been a topic of active investigation lately. Human association studies and multiple mice models of gene deletion/modification failed to define a clear cause and effect of adiponectin signaling in bone. The most plausible reason could be the multimeric forms of adiponectin that display differential binding to receptors ( adipoR1 and adipoR2) with cell-specific receptor variants in bone. Discovery of small molecule agonist of adipoR1 suggested a salutary role of this receptor in bone metabolism. The downstream signaling of adipoR1 in osteoblasts involves stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased differentiation via the likely suppression of wnt inhibitor , sclerostin. On the other hand , the inflammation<symptom> modulatory effect of adiponectin signaling suppresses the RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor Îº-B ligand)- to- OPG ( osteprotegerin) ratio in osteoblasts leading to the suppression of osteoclastogenic response. This review will discuss the adiponectin signaling and its role in skeletal homeostasis and critically assess whether adipoR1 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.
