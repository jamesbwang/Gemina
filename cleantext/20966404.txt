  The intravascular processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins depends on lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) and GPIHBP1 , a membrane protein of endothelial cells that binds LPL within the subendothelial spaces and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. In the absence of GPIHBP1 , LPL remains mislocalized within the subendothelial spaces , causing severe hypertriglyceridemia ( chylomicronemia). The N-terminal domain of GPIHBP1 , an intrinsically disordered region ( IDR) rich in acidic residues , is important for stabilizing LPL 's catalytic domain against spontaneous and ANGPTL4-catalyzed unfolding. Here , we define several important properties of GPIHBP1 's IDR. First , a conserved tyrosine in the middle of the IDR is posttranslationally modified by O-sulfation; this modification increases both the affinity of GPIHBP1-LPL interactions and the ability of GPIHBP1 to protect LPL against ANGPTL4-catalyzed unfolding. Second , the acidic IDR of GPIHBP1 increases the probability of a GPIHBP1-LPL encounter via electrostatic steering , increasing the association rate constant (
