  There is an increasing interest in targeted application of probiotic bacteria for prevention and treatment of airway diseases , including allergies. Here , we investigated the beneficial effects of preventive intranasal treatment with probiotics Lactobacillus<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GG and L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GR-1 in a mouse model of allergic asthma. L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> was administered intranasally eight times on days 1-4 and 8-11 at 5x10 Transient colonization of the murine upper airways by L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GG was demonstrated and was approximately ten times higher compared to L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GR-1. Marked binding of fluorescent L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GG to murine nasal mucosal cells and airway macrophages was visualized. Preventive treatment with L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GG ( but not L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GR-1) resulted in a significant decrease in bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophil counts , lung interleukin-13 and interleukin-5 levels , and airway hyperreactivity. A tendency towards a decrease in serum Bet v 1-specific IgG1was likewise observed. Intranasally administered L.<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> GG prevents the development of cardinal features of birch pollen-induced allergic asthma in a strain-specific manner.
