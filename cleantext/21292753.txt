  As many health disparities in American minority communities ( AMCs) are stress-related , there has been an increased interest in the development of mindfulness programs as potential stress reduction measures in these communities. However , the bulk of the extant literature on mindfulness research and mindfulness interventions is based upon experiences with the larger White community. The intent of this commentary is to share a framework that includes key cultural considerations for conducting research and developing culturally-salient mindfulness programs with AMCs. We build on our experiences and the experiences of other researchers who have explored mindfulness in African and Native American communities; in particular , we examine issues around community outreach with an emphatic gesture toward emphasizing protection of AMCs and their participants. Discussed are considerations with respect to attitudinal foundations in mindfulness-based research and program development with these communities. However , the overall message of this paper is not to provide a `` to-do '' list of research steps , but to rather , encourage researchers to turn inward and consider the development of skillful characteristics that will increase the likelihood of a successful research venture while also protecting the cultural traditions of the AMC of interest.
