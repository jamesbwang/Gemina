  Vulvar Paget disease ( VPD) is extremely rare and thought to be associated with other malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing breast , intestinal , and urological malignancies in patients with VPD compared with the general population , and in particular focus on the risk of malignancy in patients with cutaneous non-invasive VPD. Data on the oncologic history of patients with any type of VPD between 2000 and 2015 were obtained from PALGA , a nationwide archive containing all pathology reports in the Netherlands. Follow-up data and a control group from the general population were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. After correction for age and calendar year at time of diagnosis , standardised incidence ratios ( SIR) for the first three years after VPD diagnosis were estimated with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI). We identified 199 patients with a first diagnosis of VPD ( 164 non-invasive , 35 ( micro-) invasive) between 2000 and 2015. The SIR of developing an associated malignancy in the first 3 years after diagnosis was 4.67 ( 95 % CI 2.66-7.64). This was mainly due to the high incidence of intestinal malignancies among patients with secondary VPD. Subgroup analysis for cutaneous non-invasive VPD did not reveal a significantly increased risk for associated malignancies i.e. , SIR 2.08 ( 95 % CI 0.76-4.62). Of patients with VPD , 76.9 % is diagnosed with cutaneous non-invasive VPD , and this group has no increased risk for developing malignancies of the breast , intestinal or urological tract. Our study suggests that routine screening for these malignancies in patients diagnosed with cutaneous non-invasive VPD may not be necessary. This article is protected by copyright.
