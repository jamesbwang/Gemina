  Mandibular distraction osteogenesis ( DO) has been shown to lead to considerable improvement in obstruction of the posterior airway space in patients with ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) , and our objective was to find out if we could confirm these findings. Seventeen patients had spiral computed tomographic ( CT) scans before and after DO. After treatment , the overall posterior airway space was enlarged in all three sections of the airway ( oropharyngeal<disease> , glossopharyngeal , and laryngeal). We then compared rates of change in the airway among the sections using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional assessments , and found that the rate of change in 3-dimensional assessment of volume was significantly higher than that in the 2-dimensional ( 62 % compared with 34 %). We also found that the higher 3-dimensional rate of change came from changes in the oropharyngeal<disease> and glossopharyngeal sections , while there was no significant difference between the 2- and 3-dimensional rates of change in the laryngeal section. Because the laryngeal section had the most robust enlargement after DO in both the overall area of the posterior airway space ( increased by 54 %) and volume ( increased by 73 %) , we concluded that 3-dimensional assessments were more sensitive to smaller changes in the airway space during the operation. This suggests that 3-dimensional assessments are preferable in the prediction and evaluation of the effects of DO on the posterior airway space.
