  To explore whether a high serum estradiol ( E2) level before progesterone administration adversely affects the pregnancy outcomes of frozen-thawed embryo transfer ( FET) cycles. We retrospectively analyzed 205 hormone replacement therapy ( HRT)- FET cycles in our Center between February , 2017 and August , 2017. With a cutoff value of serum E2 level of 600 pg/mL before progesterone administration , the cases were divided into high E2 level group and control group with normal E2 level , and the clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the patients ` age during IVF/ICSI cycle , body mass index ( BMI) or endometrial thickness at the time of FET ( P > 0.05). The patients with high E2 levels had a significantly younger age ( P < 0.05) and a significantly longer duration of estradiol administration than those in the control group ( P < 0.05). The clinical pregnancy rates , ongoing pregnancy rates , early miscarriage rates , late abortion<disease> rates and live birth rates were all comparable between the two groups ( P > 0.05). After controlling for the compounding factors including the age at FET cycle and the duration of estradiol administration , all these pregnancy outcomes were still comparable between the two groups. A high serum E2 level before progesterone administration does not adversely affect the pregnancy outcomes of HRT-FET cycles.
