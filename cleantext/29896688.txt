  Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the USA , yet the causes of most of these conditions are unknown. While a combination of genetic and environmental factors are suspected in most cases , little information exists about the health risks that prenatal exposure to many common chemicals poses for the fetus. Thus , development and refinement of procedures that can accurately predict embryotoxicity of compounds is important for curtailing the number of infants born with birth defects. The embryonic stem cell test ( EST) is a procedure that utilizes comparison of cytotoxicity in embryonic and adult cells and inhibition of differentiation to predict embryotoxicity of compounds tested. Because of its use of existing cell lines , the EST dramatically reduces the need for animal test subjects in toxicity testing. In addition , because of its use of inhibition of differentiation as an endpoint , the EST is extremely versatile in the range of complications it can test for. In this chapter , procedures for use of the validated embryonic stem cell test with the traditional cardiomyocyte differentiation endpoint are explained. The protocol includes discussion of routine stem cell culture , the cardiomyocyte differentiation procedure , and methods for utilization of molecular endpoints for assessing embryotoxicity of compounds.
