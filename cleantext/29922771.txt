  Cu2O/Bi/Bi2MoO6 , a ternary catalyst , was expertly prepared using an in situ catalytic reduction reaction. All synthetic materials were carefully researched by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM) , powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectra ( UV-vis DRS). The elemental Bi was generated from Bi2MoO6 ( BM) after a circular reduction catalysis process of 4-nitrophenol ( 4-NP) and evenly dispersed in the surface of the leaves of BM flower-like spheres , which was simultaneously coated with Cu2O. The multiphase samples achieved highly effective catalytic activity ( 10053.6 min-1 g-1) for the conversion of the highly toxic 4-NP to the less toxic aminobenzene , compared to the single phase Cu2O and BM nanoparticles. Moreover , the excellent reusable stability of the compositing samples was confirmed by executing successive recycling experiments. It was proposed that the Bi3 +/ Bi0 pairs were the key active species which were produced via prompt reduction and oxidation with the help of Cu2O. The active interfacial contact between copper oxide/metallic Bi/BM ( Cu2O/Bi/BM) in the designed sandwich structure facilitated the production and maintained the balance<symptom> of Bi3 +/ Bi0 pairs , contributing to the enhanced activity and excellent stability.
