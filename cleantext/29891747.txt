  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is the main cause of death in children with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD). Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP-2 and MMP-9) are members of endopeptidases which contribute to CVD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with markers of endothelial dysfunction , soluble E-selectin and brachial flow-mediated dilatation; several biochemical risk factors of CVD; and thrombotic incidents in children with ESRD. Thirty-one children with ESRD and 18 healthy age- and sex-adjusted controls underwent measurement of serum levels of MMP-2 , MMP-9 , soluble E-selectin , phosphorus , calcium , parathyroid hormone , lipid profile , thrombotic factors , and albumin. Flow-mediated dilatation was measured in both groups by Doppler ultrasonography. Thrombotic events were assessed in patients with ESRD. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , soluble E-selectin , creatinine , cholesterol , triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , phosphorus , and parathyroid hormone and negatively correlated with body mass index , hemoglobin , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and flow-mediated dilatation , while MMP-9 correlated with soluble E-selectin , phosphorus , parathyroid hormone , and albumin and negatively correlated with body mass index and hemoglobin. Six patients ( 19.3 %) had thrombotic incidents. There was no significant difference between the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the children with and without thrombotic events. This study determined the associations of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with markers of endothelial dysfunction and several traditional and uremia related CVD risk factors in children with ESRD. No associations were found between these two MMPs and thrombotic events.
