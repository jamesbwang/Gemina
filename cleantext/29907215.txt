  Burns are a leading cause of morbidity in children , with infections representing the most common group of complications. Severe thermal injuries are associated with a profound inflammatory response , but the utility of laboratory values to predict infections in pediatric burn patients is poorly understood. Our institutional burn database was queried for patients aged 18 y and younger with at least 10 % total body surface area burns. Demographics , mechanism , laboratory results , and outcomes were extracted from the medical record. Patients were classified as having an abnormal or normal total white blood cell count , neutrophil percentage , and lymphocyte<symptom> percentage using the first complete blood count drawn 72 or more hours postinjury. Outcomes were compared between groups. White blood cell data were available for 90 patients , 84 of whom had neutrophil and lymphocyte<symptom> percentages. Abnormal lymphocyte<symptom> percentage 72 h or more after burn injury was associated with a significant increase in infections ( 67.9 % versus 32.3 % , P = 0.003) , length of stay ( 33.1 versus 18.8 d , P = 0.02) , intensive care unit length of stay ( 13.1 versus 3.7 days , P = 0.01) , and ventilator days ( 5.8 versus 2.3 , P = 0.02). It was also an independent predictor of infection ( odds ratio 7.2 , 95 % confidence interval 2.1-24.5). Abnormal lymphocyte<symptom> percentage at or after 72 h after burn injury is associated with adverse outcomes , including increased infectious risk.
