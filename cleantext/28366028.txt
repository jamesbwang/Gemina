  To evaluate the incidence of variant hemoglobins in different health regions. A descriptive , observational , and cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach based on secondary data in the internal records of the neonatal screening service- Laboratório Central de Saúde Pública do Estado do Piauí ( PI , Brazil). The variables related to sex , ethnicity and positive diagnosis for variant hemoglobins were analyzed , with further population distribution of hemoglobinopathies among the macroregions of the state. A total of 69,180 samples of newborns were analyzed , and 3,747 were diagnosed as hemoglobinopathies , from February 1st , 2014 and December 31st , 2015. Sickle cell trait was the most frequent ( 4.1 %) , followed by hemoglobinopathy C in 0.9 %; homozygous hemoglobin S cases 0.1 % stood out and there were no cases of hemoglobinopathy D in the state. It is also worth noting that the highest frequencies of hemoglobin alterations in Piauí were in males ( 49.8 %) and of parda skin<symptom> color ( 38.5 %). The region of Piauí presenting the highest incidence of heteroygous variant hemoglobins was Tabuleiros do Alto Parnaíba and Vale do Sambito , due to importance of the region 's population Entre Rios. Neonatal screening programs are important for screening , orientations regarding health actions and monitoring of families with hemoglobinopathies , in order to reduce morbidity and mortality rates.
