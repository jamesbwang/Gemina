  Microtissues ( MT) are currently considered as a promising alternative for the fabrication of natural , 3D biomimetic functional units for the construction of bio-artificial substitutes by tissue engineering ( TE). The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of generating mesenchymal cell-based MT using human umbilical cord Wharton 's jelly stromal cells ( WJSC-MT). MT were generated using agarose microchips and evaluated ex vivo during 28 days. Fibroblasts MT ( FIB-MT) were used as control. Morphometry , cell viability and metabolism , MT-formation process and ECM synthesis were assessed by phase-contrast microscopy , functional biochemical assays , and histological analyses. Morphometry revealed a time-course compaction process in both MT , but WJSC-MT resulted to be larger than FIB-MT in all days analyzed. Cell viability and functionality evaluation demonstrated that both MT were composed by viable and metabolically active cells , especially the WJSC during 4-21 days ex vivo. Histology showed that WJSC acquired a peripheral pattern and synthesized an extracellular matrix-rich core over the time , what differed from the homogeneous pattern observed in FIB-MT. This study demonstrates the possibility of using WJSC to create MT containing viable and functional cells and abundant extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that WJSC-MT could be a promising alternative in TE protocols. However , future cell differentiation and in vivo studies are still needed to demonstrate the potential usefulness of WJSC-MT in regenerative medicine.
