  This study aims to explore the effects and related mechanisms of Tanshinone IIA in cervix carcinoma ( CC) stemness-like cells migration , invasion , stemness and chemotherapeutical sensitivity. Here , we found that Tanshinone IIA suppressed CC stemness-like cells migration and invasion in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. And consistent results were obtained in CC cells stemness characterized as the decrease of CC stemness markers expression and cells spheroid formation ability. Mechanistically , we found that Tanshinone IIA suppressed RNA binding protein HuR translocation from nuclear to cytoplasm , and thus reduced YAP mRNAs stability and transcriptional activity. Importantly , overexpression YAP-5SA rescued the inhibition of Tanshinone IIA on CC cells stemness. Furthermore , Tanshinone IIA enhanced adriamycin sensitivity in CC stemness-like cells , this effect was attenuated by YAP-5SA overexpression too. Therefore , Tanshinone IIA could suppress CC stemness-like cells migration and invasion by inhibiting YAP transcriptional activity.
