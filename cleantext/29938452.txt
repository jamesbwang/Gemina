  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a controlled release , once-daily formulation of mosapride ( UI05MSP015CT) in patients with functional dyspepsia ( FD). Patients with FD were randomly assigned ( 1:1) to receive either UI05MSP015CT ( 15 mg once a day , study group) or mosapride ( 5 mg three times a day , control group) and corresponding placebo for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in the gastrointestinal symptom score ( GIS) evaluated at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Nepean Dyspepsia Index-Korean version ( NDI-K) , rate of satisfactory symptom relief , and rate of adverse events. A total of 138 patients were enrolled ( female , 71.3 %; mean age , 44.0 ± 15.4 years). After excluding patients who violated the study protocol , 59 and 58 patients from the study and control groups , respectively , were included in the per-protocol analysis. No difference was observed in drug compliance between the control and study groups ( 97.07 % ± 4.52 % vs 96.85 % ± 6.05 % , p = 0.870). Changes in GIS scores were -9.69 ± 6.44 and -10.01 ± 5.92 in the study and control groups. The mean difference in GIS change between groups was 0.33 ( 95 % confidence interval , -1.75 to 2.41) , demonstrating non-inferiority of UI05MSP015CT ( p = 0.755). The rate of satisfactory symptom relief was not different between the study and control groups ( 39.0 % vs 56.9 % , p = 0.053). No differences in change in NDI-K score ( 14.3 vs 16.9 , p = 0.263) or rates of adverse events ( 13.24 % vs 4.29 % , p = 0.062) were observed between the study and control groups. Once-daily mosapride is not inferior to conventional mosapride in efficacy and is safe in patients with FD.
