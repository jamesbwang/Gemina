  The effect of depressive symptoms over time on progression through the HIV<pathogen> treatment cascade is complex and poorly characterized. We included participants from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinic Systems Cohort who were ART-na√Øve , had at least one viral load and HIV<pathogen> appointment measure after ART initiation , and had a depressive symptom measure within 6 months of ART initiation. Recent depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9) and categorized using a validated cut-point ( PHQ-9 > 10). We followed participants from ART initiation through the first of the following events: loss to follow-up ( > 12 months with no HIV<pathogen> appointment) , death , administrative censoring ( 2011-2014) , or 5 years of follow-up. We used log binomial models with generalized estimating equations to estimate associations between recent depressive symptoms and having a detectable viral load ( > 75 copies/mL) or missing an HIV<pathogen> visit over time. We included 1,057 HIV-infected adults , who contributed 2,424 person years. At ART initiation 30 % of participants reported depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses , recent depressive symptoms increased the risk of having a detectable viral load ( RR 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.07 , 1.53) over time. The association between depressive symptoms and missing an HIV<pathogen> visit ( RR 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.05 , 1.36) moved to the null after adjustment for pre-existing mental health conditions ( RR 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.85 , 1.18).
