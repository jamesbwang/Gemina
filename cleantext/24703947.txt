  Necroptotic cell death is mediated by the most terminal known effector of the pathway , MLKL. Precisely how phosphorylation of the MLKL pseudokinase domain activation loop by the upstream kinase , RIPK3 , induces unmasking of the N-terminal executioner four-helix bundle ( 4HB) domain of MLKL , higher-order assemblies , and permeabilization of plasma membranes<symptom> remains poorly understood. Here , we reveal the existence of a basal monomeric MLKL conformer present in human cells prior to exposure to a necroptotic stimulus. Following activation , toggling within the MLKL pseudokinase domain promotes 4HB domain disengagement from the pseudokinase domain Î±C helix and pseudocatalytic loop , to enable formation of a necroptosis-inducing tetramer. In contrast to mouse MLKL , substitution of RIPK3 substrate sites in the human MLKL pseudokinase domain completely abrogated necroptotic signaling. Therefore , while the pseudokinase domains of mouse and human MLKL function as molecular switches to control MLKL activation , the underlying mechanism differs between species.
