  A new yellow pigment trypethelonamide A ( 1) , and a new dark violet-red pigment 5 '- hydroxytrypethelone ( 2) , as well as three known dark violet-red pigments ( +) -8-hydroxy-7-methoxytrypethelone ( 3) , ( +)- trypethelone ( 4) and (-)- trypethelone ( 5) were isolated from the cultured lichenized fungus Trypethelium eluteriae. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined to be 1 , 2-naphthoquinone derivatives by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were assigned by quantum electronic circular dichroism ( ECD) calculation. All isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicities against A549 , HepG2 and RKO cell lines , and antioxidant effects on DPPH. Compounds 1-5 showed moderate and weak cytotoxicities against RKO cell line with IC
