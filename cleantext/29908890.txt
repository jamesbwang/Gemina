  Glutathione S-tranferases ( GSTs) are phase II drug metabolizing enzymes , they play crucial role in detoxification of environmental pollutants , carcinogens , drugs , xenobiotics and oxidative stress products. Genetic differences in expression and activity of GSTs are due to the existence of polymorphic alleles which encode them. Because of genetic polymorphism the GST activity has altered that lead to the increased susceptibility for toxic chemical compounds. GST genetic polymorphism is the main reason for many neurological<symptom> dysfunctions<symptom>. GST has over expressed in epileptic brain and pi ( π) GST has used to predict stroke; mu ( μ) and pi ( π) GST are over expressed in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Null and single nucleotide polymorphism of GST has associated with many neurodisorders. Over all , it can be concluded that the GST genetic polymorphism has associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
