  Because of recent developments in immunosuppressive therapy , renal transplant outcomes have improved. Although reports on the association between immunosuppressive therapy and malignant disease are available , the results are controversial. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has been reported as an easy tumor marker for predicting the prognoses of some solid tumors. In the present study , we examined changes in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio after renal transplant and discussed cases in which malignant disease developed after renal transplant. Our study included 137 patients who underwent renal transplant between August 2001 and September 2015. Four of these patients ( 2.9 %) developed malignant disease. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was calculated based on the numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the complete blood count and evaluated before and at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months and at 3 years after renal transplant. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was markedly high at 1 week and 1 month after renal transplant and gradually decreased until it became stable at 3 months posttransplant. In patients with malignant disease , there was a gradual increase in the neutrophil-to-Iymphocyte ratio after renal transplant. We observed dramatic differences in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at 1 and 3 months after renal transplant. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of patients with malignant disease after renal transplant continued to increase.
