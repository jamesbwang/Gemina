  Like other tumors , lung cancer must induce angiogenesis as it grows. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ( HIF-1α) is the inducible subunit of the HIF-1 transcription factor that regulates genes involved in the response to hypoxia , some of which contributes to angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) is one of the genes upregulated by HIF-1 and is the primary cytokine in relation to angiogenesis. In this study we tested whether aberrant activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α/ vascular endothelial growth factor ( HIF-1α/ VEGF) pathway correlates with response to radiotherapy and examined the response of lung cancer cells to hypoxia in vitro. We determined increased expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF-A in 76 cancerous tissues of responders ( complete remission and partial remission). HIF-1α and VEGF-A were shown to be upregulated in lung cancer cells in response to hypoxia. The treatment with anti-HIF-1α siRNA prior to hypoxia exposure was shown to decrease HIF-1α and VEGF-A expressions and reduce hypoxia-induced angiogenesis , suggesting that HIF-1α expression resulted in increased VEGF-A expression and activation of HIF-1α/ VEGF pathway was responsible for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. In conclusion , we identified the relationship between HIF-1α/ VEGF pathway and response to radiotherapy and its role in angiogenesis in lung cancer in vitro. HIF-1α/ VEGF pathway as a target for antiangiogenic treatment strategies for this tumor requires further investigation.
