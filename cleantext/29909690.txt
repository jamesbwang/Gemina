  We assessed cardiac function ( CF) in celiac disease ( CD) patients and the effect of gluten-free diet ( GFD) on CF. Prospective evaluation of CF using conventional and tissue doppler echocardiography in 50 CD patients ( age 4.2 ± 1.1 years) at diagnosis and after a year of GFD ( group 1) , 100 CD children ( group 2; 47 compliant and 53 non-compliant) in follow-up and 25 healthy controls. Untreated CD ( n = 50) children had larger left ventricle end diastolic dimension ( 35.33 ± 0.87 vs. 32.90 ± 0.91 mm; p = .04) , reduced ( < 55 %) left ventricular ejection fraction ( 20 % vs. 0 %; p = .01) and a higher ( > 0.6) myocardial performance index ( MPI , 66 % vs. 0 %; p ≤ .01) as compared to controls. Re-evaluation after one year with good dietary compliance showed changes in isovolumic relaxation time ( 72.5 ± 4.2 vs. 50.62 ± 2.69; p = .0001) and deceleration time ( 121.05 ± 10.1 vs. 99.87 ± 8.5; p = .02) , reflecting improved cardiac diastolic function. GFD compliant patients had lower MPI than non-compliant ( 0.60 ± .03 vs. 0.66 ± .08; p = .04) , reflecting improvement in load-independent echocardiographic parameters. Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is common in CD children at diagnosis. Improvement in echocardiographic parameters occurs with GFD and non-compliant children continue to have persistent cardiac dysfunction.
