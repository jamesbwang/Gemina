  The large yellow croaker ( Larimichthys crocea) has low hypoxia tolerance compared with other fish species , and the mRNA levels of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF) -1 Î± in its brain do not change markedly under hypoxic conditions. In this study , we investigated noncoding transcription in the hypoxic response mechanism of L. crocea. We generated a catalog of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) from the brain of L. crocea individuals under hypoxic stress , investigated lncRNA expression patterns , and analyzed the HIF signaling pathway by RNA sequencing. Prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 ( PHD2) expression significantly increased after 6 and 12 h of hypoxia , and a lncRNA ( Linc_06633.1) was found in the upstream , antisense region of PHD2. Linc_06633.1 may be an important regulator that promotes PDH2 expression under hypoxia in L. crocea , and we constructed a regulatory profile of L. crocea under hypoxic conditions. To the best of our knowledge , it is the first study that has been conducted on hypoxia signaling pathway regulation by lncRNAs in L. crocea and elucidates the role played by lncRNAs in the regulation of the hypoxia stress response in teleost fish.
