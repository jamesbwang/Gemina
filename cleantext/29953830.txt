  This systematic review aimed to synthesize the effects of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve performance of activities of daily living ( ADLs) in community-dwelling older adults. Searches were conducted in CINAHL , the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , MEDLINE , PsycINFO , and OTseeker. Empirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers. Forty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria. Physical exercise was the most common intervention approach. Physical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit , but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in ADLs. For older adults with difficulty in ADLs , there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention. The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults ' living environment in intervention to promote independence in ADLs.
