  Acute pharyngitis<disease> is a common diagnosis in ambulatory pediatrics. The Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA) clinical practice guideline for group A streptococcal ( GAS) pharyngitis<disease> recommends strict criteria for GAS testing to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of children who are colonized with group A The Model for Improvement was used , and iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were completed. The quality improvement project was approved for American Board of Pediatrics Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit. Interventions included provider education , modification of existing office procedure , communication strategies , and patient and family education. Outcomes were assessed by using statistical process control charts. An absolute reduction in unnecessary GAS testing of 23.5 % ( from 64 % to 40.5 %) was observed during the project. Presence of viral symptoms was the primary reason for unnecessary testing. Appropriate antibiotic use for GAS pharyngitis<disease> did not significantly change during the project; although , inappropriate use was primarily related to unnecessary testing. At the end of the intervention period , the majority of providers perceived an improvement in their ability to communicate with families about the need for GAS pharyngitis<disease> testing and about antibiotic use. The majority of GAS pharyngitis<disease> testing in this practice before intervention was inconsistent with IDSA guideline recommendations. A quality improvement initiative , which was approved for Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit , led to improvement in guideline-based testing for GAS
