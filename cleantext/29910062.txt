  Mass spectrometric ( MS) techniques are applied in various areas of medical diagnostics. For the detection of microbiological germs and genetic mutations , MS is a method used in routine. Since MS also allows the analysis of proteins and peptides , it seems an ideal candidate to supplement histopatholological diagnostics. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight Imaging MS links molecular analysis of numerous analytes with morphological information about their spatial distribution in cells or tissues. Herein , we review principle MS techniques as well as potential applications in pathology and discuss our vision for a future workflow.
