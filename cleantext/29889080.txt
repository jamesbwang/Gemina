  Evidence from a growing number of preclinical studies indicate that recently discovered stem cell lines may be translated into viable cellular therapies for people with Parkinson 's disease. In a brief but critical review , we examine the use of primary and secondary outcome measures currently used to evaluate the efficacy of cellular therapies. The current practice of relying on a single primary outcome measure does not appear to provide the evidence required for demonstrating the robust , life-changing recovery anticipated with the successful implementation of cellular therapies. We propose a 360-degree assessment protocol , which includes co-primary and composite outcome measures to provide accurate and comprehensive evidence of treatment efficacy , from the perspectives of both the researchers and the patients.
