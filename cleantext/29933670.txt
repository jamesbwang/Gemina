  The study aims at developing a convenient and specific method for the identification of Fel Serpentis DNA. The methods of Fel Serpentis genomic DNA purification were tested and optimized , four pairs of specific primers for the amplification of COâ…  , Cyt b and 16S were designed. Then the best pair of primers were selected according to the specificity and efficiency. The DNA fragment about 400 bp was amplified from 20 kinds of Fel Serpentis , whereas no DNA fragment was amplified from other animal samples under the same condition. This method is specific , accurate and reproducible , which provides a useful tool for the quality control of Fel Serpentis.
