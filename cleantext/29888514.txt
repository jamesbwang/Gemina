  This research aimed to enhance self-care among rubber farmers for preventing work-related illness. The project used Action Research 's four phase iterative process: fact-finding to understand the problems , action planning , action plan implementation , and evaluation and reflection on action plan impacts. Sixty-six participants ( 46 rubber farmers and 20 community stakeholders) were purposively recruited from two villages in the top 10 rubber producing provinces in Northeastern Thailand. Demographic and work-related illness data were collected in face-to-face structured interviews , Focus group interviews and participant observations were used to collect data in each project phase. Night group meetings were held throughout the research phases. The intervention included training workshops and establishing a community health education team for ongoing farmer support. Results showed improved farmer self-care behaviors and establishment of a community health education team to encourage farmers to care for themselves properly. Community nurses , other health personnel , and the Thai government can build on initiatives like this to strengthen occupational health and safety practices and services policy for rubber farmers.
