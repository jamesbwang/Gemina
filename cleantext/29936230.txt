  Certain clinical features of schizophrenia , such as working memory disturbances , appear to emerge from altered gamma oscillatory activity in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC). Given the essential role of GABA neurotransmission in both working memory and gamma oscillations , understanding the cellular substrate for their disturbances in schizophrenia requires evidence from in vivo neuroimaging studies , which provide a means to link markers of GABA neurotransmission to gamma oscillations and working memory , and from postmortem studies , which provide insight into GABA neurotransmission at molecular and cellular levels of resolution. Here , we review findings from both types of studies which converge on the notions that 1) inhibitory GABA signaling in the PFC , especially between parvalbumin positive GABAergic basket cells and excitatory pyramidal cells , is required for gamma oscillatory activity and working memory function; and 2) disturbances in this signaling contribute to altered gamma oscillations and working memory in schizophrenia. Because the PFC is only one node in a distributed cortical network that mediates working memory , we also review evidence of GABA abnormalities in other cortical regions in schizophrenia.
