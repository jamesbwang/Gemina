  Fabrication of a high quality quantum dot ( QD) film is essentially important for a high-performance QD light emitting diode display ( QLED) device. It is normally a high-cost and multiple-step solution-transfer process where large amounts of QDs were needed but with only limited usefulness. Thus , developing a simple , efficient , and low-cost approach to fabricate high-quality micropatterned QD film is urgently needed. Here , we proposed that the Chinese brush enables the controllable transfer of a QD solution directly onto a homogeneous and ultrasmooth micropatterned film in one step. It is proposed that the dynamic balance<symptom> of QDs was enabled during the entire solution transfer process under the cooperative effect of Marangoni flow aroused by the asymmetric solvent evaporation and the Laplace pressure different by conical fibers. By this approach , QD nanoparticles were homogeneously transferred onto the desired area on the substrate. The as-prepared QLED devices show rather high performances with the current efficiencies of 72.38 , 26.03 , and 4.26 cd/A and external quantum efficiencies of 17.40 , 18.96 , and 6.20 % for the green , red , and blue QLED devices , respectively. We envision that the result offers a low-cost , facile , and practically applicable solution-processing approach that works even in air for fabricating high-performance QLED devices.
