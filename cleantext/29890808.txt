  To evaluate the effect of 3D printing technology applied in the surgical treatment of pelvic fractures through the published literatures by Meta-analysis. The PubMed database , EMCC database , CBM database , CNKI database , VIP database and Wanfang database were searched from the date of database foundation to August 2017 to collect the controlled clinical trials in wich 3D printing technology was applied in preoperative planning of pelvic fracture surgery. The retrieved literatures were screened according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria , and quality evaluation were performed. Then , the available data were extracted and analyzed with the RevMan5 .3 software. Totally 9 controlled clinical trials including 638 cases were chosen. Among them , 279 cases were assigned to the 3D printing technology group and 359 cases to the conventional group. The Meta-analysis results showed that the operative time ( SMD = -2.81 , 95 % CI ( -3.76 , -1.85)) , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( SMD = -3.28 , 95 % CI ( -4.72 , -1.85)) and the rate of complication ( OR = 0.47 , 95 % CI ( 0.25 , 0.87)) in the 3D printing technology were all lower than those in the conventional group; the excellent and good rate of pelvic fracture reduction ( OR = 2.09 , 95 % CI ( 1.32 , 3.30)) and postoperative pelvic functional restoration ( OR = 1.94 , 95 % CI ( 1.15 , 3.28) in the 3D printing technology were all superior to those in the conventional group. 3D printing technology applied in the surgical treatment of pelvic fractures has the advantage of shorter operative time , less intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and lower rate of complication , and can improve the quality of pelvic fracture reduction and the recovery of postoperative pelvic function.
