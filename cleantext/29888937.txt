  This research investigates how the cultural mindset influences problem-solving. Drawing on the notion that cultural mindset influences the cognitive process individuals bring to bear at the moment of judgment , we propose that the congruency between the cultural mindset ( individualistic vs. collectivistic) and problem type ( rule-based vs. context-based) affects success in problem-solving. In 7 studies we incorporated the traditional approach to studying the impact of culture ( i.e. , comparing cultural groups) with contemporary approaches viewing cultural differences in a more dynamic and malleable manner. We first show that members of an individualistic group ( Jewish Americans) perform better on rule-based problems , whereas members of collectivistic groups ( ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs from Israel) perform better on context-based problems ( Study 1). We then study Arabs in Israel using language ( Arabic vs. Hebrew) to prime their collectivistic versus individualistic mindsets ( Study 2). As hypothesized , among biculturals ( those who internalize both cultures) Arabic facilitated solving context-based problems , whereas Hebrew facilitated solving rule-based problems. We follow up with 5 experiments priming the cultural mindset of individualism versus collectivism , employing various manifestations of the cultural dimension: focusing on the individual versus the collective ( Studies 3 , 6 , and 7); experiencing independence versus interdependence ( Study 4); and directing attention to objects versus the context ( Studies 5a-b). Finally , we took a meta-analytic approach , showing that the effects found in Studies 3-6 are robust across priming tasks , problems , and samples. Taken together , the differences between cultural groups ( Studies 1-2) were recreated when the individualistic/collectivistic cultural mindset was primed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
