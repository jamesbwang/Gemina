  The immune responses elicited following delivery of DNA vaccines to the skin has previously been shown to be significantly enhanced by the addition of electroporation ( EP) to the treatment protocol. Principally , EP increases the transfection of pDNA into the resident skin cells. In addition to increasing the levels of in vivo transfection , the physical insult induced by EP is associated with activation of innate pathways which are believed to mediate an adjuvant effect , further enhancing DNA vaccine responses. Here , we have investigated the possible mechanisms associated with this adjuvant effect , primarily focusing on the cell death pathways associated with the skin EP procedure independent of pDNA delivery. Using the minimally invasive CELLECTRA Â® -3 P intradermal electroporation device that penetrates the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin , we have investigated apoptotic and necrotic cell death in relation to the vicinity of the electrode needles and electric field generated. Employing the well-established TUNEL assay , we detected apoptosis beginning as early as one hour after EP and peaking at the 4 hour time point. The majority of the apoptotic events were detected in the epidermal region directly adjacent to the electrode needle. Using a novel propidium iodide in vivo necrotic cell death assay , we detected necrotic events concentrated in the epidermal region adjacent to the electrode. Furthermore , we detected up-regulation of calreticulin expression on skin cells after EP , thus labeling these cells for uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. These results allow us to delineate the cell death mechanisms occurring in the skin following intradermal EP independently of pDNA delivery. We believe these events contribute to the adjuvant effect observed following electroporation at the skin treatment site.
