  Water oxidation is the key process for many sustainable energy technologies containing artificial photosynthesis and metal-air batteries. Engineering inexpensive yet active electrocatalysts for water oxidation is mandatory for the cost-effective generation of solar fuels. Herein , we propose a novel hierarchical porous Ni-Co-mixed metal sulfide ( denoted as NiCoS) on Ti
