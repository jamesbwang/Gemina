  The treatment of autoimmune diseases still poses a major challenge , frequently relying on non-specific immunosuppressive drugs. Current efforts aim at reestablishing self tolerance using immune cells with suppressive activity like the regulatory T cells ( Treg) or the myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC). We have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of MDSC in mouse Alopecia Areata ( AA). In the same AA model , we now asked whether MDSC exosomes ( MDSC-Exo) can replace MDSC. MDSC-Exo from bone<disease> marrow cells ( BMC) cultures of healthy donors could substantially facilitate treatment. With knowledge on MDSC-Exo being limited , their suitability needs to be verified in advance. Protein marker profiles suggest comparability of BMC- to
