  Childhood eczema<disease> results from an interplay of genetic and environmental factors including Traffic-Related Air Pollution ( TRAP). In contrast , little is known about eczema<disease> in the elderly in general and its association with TRAP in particular. Animal experiments indicate that the arylhydrocarbon receptor ( AHR) might link TRAP and eczema<disease>. We investigated ( i) incidence and prevalence of eczema<disease> in elderly women , ( ii) its association with long-term TRAP exposure and ( iii) the effect modification by AHR polymorphism rs2066853. The study is based on the SALIA cohort. The women 's average age was 55 years at baseline ( 1985-1994) and 74 years at follow-up ( 2008-2009) examination. Incidence and prevalence of eczema<disease> were assessed by an adapted version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC) symptom questionnaire. TRAP was determined using land-use regression models. Adjusted logistic regression models were used. After age 55 , the incidence and prevalence of eczema<disease> symptoms were 7.9 % and 8.8 % , respectively. Significant associations ( p < 0.05) were found between all parameters of TRAP at the baseline visit and eczema<disease> incidence. The risk was higher for minor allele carriers of rs2066853 e.g. NOx: OR = 3.75 , p = 0.030 vs. OR = 1.34 , p = 0.317 in non-carriers ( p ( interaction) = 0.122). These results indicate a high incidence for eczema<disease> in elderly women , which is associated with chronic exposure to TRAP and possibly mediated by AHR.
