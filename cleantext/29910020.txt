  Faces are often used in psychological and neuroimaging research to assess perceptual and emotional processes. Most available stimulus sets , however , represent minimal diversity in both race and ethnicity , which may confound understanding of these processes in diverse/racially heterogeneous samples. Having a diverse stimulus set of faces and emotional expressions could mitigate these biases and may also be useful in research that specifically examines the effects of race and ethnicity on perceptual , emotional and social processes. The racially diverse affective expression ( RADIATE) face stimulus set is designed to provide an open-access set of 1,721 facial expressions of Black , White , Hispanic and Asian adult models. Moreover , the diversity of this stimulus set reflects census data showing a change in demographics in the United States from a white majority to a nonwhite majority by 2020. Psychometric results are provided describing the initial validity and reliability of the stimuli based on judgments of the emotional expressions.
