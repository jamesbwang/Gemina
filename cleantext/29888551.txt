  In the U.S. , Momordica charantia , is relatively unknown and usually found in specialty markets. In this study , cultivation of five bitter melon cultivars grown in field conditions in College Station , Texas , was evaluated. Additionally , ascorbic acid , amino acids and phenolic compounds were quantified from various cultivars grown at different years. The yield of the first year of evaluation was comparable to other bitter melon growing regions , ranging from 9371.5 kg ha The current three-year field study demonstrates that it is feasible to grow bitter melon commercially in Texas with proper climatic and agronomic conditions. Bitter melon is a rich source for ascorbic acid , amino acids and phenolic compounds , which make is a valuable food source to improve human health. This article is protected by copyright.
