  Human AFG3L2 is a compartmental AAA + protease that performs ATP-fueled degradation at the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Identifying how AFG3L2 selects substrates from the diverse complement of matrix-localized proteins is essential for understanding mitochondrial protein biogenesis and quality control. Here , we create solubilized forms of AFG3L2 to examine the enzyme 's substrate specificity mechanisms. We show that conserved residues within the presequence of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein , MrpL32 , target the subunit to the protease for processing into a mature form. Moreover , these residues can act as a degron , delivering diverse model proteins to AFG3L2 for degradation. By determining the sequence of degradation products from multiple substrates using mass spectrometry , we construct a peptidase specificity profile that displays constrained product lengths and is dominated by the identity of the residue at the P1 ' position , with a strong preference for hydrophobic and small polar residues. This specificity profile is validated by examining the cleavage of both fluorogenic reporter peptides and full polypeptide substrates bearing different P1 ' residues. Together , these results demonstrate that AFG3L2 contains multiple modes of specificity , discriminating between potential substrates by recognizing accessible degron sequences and performing peptide bond cleavage at preferred patterns of residues within the compartmental chamber.
