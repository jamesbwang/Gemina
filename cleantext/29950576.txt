  The most common biomineral produced in the contemporary ocean is calcium carbonate , including the polymorph calcite produced by coccolithophores. The surface waters of the ocean are supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate. As a result , particulate inorganic carbon ( PIC) , such as calcite coccoliths , is not expected thermodynamically to dissolve in waters above the lysocline ( ~ 4500-6000 m). However , observations indicate that up to 60-80 % of calcium carbonate is lost in the upper 500-1000 m of the ocean. This is hypothesized to occur in microenvironments with reduced saturation states , such as zooplankton guts. Using a new application of the highly precise
