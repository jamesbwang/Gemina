  To find the connections between microcystins and the phytoplankton community , coupled with environmental factors , we investigated 2 cyanobacteria blooming lakes , Lake Taihu ( at the center of the Yangtze River Delta , eastern China) and Lake Yanghe ( near Qinhuangdao City , northern China). Two years of data , including water quality and the amounts of phytoplankton , microcystins , and the congeners in both algal cells and water , were collected from the 2 lakes during 2013 and 2014. The results showed that both the microcystin quota and release percentage were positively correlated with biodiversity of phytoplankton and the Chlorophyta to phytoplankton ratio , but were negatively correlated with cyanobacteria abundance and the cyanobacteria to phytoplankton ratio; both the microcystin quota and release percentage were closely related to the intensity of competition between cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton; meanwhile , microcystins played a role in the competition between cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton. Salinity had a significantly negative relationship with both cellular and total microcystins , but a significantly positive relationship with the microcystin releasing percentage , indicating that an increase in salinity inhibited the production of microcystins but promoted their release into the aquatic environment. In addition , the average number of microcystins in Lake Yanghe was several times higher than the provisional guideline value adopted by the World Health Organization , indicating a possible health risk to local people.
