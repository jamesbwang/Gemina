  The causes of genetic epilepsies are unknown in the majority of patients. HCN ion channels have a widespread expression in neurons and increasing evidence demonstrates their functional involvement in human epilepsies. Among the four known isoforms , HCN1 is the most expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus and de novo HCN1 point mutations have been recently associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. So far , HCN1 mutations have not been reported in patients with idiopathic epilepsy. Using a Next Generation Sequencing approach , we identified the de novo heterozygous p.Leu157Val ( c. 469C > G) novel mutation in HCN1 in an adult male patient affected by genetic generalized epilepsy ( GGE) , with normal cognitive development. Electrophysiological analysis in heterologous expression model ( CHO cells) and in neurons revealed that L157V is a loss-of-function , dominant negative mutation causing reduced HCN1 contribution to net inward current and responsible for an increased neuronal firing rate and excitability , potentially predisposing to epilepsy. These data represent the first evidence that autosomal dominant missense mutations of HCN1 can also be involved in GGE , without the characteristics of epileptic encephalopathy reported previously. It will be important to include HCN1 screening in patients with GGE , in order to extend the knowledge of the genetic causes of idiopathic epilepsies , thus paving the way for the identification of innovative therapeutic strategies.
