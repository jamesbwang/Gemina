  The past 2 decades have seen a proliferation of transcatheter mitral valve ( MV) therapies , which are less invasive and distinct from surgical MV repair or replacement. The commonly used MV transcatheter therapies include ( 1) percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy ( PMBC) for rheumatic mitral stenosis; ( 2) edge-to-edge repair with the MitraClip for mitral regurgitation; ( 3) valve-in-valve implantation in bioprosthetic MV , native MV , or mitral ring; and ( 4) closure of paravalvular leaks ( PVLs). This article will focus on the use of echocardiography in the diagnosis , patient selection , procedural guidance , and postprocedural follow-up for PMBC , with notes on the role of transesophageal echocardiography in transcatheter interventions for prosthetic valve degeneration and PVL closure.
