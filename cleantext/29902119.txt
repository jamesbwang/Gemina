  This paper discusses the possibility of using the process of geopolymerization to immobilize the ash from the municipal waste incineration plant. Fly ash used in the related research came from the same incineration plant , one of the biggest in Poland. The examination was conducted on the waste samples labeled as 190107 * and 190113 *. The comparison included such properties of waste as e.g.: chemical composition , dioxin content , size and morphology of particles. The waste was solidified in geopolymer matrix made from: ( i) fly ash from the combustion of bituminous coal or ( ii) metakaolin. Their percentage was 50 mass % or 70 mass % , respectively. Moreover , leaching tests and mechanical properties of the geopolymers materials containing immobilized ashes were analysed. It was proved that geopolymerization process allows for the high-level immobilization of such compounds and elements as: chlorides , sulfates , fluorides , barium and zinc. Additionally , it was observed that in the case of the geopolymer samples containing 70 mass % of 190107 * waste , the average compressive strength exceeded 18 MPa.
