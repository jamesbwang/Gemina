  To determine if a standardized intervention process for Category II fetal heart rates ( FHRs) with significant decels ( SigDecels) would improve neonatal outcome and to determine the impact on mode of delivery rates. Patients with Category II FHRs from six hospitals were prospectively managed using a standardized approach based on the presence of recurrent SigDecels. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between pre- ( 6 months) and post- ( 11 months) implementation. Neonatal outcomes were: 5-minute APGAR scores of < 7 , < 5 , < 3 , and severe unexpected newborn complications ( UNC). Maternal outcomes included primary cesarean and operative vaginal birth rates of eligible deliveries. Post implementation there were 8,515 eligible deliveries , 3,799 ( 44.6 %) were screened , and 361 ( 9.5 %) met criteria for recurrent SigDecels. Compliance with the algorithm was 97.8 %. The algorithm recommended delivery in 68.0 % of cases. Relative to pre-implementation , 5-minute APGAR score of < 7 were reduced by 24.6 % (
