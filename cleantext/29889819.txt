  Ground reaction forces ( GRFs) during load carriage differ from unloaded walking. Methods to quantify peak vertical GRF ( pGRFvert) of Soldiers walking with loads outside of a laboratory are needed in order to study GRFs during operationally relevant tasks. Develop a statistically based model to predict pGRFvert during loaded walking from ActiGraph GT3X + activity monitor ( AM) vertical acceleration. 15 male Soldiers ( 25.4 ± 5.3 years , 85.8 ± 9.2 kg , 1.79 ± 9.3 m) wore an ActiGraph GT3X + AM over their right hip. Six walking trials ( 0.67-1.58 m/s) with four loads ( no load , 15 , 27 , 46 kg) and two types of footwear ( athletic shoes and combat boots) were completed on an instrumented force plate treadmill. Average peak vertical AM acceleration ( pACCvert) and pGRFvert were used to develop a regression equation to predict pGRFvert. The model was validated using a leave-one-subject-out ( LOSO) approach. Root mean square error ( RMSE) and average absolute percent difference ( AAPD) between actual and predicted pGRFvert were determined. pGRFvert was also predicted for two novel datasets and AAPD and RMSE calculated. The final equation to predict pGRFvert included pACCvert , body mass , carried load mass , and pACCvert-carried load mass interaction. Cross-validation resulted in an AAPD of 4.0 ± 2.7 % and an RMSE of 69.5 N for LOSO and an AAPD of 5.5 ± 3.9 % and an RMSE of 78.7 N for the two novel datasets. A statistically based equation developed to predict pGRFvert from ActiGraph GT3X + AM acceleration proved to be accurate to within 4 % for Soldiers carrying loads while walking. This equation provides a means to predict GRFs without a force plate.
