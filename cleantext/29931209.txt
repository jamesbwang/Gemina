  Asparagus ( Asparagus officinalis L.) accumulates inulin- and inulin neoseries-type fructans. Fructose released by the hydrolysis of fructans is an energy source for emerging asparagus spears. Plant fructans are hydrolyzed by fructan exohydrolases ( FEH) , whose presence in asparagus has not yet been fully characterized. Here , we describe for the first time the purification and characterization of a FEH from asparagus , and the functional analysis of its gene. The purified enzyme was predicted to exist as a dimer ( approximately 130 kDa) , consisting of two polypeptides with a molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa. N-terminal sequences of the purified enzyme were matched with the amino acid sequences of aoeh4a and aoeh4b-cDNAs isolated from asparagus ( cv. Gijnlim and Taihouwase). Native enzymes obtained from asparagus roots and recombinant enzymes produced by Pichia<pathogen> pastoris showed fructan 1-exohydrolase ( 1-FEH) activity via the hydrolysis of inulin-type fructan. Unlike other 1-FEHs , these enzymes showed minimal hydrolysis of 1-kestose but efficiently hydrolyzed neokestose. Therefore , the enzyme was termed 6G & 1-FEH. Gene expression studies in asparagus roots showed that aoeh4 increased during low-temperature periods and harvesting. These findings suggest that 6G & 1-FEH described here may be involved in fructan hydrolysis in asparagus roots for emerging asparagus spears.
