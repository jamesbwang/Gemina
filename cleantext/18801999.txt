  Optimizing economic welfare in environmental governance has been criticized for delivering short-term gains at the expense of long-term environmental degradation. Different from economic optimization , the concepts of sustainability and the more recent safe operating space have been used to derive policies in environmental governance. However , a formal comparison between these three policy paradigms is still missing , leaving policy makers uncertain which paradigm to apply. Here , we develop a better understanding of their interrelationships , using a stylized model of human-environment tipping elements. We find that no paradigm guarantees fulfilling requirements imposed by another paradigm and derive simple heuristics for the conditions under which these trade-offs occur. We show that the absence of such a master paradigm is of special relevance for governing real-world tipping systems such as climate , fisheries , and farming , which may reside in a parameter regime where economic optimization is neither sustainable nor safe.
