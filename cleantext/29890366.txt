  Metacognitive Training for Depression<symptom> ( D-MCT) is a highly standardized group program targeted at depression-related ( `` Beckian '') emotional as well as cognitive biases , including mood-congruent and false memory. While prior results are promising with respect to psychopathological outcomes ( depression<symptom> , it is unclear whether D-MCT also meets its goal of improving cognitive biases , such as false memories. In the framework of a randomized controlled trial ( registered trial , DRKS00007907) , we investigated whether D-MCT is superior to an active control condition ( health training , HT) in reducing the susceptibility of depressed patients for false memories. False memories were examined using parallel versions of a visual variant of the Deese-Roediger McDermott paradigm. Both groups committed less false memories at post assessment after 4 weeks compared to baseline. Relative to HT , D-MCT led to a significant decrease in high-confident false memories over time. The study presents first evidence that D-MCT decreases the susceptibility of depressed patients for false memories , particularly for errors made with high confidence that are presumably the most `` toxic '' in terms of mood-congruent memory distortions.
