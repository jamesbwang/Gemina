  Two-dimensional ( 2D) tin disulfide ( SnS2) is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries ( LIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity. The main challenges associated with the SnS2 electrodes are the poor cycling stability and low rate capability due to structural degradation in the discharge/charge process. Here , a facile two-step synthesis method is developed to fabricate hierarchical MoO3/SnS2 core-shell nanowires , where ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets are vertically anchored on MoO3 nanobelts to induce a heterointerface. Benefiting from the unique structural and compositional characteristics , the hierarchical MoO3/SnS2 core-shell nanowires exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and deliver a high reversible capacity of 504 mA h g-1 after 100 stable cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1 , which is far superior to the MoO3 and SnS2 electrodes. An analysis of lithiation dynamics based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrates that the formation of a hierarchical MoO3/SnS2 core-shell heterostructure can effectively suppress the rapid dissociation of shell-layer SnS2 nanosheets via the interfacial coupling effect and the central MoO3 backbone can trap and support the polysulfide in the discharge/charge process. The results are responsible for the high storage capacity and rate capability of MoO3/SnS2 electrode materials. This work provides a novel design strategy for constructing high-performance electrodes for LIBs.
