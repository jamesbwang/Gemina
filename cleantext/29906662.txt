  The inclusion of pre-pubertal bovine females in reproductive management could allow in vitro embryo production and reduce generation interval , thereby causing faster genetic gain of the herd. However , oocytes of pre-pubertal females have lower competence , blastocyst production , and pregnancy rates than those collected from pubertal animals. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an induced hormonal stimulation on the serum concentrations of Anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH) and FSH , ovarian responses , ovum pick up ( OPU) , and in vitro produced embryos ( IVP) from oocytes obtained from four-to seven-months old Nelore female cattle. In a crossover design , these females were randomly allocated into: 1) Treated Group ( TG , n = 9): the animals were subjected to a hormonal protocol ( implanted progesterone device , estradiol benzoate , LH , and FSH) from Day 0 ( the start of the treatment) to Day 7 ( OPU day) , and 2) Control Group ( CG , n = 9): the females did not receive any hormonal stimulation , but they had ablation of their largest follicles on Day 2 of experiment. Blood collection for serum FSH measurements was done on Days 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , and collection for serum AMH measurements was done on Days 5 and 8. As hypothesized , TG had higher serum FSH concentrations ( p < 0.05) on Day 5 ( 1.16 ± 0.31 ng/mL) , Day 6 ( 1.21 ± 0.45 ng/mL) , and Day 7 ( 0.95 ± 0.26 ng/mL) than CG ( 0.56 ± 0.17 ng/mL on Day 5 , 0.60 ± 0.25 ng/mL on Day 6 , and 0.60 ± 0.14 ng/mL on Day 7). However , serum AMH concentrations were neither significantly different ( p > 0.05) between CG and TG , nor between the collection days. Hormonal stimulation also increased ( p < 0.05) total follicular population ( 20.0 ± 4.95 CG vs 26.66 ± 4.24 TG) , ovarian diameter ( 13.08 ± 1.0 mm CG vs 14.81 ± 1.38 mm TG) and number of follicles ≥ 2.5 mm ( 6.88 ± 2.14 CG vs 11.55 ± 4.09 TG). In TG , grades I and II oocytes predominated , whereas , in CG grades III and IV oocytes were more abundant ( p < 0.05). No significant increases ( p > 0.05) in the cleavage ( 49.33 % CG vs 51.42 % TG) , cleavage > 4 cells ( 9.33 % CG vs 16.19 % TG) , and blastocysts rates ( 1.33 % CG vs 8.57 % TG) were seen in TG. This hormonal protocol increased serum FSH concentrations that possibly contributed to increases in the observed follicle , as well as improving oocyte quality. This exogenous hormonal stimulation increased available oocytes numbers for IVP , despite no increase in the in vitro embryo production efficiency.
