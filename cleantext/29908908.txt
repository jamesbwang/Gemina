  A host of pathogenic factors induce acute kidney injury ( AKI) leading to insufficiencies of renal function. In the present study we evaluated the role of myocardin-related transcription factor A ( MRTF-A) in the pathogenesis of AKI. We report that systemic deletion of MRTF-A or inhibition of MRTF-A activity with CCG-1423 significantly attenuated AKI in mice induced by either ischemia-reperfusion or LPS injection. Of note , MRTF-A deficiency or suppression resulted in diminished renal ROS production in AKI models with down-regulation of NAPDH oxdiase 1 ( NOX1) and NOX4 expression. In cultured macrophages , MRTF-A promoted NOX1 transcription in response to either hypoxia-reoxygenation or LPS treatment. Interestingly , macrophage-specific MRTF-A deletion ameliorated AKI in mice. Mechanistic analyses revealed that MRTF-A played a role in regulating histone H4K16 acetylation surrounding the NOX gene promoters by interacting with the acetyltransferase MYST1. MYST1 depletion repressed NOX transcription in macrophages. Finally , administration of a MYST1 inhibitor MG149 alleviated AKI in mice. Therefore , we data illustrate a novel epigenetic pathway that controls ROS production in macrophages contributing to AKI. Targeting the MRTF-A-MYST1-NOX axis may yield novel therapeutic strategies to combat AKI.
