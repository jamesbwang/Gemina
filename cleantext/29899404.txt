  Schizophrenia is characterized by hypoconnectivity or decreased intrinsic functional connectivity ( iFC) between prefrontal-limbic cortices and thalamic nuclei , as well as hyperconnectivity or increased iFC between primary-sensorimotor cortices and thalamic nuclei. However , cortico-thalamic iFC overlaps with larger , structurally defined cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical ( CSPTC) circuits. If such an overlap is relevant for intrinsic hypo-/ hyperconnectivity , it suggests ( i) that patterns of cortico-subcortical hypo-/ hyperconnectivity extend consistently from thalamus to basal ganglia nuclei; and ( ii) such consistent hypo-/ hyperconnectivity might link distinctively but consonant with different symptom dimensions , namely cognitive and psychotic impairments. To test this hypothesis , 57 patients with schizophrenia and 61 healthy controls were assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) and clinical-behavioral testing. IFC from intrinsic cortical networks into thalamus , striatum<pathogen> , and pallidum<pathogen> was estimated by partial correlations between fMRI time courses. In patients , the salience network covering prefrontal-limbic cortices was hypoconnected with the mediodorsal thalamus and ventral parts of striatum<pathogen> and pallidum<pathogen>; these iFC-hypoconnectivity patterns were correlated both among each other and specifically with patients ' impaired cognition. In contrast , the auditory-sensorimotor network covering primary-sensorimotor cortices was hyperconnected with the anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus and dorsal parts of striatum<pathogen> and pallidum<pathogen>; these iFC-hyperconnectivity patterns were likewise correlated among each other and specifically with patients ' psychotic symptoms. The results demonstrate that prefrontal-limbic hypoconnectivity and primary-sensorimotor hyperconnectivity extend consistently across subcortical nuclei and specifically across distinct symptom dimensions. Data support the model of consistent cortico-subcortical hypo-/ hyperconnectivity within CSPTC circuits in schizophrenia.
