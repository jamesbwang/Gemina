  to analyze the use of the Adductor Pollicis Muscle Thickness ( APMT) as an anthropometric parameter and prognostic indicator in hospitalized or ambulatory patients. systematic review carried out the Web of Science , SCOPUS and Lilacs databases. Twenty-three studies were performed on critical , surgical , oncological , nephropathic and hepatopathic patients , collecting data on bibliographic reference , study site , objectives , number of patients , age group , methodology , main results and conclusion. APMT proved to be a good anthropometric parameter for evaluation of nutritional status in critical patients without edema<symptom> , and surgical , oncological and nephropathic patients , but presented poor performance for diagnosis of malnutrition in hepatopathic patients. It was a good prognostic indicator for mortality in critical , nephropathic and oncological patients , and also a good predictor of hospitalization in nephropathic patients. There was an association with neurological complications in Hepatic Encephalopathy ( HE) in the case of hepatophatic patients , but it was not a predictor of postoperative complications in surgical patients. APTM was considered a good anthropometric parameter in most clinical conditions , except in patients with liver disease and a good prognostic indicator for mortality in critical , oncological and nephropathic patients , and a predictor of neurological complications in HE. Further prognostic investigation , standardization of cutoff points and evaluation of sensitivity and specificity are required.
