  Cancer survivors who undergo chemotherapy for non-CNS tumours often report substantial cognitive disturbances that adversely affect quality of life , during and after treatment. The neurotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs have been confirmed in clinical and pre-clinical research. Work with animals has also identified a range of factors and underlying mechanisms that contribute to chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. However , there is a continuing need to develop standard cognitive testing procedures for validation and comparison purposes , broaden the search for biological and neurochemical mechanisms , and develop improved animal models for investigating the combined effects of treatment , the disease , and other potential factors ( e.g. , age , stress). In this paper , a working group , formed under the auspices of the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force , reviews the state of pre-clinical research , formulates strategic priorities , and provides recommendations to guide animal research that meaningfully informs clinical investigations.
