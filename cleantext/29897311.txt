  Growing evidence shows that non-offending mothers experience significant loss and trauma following their child reporting experiencing sexual abuse. Maternal support offered to sexually abused children following disclosure can be a crucial factor in children 's recovery. Although mothers are often seen as playing a central role in facilitating the recovery of their sexually abused child , there has been little focus on their own needs and profiles. This present study aimed to increase our understanding of the diversity of profiles of non-offending mothers of sexually abused children by exploring the differences in psychosocial traits of non-offending mothers ( N = 68; age range 28-67 years) reporting higher and lower resilience. The mediating role of these psychosocial factors on the relationship between resilience and psychological distress will also be explored. Results found that non-offending mothers in the higher resilience group reported higher levels of positive reappraisal , self-compassion , social support , and significantly lower levels of psychological distress compared to non-offending mothers in the lower resilience group. Additionally , multiple mediation analysis indicated positive reappraisal , self-compassion , and social support to be significant mediators of the relationship between resilience and psychological distress. Increased levels of self-compassion and social support were found to be predictive of lowered psychological distress , while increased positive reappraisal predicted increased psychological distress. The findings of the present study provide support for the targeting of the psychosocial factors such as self-compassion , social support , and positive reappraisal in interventions for non-offending mothers in an effort to promote resilience.
