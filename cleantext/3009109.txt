  Non-malignant portal vein thrombosis ( PVT) is common in patients with advanced liver disease. Anticoagulation ( AC) increases the chances of recanalization and may improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis. We retrospectively assessed the course of non-malignant PVT in patients receiving AC. Parameters related to hepatic injury ( aspartate aminotransferase ( AST)/ alanine aminotransferase ( ALT)) , severity of disease ( ascites) and synthesis function ( albumin) as well as AC , rates of PVT regression/progression and AC-associated complications were documented. Among 122 patients with PVT , 51 patients with non-malignant PVT ( 27 incomplete , 24 complete) were included , 12 patients ( 25 %) received long-term AC therapy ( ≥ 9 months) as compared to 36 patients without long-term AC. We observed a trend towards higher regression rates with long-term AC of 58 % ( vs. 28 % without AC; p = 0.08) and lower progression rates of 25 % ( vs. 42 % without AC; p = 0.15). In the subgroup of patients with decompensation prior to PVT diagnosis ( n = 39) , long-term AC ( n = 10 , 25.6 %) resulted in a significantly higher rate of PVT regression/resolution ( 70 % vs. 24 % , p = 0.031). Interestingly , AST/ALT tended to decrease ( -19 %/ -16 %) and the proportion of patients with ascites became lower ( -33 %) with long-term AC ( without AC: ± 0 %). Furthermore , there was a significant improvement in albumin levels ( +9 %/ +3.6 g/dl) when compared to patients without long-term AC ( -2 %/ -0.8 g/dl; p = 0.04). Additionally , 10 patients were treated with direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) for splanchnic vein thrombosis. Importantly , there were no AC-associated bleeding events in patients with conventional AC and one bleeding event in patients with DOAC treatment ( 10 %). Our findings support anticoagulation in patients with non-malignant PVT , since AC seems safe and associated with superior PVT regression rates and might also decrease hepatic injury and improve liver synthesis.
