  Apoptosis is a ubiquitous process occurring in the brain under both physiological and pathological conditions. The central nervous system ( CNS) requires an active and efficient clean-up system to prevent the spillover of intracellular contents into the surrounding parenchyma and suppress the initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Microglia , the resident professional phagocytes of the brain , are the cells in charge of the removal of these dead cells by the process named phagocytosis. Therefore , microglial phagocytosis is a vital mechanism to maintain tissue homeostasis. Traditionally , this process has been assessed using indirect methods , which have resulted in poor or inaccurate estimations of microglial phagocytosis efficiency. In these protocols , we describe a series of parameters to directly quantify microglial phagocytosis efficiency in vivo and in vitro. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
