  Chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) is commonly treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) that inhibit the pro-leukemic activity of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Despite the therapeutic progress mediated by TKI use , off-target effects , treatment-induced drug resistance , and the limited effect of these drugs on CML stem cells ( SCs) are major drawbacks frequently resulting in insufficient or unsustainable treatment. Therefore , intense research efforts have focused on development of improved TKIs and alternative treatment strategies to eradicate CML SCs. Alongside efforts to design superior protein inhibitors , the need to overcome the poor therapeutic effect of TKIs on CML SCs has led to a renaissance of antisense strategies , as they are reported as effective in more primitive cell types. Despite the greater drug design flexibility offered by antisense sequence variability and remarkable chemical improvements , antisense drugs exhibit unacceptable levels of off-target effects , precluding them from large-scale clinical testing. Recent advances in antisense drug design have led to a pioneering mRNA recognition concept that may offer a helping hand in eliminating off-target effects , and has potential to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.
