  To investigate the duration of casual sunlight ultraviolet-B ( UVB) exposure required to maintain optimal Vitamin D status ( 25-hydroxyvitamin-D ( 25 ( OH) D > 50 nmol/L in urban Indian men , using polysulfone ( PSU) dosimeters and a sunlight exposure questionnaire. In healthy men ( aged 40-60 years) from Pune ( 18.52 ° N , 73.86 ° E) , India , serum 25 ( OH) D was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sunlight exposure was assessed using PSU dosimeter and by questionnaire. Of 160 men ( 48.3 ± 5.6 years) , 26.8 % were deficient and 40.6 % had insufficient Vitamin D concentrations. A hyperbolic function for the relationship between PSU measured sunlight exposure in standard erythema dose ( SED) and serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations ( In urban Indian men , > 1 h of casual midday sunlight exposure daily was required to maintain serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations above 50 nmol/L , and > 2 h of casual sunlight exposure was needed to maintain 25 ( OH) D concentrations above 75 nmol/L. Excess sunlight did not increase 25 ( OH) D linearly. The sunlight exposure questionnaire was validated for use in clinical studies and surveys.
