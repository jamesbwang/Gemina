  To analyze magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the elbow area to quantify the presence of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle. A total of 232 exams were analyzed; 218 were included , of which 141 were of men and 77 , women. Presence of the muscle was observed in 29 cases ( 13.3 %) , demonstrating that the presence of this muscle on images does not have a statistical correlation with the gender or age of the individual.
