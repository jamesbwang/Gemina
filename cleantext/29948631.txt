  Serious mental illness ( SMI) affects 5 % of the United States population and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality , and use of high-cost healthcare services including hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Integrating behavioral and physical healthcare may improve care for consumers with SMI , but prior research findings have been mixed. This quantitative retrospective cohort study assessed whether there was a predictive relationship between integrated healthcare clinic enrollment and inpatient and emergency department utilization for consumers with SMI when controlling for demographic characteristics and disease severity. While findings indicated no statistically significant impact of integrated care clinic enrollment on utilization , the sample had lower levels of utilization than would have been expected. Since policy and payment structures continue to support integrated care models , further research on different programs are encouraged , as each setting and practice pattern is unique.
