  Synonymous nucleotide variation is increasingly recognized as a factor than can affect protein expression , but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here , we investigated whether synonymous changes could affect expression of the potassium voltage gated channel subfamily H member 2 ( KCNH2) gene , encoding the human ether-a-go-go related gene ( hERG) ion channel which is linked to hereditary cardiac arrhythmia. We examined a previously described synthetic version ( hERG-CM) with synonymous substitutions designed to reduce GC content , rare codons , and mRNA secondary structure relative to the native construct ( hERG-NT). hERG-CM exhibited lower protein expression than hERG-NT in HEK293T cells. We found that the steady-state abundance of hERG NT mRNA was greater than hERG-CM because of an enhanced transcription rate and increased mRNA stability for hERG-NT. Translation of hERG-CM was independently reduced , contributing to the overall greater synthesis of hERG-NT channel protein. This was partially off-set , however , by a higher aggregation of newly synthesized hERG-NT channel , resulting in nonfunctional protein. Regional mRNA analyses of chimeras of hERG-NT and hERG-CM revealed that synonymous changes in the 5 ' segments of the coding region had the greatest influence on hERG synthesis at both the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together , these results indicate that synonymous nucleotide variations within the coding region , particularly in the 5 ' region of the hERG mRNA , can affect both transcription and translation. These findings support the notion that greater attention should be given to the effects of synonymous genetic variation when analyzing hERG DNA sequences in the study of hereditary cardiac disease.
