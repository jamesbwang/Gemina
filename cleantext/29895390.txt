  The engulfment of apoptotic cells by monocytes and unprimed macrophages results in M2 polarization. In the current study , we investigated whether apoptotic cells influence the phenotypic and functional characteristics of GM-CSF-differentiated human macrophages ( GM-Mφ). Our results demonstrate that GM-Mφ preincubated with apoptotic neutrophils ( GM-Mφ
