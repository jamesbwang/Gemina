  The kinetic compensation effect in the logistic distributed activation energy model ( DAEM) for lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis was investigated. The sum of square error ( SSE) surface tool was used to analyze two theoretically simulated logistic DAEM processes for cellulose and xylan pyrolysis. The logistic DAEM coupled with the pattern search method for parameter estimation was used to analyze the experimental data of cellulose pyrolysis. The results showed that many parameter sets of the logistic DAEM could fit the data at different heating rates very well for both simulated and experimental processes , and a perfect linear relationship between the logarithm of the frequency factor and the mean value of the activation energy distribution was found. The parameters of the logistic DAEM can be estimated by coupling the optimization method and isoconversional kinetic methods. The results would be helpful for chemical kinetic analysis using DAEM.
