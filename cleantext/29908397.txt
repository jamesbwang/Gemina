  Changes in land use due to the industrial revolution , increasing population , ever-increasing desire for economic growth is a global concern. The aforementioned changes can have a significant impact on global and regional ecosystem services which are indispensable for human well-being and their subsistence. This study identifies several approaches ( Costanza et al. , de Groot et al. , and Xie et al.) to estimate the value of global terrestrial ecosystem services. High resolution ( 300 m) land use products provided by European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative ( ESA-CCI) were used to quantify the global ecosystem service values ( ESV) for 1995 , 2000 , 2005 , 2010 and 2015 respectively. The coefficient of elasticity ( CE) and coefficient of sensitivity ( CS) was calculated to compute the response of ESV 's corresponding to land use land cover ( LULC) change. The results estimated the mean global ESV 's ( Trillion US$ year
