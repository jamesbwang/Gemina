  Despite significant advances in the last 30 years in reducing morbidity and mortality from heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) with pharmacological and device-based therapies , patients remain at a high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Sacubitril/valsartan , a first-in-class angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors ( ARNI) , has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalisation and improve symptoms in patients with chronic , ambulatory , symptomatic HFrEF in a large , phase 3 , multicentre , international , randomised controlled trial , PARADIGM-HF , when compared to the gold-standard angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , enalapril. This article will review the development of sacubitril/valsartan , the evidence for its use and its current and future role in the management of HFrEF.
