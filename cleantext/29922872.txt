  Consistent with Baldwin and Ford 's model ( Pers Psychol 41 ( 1): 63-105 , 1988) , training transfer is defined as the generalization of learning from a training to everyday practice in the workplace. The purpose of this review was to examine the influence of work-environment factors , one component of the model hypothesized to influence training transfer within behavioral health. An electronic literature search guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research 's inner setting domain was conducted was conducted on Medline OVID , Medline EMBASE , and PsycINFO databases. Of 9184 unique articles , 169 full-text versions of articles were screened for eligibility , yielding 26 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Results from the 26 studies revealed that overall , having more positive networks and communication , culture , implementation climate , and readiness for implementation can facilitate training transfer. Although few studies have examined the impact of inner setting factors on training transfer , these results suggest organizational context is important to consider with training efforts. These findings have important implications for individuals in the broader health professions educational field.
