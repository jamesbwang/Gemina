  Using an asymmetric tetradentate ligand N- ( ( 6- ( 1H-pyrazol-1-yl) pyridin-2-yl) methylene) benzohydrazide ( pypzbeyz) , two high-coordinate 3d transition metal compounds ( CoII ( pypzbeyz) ( NO3) 2) ( 1) and ( FeII ( pypzbeyz) 2) ( BF4) 2 ( CH3CN) ( 2) have been synthesized and characterized by structural and magnetic measurements. X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that compound 1 is seven-coordinate with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry ( pseudo-D5h) and compound 2 is eight-coordinate with a triangular dodecahedral geometry ( pseudo-D2d). Direct current ( dc) magnetic susceptibilities revealed that compound 1 shows easy-plane magnetic anisotropy ( D = +29.9 cm-1 , E = 0.31 cm-1) and 2 shows easy-axis magnetic anisotropy ( D = -6.6 cm-1 , E = 0.02 cm-1). Alternating current ( ac) magnetic measurements indicate that both compounds exhibit field-induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior. Furthermore , ab initio calculations also demonstrate that compound 1 presents a strong easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and 2 presents an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy , which are further identified by the calculated orientations of the local magnetic axes. These results demonstrate an effective way to achieve the targeted synthesis of high-coordinate 3d SIMs.
