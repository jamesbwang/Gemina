  Development of optimal drug product ( DP) lyophilization cycles is typically accomplished via multiple engineering runs to determine appropriate process parameters. These runs require significant time and product investments , which are especially costly during early phase development when the DP formulation and lyophilization process are often defined simultaneously. Even small changes in the formulation may require a new set of engineering runs to define lyophilization process parameters. To overcome these development difficulties , an 8 factor definitive screening design , including both formulation and process parameters , was executed on a fully human monoclonal antibody DP. The definitive screening design enables evaluation of several interdependent factors to define critical parameters that affect primary drying time and product temperature. From these parameters , a lyophilization development model is defined where near optimal process parameters can be derived for many different DP formulations. This concept is demonstrated on a monoclonal antibody DP where statistically predicted cycle responses agree well with those measured experimentally. This design of experiments approach for early phase lyophilization cycle development offers a workflow that significantly decreases the development time of clinically and potentially commercially viable lyophilization cycles for a platform formulation that still has variable range of compositions.
