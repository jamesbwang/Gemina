  Poor<symptom> knowledge and practice of waste management among hospital cleaners is a significant occupational and public health risk which could be improved by better training. To assess private hospital cleaners ' knowledge and practice of hospital waste management and the association with training. A cross-sectional study using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was undertaken. The questionnaire was designed to record demographics , assess knowledge and assess self-reported practice and training by private hospital cleaners in Etiosa in Nigeria. Results were analysed with SPSS20 using chi-squared tests. Ninety-eight hospital cleaners out of 135 participated ( response rate 73 %) , of whom 81 % reported that they had received training. Forty-nine per cent had good knowledge , while 90 % self-reported good practice. Statistical analysis showed a significant negative association between training and knowledge ( Ï‡2 = 11.1 , P < 0.01). There was no significant association between knowledge and practice. This group of cleaners reported good practice but knowledge was negatively associated with training. This may be related to the nature of training. The study found a knowledge gap , exposing these hospital cleaners to occupational risks which appropriate training has the potential to prevent. Collaboration to produce effective training programmes is recommended.
