  Brain stimulation techniques can modulate cognitive functions in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Pilot studies have shown promising effects of brain stimulations on Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Brain stimulations can be categorized into non-invasive brain stimulation ( NIBS) and invasive brain stimulation ( IBS). IBS includes deep brain stimulation ( DBS) , and invasive vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) , whereas NIBS includes transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) , transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS) , electroconvulsive treatment ( ECT) , magnetic seizure<symptom> therapy ( MST) , cranial electrostimulation ( CES) , and non-invasive VNS. We reviewed the cutting-edge research on these brain stimulation techniques and discussed their therapeutic effects on AD. Both IBS and NIBS may have potential to be developed as novel treatments for AD; however , mixed findings may result from different study designs , patients selection , population , or samples sizes. Therefore , the efficacy of NIBS and IBS in AD remains uncertain , and needs to be further investigated. Moreover , more standardized study designs with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up are warranted for establishing a structural guide for future studies and clinical application.
