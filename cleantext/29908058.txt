  The present study used achievement goal theory ( AGT) as a theoretical framework and examined the role of mastery and performance goals , both performance-approach and performance-avoidance , on school achieve-ment within the nonlinear dynamical systems ( NDS) perspective. A series of cusp catastrophe models were applied on students ' achievement in a number of school subjects , such as mathematics and language for elementary school and algebra , geometry , ancient and modern Greek language for high school , using achievement goal orientations as control variables. The participants ( N = 224) were students attending fifth and eighth grade ( aged 11 and 14 , respectively) in public schools located in northern Greece. Cusp analysis based on the probability density function was carried out by two procedures , the maximum likelihood and the least squares. The results showed that performance-approach goals had no linear effect on achievement , while the cusp models implementing mastery goals as the asymmetry factor and performance-avoidance as the bifurcation , proved superior to their linear alternatives. The results of the study based on NDS support the multiple goal perspective within AGT. Theoretical issues , educational implications and future directions are discussed.
