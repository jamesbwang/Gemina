  Self-bound quantum droplets are a newly discovered phase in the context of ultracold atoms. In this Letter , we report their experimental realization following the original proposal by Petrov ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 , 155302 ( 2015) PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/ PhysRevLett .115.155302) , using an attractive bosonic mixture. In this system , spherical droplets form due to the balance<symptom> of competing attractive and repulsive forces , provided by the mean-field energy close to the collapse threshold and the first-order correction due to quantum fluctuations. Thanks to an optical levitating potential with negligible residual confinement , we observe self-bound droplets in free space , and we characterize the conditions for their formation as well as their size and composition. This work sets the stage for future studies on quantum droplets , from the measurement of their peculiar excitation spectrum to the exploration of their superfluid nature.
