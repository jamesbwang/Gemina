  During development , the embryonic heart grows by addition of cells from a highly proliferative progenitor pool and by subsequent precisely controlled waves of cardiomyocyte proliferation. In this period , the heart can compensate for cardiomyocyte loss by an increased proliferation rate of the remaining cardiomyocytes. This proliferative capacity is lost soon after birth , with heart growth continuing by an increase in cardiomyocyte volume. The failure of the injured adult heart<symptom> to regenerate often leads to the development of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , a major cause of death. With the recent observation of a small fraction of cardiomyocytes that appear to have retained the proliferative capacity within the adult heart , as well as the identification of developmental pathways such as the Hippo-signaling pathway that can invoke mature cardiomyocyte proliferation , more studies are taking a knowledge-based mechanistic approach to heart regeneration. A key question being asked is if this knowledge can be used therapeutically to reinitiate cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury such as myocardial infarction. In this respect , uncovering and understanding the mechanisms and conditions that give rise to a fully functional and adaptive heart in the developing embryo could provide us with the answers to many of the questions that are now being asked.
