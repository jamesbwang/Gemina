  Several centers have presented minimally invasive surgical approaches to centrifugal left ventricular assist device implantation. Although minimally invasive implantation has been successfully performed by experienced surgeons , at large implanting centers , it is unknown whether these techniques are widely adoptable. We evaluated the experience of a surgeon early in his career with conventional and minimally invasive approaches to device implantation. All consecutive left ventricular assist device implantations by a single surgeon in the first year of practice ( 2015-2016) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified by standard approach , conventional full sternotomy versus a minimally invasive approach , left anterior thoracotomy and upper hemisternotomy. Demographics , perioperative variables , and short-term outcomes were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Thirteen patients were identified: six performed via the standard approach and seven performed via the minimally invasive approach. Preoperative demographics were comparable in both groups. However , there was significantly more preoperative right ventricle dysfunction in the minimally invasive group ( P = 0.01). Although operative time was significantly longer in the minimally invasive cohort , there was a trend toward decreased cardiopulmonary bypass time. Six-month survival in both groups was 100 %. Compared with conventional sternotomy , minimally invasive ventricular assist device implantation , performed by a surgeon in his first year of practice , had similar perioperative outcomes and excellent survival. Based on these data , minimally invasive implantation may be a feasible strategy for device implantation even early in a surgeon 's career.
