  Exploration of development requires the use of research designs and process-oriented methodologies that can capture daily fluctuations within individuals , systematic changes within individuals , and differences between individuals ( Nesselroade , 1991). We examine the stress-affect relationship in this way to assess how the relationship between daily stress and negative affect ( NA) as well as the relationship between daily stress and positive affect ( PA) differs between individuals and changes over time depending on age and stress differences. Participants ( N = 966) completed daily `` burst '' assessments of stress , NA , and PA.. Three-level multi-level models depicted how cross-sectional age , within-person age changes , and global stress differences impact the daily stress-affect relationship. Findings illustrate that cross-sectional age and the aging process uniquely buffer the stress-NA relationship whereas global stress exacerbates it. Furthermore , older adults as well as adults with low global stress experience a weaker relationship between daily stress and PA as they age , but midlife adults and adults with high global stress experience a stronger relationship. These results depict differences in aging trajectories for both midlife and older adults and thus inform intervention and preventative care strategies aimed toward promoting stress regulation.
