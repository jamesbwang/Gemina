  The aim of the study was to investigate the anticancer potential of Aclidinium bromide ( INN) in glioblastoma. Glioblastoma cell lines U251 and U87 were treated with INN. The effects of INN on cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell migration and invasion assays. Additionally , the effects of INN on the proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 kit and flow cytometry. Western blotting was employed to determine anti-apoptotic proteins and the signaling pathway changes. The results showed that INN effectively suppressed proliferation , migration and invasion and induced apoptosis in U251 and U87 cells , respectively. Furthermore , the expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 was significantly decreased whereas the expression of Bax and caspase-3 were increased in glioblastoma cells ( all , P Keywords: Aclidinium bromide , glioblastoma , proliferation , migration , invasion , apoptosis.
