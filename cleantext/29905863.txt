  In the light of the new ICRP requirements the first National radon survey has been conducted in Bulgaria in the period 2015-16. Indoor radon concentrations were measured for 1 y in 2778 dwellings of whole Bulgarian territory in order to obtain the systematic data for the distribution of radon. The arithmetic mean is 111 Bq m-3 and the geometric mean is 81 Bq m-3 with geometric standard deviation of 2.15. On the base of the data , an annual effective dose to the Bulgarian population due to indoor radon exposure was estimated at 5.2 mSv and excess lifetime cancer risk at about 2 %. The evaluation has been made using the ICRP dose coefficient of 6.7 Ã— 10-6 ( mSv h-1)/ ( Bq m-3) , 7000 h occupancy per year and value of 0.4 for the equilibrium factor. This preliminary assessment allows consideration and planning the long-term appropriate radon and exposure reduction measures in the new national action plan.
