  Single-crystal & alpha;- Al ₂ O ₃ fibres can be utilized as a novel reinforcement in high-temperature composites owing to their high elastic modulus , chemical and thermal stability. Unlike non-oxide fibres and polycrystalline alumina fibres , high-temperature oxidation and polycrystalline particles boundary growth will not occur for single-crystal & alpha;- Al ₂ O ₃ fibres. In this work , single-crystal & alpha;- Al ₂ O ₃ whiskers and Al ₂ O ₃ particles synergistic reinforced copper-graphite composites were fabricated by mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing techniques. The phase compositions , microstructures , and fracture morphologies of the composites were investigated using X-ray diffraction , a scanning electron microscope equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer ( EDS) , an electron probe microscopic analysis equipped with wavelength-dispersive spectrometer , and a transmission electron microscope equipped with EDS. The mechanical properties have been measured by a micro-hardness tester and electronic universal testing machine. The results show that the reinforcements were unevenly distributed in the matrix with the increase of their content and there were some micro-cracks located at the interface between the reinforcement and the matrix. With the increase of the Al ₂ O ₃ whisker content , the compressive strength of the composites first increased and then decreased , while the hardness decreased. The fracture and strengthening mechanisms of the composite materials were explored on the basis of the structure and composition of the composites through the formation and function of the interface. The main strengthening mechanism in the composites was fine grain strengthening and solid solution strengthening. The fracture type of the composites was brittle fracture.
