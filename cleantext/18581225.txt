  Schools remain among the most frequent providers of children 's mental health services , particularly in low-income urban settings. Several decades of research have focused on training teachers to implement evidence-based interventions for minimizing disruptive behavior. Studies consistently demonstrate robust improvements in student behavior and learning; however , the impact on teachers ' work-related stress or satisfaction is not well understood. Six urban , high-poverty elementary schools were randomly assigned to a school mental health services model ( Links to Learning; L2L) for referred , disruptive students or to services and professional development as usual ( SAU). Teachers ( n = 71 , K-4 general education teachers) in L2L schools participated in professional development and consultation in two universal and two targeted interventions to reduce disruptive behaviors and promote learning. Teachers ( n = 65) in SAU schools participated in professional development as usual. Multiple regression models examined teacher reports of individual-level self-efficacy , classroom-level student functioning , and school-level organizational health as predictors of stress and satisfaction. Findings revealed no significant difference between conditions on teacher work-related stress or satisfaction. Organizational health was the strongest predictor of stress and satisfaction. Training on and implementation of evidence-based classroom interventions did not appear to significantly impact teachers ' work-related stress or satisfaction. Instead , findings point to organizational climate and teacher connectedness as potential levers for change , supporting prior work on teacher stress and satisfaction in schools. The significance of targeting organizational factors may be particularly significant in urban school districts.
