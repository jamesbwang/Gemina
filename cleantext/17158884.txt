  The reduction of pulmonary surfactant ( PS) is essential for decreased pulmonary compliance and edema<symptom> in acute lung injury ( ALI). Thyroid transcription factor-1 ( TTF-1) plays a major role in the regulation of surfactant protein-A ( SP-A) , the most abundant protein component of PS. Simultaneously , the glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) analogue can enhance SP-A expression in the lung. However , the underlying mechanism is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore whether liraglutide , a GLP-1 analogue , upregulates SP-A expression through the TTF-1 signaling pathway in ALI. In vivo , a murine model of ALI was induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS). Pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , edema<symptom> , insulin level , ultrastructural changes in type II alveolar epithelial ( ATII) cells , and SP-A and TTF-1 expression were analyzed. In vitro , rat ATII cells were obtained. SP-A and TTF-1 expression in cells was measured. ShRNA-TTF-1 transfection was performed to knock down TTF-1 expression. Our data showed that LPS-induced lung injury and increase in insulin level , and LPS-induced reduction of SP-A and TTF-1 expression in both the lung and cells , were significantly compromised by liraglutide. Furthermore , we also found that these effects of liraglutide were markedly blunted by shRNA-TTF-1. Taken together , our findings suggest that liraglutide enhances SP-A expression in ATII cells and attenuates pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in LPS-induced ALI , most likely through the TTF-1 signaling pathway.
