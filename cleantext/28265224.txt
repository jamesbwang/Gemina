  Recent advances enable data from manufacturing systems to be captured and contextualised relative to other phases of the product lifecycle , a necessary step toward understanding system behaviour and satisfying traceability requirements. Significant challenges remain for integrating information across the lifecycle and enabling efficient decision-making. In this paper , we explore opportunities for mapping standard data representations , such as the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data ( STEP) , MTConnect , and the Quality Information Framework ( QIF) to integrate information silos existing across the lifecycle. To demonstrate this vision , we describe a reference implementation with a contract manufacturer in the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST) Smart Manufacturing Systems Test Bed. Using this implementation , we explore how knowledge generated from manufacturing can support lifecycle decision-making. As a case study , we then present an interactive prototype correlating the test bed 's data based on the context that must be provided for a specific decision-making viewpoint.
