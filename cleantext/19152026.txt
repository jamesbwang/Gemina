  The increasing use of nipple-sparing mastectomy ( NSM) and skin-sparing mastectomy ( SSM) in the treatment of nonmetastatic breast cancer is justified by considerations linked to their therapeutic index. In selected patients , efficacy results tend to be similar to those observed after radical modified mastectomy and at the same time , subcutaneous mastectomies preserve the patient 's body image. Yet the oncologic safety of the two former surgical approaches is still a matter of debate , also in consideration of the almost complete absence of clinical studies directed to prospective , controlled comparisons between subcutaneous and radical modified mastectomies. In addition , no clear statement-and consequently no consensus-emerges from the rather rare reports addressing the issue of whether or not there exist robust algorithms for guiding decision-making in delivering postoperative radiotherapy after NSM or SSM. The objective of the present review article is to revisit the dataset recently provided by the literature , which might help oncology teams optimise local treatment in this patient population.
