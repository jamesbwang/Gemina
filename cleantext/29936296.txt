  Ethylene oxide ( EO) , an industrial intermediate and gaseous sterilant for medical devices , is carcinogenic to humans , which warrants minimization of exposure in the workplaces. The principal analytical strategy currently used in biomonitoring of exposure to EO consists in the conversion of N- ( 2-hydroxyethyl) adduct at the N-terminal valine ( HEV) in globin to a specific thiohydantoin derivative accessible to GC-MS analysis ( modified Edman degradation , MED). Though highly sensitive , the method is laborious and , at least in our hands , not sufficiently robust. Here we developed an alternative strategy of HEV determination based on acidic hydrolysis ( AH) of globin followed directly by HPLC-ESI-MS
