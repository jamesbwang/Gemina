  Opioids alleviate pain , but adverse effects severely limit their usefulness. To solve this problem , biased ligands favoring 1 signaling pathway downstream of the μ-opioid receptor over another are being developed. In the target article , the authors synthesize compounds that preferentially activate G-protein or β-arrestin signaling. They find that increased bias towards G-protein signaling produces better antinociception with minimal side effects in mice models. G-protein-biased opioids may provide a safer treatment strategy.
