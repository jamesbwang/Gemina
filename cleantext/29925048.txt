  We report on the prognostic role of cross sectional area ( CSA) enlargement and axonal damage in traumatic sural neuropathy ( TSN). Reference values were defined in 23 healthy subjects. 13patients with TSN underwent evaluation ( Thessaloniki Hypesthesia Score ( THS) , ultrasound , electrophysiology). All patients were followed up with THS 6 months after initial evaluation. During initial evaluation , the 13 patients showed a mean THS of 2.6 ( SD ± 0.9). 7 patients showed pathological ( pUS) and 6 normal CSA ( nUS). 8 patients showed axonal affection ( pCS) and 5 no axonal affection ( nCS). During follow up , mean THS was 3.1 ( SD ± 0.9) in pUS , and 1.8 ( SD ± 0.7) in the nUS group ( p < 0.001). Mean THS was 2.8 ( SD ± 0.7) in pCS , and 2.1 ( SD ± 0.9) in nCS group ( p = 0.035). CSA enlargement , but not axonal loss , seems to have a negative prognostic role in patients with TSN.
