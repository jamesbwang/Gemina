  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide , including in Sweden. The main aim of this study was to explore the temporal trends and spatial patterns of CVD in Sweden using spatial autocorrelation analyses. The CVD admission rates between 2000 and 2010 throughout Sweden were entered as the input disease data for the analytic processes performed for the Swedish capital , Stockholm , and also for the whole of Sweden. Age-adjusted admission rates were calculated using a direct standardisation approach for men and women , and temporal trends analysis were performed on the standardised rates. Global Moran 's I was used to explore the structure of patterns and Anselin 's local Moran 's I , together with Kulldorff 's scan statistic were applied to explore the geographical patterns of admission rates. The rates followed a spatially clustered pattern in Sweden with differences occurring between sexes. Accordingly , hot spots were identified in northern Sweden , with higher intensity identified for men , together with clusters in central Sweden. Cold spots were identified in the adjacency of the three major Swedish cities of Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malm√∂. The findings of this study can serve as a basis for distribution of health-care resources , preventive measures and exploration of aetiological factors.
