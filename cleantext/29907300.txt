  Regarding to the growing trend of photovoltaic ( PV) energy as a clean energy source in electrical networks and its uncertain nature , PV energy prediction has been proposed by researchers in recent decades. This problem is directly effects on operation in power network while , due to high volatility of this signal , an accurate prediction model is demanded. A new prediction model based on Hilbert Huang transform ( HHT) and integration of improved empirical mode decomposition ( IEMD) with feature selection and forecast engine is presented in this paper. The proposed approach is divided into three main sections. In the first section , the signal is decomposed by the proposed IEMD as an accurate decomposition tool. To increase the accuracy of the proposed method , a new interpolation method has been used instead of cubic spline curve ( CSC) fitting in EMD. Then the obtained output is entered into the new feature selection procedure to choose the best candidate inputs. Finally , the signal is predicted by a hybrid forecast engine composed of support vector regression ( SVR) based on an intelligent algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified over a number of real-world engineering test cases in comparison with other well-known models. The obtained results prove the validity of the proposed method.
