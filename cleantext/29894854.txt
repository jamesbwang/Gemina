  The loading capacity of thionin ( Thi) on shortened multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( S-MWCNTs) and acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( A-MWCNTs) was compared. Two DNA probe fragments were designed for hybridization with microRNA-21 ( miR-21) , the microRNAs ( miRNAs) model analyte. DNA probe 1 ( P1) was assembled on Au nanoparticles ( AuNPs) modified electrode. MiR-21 was captured by the pre-immobilized P1. A signal nanoprobe was synthesized by loading large amount of Thi on S-MWCNTs with covalently bonded probe 2 ( P2). Owing to the large effective surface area of MWCNTs , fast electron shuttle of MWCNTs , high-loaded Thi on S-MWCNTs , and the increased conductivity from AuNPs , after signal probe hybridized with miR-21 , it gave rise to a magniÔ¨Åed current response on electrode. The increased electrochemical current enabled us to quantitatively detect miR-21. Expensive bioreagents and labeled target/detection DNA or miRNAs were avoided in this strategy. The operation complexity and assay cost were also reduced.
