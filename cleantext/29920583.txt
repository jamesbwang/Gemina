  Three patients enrolled in a clinical trial of 5-aminolevulinic-acid ( 5-ALA)- induced fluorescence-guidance , which has been demonstrated to facilitate intracranial tumor resection , were found on neuropathological examination to have focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD). To evaluate in this case series visible fluorescence and quantitative levels of protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX) during surgery and correlate these findings with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and histopathology. Patients were administered 5-ALA ( 20 mg/kg) approximately 3 h prior to surgery and underwent image-guided , microsurgical resection of their MRI- and electrophysiologically identified lesions<symptom>. Intraoperative visible fluorescence was evaluated using an operating microscope adapted with a commercially available blue light module. Quantitative PpIX levels were assessed using a handheld fiber-optic probe and a wide-field imaging spectrometer. Sites of fluorescence measurements were co-registered with both preoperative MRI and histopathological analysis. Three patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of FCD ( Types 1b , 2a , and 2b) underwent surgery. All patients demonstrated some degree of visible fluorescence ( faint or moderate) , and all patients had quantitatively elevated concentrations of PpIX. No evidence of neoplasia was identified on histopathology , and in 1 patient , the highest concentrations of PpIX were found at a tissue site with marked gliosis but no typical histological features of FCD. FCD has been found to be associated with intraoperative 5-ALA-induced visible fluorescence and quantitatively confirmed elevated concentrations of the fluorophore PpIX in 3 patients. This finding suggests that there may be a role for fluorescence-guidance during surgical intervention for epilepsy-associated FCD.
