  Most higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( HR-MDS) patients will become transfusion-dependent , leading to potential complications , including infections or end-organ dysfunction. Data correlating achievement of transfusion-free intervals ( TFIs) during first-line therapy ( 1LT) with survival are sparse. We evaluated HR-MDS patients receiving 1LT diagnosed from 1/1/2008 to 7/31/2015 and the impact of a TFI ( â‰¥ 60-day interval without transfusions) on progression-free and overall survival ( PFS , OS) using Cox proportional-hazard models. Two hundred and twenty-nine HR-MDS patients received 1LT; overall , median PFS/OS were 8.4 months and 14.7 months , respectively. Two-year PFS/OS were 22.3 % and 34.6 % , respectively. Median PFS/OS were longer for patients with vs. without a TFI ( 16.9 vs. 6.1 months and 26.1 vs. 11.8 months , respectively; p < .01 ( both)). Two-year PFS ( 43.0 % vs. 3.9 %; p < .01) and 2-year OS ( 51.8 % vs. 22.5 %; p < .01) were also longer in patients with a TFI vs. not. Achievement of a TFI during 1LT appears to positively affect PFS and OS in HR-MDS patients.
