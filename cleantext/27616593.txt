  The advent of combination therapy to provide LDL lowering beyond that achieved with statins necessitates the development of greater understanding of how drugs work together , what changes occur in key lipoprotein fractions , and what residual risk remains. Clinical trials of agents that , when added to statins , generate profound LDL lowering have been successful in reducing further the risk of cardiovascular disease. LDL cholesterol can be now decreased to unprecedented levels , so the focus of attention then shifts to other apolipoprotein B-containing , atherogenic lipoprotein classes such as lipoprotein ( a) and remnants of the metabolism of triglyceride-rich particles. `` Non-HDL cholesterol '' is used increasingly ( especially if measured in the non-fasting state) as a more comprehensive index of risk. Metabolic studies reveal how current drugs act in combination to achieve profound lipid lowering. However , care is needed in interpreting achieved LDLc and non-HDLc levels in the emerging treatment paradigm.
