  This study aimed to determine the failure rate of a combination of the PERC and the YEARS rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ( PE) in the emergency department ( ED). We performed a retrospective analysis of two European cohorts of emergency patients with low gestalt clinical probability of PE ( PROPER and PERCEPIC). All patients we included were managed using a conventional strategy ( D-dimer test , followed , if positive , by computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram CTPA). We tested a diagnostic strategy that combined PERC and YEARS to rule out PE. The primary endpoint was a thrombo-embolic event diagnosed in the ED or at 3 months follow up. Secondary endpoints included a thrombo-embolic event at baseline in the ED , and a CTPA in the ED. 95 % confidence interval of proportions were calculated with the use of Wilson 's continuity correction. We analyzed 1951 patients ( mean age 47 , 56 % women) with an overall proportion of patients with PE of 3.5 %. Both PERC and YEARS strategies were associated with 11 missed PE in the ED: failure rate 0.57 ( 0.32- 1.02). At 3 months follow-up , the overall failure rate was 0.83 % ( 95 % CI 0.51- 1.35). Among the 503 patients who underwent a CTPA ( 26 %) , the use of the PERC-YEARS combination would have ruled out PE without CTPA in 249 patients ( 50 % ( 95 % CI 45- 54) , absolute reduction 13 % ( 95 % CI 11- 14)). The combination of PERC then YEARS was associated with a low risk of PE diagnostic failure , and would have resulted in a relative reduction of almost half of CTPA.
