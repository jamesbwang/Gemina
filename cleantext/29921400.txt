  This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of T-cell immune function and L-dopamine ( L-DOPA) in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Sixty subjects ( included in the study group) with PD who were patients of the Neurology Department of The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University from July 2015 to March 2017 were selected. The study group was then categorized into groups according to the age of the patients , severity of disease , level of cognition , and treatment of L-DOPA. The control group ( 30 cases) was from the healthy population of the check-up center at The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University. The peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets of the study group were measured by direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry staining and compared with the control group. At the same time , correlation analysis was carried out on patients with different degrees of disease severity according to staging , different accompanying symptoms , and whether L-DOPA was administered. The results of the study show that the levels of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD3 + , and CD4 +/ CD8 + peripheral blood in PD patients were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P less than 0.05). It was found that the levels of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD3 + , and CD4 +/ CD8 + decreased with age. The CD4 + , CD8 + , CD3 + , and CD4 +/ CD8 + in patients with advanced stage PD were more significant than those with low PD stages ( P less than 0.05). The levels of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD3 + , and CD4 +/ CD8 + in the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the non-dementia group ( P less than 0.05). The levels of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD3 + , and CD4 +/ CD8 + in PD patients treated with L-DOPA were higher than those of PD patients without L-DOPA treatment ( P less than 0.05). In conclusion , the immune function of T cells in patients suffering from PD is low , and the immune function of T cells in patients with severe disease is lower. Therefore , it is of certain significance to further study the pathophysiological mechanism of PD.
