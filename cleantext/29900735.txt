  In field applications , mostly in porous media , transport of stabilized nano zerovalent iron particles ( nZVI) has never exceeded a few meters in range. In the present study , the transport of Carbo-Iron Colloids ( CIC) , a composite material of activated carbon as a carrier for nZVI stabilized by carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC) , was tested under field conditions. The field site lies within a fractured chalk aquitard characterized by moderately saline ( ∼ 13 mS) groundwater. A forced gradient tracer test was conducted where one borehole was pumped at a rate of 8 L/min and CMC-stabilized CIC was introduced at an injection borehole 47 m up-gradient. Two CIC-CMC field applications were conducted: one used high 100 % wt CMC ( 40 g/L) and a second used lower 9 % wt loading ( ∼ 2.7 g/L). Iodide was injected as a conservative tracer with the CIC-CMC in both cases. The ratio between the CIC-CMC and iodide recovery was 76 % and 45 % in the high and low CMC loading experiments , respectively. During the low CMC loading experiment , the pumping rate was increased , leading to an additional CIC recovery of 2.5 %. The results demonstrate the potentially high mobility of nZVI in fractured environments and the possibility for transport manipulation through the adjustment of stabilizer concentration and transport velocity.
