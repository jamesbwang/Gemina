  Golden shell color and mineral content are important economic traits of Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas). In this study , we mapped a series of quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) that control zinc ( Zn) and magnesium ( Mg) content , shell color and growth performance to two sex-averaged linkage maps from the FAM-A and FAM-B families. In total , ten QTLs were identified in seven linkage groups ( LGs) in the FAM-B family , and seven QTLs were identified in four linkage groups in the FAM-A family. Two QTLs affecting the trait of golden shell color were identified in LG8 of the FAM-A and LG10 of the FAM-B families , which could explain 20.2 and 10.5 % of the phenotypic variations , respectively. Two QTLs for Zn content were identified that could contribute to 17.9 and 34.44 % of the phenotypic variations in FAM-A. Six QTLs for Zn and Mg contents were identified in four LGs ( LG1 , LG2 , LG5 , and LG9) in FAM-B , which explained 13.5-26.7 % of the phenotypic variations. In addition , seven QTLs related to oyster growth were recognized in both FAM-A and FAM-B families accounting for 14.6-36.7 % of the phenotypic variations. All of the DNA markers in QTL regions were blasted and 14 genes associated with above traits were identified. The mRNA expression of these genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. These QTLs and candidate genes could be used as potential targets for marker-assisted selection in C. gigas breeding.
