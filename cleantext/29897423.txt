  The leaves of the aromatic neotropical shrub Hedyosmum brasiliense are employed popularly as a sedative , aphrodisiac and as a substitute for green tea. Sesquiterpene lactones and phenolic compounds were characterized as the main compounds of its aqueous extract , and some biological investigation demonstrated its anxiolytic , antidepressant and hypnotic effects. The quantification of podoandin , onoseriolide and rosmarinic acid in its infused tea was achieved by means of ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a electronspray ionization interface and a high resolution mass detector. Quantification of the analytes was performed employing the areas of the extracted ion chromatograms of the analytes , negative ion mode for rosmarinic acid ( 1) and positive mode for podoandin ( 2) and onoseriolide ( 3). The method was validated by evaluating specificity , linearity , precision and accuracy and has been found to be sensitive , precise and accurate. When applied to analyze the hot water infusion extract of H. brasiliense , compounds 1 , 2 and 3 were obtained to be 188 ± 1.45 mg/g , 1.9 ± 0.15 mg/g and 1.7 ± 0.02 mg/g of extract , respectively. The H. brasiliense tea was found to be a good source of the rosmarinic acid , also widely employed in the cosmetic industry.
