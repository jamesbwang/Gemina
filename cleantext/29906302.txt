  Probes for monitoring aggregation of amyloid beta ( Aβ) peptides are crucial to advance understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD). Here , we report luminescent tricarbonyl rhenium complexes of tetraarylethylene ( TAE) ligands featuring bis ( benzothiazole) chelating groups in combination with ( oligo) thiophene units that have been designed for monitoring amyloid fibrillation. Variation in the number of thiophenes influenced the photophysical properties of these complexes , as well as their binding affinities toward Aβ
