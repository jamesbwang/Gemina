  Esophageal diverticulum is a rare entity with symptoms that include dysphagia<symptom> , halitosis , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , and regurgitation. Indications for surgery include the presence of any of these symptoms and a diverticulum larger than 3 cm because of the increased risk of malignancy and aspiration. Treatment is open or minimally invasive surgery performed from the transhiatal or transthoracic approach. Three patients were investigated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy , esophageal manometry , and computed tomography and were given the diagnosis of epiphrenic diverticulum of the esophagus. The patients underwent robot-assisted surgery by a transthoracic approach for esophageal diverticulectomy. The mean operative time was 211 min , with no significant blood<symptom> loss<symptom> or intraoperative complications. This report of robot-assisted surgery for esophageal diverticulectomy from a transthoracic approach adds to the literature regarding surgical treatment of epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum. It is a feasible method that can be used in selected patients with esophageal diverticulum.
