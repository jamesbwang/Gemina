  The study aimed to assess whether the Modified Shuttle Walk Test ( MSWT) can detect changes in cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF) in overweight/obese people with hypertension ( HTN) after an exercise intervention evaluating the equation presented in the previous research by Jurio-Iriarte et al.. Participants ( N = 248) performed a peak cardiorespiratory exercise test ( CPET) and MSWT before and after 16-weeks of different types of aerobic exercise intervention. The formula of Jurio-Iriarte et al. was used to predict peak oxygen uptake ( V̇O AC: Attention Control; BM: Body Mass; BP: Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom>; CI: Confidence Interval; CRF: Cardiorespiratory Fitness; CPET: Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test; HTN: Primary Hypertension; HR: Heart Rate; HV-HIIT: High-Volume and High-Intensity Interval Training; ICC: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient; LV-HIIT: Low-Volume and High-Intensity Interval Training; MICT: Moderate-intensity continuous training; MSWT: Modified Shuttle Walk Test; SD: Standard Deviation; SEE: Standard Error of Estimate; V̇O
