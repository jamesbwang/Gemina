  Demands for solving complex kinship scenarios where only distant relatives are available for testing have risen in the past years. In these instances , other genetic markers such as X-chromosome short tandem repeat ( X-STR) markers are employed to supplement autosomal and Y-chromosomal STR DNA typing. However , prior to use , the degree of STR polymorphism in the population requires evaluation through generation of an allele or haplotype frequency population database. This population database is also used for statistical evaluation of DNA typing results. Here , we report X-STR data from 143 unrelated Filipino male individuals who were genotyped via conventional polymerase chain reaction-capillary electrophoresis ( PCR-CE) using the 12 X-STR loci included in the Investigator
