  Individuals with cerebral palsy ( CP) exhibit neuromuscular complications and low physical activity levels. Adults with CP exhibit a high prevalence of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , which is associated with musculoskeletal deficits. Children with CP have poor musculoskeletal accretion accompanied by excess bone<disease> marrow fat , which may lead to weaker bones. Mechanistic studies to determine the role of bone<disease> marrow fat on skeletal growth and maintenance , and how it relates to systemic energy metabolism among individuals with CP , are lacking. In this review , we highlight the skeletal status in children with CP and analyze the existing literature on the interactions among bone<disease> marrow fat , skeletal health , and cardiometabolic disease risk in the general population. Clinically vital questions are proposed , including: ( 1) Is the bone<disease> marrow fat in children with CP metabolically distinct from typically developing children in terms of its lipid and inflammatory composition? ( 2) Does the bone<disease> marrow fat suppress skeletal acquisition? ( 3) Or , does it accelerate chronic<disease> disease<disease> development in children with CP? ( 4) If so , what are the mechanisms? In conclusion , while inadequate mechanical loading may initiate poor skeletal development , subsequent expansion of bone<disease> marrow fat may further impede skeletal acquisition and increase cardiometabolic disease risk in those with CP.
