  Remediation and management of dumpsites is a worldwide problem that must be addressed to protect human health and the environment. Aragon Government long-term objective is the control of air quality related to landfills used to dump organochlorine waste. The present study evaluated the influence of dismantling works performed in Bailín landfill , an hexachlorocyclohexane ( 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexaclorohexane; HCH) dumpsite located in the city of Sabiñánigo , Spain. A total of 65,000 t of HCH solid waste and 342,000 t of polluted soil were transferred to a new cell with additional isolating measures going beyond the Spanish legal requirements. To evaluate influence of excavation of the old cell , transfer of waste and the state once the works in Bailín area had finished , levels of α- , β- , γ- , δ- and ɛ- HCH isomers were analyzed in 112 air samples obtained from summer 2014 to autumn 2016 by using passive air samplers. Results showed that: i) the existence of the old landfill and/or the works performed during its dismantling were a source of HCH air contamination , ii) old landfill represented an HCH source even after dismantling work was completed , iii) other sources , tentatively associated to Sardas dumpsite and HCH production site ( INQUINOSA Factory) were identified in the surroundings , where management should be addressed. Data comparison reflected a heavier contamination caused by the production , storage , and waste disposal than the corresponding to application of lindane and/or technical HCH in Spain. Meteorological dependence ( temperature , solar radiation and relative humidity) , α-/ γ-HCH ratios and isomer profiles of HCH air concentrations were evaluated for temporal trends and geographic distribution.
