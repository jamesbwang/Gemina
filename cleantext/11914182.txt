  The relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer is still controversial. The present meta-analysis examines the effects of the 25 ( OH) D , 1,25 ( OH) 2D and vitamin D intake on breast cancer risk. For this purpose , a PubMed , Scopus and Web of Science-databases search was conducted including all papers published with the keywords `` breast cancer '' and `` vitamin D '' with at least one reported relative risk ( RR) or odds ratio ( OR). In total sixty eight studies published between 1998 and 2018 were analyzed. Information about type of study , hormonal receptors and menopausal status was retrieved. Pooled OR or RR were estimated by weighting individual OR/RR by the inverse of their variance Our study showed a protective effect between 25 ( OH) D and breast cancer in both cohort studies ( RR = 0.85 , 95 % CI: 0.74-0.98) and case-control studies ( OR = 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.56-0.76). However , analyzing by menopausal status , the protective vitamin D- breast cancer association persisted only in the premenopausal group ( OR = 0.67 , 95 % CI: 0.49-0.92) when restricting the analysis to nested case-control studies. No significant association was found for vitamin D intake or 1,25 ( OH) 2D. This systematic review suggests a protective relationship between circulating vitamin D ( measured as 25 ( OH) D and breast cancer development in premenopausal women.
