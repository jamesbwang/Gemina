  Heavy alcohol drinking is associated with pancreatitis<disease> , whereas moderate intake lowers the risk. Mice fed ethanol long term show no pancreas damage unless adaptive/protective responses mediating proteostasis are disrupted. Pancreatic acini synthesize digestive enzymes ( largely serine hydrolases) in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) , where perturbations ( eg , alcohol consumption) activate adaptive unfolded protein responses orchestrated by spliced X-box binding protein 1 ( XBP1). Here , we examined ethanol-induced early structural changes in pancreatic ER proteins. Wild-type and Ethanol feeding and Results documented in ethanol-fed mice lacking sufficient spliced XBP1 illustrate consequences of ER stress extended by preventing unfolded protein response from fully restoring pancreatic acinar cell proteostasis during ethanol-induced redox challenge. In this model , orderly protein folding and transport to the secretory pathway were disrupted , and abundant molecules including Cel with perturbed structures were retained in ER , promoting ER stress-related pancreas pathology.
