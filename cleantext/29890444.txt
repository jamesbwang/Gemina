  Avian coccidiosis leads to severe economic losses for the global poultry industry. Apical membrane antigen 1 ( AMA1) of E. tenella ( EtAMA1) plays a vital role during invasion of parasites into host cells. In the present study , recombinant live Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> expressing cytoplasmic , secreted and cell wall-anchored EtAMA1 protein were respectively constructed. The three live bacteria were respectively administered orally to SPF chickens ( 100 μl bacteria containing 5 × 10
