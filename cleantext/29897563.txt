  Between May and June 2015 , 512 bats , six rodents , and six tree-shrews were examined for ectoparasites in Vientiane and Khammouane Provinces , Laos. Thirty-seven ticks ( 33 females and four males) identified as Ixodes<pathogen> granulatus Supino were collected from four individuals of the Northern tree-shrew , Tupaia<pathogen> belangeri ( Wagner) ( Scandentia: Tupaiidae) , and one female of Ixodes vespertilionis Koch was collected from one individual of the Intermediate Leaf-nosed Bat , Hipposideros larvatus ( Horsfield) ( Chiroptera: Hipposideridae). This appears to be the first record of I. vespertilionis from Laos , as well as the first record of this host-parasite relationship in the Southeast Asia region.
