  Diabetes distress among patients from ethnic minorities is still poorly understood. We investigated the association between ethnicity and diabetes distress among ethnic minority groups of people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands , focusing on the possible effects of glycemic control , lifestyle factors , cardiovascular risk factors , and diabetes complications. Cross-sectional data from the Dutch Diabetes Pearl cohort included people with type 2 diabetes from primary , secondary , and tertiary diabetes care programs. We used the 20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes scale to assess diabetes distress; a score â‰¥ 40 is considered to represent high distress. Ethnicity was estimated on the basis of country of birth. Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were self-reported; cardiovascular and metabolic data were retrieved from medical charts. Logistic regression analysis determined the association between ethnicity and diabetes distress , with Caucasians as the reference group. Diabetes distress scores and ethnicity were available for 4,191 people with type 2 diabetes: 3,684 were Caucasian , 83 were Asian , 51 were Moroccan , 92 were African , 134 were Latin American , 46 were Turkish , and 101 were Hindustani-Surinamese. Overall , participants in minority groups had worse health outcomes than those of Caucasian descent , and diabetes distress was more prevalent ( ranging from 9.6 to 31.7 % , compared with 5.8 % among Caucasians) , even after adjusting for age , sex , education level , alcohol use , smoking , BMI , lipid profile , HbA Among people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands , ethnicity is independently associated with high diabetes distress. Further research is warranted to explain the higher prevalence of diabetes distress in minority groups and to develop effective interventions.
