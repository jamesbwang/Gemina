  During insect larval-pupal metamorphosis , the obsolete larval organs and tissues undergo histolysis and programmed cell death ( PCD) to recycle cellular materials. It has been demonstrated that some cathepsins are essential for histolysis in larval tissues , but the process of tissue destruction is not well documented. Fat body , the homologous organ<symptom> to mammalian liver and adipose tissue , goes through a distinct destruction process during larval-pupal transition. Herein , we found that the Bombyx proteases , including BmCatB , BmCatD , BmCatLL-1 , BmCatLL-2 , BmBcp , BmMmp , BmAdamTS-1 , BmAdamTS L and Bmbcpi , most of them expressed highly in fat body during feeding and metamorphosis , and occurred peak during nonfeeding molting or prepupal stage , as well as were 20E-responsive. Injection of 20E into the feeding larvae upregulated while blocking 20E signaling transduction downregulated above protease genes expression. Therein , western blotting and immunofluorescent staining of BmCatB and BmBcp confirmed the coincident variation of their mRNA and protein level during the development and after the treatments. Moreover , BmCatB , BmBcp , BmMmp and BmAdamTS-1 RNAi all led to blockage of larval fat body destruction. Taken together , we conclude that 20E regulates larval fat body destruction by upregulating related protease gene expression and protein levels during larval-pupal transition.
