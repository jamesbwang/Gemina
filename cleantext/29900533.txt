  Gene-by-environment interactions between maternal sensitivity during infancy and child oxytocin receptor gene ( OXTR rs53576) and D2 dopamine receptor gene ( DRD2 TaqIA , rs1822497) genotypes were explored as predictors of toddlers ' well-regulated behavioral and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to maternal compliance demands. Maternal sensitivity was assessed across a range of mother-child interactions when children were 6 months and 1 year of age ( N = 186) , and toddler self-regulatory responses were assessed through compliance and vagal withdrawal during a toy clean-up task when children were 2 years of age. Sensitivity-by-OXTR interactions suggested two diathesis-stress patterns , predicting compliance for the GG genotype group , and predicting physiological regulation for the AA/AG genotype group. A main effect for DRD2 genotype indicated that children with an A1 allele displayed less-compliant behavior in toddlerhood. These results suggest that genetic differences may contribute to variation both in risk for self-regulatory difficulties , and in relations between maternal sensitivity and children 's responses to compliance demands at different levels of analysis.
