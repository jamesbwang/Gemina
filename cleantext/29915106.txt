  The oxidation of Fe ( II) by anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria was likely a key contributor to Earth 's biosphere prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and is still found in a diverse range of modern environments. All known phototrophic Fe ( II)- oxidizers can utilize a wide range of substrates thus making them very metabolically flexible. However , the underlying adaptations required to oxidize Fe ( II) , a potential stressor , are not completely understood. We used a combination of quantitative proteomics and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy ( cryo-TEM) to compare cells of
