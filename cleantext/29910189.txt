  Ergothioneine ( EGT) is a sulfur-containing , anti-oxidative amino acid derived from histidine. EGT is synthesized in bacteria and fungi<pathogen> but not in animals and plants , and is now recognized as important for human health. Its cost-effective fermentative production has not been elucidated due to the lack of information for productive microorganisms. In this study , we doubled the gene copy for EGT synthesis and deleted the histidine ammonia-lyase gene in a potent EGT-producing methylotrophic bacterium<pathogen> Methylobacterium<pathogen> aquaticum strain 22A , and optimized its culture conditions , resulting in increased EGT production of 7.0 mg EGT/g dry cell weight and 100 μg EGT/5 mL/7 days. In addition , through screening we found EGT-producing eukaryotic strains of Aureobasidium<pathogen> pullulans<pathogen> and Rhodotorula<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> , which can produce 1.0 and 3.2 mg EGT/g dry cell weight , 70 and 120 μg EGT/5 mL/7 days , respectively. This study proposes practical uses of potent EGT-producing recombinant Methylobacterium<pathogen> species and non-recombinant yeast and fungal strains.
