  Synthetic phenolic antioxidants ( SPAs) have gained high concerns due to their extensive usages and unintended environmental release via various routes. Their contamination in water system could pose potential threat to aquatic organisms , therefore , the studies on the aquatic toxicology of this kind of chemicals are of high importance. In this research , the developmental toxicities of four commonly used SPAs , including butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA) , butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT) , tert-butyl hydroquinone ( TBHQ) , and 2,2 '- methylenebis ( 6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) ( AO2246) were investigated using the zebrafish embryo toxicity test ( ZFET). The results showed that these four SPAs exerted different acute toxicities to zebrafish , and the toxic order , based on their 96 h LC
