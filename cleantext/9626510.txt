  Planarians have gained a well-deserved reputation as an excellent model organism for research on the biology of adult stem cells and their role in regeneration. Though less widely recognized , these animals also offer many advantages for investigating mechanisms and functions of programmed cell death in self-renewing tissues. Apoptosis complements stem cell division during physiological cell turnover and constitutes a prominent feature of the tissue remodeling process that restores anatomical scale and proportion during regeneration. One technical advantage to studying apoptosis in planarians is the availability of a whole-mount TUNEL assay for visualizing dying cells throughout the animal. Here , we provide a detailed protocol for this assay that is likely to benefit researchers investigating planarian cell death in either physiological or pathological contexts.
