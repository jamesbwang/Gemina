  Physical inactivity alters glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle , potentially developing into overt metabolic disease. The present study sought to investigate the role of skeletal muscle capillarization in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity ( IS) using a classic human model of physical inactivity. Thirteen healthy males ( age = 23 ± 2 yr) underwent 4 days of full-time supervised and diet-controlled bed rest. Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) , indices of insulin sensitivity ( IS) ( quantitative IS check index ( QUICKI) , Matsuda index) as well as skeletal muscle biopsies with measurement of fiber type distribution , fiber cross-sectional area ( FCSA) , capillary-to-fiber ratio ( C/F ratio) and capillary density ( CD) were assessed prior to and after bed rest. Body<symptom> weight and composition were unaltered by bed rest. Fasting glucose/insulin ratio ( G0/I0 ratio) ( -25 % , P = 0.016) , QUICKI ( -7 % , P = 0.023) and Matsuda index ( -24 % , P = 0.003) diminished with bed rest. Skeletal muscle FCSA decreased ( -737.4 ± 763.2 µm-2 ( -12 %) , P = 0.005) while C/F ratio was preserved , resulting in augmented CD ( +93.9 ± 91.5 capillaries • mm-2 ( +37 %) , P = 0.003) with bed rest. No association was detected between changes in skeletal muscle variables and metabolic outcomes. Independently of bed rest-induced effects , a positive linear relationship was detected between C/F ratio and G0/I0 ratio ( β = 17.09 , P = 0.021). In conclusion , impaired glucose homeostasis with bed rest is not prevented nor associated with enhanced skeletal muscle capillarization in healthy individuals.
