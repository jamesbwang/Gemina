  We demonstrated a novel nanocomposite based on fluorescent turn-on gold nanostars for simultaneous tumor targeting photothermal therapy ( PTT) and feedback apoptosis imaging of the self-therapeutic effect. In this theranostic agent ( AuNS@probe) , gold nanostars ( AuNSs) and fluorescent dye Atto 655 , as a fluorophore/quencher pair , were conjugated to form intermolecular fluorescence quenching in virtue of the linkage of a caspase-3 responsive peptide. Folic acid targeting moiety facilitated the selective accumulation in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon photo irradiation , AuNS@probe demonstrated excellent photothermal effect and induced cell death with apoptosis related mechanism. The typical apoptosis-effector proteases , caspase-3 , was subsequently activated and terminated intramolecular fluorescent quenching process. Obvious fluorescence recovery could be applied to precisely assess the activated caspase-3 expression and the real time therapeutic efficacy. This novel versatile nanocomposite could serve as a theranostic agent for tumor targeting PTT and also provide self-therapeutic monitoring for precise cancer therapeutic applications.
