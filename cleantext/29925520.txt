  The aim of this study was to investigate the association of fluid overload , measured by bioelectrical impedance vector analysis ( BIVA) and also by accumulated fluid balance<symptom> , with 30-day mortality rates in patients admitted to the emergency department ( ED). We conducted a prospective observational study of fluid overload using BIVA , taking measures using a multiple-frequency whole-body tetrapolar equipment. Accumulated fluid balances<symptom> were obtained at 24 , 48 and 72 hours from ED admission and its association with 30-day mortality. 109 patients admitted to the ED classified as fluid overloaded by both methods. According to BIVA , 71.6 % ( n = 78) of patients had fluid overload on ED admission. These patients were older and had higher Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment scores. During a median follow-up period of 30 days , 32.1 % ( n = 25) of patients with fluid overload evaluated by BIVA died versus none with normovolaemia ( p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between patients with and without fluid overload as assessed by accumulated fluid balance<symptom> ( p = 0.81). Fluid overload on admission evaluated by BIVA was significantly related to mortality in patients admitted to the ED.
