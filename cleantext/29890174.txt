  Reading is slow and difficult for people with central vision loss<symptom> who must rely on their peripheral<symptom> vision<symptom>. It has been shown that practicing on a letter-recognition task can increase peripheral reading speed , and that the training-related improvement is attributable mainly to reduced crowding. Since there is a high degree of variability in the vision conditions across people with central vision loss<symptom> , a one-size-fits-all training protocol may not be adequate or appropriate for these patients. In this study , we target two aspects of training-training task and individual customization , and propose a training paradigm that focuses on reducing crowding and tailors training for each individual using an adaptive method. Seven normally-sighted adults were trained with four daily sessions of identifying crowded letters presented at various positions 10 Â° below fixation in a pre/post design. During the training , a dynamic cue ( jitter motion) was applied to target letters to modulate crowding. Amplitude of motion was varied on a block by block basis according to individual performance to maintain task difficulty near a pre-defined level ( 80 % accuracy in letter recognition). We found that motion amplitude gradually reduced as training progressed , indicating a reduction in crowding. Following training , reading speed ( measured using RSVP method) showed a significant improvement in both the trained ( 49 %) and untrained ( 50 %) visual fields. Despite showing similar improvement as observed in the previous training studies , our adaptive training method demands less effort and , most importantly , offers customization for each individual trainee.
