  The Kohnstamm phenomenon is a prolonged involuntary aftercontraction following a sustained voluntary isometric muscle contraction. The control principles of the Kohnstamm have been investigated using mechanical perturbations , but previous studies could not dissociate sensorimotor responses to perturbation from effects of gravity. We induced a horizontal , gravity-independent Kohnstamm movement around the shoulder joint , and applied resistive or assistive torques of 0.5 Nm after 20 Â° angular displacement. A No perturbation control condition was included. Further , participants made velocity-matched
