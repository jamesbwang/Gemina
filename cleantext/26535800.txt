  Resistive switching random access memories ( ReRAM) are promising candidates for energy efficient , fast , and non-volatile universal memories that unite the advantages of RAM and hard drives. Unfortunately , the current ReRAM materials are incompatible with optical interconnects and wires. Optical signal transmission is , however , inevitable for next generation memories in order to overcome the capacity-bandwidth trade-off. Thus , we present here a proof-of-concept of a new type of resistive switching realized in III-V semiconductors , which meet all requirements for the implementation of optoelectronic circuits. This resistive switching effect is based on controlling the spatial positions of vacancy-induced deep traps by stimulated migration , opening and closing a conduction channel through a semi-insulating compensated surface layer. The mechanism is widely applicable to opto-electronically usable III-V compound semiconductors.
