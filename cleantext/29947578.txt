  Evidence has consistently shown that low/limited health literacy ( HL) is associated with negative health consequences and higher costs for individuals and society. To generate internal data for employee training and health/wellness programming , an HL assessment of 120 university employees was conducted using the Newest Vital Sign ( NVS) , a valid and reliable clinical screening tool that asks individuals to interpret a nutrition label. Sociodemographic data were collected and time to administer the NVS tool was also measured. Even in this employed , well-educated sample ( mean years of formal education was 16.6 years) , 17 % had scores indicating limited or possibly limited HL. Findings have implications for occupational training and health providers and programs. Even a well-educated workforce benefits from addressing HL challenges or situational issues with universal strategies. This project supports initiatives to assist employees better navigate , understand , and use health information and services to improve their health.
