  Regeneration as a therapeutic priniciple and regenerative medicine in general are promising new strategies to add new therapeutic dimensions to our current treatment options. Today , reconstructive surgery , drugs and implants such as the cochlear implant can replace the functions of damaged tissues. In contrast , regenerative therapies aim at the replacement of the damaged tissues themselves while at the same time replacing their lost tissue function. In this review article new technologies such as 3D-bioprinting and the application of decellularised tissues as biomaterials are introduced and explained. A summary of current preclinical and clinical regenerative studies in otorhinolaryngology is complementing these basic aspects.
