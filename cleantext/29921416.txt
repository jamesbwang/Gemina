  The nucleus accumbens ( NAc) is a brain region implicated in pathological motivated behaviors such as drug addiction and is composed predominantly of two discrete populations of neurons , dopamine receptor-1- and dopamine receptor-2-expressing medium spiny neurons ( D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs , respectively). It is unclear whether these populations receive inputs from different brain areas and whether input regions to these cell types undergo distinct structural adaptations in response to the administration of addictive drugs such as cocaine. Using a modified rabies<pathogen> virus-mediated tracing method , we created a comprehensive brain-wide monosynaptic input map to NAc D1- and D2-MSNs. Next , we analyzed nearly 2000 dendrites and 125,000 spines of neurons across four input regions ( the prelimbic cortex , medial orbitofrontal cortex , basolateral amygdala , and ventral hippocampus) at four separate time points during cocaine administration and withdrawal to examine changes in spine density in response to repeated intraperitoneal cocaine injection in mice. D1- and D2-MSNs display overall similar input profiles , with the exception that D1-MSNs receive significantly more input from the medial orbitofrontal cortex. We found that neurons in distinct brain areas projecting to D1- and D2-MSNs display different adaptations in dendritic spine density at different stages of cocaine administration and withdrawal. While NAc D1- and D2-MSNs receive input from similar brain structures , cocaine-induced spine density changes in input regions are quite distinct and dynamic. While previous studies have focused on input-specific postsynaptic changes within NAc MSNs in response to cocaine , these findings emphasize the dramatic changes that occur in the afferent input regions as well.
