  The objective of this study is to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo osteogenic potential of rat bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BM-MSCs) using chitosan/hydroxyapatite ( C/HAp) microbeads as encapsulation matrix under osteoinductive medium and dynamic culture conditions. The degradation characteristics of C/HAp microbeads were evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions for 180 days. BM-MSCs were encapsulated in C/HAp microbeads with > 85 % viability , and were cultured in a slow turning lateral vessel-type rotating bioreactor simulating microgravity conditions for 28 days , under the effect of osteogenic inducers. MTT assay showed that the metabolic activity of encapsulated cells was preserved > 80 % after a week. In vitro experiments confirmed that the encapsulated BM-MSCs differentiated into osteoblastic cells , formed bone-like tissue under osteogenic microgravity bioreactor conditions. Preliminary in vivo study indicated C/HAp microbeads containing BM-MSCs were able to repair the surgically-created small bone defects in the rat femur. BM-MSCs-C/HAp composite microbeads may have potential for modular bone regeneration.
