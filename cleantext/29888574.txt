  We have demonstrated that needle knife ( acupotomy) treatment can improve knee osteoarthritis ( KOA) in rabbits. The present study was designed to examine its effect on expression of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase ( p-FAK) , phosphinositides 3 kinase ( p-PI 3 K) and Aggrecan genes and proteins in the knee-joint cartilage tissues of KOA rabbits , so as to explore its partial molecular mechanism underlying improvement of KOA. Forty-nine New Zealand male rabbits were randomly divided into normal control , model , model + inhibitor , needle knife , needle knife + inhibitor , electroacupuncture ( EA) , EA + inhibitor groups ( After modeling , the expression levels of p-FAK and p-PI 3 K genes and proteins were significantly up-regulated ( Needle knife intervention can up-regulate the expression levels of p-FAK , p-PI 3 K and Aggrecan proteins and mRNAs in the cartilage tissue of the knee-joint in KOA rabbits , suggesting an involvement of FAK-PI 3 K signaling in the needle knife-induced improvement of KOA.
