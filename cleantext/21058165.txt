  This study investigated the effect of a 12-week modified German Volume Training intervention , or the 10 sets method , on muscle strength and hypertrophy. Twelve healthy males were randomly assigned to either a 5-SET or 10-SET group and performed 5 or 10 sets , respectively , of 10 repetitions at 60 ‚Åª 80 % one-repetition maximum ( 1RM). Muscle strength and body composition measures were taken at baseline , six weeks , and after 12 weeks of training. No significant changes in total , trunk , and arm lean mass were found within and between groups at any time point. There was no significant difference between groups for lean leg mass. However , a decrease in lean leg mass was observed within the 10-SET group between six and 12 weeks (
