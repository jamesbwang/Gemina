  During HIV-1 assembly , the retroviral structural protein Gag forms an immature capsid , containing thousands of Gag molecules , at the plasma membrane ( PM). Interactions between Gag nucleocapsid ( NC) and viral RNA ( vRNA) are thought to drive assembly , but the exact roles of these interactions have remained poorly understood. Since previous studies have shown that Gag dimer- or trimer-forming mutants ( Gag
