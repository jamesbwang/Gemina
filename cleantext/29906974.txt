  A model of three-disk micromachine swimming in a quasi-two-dimensional supported membrane is proposed. We calculate the average swimming velocity as a function of the disk size and the arm length. Due to the presence of the hydrodynamic screening length in the quasi-two-dimensional fluid , the geometric factor appearing in the average velocity exhibits three different asymptotic behaviors depending on the microswimmer size and the hydrodynamic screening length. This is in sharp contrast with a microswimmer in a three-dimensional bulk fluid that shows only a single scaling behavior. We also find that the maximum velocity is obtained when the disks are equal-sized , whereas it is minimized when the average arm lengths are identical. The intrinsic drag of the disks on the substrate does not alter the scaling behaviors of the geometric factor.
