  The recent Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) epidemic swept across Latin America and the Caribbean , where dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) is endemic. The antigenic similarities of these closely related flaviviruses left researchers and clinicians with challenges to interpret serological tests. Thirty-six women attending a prenatal clinic in Honduras and with positive DENV<pathogen> IgM enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays ( ELISAs) were screened with a ZIKV IgM ELISA , RT-PCR for ZIKV and DENV<pathogen> 1-4 , and plaque reduction neutralization tests ( PRNTs) for ZIKV and DENV-2. Plaque reduction neutralization test results were interpreted using the World Health Organization ( WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) criteria. Using the WHO criteria of a PRNT90 titer â‰¥ 20 and a 4-fold difference between ZIKV and DENV<pathogen> titers , we determined that 69.4 % of samples had a recent ZIKV infection , compared with 5.6 % using CDC criteria. The interpretation of ZIKV PRNTs in a DENV-endemic region is highly dependent on the choice of interpretation criteria.
