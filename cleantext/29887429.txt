  Maintenance of sinus rhythm has been associated with lower mortality , but whether atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) ablation per se benefits hard outcomes such as mortality and stroke is still debated. To determine whether AF ablation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and stroke compared with medical therapy alone. Literature search looking for both randomized and observational studies comparing AF catheter ablation vs. medical management. Data pooled using random-effects. Risk ratios ( RR) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) used as a measure of treatment effect. The primary and secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and occurrence of cerebrovascular events during follow-up , respectively. Thirty studies were eligible for inclusion , comprising 78,966 patients ( 25,129 receiving AF ablation and 53,837 on medical treatment) and 233,990patient-years of follow-up. The pooled data of studies revealed that ablation was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality: 5.7 % vs. 17.9 %; RR = 0.44 , 95 % CI 0.32-0.62 , p < 0.001. In a sensitivity analysis by study design , a survival benefit of AF ablation was seen in randomized studies , with no heterogeneity ( mortality risk 4.2 % vs. 8.9 %; RR = 0.55 , 95 % CI 0.39-0.79 , p = 0.001 , I Ablation of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> associates with a survival benefit compared with medical treatment alone , although evidence is restricted to the setting of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and LV systolic dysfunction.
