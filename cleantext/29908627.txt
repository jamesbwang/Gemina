  Phalloplasty represents the most complete genitoperineal transformation. Because it requires complex , staged procedures as well as the use of tissue from remote sites , patients must be well informed as to the nature of surgery. Surgical techniques for phalloplasty continue to evolve. Although many surgeons prefer the radial forearm free flap technique , a visible flap donor site makes this procedure less desirable for some patients. Other surgical options are available and include the anterolateral thigh flap , sometimes in conjunction with secondary flaps , and the musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap.
