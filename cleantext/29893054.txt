  Stem cell surface markers may facilitate a better understanding of stem cell biology through molecular function studies or serve as tools to monitor the differentiation status and behavior of stem cells in culture or tissue. Thus , it is important to identify additional novel stem cell markers. We used glycoproteomics to discover surface glycoproteins on human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs) that may be useful stem cell markers. We found that a surface glycoprotein , leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 1 ( LRRN1) , is expressed abundantly on the surface of hESCs before differentiation into embryoid bodies ( EBs). Silencing of LRRN1 with short hairpin RNA ( shLRRN1) in hESCs resulted in decreased capacity of self-renewal , and skewed differentiation toward endoderm/mesoderm lineages in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile , the protein expression levels of the pluripotency factors OCT4 , NANOG , and SOX2 were reduced. Interestingly , the mRNA levels of these pluripotency factors were not affected in LRRN1 silenced cells , but protein half-lives were substantially shortened. Furthermore , we found LRRN1 silencing led to nuclear export and proteasomal degradation of all three pluripotency factors. In addition , the effects on nuclear export were mediated by AKT phosphorylation. These results suggest that LRRN1 plays an important role in maintaining the protein stability of pluripotency factors through AKT phosphorylation , thus maintaining hESC self-renewal capacity and pluripotency. Overall , we found that LRRN1 contributes to pluripotency of hESC by preventing translocation of OCT4 , NANOG , and SOX2 from nucleus to cytoplasm , thereby lessening their post-translational modification and degradation.
