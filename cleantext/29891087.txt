  This paper presents a study on electro-hydraulic servo system for the purpose of position control using a compatible linear model. The system has high level of nonlinearity and linearization introduces extra error in system model. In order to reduce this error several methods of linearization uncertainty are discussed. In spite of applying Taylor 's series for all methods , several procedures are used for considering uncertainty on linearization constants. In the first procedure , a simple bound is considered for each linearization constant. In the second procedure , a polytope is extracted for the uncertainty by a graphical method. Finally , a procedure with less conservativeness and less restriction is proposed. This procedure is used to extract the linear model of the electro-hydraulic servo system for the task of position control. The resulting model is used to synthesize an output-feedback H
