  A mixed methods study was conducted to examine the implementation process of 26 urban school-based mental health clinics that took part in a training and implementation support program for an evidence-based school trauma intervention. Implementation process was observed using the Stages of Implementation Completion ( SIC) measure. Qualitative interviews were conducted with clinic leaders in order to gain insight into clinic processes related to the SIC. Results showed that almost all of the clinics engaged in some activities related to pre-implementation ( engagement , feasibility , and readiness) , but only 31 % of the sites formally started delivering the program to youth. Completing more pre-implementation activities , particularly those related to readiness , predicted program start-up. Qualitative analysis comparing those that implemented the program to those that did not revealed critical differences in decision-making processes , leadership strategies , and the presence of local champions for the program. This study documented the patterns of clinic behavior that occurs as part of large-scale training efforts , suggests some unique challenges that occur in schools , and highlights the importance of engaging in particular implementation activities ( i.e. , readiness planning , stakeholder consensus and planning meetings) as part of program start-up. Findings indicate that pre-implementation and readiness-related consultation should be employed as part of broad-scale implementation and training efforts.
