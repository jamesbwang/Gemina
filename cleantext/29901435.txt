  With increasing participation of females in endurance athletics and active military service , it is important to determine if there are inherent sex-dependent susceptibilities to exertional heat injury or heat stroke. In this study we compared responses of male and female adult mice to exertional heat stroke ( EHS). All mice were instrumented for telemetry core temperature measurement and were exercise-trained for 3 weeks prior to EHS. During EHS , environmental temperature was 37.5 °C ( 35 % RH) while the mice ran on a forced running wheel , using incremental increases in speed. The symptom-limited end-point was loss of consciousness<symptom> , occurring at ~ 42.2 °C core temperature. Females ran greater distances ( 623 vs. 346 meters , P < 0.0001) , reached faster running speeds ( 7.2 vs. 5.1 m/min , P < 0.0001) , exercised for longer times ( 177 vs 124 min , P < 0.0001) , and were exposed to greater internal heat loads ( 240 vs. 160 °C • min; P < 0.0001). Minimum Tc during hypothermic recovery was ~ 32.0 °C in both sexes. Females lost 9.2 % body<symptom> weight vs. 7.5 % in males ( P < 0.001). Females demonstrated higher circulating corticosterone ( 286 vs 183 ng/ml , P = 0.001 , at 3 h) , but most plasma cytokines were not different. A component performance in females could be attributed to greater body surface area/mass and greater external power performance. However , there were significant and independent effects of sex alone and a crossed effect of ` sex x power ' on performance. These results demonstrate that female mice have greater resistance to EHS during exercise in hyperthermia<symptom> and that these effects can not be attributed solely to body size.
