  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel radioactive bare metal stent ( RBMS) compared with a conventional bare metal stent ( CBMS) in patients with inoperable malignant airway obstruction. This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee , and informed consent was obtained from each participant. Patients with malignant airway obstruction who had dyspnea<symptom> were randomly assigned to receive RBMS or CBMS placement. The primary endpoint was stenosis grade , while the secondary endpoints were technical success , overall survival , and complications. A p value of < 0 路 05 was considered statistically significant. Between September 2013 and July 2015 , 66 patients with inoperable malignant airway obstruction received stent placement fluoroscopically ( 33 in either group). The median follow-up time was 154 days ( range , 15-335 days). The baseline stenosis was immediately relieved in both groups after stent placement , and the stenosis grades in the RBMS group were significantly lower than that in the CBMS group since the second month ( p < 0 路 05). The technical success rates of stent placement were 100 % in both groups. The median survival in the RBMS group was significantly longer than that in the CBMS group ( 170 days vs. 123 days , p < 0 路 05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups ( p < 0 路 05). The placement of RBMS in patients with inoperable malignant airway obstruction is feasible and safe , and it significantly reduces restenosis and improves overall survival compared with the placement of CBMS.
