  Differences in outcomes between males and females with biliary tract cancer ( BTC) has been previously reported but not studied. This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing BTC resection in Ontario between 2002 and 2012. Descriptive statistics on patient , disease , and treatment-related factors in each BTC subtype were reported. Kaplan Meier Curves and Cox Proportional Hazards analysis were used to examine the univariate relationship between sex and overall survival. 714 patients underwent resection of a BTC. Kaplan Meier Curves shows trends towards different survival for males and females in different BTC subtypes: improved for females with intrahepatic and ampullary cancers and poorer survival for females with perhilar and distal cholangiocarcinomas. These trends were not statistically significant. Sex may be an important factor in overall survival following resection of BTC. Further work is needed to better characterize the relationship between sex and outcomes of BTC.
