  Urethral cancer is rare , with limited data guiding treatment. A national hospital-based registry was used to evaluate the role of local therapy in these patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with T0-4N0-2 M0 urethral cancer ( 2004-2013). Local therapy was: radiation ( RT) , surgery ( S) , or surgery and radiation ( S+RT). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the impact of therapy type on overall survival ( primary endpoint). Subgroup analysis by extent of disease ( early-stage: T0-2 N0 vs. locally advanced: T3 + or N +) and histology was performed. N = 2,614 patients had a median follow-up of 28 months. 3-year OS was 54 %. In 501 locally advanced patients , S+RT was associated with improved survival vs. S alone ( HR 0.58 , 95 % CI 0.42-0.80). There was no difference for squamous cell carcinoma patients by treatment type , but those with adenocarcinoma ( RT vs. S: HR 0.20 , 95 % CI 0.07-0.60; S+RT vs. S: HR 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.10-0.75) or transitional cell carcinoma ( S+RT vs. S: HR 0.45 , 95 % CI 0.26-0.77) had improved OS with RT as part of treatment. In 1,705 early-stage patients , there was no association with survival when comparing S+RT vs. S. For patients undergoing S with locally advanced disease and transitional cell carcinoma , the addition of RT is associated with improved OS and should be considered. An RT-based approach may be preferred for adenocarcinoma , but there was no clear association with survival by therapy type for squamous cell carcinoma. This study is hypothesis generating; prospective trials are necessary.
