  The presentation and clinical course of mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament ( MD-ACL) are poorly documented within the literature. Subsequently , it is under-diagnosed and the optimal management strategy remains ill-defined. Here , we characterize the syndrome<disease> associated with MD-ACL and compare the natural clinical course with the outcomes of arthroscopic management. Thirty-one patients with radiological features of MD-ACL over a 2-year period had their clinical notes retrospectively reviewed. Seven patients underwent arthroscopic debridement of the ACL for MD.. These were followed up for a minimum of 2 years and an average of 2.8 years from surgery. The remainder were managed conservatively (
