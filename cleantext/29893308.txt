  It has been proved that nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) is activated in all cells , promotes proliferation of cells , regulates the immunological and inflammatory response , and contribute to the pathogenesis of many conditions , including cancer. Many studies pointed to constitutive activation of NF-κB in cells of certain malignant tumors. The aim of the study was to analyze the role of nuclear growth factor κB as colon cancer marker and prognostic factor. The study included 59 primary colorectal tumor patients and 15 patients in control group. The tumor samples were taken during partial colectomy and colonoscopy in control group. Tissues samples were fixed and embedded in paraffin blocks and cut. Sections were used for schedule immunohistochemical staining with the application of specific antibody for NF-κB epitope. The marker expression was compared with well-known prognostic factors in colon tumors such as tumor type , stage , and grade to establish if it might be a potential prognostic factor. The results showed statistically significant difference between control group and cancer group. The expression NF-κB did not depend on the stage and grade of colon tumors.
