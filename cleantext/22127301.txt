  More than 10 million people worldwide incur a traumatic brain injury ( TBI) each year , with two million cases occurring in the United States. TBI survivors exhibit long-lasting cognitive and affective sequelae that are associated with reduced quality of life and work productivity , as well as mental and emotional disturbances. While TBI-related disabilities often manifest physically and conspicuously , TBI has been linked with a `` silent epidemic '' of psychological disorders , including major depressive disorder ( MDD). The prevalence of MDD post-insult is approximately 50 % within the 1st year. Furthermore , given they are often under-reported when mild , TBIs could be a significant overall cause of MDD in the United States. The emergence of MDD post-TBI may be rooted in widespread disturbances in the modulatory role of glutamate , such that glutamatergic signaling becomes excessive and deleterious to neuronal integrity , as reported in both clinical and preclinical studies. Following this acute glutamatergic storm , regulators of glutamatergic function undergo various manipulations , which include , but are not limited to , alterations in glutamatergic subunit composition , release , and reuptake. This review will characterize the glutamatergic functional and signaling changes that emerge and persist following experimental TBI , utilizing evidence from clinical , molecular , and rodent behavioral investigations. Special care will be taken to speculate on how these manipulations may correlate with the development of MDD following injury in the clinic , as well as pharmacotherapies to date. Indisputably , TBI is a significant healthcare issue that warrants discovery and subsequent refinement of therapeutic strategies to improve neurobehavioral recovery and mental health.
