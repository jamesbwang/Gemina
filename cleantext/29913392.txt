  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC) is a commonly performed minimally invasive procedure that has led to a decrease in procedure-related mortality and morbidity. However , LC requires analgesia that blocks both visceral and somatic nerve fibers. In this study , we evaluated the effectiveness of Erector Spinae Plane Block ( ESPB) for postoperative analgesia management in LC. Single-blinded , prospective , randomized , efficiency study. Tertiary university hospital , postoperative recovery room & ward. 36 patients ( ASA I-II) were recruited in two equal groups ( block and control group). Following exclusion , 30 patients were included in final analysis. Standard multimodal analgesia was performed in Group C ( control) while ESPB block was also performed in Group B ( block). Pain intensity between groups were compared using Numeric Rating Scores ( NRS). Also , tramadol consumption and additional rescue analgesic requirement were measured. NRS was lower in Group B during the first 3 h. There was no difference in NRS scores at other hours. Tramadol consumption was lower in Group B during the first 12 h. Less rescue analgesia was required in Group. Bilateral ultrasound guided ESPB leads to effective analgesia and a decrease in analgesia requirement in first 12 h in patients undergoing LC.
