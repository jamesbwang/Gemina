  Large-scale gold production ( LSGP) is one of the five convention-related atmospheric mercury ( Hg) emission sources in the Minamata Convention on Mercury. However , field experiments on Hg flows of the whole process of LSGP are limited. To identify the atmospheric Hg emission points and understand Hg emission characteristics of LSGP , Hg flows in two gold smelters were studied. Overall atmospheric Hg emissions accounted for 10 % -17 % of total Hg outputs and the Hg emission factors for all processes were 7.6-9.6 kg/ton. There were three dominant atmospheric Hg emission points in the studied gold smelters , including the exhaust gas of the roasting process , exhaust gas from the environmental fog collection stack and exhaust gas from the converter of the refining process. Atmospheric Hg emissions from the roasting process only accounted for 16 % -29 % of total emissions and the rest were emitted from the refining process. The overall Hg speciation profile ( gaseous elemental Hg/gaseous oxidized Hg/particulate-bound Hg) for LSGP was 34.1/ 57.1/ 8.8. The dominant Hg output byproducts included waste acid , sulfuric acid and cyanide leaching residue. Total Hg outputs from these three byproducts were 80 % in smelter A and 84 % in smelter B. Our study indicated that previous atmospheric Hg emissions from large-scale gold production might have been overestimated. Hg emission control in LSGP is not especially urgent in China compared to other significant emission sources ( e.g. , cement plants). Instead , LSGP is a potential Hg release source due to the high Hg output proportions to acid and sludge.
