  Ordering configurations of a director field on a curved membrane induces stress. In this work , we present a theoretical framework to calculate the stress tensor and the torque as a consequence of the nematic ordering; we use the variational principle and invariance of the energy under Euclidean motions. Euler-Lagrange equations of the membrane as well as the corresponding boundary conditions also appear as natural results. The stress tensor found includes attraction-repulsion forces between defects; likewise , defects are attracted to patches with the same sign in Gaussian curvature. These forces are mediated by the Green<symptom> function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the surface. In addition , we find nonisotropic forces that involve derivatives of the Green<symptom> function and the Gaussian curvature , even in the normal direction to the membrane. We examine the case of axial membranes<symptom> to analyze the spherical one. For spherical vesicles we find the modified Young-Laplace law as a consequence of the nematic texture. In the case of spherical cap with defect at the north pole , we find that the force is repulsive with respect to the north pole , indicating that it is an unstable equilibrium point.
