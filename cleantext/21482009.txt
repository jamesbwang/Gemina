  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia<pathogen> ( CPVT) is one of the leading causes of sudden arrhythmic death in the young. The QT interval in CPVT patients is typically within the normal range. However , those with prolonged QT interval have often been diagnosed with mutation-negative long QT syndrome<pathogen> ( LQTS). We report three CPVT patients with prolonged QT interval. Case 1 and 2 were diagnosed as LQTS at first. Genetic test using next-generation sequencing ( NGS) revealed
