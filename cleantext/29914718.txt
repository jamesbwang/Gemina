  Legalization of marijuana for medical and/or recreational use in some U.S. states has increased attention to substance use and related problems. However , little attention has been paid to these phenomena among adults in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF) whose adverse life experiences may put them at elevated risk of substance use disorders ( SUDs). Data from the 2003-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH) were used to test trends in past-month binge drinking and past-year marijuana , other illicit drug , and any illicit drug use and to examine SUD prevalence and treatment correlates among adults in TANF families. While rates of binge drinking and any illicit drug use remained steady , marijuana use increased from 15.8 % in 2003/2004 to 21.6 % in 2013/2014 , a 36.7 % increase. Increased marijuana use was strongly related to changes in marijuana risk perception. Among adults in TANF families , 19.5 % of men and 10.8 % of women had a past-year SUD , but only one in five received treatment. Those aged 18-25 , Black or Hispanic women , and those who had children at home when surveyed were less likely to have received treatment. Preventive efforts to address substance use , especially marijuana use , among adults in TANF families are needed. Moreover , given greater odds of unmet SUD treatment need among these economically disadvantaged adults , particularly racial/ethnic minority women and those who are in emerging adulthood , uninsured , and have children at home , measures to provide more inclusive services such as integrated behavioral health care are needed.
