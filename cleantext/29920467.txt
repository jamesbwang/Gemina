  A method was proposed to evaluate comprehensive effects of pHs and total metal concentration ( TMC) variation for metal speciation human health risk in groundwater. The method used for the health assessment considered comprehensive and mutative effects caused by oral ingestion of groundwater based on human health risk assessment model and MINTEQ simulation. The results demonstrated that the dissolution rate of Ni
