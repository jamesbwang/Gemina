  Acid-catalyzed skeletal C-C bond isomerizations are important benchmark reactions for the petrochemical industries. Among those , o-xylene isomerization/disproportionation is a probe reaction for strong Br√∏nsted acid catalysis , and it is also sensitive to the local acid site density and pore topology. Here , we report on the use of phosphotungstic acid ( PTA) encapsulated within NU-1000 , a Zr-based metal-organic framework ( MOF) , as a catalyst for o-xylene isomerization at 523 K. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure ( EXAFS) ,
