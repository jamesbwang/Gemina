  Melanonychia of the digit is uncommon in the Caucasian population and is concerning because of potential malignant transformation. Several histologic changes occur before malignant transformation , including melanocytic atypia. The authors evaluated patients with melanonychia with melanocytic hyperplasia<disease> to determine the risk factors for malignant transformation. The authors retrospectively reviewed records for patients older than 18 years that underwent biopsy for melanonychia. They identified 22 patients with melanocytic hyperplasia<disease> with a median age of 61 years ( interquartile range , 44 to 71 years). A bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate whether the degree of atypia was associated with malignant transformation and whether treatment choices by surgeons were based on melanocytic atypia. Following biopsy , patients were followed for a median of 41.0 months ( interquartile range , 4.8 to 100.6 months). Melanocytic atypia was present in nine patients and transformed into a malignancy in three: in two patients it became a melanoma in situ , and in one it became an acral lentiginous melanoma. Moderate-severe and severe melanocytic atypia was associated with malignant transformation. After initial biopsy , 14 patients were monitored ( 11 without atypia and three with atypia). One patient with slight atypia , two patients with moderate-severe atypia , and two patients with severe atypia underwent additional treatment. Patients with melanocytic hyperplasia<disease> without atypia were monitored more often ( 78.6 percent versus 21.4 percent). Melanonychia presents a challenge to the hand surgeon , as some patients may be monitored and some should undergo additional resection. Patients with moderate-severe melanocytic atypia following biopsy should undergo resection , and those with mild to slight atypia can most often be monitored clinically. Therapeutic , IV.
