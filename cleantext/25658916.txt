  Diabetic nephropathy is characterised by the excessive amount of extracellular matrix in glomeruli and tubulointerstitial space. Lysyl oxidase-like 2 ( LOXL2) is elevated in renal fibrosis<disease> and known to play key roles in ECM stabilisation by facilitating collagen cross-links , epithelial to mesenchymal transition and myofibroblast activation. Thus , targeting LOXL2 may prove to be a useful strategy to prevent diabetic nephropathy. We explored the renoprotective effect of a selective small molecule LOXL2 inhibitor ( PXS-S2B) in a streptozotocin-induced diabetes model. Diabetic mice were treated with PXS-S2B for 24 weeks and outcomes compared with untreated diabetic mice and with telmisartan treated animals as comparator of current standard of care. Diabetic mice had albuminuria , higher glomerulosclerosis scores , upregulation of fibrosis<disease> markers and increased renal cortical LOXL2 expression. Treatment with PXS-S2B reduced albuminuria and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis. This was associated with reduced expression of glomerular fibronectin and tubulointerstitial collagen I. The renoprotective effects of both PXS-S2B and telmisartan were more marked in the glomerular compartment than in the tubulointerstitial space. The study reveals that LOXL2 inhibition was beneficial in preserving glomerular structure and function. Thus , LOXL2 may be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy.
