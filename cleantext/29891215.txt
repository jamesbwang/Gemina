  Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) is the most effective treatment for severe<symptom> depression<symptom> but its neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. This randomized , sham-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) study explored the effects of a single ECT on neural response to affective pictures. Twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single active ECT ( N = 15) or sham ( N = 12) session in a double-blind , parallel-group design. On the following day , patients underwent fMRI during which they viewed pleasant , unpleasant and neutral pictures and performed a free recall test after the scan. Mood symptoms were assessed before ECT/sham and at the time of fMRI. Subsequently , all patients continued active ECT as usual. Mood symptoms were reassessed after six active ECT sessions. A single ECT vs. sham session reduced neural response to unpleasant vs. pleasant pictures in the medial prefrontal cortex , a region showing greater response in the more depressed patients. This effect occurred in the absence of between-group differences in picture recall , mood symptoms or concomitant medication. In conclusion , modulation of medial prefrontal hyper-activity during encoding of negative affective information may be a common mechanism of distinct biological depression<symptom> treatments.
