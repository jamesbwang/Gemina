  The nutritional value and chemical composition of various artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece were evaluated. Significant differences were detected in water content , as well as in fat , ash , protein and carbohydrate content. Proteins and carbohydrates were detected in high amounts in all the genotypes. Antioxidant activity was also varied between the studied samples. Palmitic and linoleic acids were the most abundant fatty acids in artichoke heads , while stearic , oleic , alpha-linolenic , arachidic , behenic and lignoceric acids were detected in lesser amounts. 3,5-O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid were the main phenolic compounds. In conclusion , heads of artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece showed a high nutritional value and antioxidant activity which signifies the importance of this vegetable for the Mediterranean diet , while the diversity in chemical composition between the studied samples should be further exploited for the selection of elite cultivars with specific end-uses of the final product.
