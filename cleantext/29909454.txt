  Diabetes increases the risk of occurrence and poor functional recovery after ischemic stroke injury. Previously , we have demonstrated greater hemorrhagic transformation ( HT) , edema<symptom> , and more severe functional deficits after stroke in diabetic animals that also presented with cerebral vasoregression and endothelial cell death in the recovery period. Given that Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR-4) activation in microvascular endothelial cells triggers a robust inflammatory response , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR-4 signaling prevents endothelial cell death and improves outcomes after stroke. Animals were treated with vehicle or TLR-4 inhibitor TAK242 ( 3 mg/kg; i.p.) following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO). Neurobehavioral deficits were measured at baseline and day 3 after ischemic stroke. Primary brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMVECs) from diabetic animals were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation re-oxygenation ( OGDR) and treated with 0.1 mM iron ( III) sulfate hydrate ( iron) ( to mimic the post-stroke bleeding) and TLR-4 inhibitors. Ischemic stroke increased the expression of TLR-4 in both hemispheres and in the microvasculature of diabetic animals. Cerebral infarct , edema<symptom> , HT , and functional deficits were greater in diabetic compared to control animals. Inhibition of TLR-4 significantly reduced the neurovascular injury and improved functional outcomes. OGDR and iron reduced the cell viability and increased the expression of TLR-4 associated proteins ( RIP3 , MyD88 , phospho-NF-kB , and release of IL-6) in BMVECs from diabetic animals. In conclusion , TLR-4 is highly upregulated in the microvasculature and that beneficial effects of TLR-4 inhibition are more profound in diabetes. This suggests that inhibition of vascular TLR-4 may provide therapeutic benefits for stroke recovery in diabetes.
