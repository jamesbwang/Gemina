  We present a case of symmetrical thermal intermediate-deep burns treated in a case-control fashion with the stromal vascular fraction ( SVF) obtained with the MyStem â„¢ device and a scaffold of hyaluronic acid. After enzymatic debridement and SVF harvesting and application , we observed quicker healing ( as assessed by wound<disease> area histogram planimetry) in the case area as opposed to the control one , which eventually underwent skin grafting. At the 3 months follow-up , the Vancouver Scar Scale was 9 for the case side and 10 for the control side , with a tendency to hypertrophic scarring in both areas , while patient satisfaction Visual Analogue Scale was 7 for the case side and 2 for the control side. CD31 expression , a marker of neoangiogenesis , was significantly higher in the case area as compared to the control one. SVF could potentially represent a valid alternative to the current standard of care , with a decreased need of invasive surgery and consequent improved patients ' quality of life.
