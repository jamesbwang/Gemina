  Fluorinated graphene ( FG) has been a star material as a new derivative of graphene. In this paper , a series of fluorinated graphene materials are prepared by using N , O-doped graphene aerogel as precursor via a direct fluorination method , and the effect of fluorination temperature on the FG structure is investigated. The prepared FG samples are systematically characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , X-ray diffraction , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that the structure of FG , including features such as layer size , chemical composition , chemical bond state of the component elements , etc. , is significantly related to the fluorination temperature. With the change of the fluorination temperature , fluorine atoms enter the graphene framework by a substitution process of the N , O-containing groups , including residual phenol , ether , carbonyl groups , or C ‚Åª N groups , and the addition to CC bonds , subsequently forming a fluoride with different fluorine contents. The fluorine content increases as the fluorination temperature increases from 200 & deg; C to 300 & deg; C , but decreases at a fluorination temperature of 350 & deg; C due to the decomposition of the fluorinated graphene. The prepared FG samples are used as cathode material for lithium primary batteries. The FG sample prepared at 300 & deg; C gives a high specific capacity of 632 mAh g
