  Emerging technologies are now giving us unprecedented access to manipulate brain circuits , shedding new light on treatments for amblyopia. This research is identifying key circuit elements that control brain plasticity and highlight potential therapeutic targets to promote rewiring in the visual system during and beyond early life. Here , we explore how such recent advancements may guide future pharmacological , genetic , and behavioral approaches to treat amblyopia. We will discuss how animal research , which allows us to probe and tap into the underlying circuit and synaptic mechanisms , should best be used to guide therapeutic strategies. Uncovering cellular and molecular pathways that can be safely targeted to promote recovery may pave the way for effective new amblyopia treatments across the lifespan.
