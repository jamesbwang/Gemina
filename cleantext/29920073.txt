  Synthetic methods that provide control over macrocycle conformation represent valuable tools for the discovery of bioactive molecules. Incorporation of heterocycles into cyclic peptides may offer a way to stabilize their solution conformations. Herein , we used N- ( isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane ( Pinc) to install an oxadiazole ring and an endocyclic amine into peptide macrocycles. To elucidate the conformational effect of this constellation of functionalities , we performed synthesis , variable temperature NMR analysis , and NOE-based molecular dynamics simulation of a range of macrocycles in DMSO. As part of this study , we conducted experiments to compare macrocycle conformation in aqueous and DMSO solutions. The obtained solution structures suggest that the reduced amide bond/heterocycle ( RAH) motif can stabilize macrocycle conformations in both water and DMSO , which addresses an enduring challenge in molecular design. The conformational effect of the RAH was used in an effort to mimic the biologically relevant secondary structure of MAdCAM-1. This resulted in the discovery of a novel Î±
