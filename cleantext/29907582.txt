  The relation between clinical complications and social network characteristics in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) has hardly been studied. Therefore , we examined the associations of social network characteristics with macro- and microvascular complications in T2DM and investigated whether these associations were independent of glycemic control , quality of life , and well-known cardiovascular risk factors. Participants with T2DM originated from the Maastricht Study , a population-based cohort study ( A smaller network size , higher percentages of family members , and lower percentages of friends were independently associated with macrovascular complications in both men and women. A smaller network size and less informational support were independently associated with microvascular complications in women , but not in men. This study shows that social network characteristics were associated with macro- and microvascular complications. Health care professionals should be aware of the association of the social network with T2DM outcomes. In the development of strategies to reduce the burden of disease , social network characteristics should be taken into account.
