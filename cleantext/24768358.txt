  Healthcare utilization and the cost implications associated with undiagnosed and/or misdiagnosed narcolepsy have not been evaluated , and there is scant literature characterizing the newly diagnosed population with narcolepsy with respect to treatment patterns and resource utilization. To analyze the changes in medication use , healthcare utilization , and the associated costs after a new diagnosis of narcolepsy. In this retrospective cohort study , we used data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Research Databases , between January 2006 and March 2013 , to identify patients who had a probable new diagnosis of narcolepsy-defined as a de novo medical claim for a multiple sleep latency test-which was preceded by â‰¥ 6 months of continuous insurance and was followed by a de novo diagnosis of narcolepsy. The utilization and cost of medical services and the percentage of patients filling prescriptions for narcolepsy-related medications were evaluated in 3 consecutive 1-year periods from the date of a positive multiple sleep latency test result ( ie , index date) , and each year 's findings were compared with the annualized results from the 6-month preindex period. A total of 3757 patients who met the definition of a new diagnosis of narcolepsy were identified. The total medical service utilization decreased each year from a preindex average of 28.2 visits per patient per year ( PPPY) to 26.9 visits ( In this study , the confirmation of a diagnosis of narcolepsy was associated with decreasing utilization and associated costs of medical services in the first 3 years after diagnosis. The total costs encompassing medical services and pharmacy costs were relatively stable during this period.
