  Sepsis<disease> remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Recognition and treatment of maternal sepsis<disease> are often delayed due to the physiological adaptations of pregnancy and vague or absent signs and symptoms during its initial presentation. Over the past decade , our understanding of sepsis<disease> has evolved and maternal early warning systems have been developed in an effort to help providers promptly identify and stratify parturients who are at risk. In addition , new consensus definitions and care bundles have recently been published by the World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis<disease> Campaign to facilitate earlier recognition and timely management of sepsis<disease>. In this narrative review , we summarize the available evidence about sepsis<disease> and provide an overview of the research efforts focused on maternal sepsis<disease> to date. Controversies and challenges surrounding the anesthetic management of parturients with sepsis<disease> or at risk of developing sepsis<disease> during pregnancy or the puerperium will be highlighted.
