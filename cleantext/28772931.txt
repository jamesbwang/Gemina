  In this study , we report the use of Al ₂ O ₃ nanoparticles in combination with fluorine doped tin oxide ( F: SnO ₂ , aka FTO) thin films to form hazy Al ₂ O ₃- FTO nanocomposites. In comparison to previously reported FTO-based nanocomposites integrating ZnO and sulfur doped TiO ₂ ( S: TiO ₂) nanoparticles ( i.e. , ZnO-FTO and S: TiO ₂- FTO nanocomposites) , the newly developed Al ₂ O ₃- FTO nanocomposites show medium haze factor H
