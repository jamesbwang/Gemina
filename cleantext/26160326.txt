  Tenderness<symptom> and intramuscular fat content are key attributes for beef sensory qualities. Recently some proteomic analysis revealed several proteins which are considered as good biomarkers of these quality traits. This study focuses on the analysis of 20 of these proteins representative of several biological functions: muscle structure and ultrastructure , muscle energetic metabolism , cellular stress and apoptosis. The relative abundance of the proteins was measured by Reverse Phase Protein Array ( RPPA) in five muscles known to have different tenderness<symptom> and intramuscular lipid contents:
