  To investigate the impact of meteorological conditions and PM A linear regression analysis was performed in monsoonal climate epidemiological survey for a period of four years on the impact of meteorological factors ( minimal temperature , mean temperature , maximal temperature , average daily surface temperature , day temperature range , relative humidity , mean wind speed , and atmospheric pressure) and PM During the study period ( from January 2011 to December 2014) , 1164 patients were identified as having acute aortic dissections. The corresponding incidences in spring and autumn were 0.96 and 1.00 , respectively , which significantly higher than that in summer and winter. The incidences of acute aortic dissection in a day could be predicted by diurnal temperature range ( DTR) using the following linear multiple regression models: incidences of acute aortic dissection = 0.543 + 0.025 Ã— DTR. This is the first study to show an attributable effect of DTR on acute aortic events in monsoonal climate. Our study confirms that meteorological variables were important factors influencing the incidence of acute aortic dissection.
