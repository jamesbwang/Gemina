  Host-associated microbiota undergoes a continuous transition , from the birth to adulthood of the host. These developmental stage-related transitions could lead to specific microbial signatures that could impact the host biological processes. In this study , the succession of early-life and intestinal bacterial communities of Atlantic<disease> salmon ( starting from embryonic stages to 80-week post hatch; wph) was studied using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA. Stage-specific bacterial community compositions and the progressive transitions of the communities were evident in both the early life and the intestine. The embryonic communities showed lower richness and diversity ( Shannon and PD whole tree) compared to the hatchlings. A marked transition of the intestinal communities also occurred during the development; Proteobacteria were dominant in the early stages ( both embryonic and intestinal) , though the abundant genera under this phylum were stage-specific. Firmicutes were the most abundant group in the intestine of late freshwater; Weissella being the dominant genus at 20 wph and Anaerofilum at 62 wph. Proteobacteria regained its dominance after the fish entered seawater. Furthermore , LEfSe analysis identified genera under the above- mentioned phyla that are significant features of specific stages. The environmental ( water) bacterial community was significantly different from that of the fish , indicating that the host is a determinant of microbial assemblage. Overall the study demonstrated the community dynamics during the development of Atlantic<disease> salmon.
