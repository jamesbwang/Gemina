  Focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD) is the most commonly encountered developmental malformation that causes refractory epilepsy. Focal cortical dysplasia type 2 is one of the most usual neuropathological findings in tissues resected therapeutically from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Unlike other types of FCD , it is characterized by laminar disorganization and dysplastic neurons , which compromise the organization of the six histologically known layers in the cortex; the morphology and/or cell location can also be altered. A comprehensive review about the pathogenesis of this disease is important because of the necessity to update the results reported over the past years. Here , we present an updated review through Pubmed about the mammalian target of rapamycin ( MTOR) pathway in FCD type 2. A wide variety of aspects was covered in 44 articles related to molecular and cellular biology , including experiments in animal and human models. The first publications appeared in 2004 , but there is still a lack of studies specifically for one type of FCD. With the advancement of techniques and greater access to molecular and cellular experiments , such as induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) and organoids , it is believed that the trend is increasing the number of publications contributing to the achievement of new discoveries.
