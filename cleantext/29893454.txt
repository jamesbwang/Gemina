  A 10-year-old male and his family members visited a pediatric hematology clinic due to coagulopathy. Laboratory tests indicated von Willebrand disease ( vWD) in all the family members. We conducted diagnostic exome sequencing for confirmation. The patient was confirmed to be a compound heterozygote for vWD: c. 2574C > G ( p.Cys858Trp) from his father ( known variant of vWD type 1) and c. 3390C > T ( p.Pro1127 _ Gly1180delinsArg) from his mother ( variant known to result in exon 26 skipping in vWD type 2A). He was managed with factor VIII and von Willebrand factor complex concentrate during palatoplasty due to bleeding despite pre-operative desmopressin injection. The operation was completed successfully.
