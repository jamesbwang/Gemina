  This study analyzes the trajectories of antibiotic consumption using different indicators of patients ' socioeconomic status , category and age-group of physicians. This study uses a pooled , cross-sectional , time series analysis. The data focus on 22 European countries from 2000 to 2014 and were obtained from the European Center for Disease and Control , Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development , Eurostat and Global Economic Monitor. There are large variations in community and hospital use of antibiotics in European countries , and the consumption of antibiotics has remained stable over the years. This applies to the community ( b = 0.07 , p = 0.267 , 95 % -0.06 , 0.19 , b-squared < 0.01 , p = 0.813 , 95 % = -0.01 , 0.02) as well as the hospital sector ( b = -0.02; p = 0.450; CI 95 % = -0.06 , 0.03; b-squared < 0.01; p = 0.396; CI95 % = > -0.01 , < 0.01). Some socioeconomic variables , such as level of education , income , Gini index and unemployment , are not related to the rate of antibiotic use. The age-group of physicians and general practitioners is associated with the use of antibiotics in the hospital. An increase in the proportion of young doctors ( < 45 years old) leads to a significant increase in antibiotics consumption , and as the percentage of generalist practitioners increases , there use of antibiotics in hospitals decreases by 0.04 DDD/1000 inhabitants. Understanding that age-groups and categories ( general/specialist practitioners) of physicians may predict antibiotic consumption is potentially useful in defining more effective health care policies to reduce the inappropriate antibiotic use while promoting rational use.
