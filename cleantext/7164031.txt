  Recurrent epistaxis<symptom> is one of the most common causes of emergency department visits. Although several localized and systemic conditions has been described , the exact cause is unknown in the majority of cases. In our study , we aimed to determine the effect of mean platelet volume ( MPV) and red blood cell distribution width ( RDW) levels on recurrent epistaxis<symptom>. One hundred and thirty six patients with recurrent epistaxis<symptom> and 170 healthy cases as control group were included in the study. Demographic data , vital signs and the results of complete blood counts were recorded. The patients who had clinical conditions that might affect the levels of MPV or RDW , were excluded. MPV and RDW levels were compared between the two groups. The median level of MPV was 7.6 fL ( IQR25-75 %: 7.1-8.4) in the study group and 8.2 fL ( IQR25-75 %: 7.8-8.9) in the control group ( p < 0.001). The median levels of RDW were found in the patient and control groups in order .4 ( IQR25-75 %: 14.5-15.4) and .3 ( IQR25-75 %: 13.4-15.4) ( p < 0.001). Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , leukocyte count , age , sex , RDW and MPV levels that were variables with p levels < 0.2 , were included in the multivariate analyses. It was determined that high RDW levels increased epistaxis<symptom> ( p < 0.001; OR: 1.89 ( 95 % CI: 1.53-2.33)) and high MPV levels decreased epistaxis<symptom> ( p < 0.001; OR: 0.54 ( 95 % CI: 0.39-0.72)). Low MPV and high RDW levels caused an increased bleeding tendency in patients with recurrent epistaxis<symptom>. Although exact mechanism is not known , referring those patients for the assessment of etiologic causes would be proper.
