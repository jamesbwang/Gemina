  Single-phase white phosphors could overcome many drawbacks of traditional phosphors , and warm white light phosphors have been considered suitable for indoor illumination applications. Thus , synthesizing new single-phase warm white phosphors is significant for the production of LEDs. Based on the above considerations , a novel single component warm white light phosphor SmxTbyDy0.2-x-y-metal organic frameworks ( MOFs) has been prepared successfully in this study. The compound Sm0.1Tb0.04Dy0.06-MOF shows ideal warm white light emission with CIE coordinates ( 0.333 , 0.3522) , a color rendering index ( CRI) value of 86.7 , a low correlated color temperature ( CCT) value of 4444 K , and good heating/cooling circulation. In addition , the LED devices fabricated with this novel warm white light phosphor have excellent warm white light quality even at high temperatures , which is necessary for its practical application.
