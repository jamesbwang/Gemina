  Prostate cancer ( PCa) is one of the most prevalent male cancers in western world. Radiation therapy ( RT) is commonly used to treat PCa patients. However , a certain proportion of patients develop radioresistant PCa cells , which results in metastatic disease. Statins , which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA) reductase , are commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia , exhibiting beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases and on several types of cancers , including PCa. However , the mechanistic details and crosstalk between statins and RT in PCa cells remain unknown. In this study , radioresistant DOC-2/ DAB2 interactive protein ( DAB2IP)- deficient PCa cells were used to evaluate whether simvastatin could enhance the effect of ionizing radiation ( IR). The crucial molecules that associated with simvastatin elevated radiosensitivity in PCa cells were explored. Our results demonstrated that a combination treatment with simvastatin and IR synergistically induced apoptosis of radioresistant PCa cells. In addition , simvastatin appeared to compromise DNA double-strand breaks repair by activating the expressions of histone 2A family member X ( Î³-H2AX) and phospho-checkpoint kinase 1 ( p-CHK1) , suggesting an underlying mechanism for this radiosensitization of PCa cells. These findings reveal that simvastatin may be a potent therapeutic agent for co-treatment with radiation to overcome radioresistance in PCa cells.
