  Chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> can be particularly challenging to diagnose and characterize , as inflammatory changes in tissue may not be present in blood. There is a crucial need to develop non-invasive biomarkers that would be useful in diagnosing disease and selecting medical therapies. For example , there are no blood tests to diagnose asthma , a common inflammatory lung disease. MicroRNA ( miRNA) expression profiling in blood is emerging as a potentially sensitive and useful biomarker of many diseases. In particular , we have characterized a cost-effective PCR-based array technology to measure and profile circulating miRNAs in the plasma of patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Here , we describe the methods to isolate , quantify , and analyze miRNAs in the plasma of human subjects as well as ways to determine their diagnostic utility.
