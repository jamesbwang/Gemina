  This is the first study to identify lipidomic markers in plasma associated with response of acutely ill schizophrenia patients in response to specific antipsychotic treatments. The study population included 54 schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotics for 6 weeks. Treatment led to significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms for 34 patients with little or no improvement for 20 patients. In addition , 37 patients showed an increase in body mass index after the 6 week treatment period , consistent with effects on metabolism and the association of such effects with symptom improvement. Profiling of plasma samples taken prior to therapy using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) resulted in identification of 38 , 10 , and 52 compounds associated with the olanzapine , risperidone , and quetiapine treatment groups , which could be used to distinguish responders from non-responders. Limitations include the retroactive active nature of the study and the small sample size. Further investigations with larger sample sets could lead to the development of a molecular test that could be used to help psychiatrists determine the best treatment options for each patient.
