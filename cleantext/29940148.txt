  The molecular mechanisms involved in the development and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) are complex. Molecule-targeted drugs are characterized by strong specificity and low toxicity , but the clinical research of these drugs still exhibits many difficulties , such as poor target specificity. With the in-depth study of the tumor immunological theory , therapies based on overcoming the tumor immune escape to produce a specific effective tumor immune response has gradually become a hot topic in tumor research. We hope that by studying the effects of liver-targeted drugs on the expression of immune-related proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma cells , we will find a potential link to further guide the clinical drug use. Human hepatoma Hep3B cells were used to establish liver cancer xenografts by inoculating 40 BALB/c nude mice. The following five groups of mice ( 8 mice per group) were randomly set up: lenvatinib group , apatinib group , sorafenib group , regorafenib group , and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) group. After treatment , we analyzed PD-L1 and B7-H3 mRNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assay and assessed the PD-L1 and B7-H3 protein expression by Western immunoblotting. Real-time PCR results suggested that the mRNA expression of PD-L1 in the lenvatinib group was significantly higher than that in the control group , while its expression in the regorafenib group was significantly lower than that in the control group ( both p < .05). Western immunoblotting results suggested that , compared with the control group , PD-L1 protein was increased in the lenvatinib group , while its expression in the regorafenib group was decreased. Lenvatinib and regorafenib affected the expression of PD-L1 in the process of anti-HCC.
