  Serotonin ( 5-HT) is one of the best-studied modulatory neurotransmitters with ubiquitous presynaptic release and postsynaptic reception. 5-HT has been implicated in a wide variety of brain functions , ranging from autonomic regulation , sensory perception , feeding and motor function to emotional regulation and cognition. The role of this neuromodulator in neuropsychiatric diseases is unquestionable with important neuropsychiatric medications , e.g. , most antidepressants , targeting this system. Importantly , 5-HT modulates neurodevelopment and changes in its levels during development can have life-long consequences. In this mini-review , we highlight that exposure to both low and high serotonin levels during the perinatal period can lead to behavioral deficits in adulthood. We focus on three exogenous factors that can change 5-HT levels during the critical perinatal period: dietary tryptophan depletion , exposure to serotonin-selective-reuptake-inhibitors ( SSRIs) and poor early life care. We discuss the effects of each of these on behavioral deficits in adulthood.
