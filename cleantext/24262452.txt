  Growing skull fracture remains a rare but clinically significant complication of traumatic skull fractures in children less than 3 years of age. Dog attacks on children commonly cause head and neck injuries. We report the first case of growing skull fracture caused by a Rottweiler bite in a 21 days old neonate. Early diagnosis and surgical repair resulted in excellent outcome.
