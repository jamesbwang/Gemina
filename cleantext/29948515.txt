  Type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) has consistently been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer , but the association of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) with breast cancer is less clear. T2DM and GDM may influence breast cancer risk through mammographic breast density , a strong risk factor for breast cancer. We examined whether T2DM and GDM are associated with higher mammographic breast density in a largely racial/ethnic minority sample. We collected digital mammograms , anthropometric measures , and interview data from 511 racially diverse women recruited during screening mammography appointments between 2012 and 2016 ( mean age 51 years; 70 % Hispanic). We examined the associations of self-reported GDM , T2DM , and medication use ( metformin and insulin) with mammographic breast density , measured as percent and area of dense tissue using Cumulus software. In multivariable linear regression models , history of T2DM and/or GDM and length of time since diagnosis were not associated with percent density or dense breast area , either before or after adjustment for current BMI. Use of metformin in diabetic women was associated with lower percent density ( Î² =- 5.73 , 95 % CI- 10.27 ,- 1.19) , only before adjusting for BMI. These associations were not modified by menopausal status. Our results do not support associations between T2DM and/or GDM and higher amount of mammographically dense breast tissue , suggesting that the mechanism linking diabetes with breast cancer risk may not include mammographic breast density in midlife.
