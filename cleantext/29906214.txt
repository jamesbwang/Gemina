  Psoriasis is a complex chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal thickening on the basis of increased keratinocyte proliferation and insufficient apoptosis. Laminins are important components of the basement membrane ( BM) and impact on epidermal keratinocyte growth/apoptosis. Although several laminins are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis , it is still controversial about the expression patterns of laminin isoforms and which laminins are important in the development of psoriasis. Because laminin-511 and -332 are key BM components in human skin , and laminin-511 stimulates human hair follicle growth , we asked whether the BM zone in psoriasis shows any laminin-related abnormalities. This showed that the BM expression of laminin-511 and -332 was significantly increased within the skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> of psoriasis. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that laminin-511 , -332 , and collagen type IV proteins were also significantly increased in psoriasis-like skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> of Imiquimod-treated mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed a few gaps of lamina densa , and its thickness was significantly increased. Finally , laminin-511 treatment significantly stimulated the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HaCaT cells , while laminin-Î±5 chain gene knockdown decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis. These phenomenological observations raise the question of whether laminin-511-controlled keratinocyte growth/death may be a previously overlooked player in the pathogenesis of psoriatic epidermal
