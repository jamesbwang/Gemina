  Restriction modification systems consist of an endonuclease that cleaves foreign DNA site-specifically and an associated methyltransferase that protects the corresponding target site in the host genome. Modification-dependent restriction systems , in contrast , specifically recognize and cleave methylated and/or glucosylated DNA. The LlaJI restriction system contains two 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC) methyltransferases ( LlaJI.M1 and LlaJI.M2) and two restriction proteins ( LlaJI.R1 and LlaJI.R2). LlaJI.R1 and LlaJI.R2 are homologs of McrB and McrC , respectively , which in
