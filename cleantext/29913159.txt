  The spontaneous nature of biopolymer phase separation in cells entails that the resulting condensates can be thermodynamic machines , which , in the process of condensing , can take on distinct forms themselves and deform neighboring cellular structures. We introduce here general notions of material and mechanical properties of protein condensates with an emphasis on how molecular arrangements and intermolecular interaction within condensates determine their ability to do work on their surroundings. We further propose functional implications of these concepts to cellular and subcellular morphology and biogenesis.
