  Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control one 's own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of the precuneus in metacognition processing , especially during mnemonic tasks. However , the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here , we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy human participants of both sexes , seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition in memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing precuneal activity selectively impaired metacognitive efficiency of temporal-order memory judgment , but not perceptual discrimination. Moreover , the correlation in individuals ' metacognitive efficiency between domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together , these findings provide evidence reinforcing the notion that the precuneal region plays an important role in mediating metacognition of episodic memory retrieval.
