  Type II Diabetes ( T2DM) negatively alters baseline tendon function , including decreased range of motion and mechanical properties; however , the biological mechanisms that promote diabetic tendinopathy are unknown. To facilitate identification of therapeutic targets we developed a novel murine model of diabetic tendinopathy. Mice fed a High Fat Diet ( HFD) developed diet induced obesity and T2DM and demonstrated progressive impairments in tendon gliding function and mechanical properties , relative to mice fed a Low Fat Diet ( LFD). We then determined if restoration of normal metabolic function , by switching mice from HFD to LFD , was sufficient to halt the pathological changes in tendon due to obesity/T2DM. However , switching from a HFD to LFD resulted in greater impairments in tendon gliding function than mice maintained on a HFD. Mechanistically , IRβ signaling is decreased in obese/T2DM murine tendons , suggesting altered IRβ signaling as a driver of diabetic tendinopathy. However , knock-down of IRβ expression in S100a4-lineage cells ( IRcKO
