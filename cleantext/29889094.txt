  Laptop computer use may lead to the development of health problems. However , few methods exist to measure laptop use in undergraduate students. To develop a web-based questionnaire to measure ergonomic exposures to laptop use and to test the feasibility of administration in university students. We pilot tested the administration of the Student Laptop Use and Musculoskeletal Posture<symptom> ( SLUMP) questionnaire to 44 second year undergraduate students. We measured the participation rate , completion of questions , and sought feedback for improving the questionnaire. The participation rate was 75 % ( 33/44). Students needed 10-12 minutes to complete the questionnaire. Participants suggested adding half hour intervals for questions measuring breaks and improving the clarity by emphasizing the sections focusing on academic , recreational and employment laptop use. Our pilot study suggests that the SLUMP questionnaire is appropriate for `` in-class '' measurement of ergonomic exposures to laptop use in university students.
