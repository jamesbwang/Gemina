  The 21-item Depression<symptom> , Anxiety<symptom> , and Stress Scales ( DASS-21) is a self-report measure that is easy to administer , quick to score , and is freely available. Widely used in diverse settings and populations , confirmatory factor analytic evidence has accumulated for a bifactor model underlying this multidimensional measure. Studies employing an exploratory bifactor approach to more closely examine its underlying structure and inter-relations of factors , however , have been scarce. This is unfortunate because confirmatory techniques often employ indirect ways of handling model misspecification , whereas exploratory methods enable more direct approaches. Moreover , more precise approaches to modeling an exploratory bifactor structure have not been examined with the DASS-21. Based on several large samples of undergraduate students in the United States , the first two parts of the paper ( Studies 1 and 2) utilized both exploratory ( M = 19.7 years of age) and confirmatory factor analytic methods ( M = 19.7 years of age) following those presented by contemporary multidimensional modeling theorists. Building upon these results , the third part of the paper ( Study 3; M = 20.0 years of age) examined sensitivity-/ specificity-related indices to provide cut-off score recommendations for a revised DASS-21 instrument based on a newly identified and supported bifactor structure. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of taxonomy , challenges inherent in multidimensional modeling , and potential use of the revised DASS-21 measure as a component of an actuarial decision-making strategy to inform clinical referrals.
