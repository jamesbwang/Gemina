  Correlations between periodontitis<disease> and its effects on the outcome of pregnancies are actually more focused topics. Maternal motivation for a good oral hygiene and preventive dental treatment must be highlighted tasks during pregnancy care. The authors analysed the effect of the preventive dental treatment during pregnancy and its obstetrical effects. In a prospective randomised study , including pregnant women observed for threatening preterm deliveries , patients with dental examination ( n = 71) were compared with patients undergoing dental treatment at the same time ( n = 79). Univariate comparisons for categorical variables were assessed by χ2 tests and independent Student 's t-tests for continuous variables. ORs were compared with Mantel-Haenszel tests. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the factors determining the poor periodontal parameters and gingivitis<disease> separately. The two-tailed statistical significance level was set at 5 %. In the dental treatment group , the neonatal birth weight was significantly higher than in the non-treated group , in case of patients with periodontitis<disease> ( 2990 ± 582.3 g vs 2568.1 ± 699.1 g , p = 0.005). Also the average age at delivery was significantly higher in the treated vs non-treated groups ( 37.3 ± 1.9 vs 36.0 ± 2.9 weeks , p = 0.027) , and the treatment had a beneficial effect on the prolongation of pregnancy , with a higher level of significance in the gingivitis<disease> group vs patients with periodontitis<disease> groups ( p = 0.02 vs p = 0.043). Dental treatment of expecting women has a beneficial effect on the prolongation of pregnancy by decreasing the rate of prematurity and perinatal complications. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159 ( 24): 978-984.
