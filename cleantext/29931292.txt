  We report new crystallographic structures of Thermus thermophilus ribosomes complexed with long mRNAs and native Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> tRNAs. They complete the full set of combinations of Watson-Crick G • C and miscoding G • U pairs at the first two positions of the codon-anticodon duplex in ribosome functional complexes. Within the tight decoding center , miscoding G • U pairs occur , in all combinations , with a non-wobble geometry structurally indistinguishable from classical coding Watson-Crick pairs at the same first two positions. The contacts with the ribosomal grip surrounding the decoding center are all quasi-identical , except in the crowded environment of the amino group of a guanosine at the second position; in which case a G in the codons may be preferred. In vivo experimental data show that the translational errors due to miscoding by G • U pairs at the first two positions are the most frequently encountered ones , especially at the second position and with a G on the codon. Such preferred miscodings involve a switch from an A-U to a G • U pair in the tRNA/mRNA complex and very rarely from a G = C to a G • U pair. It is concluded that the frequencies of such occurrences are only weakly affected by the codon/anticodon structures but depend mainly on the stability and lifetime of the complex , the modifications present in the anticodon loop , especially those at positions 34 and 37 , in addition to the relative concentration of cognate/near-cognate tRNA species present in the cellular tRNA pool.
