  Adult tongue epithelium is continuously renewed from epithelial progenitor cells , a process that requires hedgehog ( HH) signaling. In mice , pharmacological inhibition of the HH pathway causes taste bud loss within a few weeks. Previously , we demonstrated that sonic hedgehog ( SHH) overexpression in lingual progenitors induces ectopic taste buds with locally increased SOX2 expression , suggesting that taste bud differentiation depends on SOX2 downstream of HH. To test this , we inhibited HH signaling in mice and observed a rapid decline in
