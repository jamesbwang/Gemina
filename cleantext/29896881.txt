  Conjugated polymer dots ( Pdots , also named polymer nanoparticles , PNPs) , which consist of Ï€-conjugated organic polymers , are novel organic nanomaterials with size in the range of 1-100 nm. Compared with traditional organic small molecules , semiconductor quantum dots and inorganic nanomaterials , the Pdots exhibit significant potential applications in biological imaging , sensing and detection , drug delivery and theranostics , due to their advantages of special optical properties , diverse structure , easy surface modification and good biocompatibility. In this short review , we present a brief summary of the current development in Pdots as phototheranostic agents , including fluorescence imaging , photoacoustic imaging , photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy. Current challenges in Pdot research and future directions in the field are proposed.
