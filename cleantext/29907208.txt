  Recent studies from Asia have reported the safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted thyroid surgery. In the United States , several small series and case reports have been published , mostly regarding treatment of benign disease. The aim of our study is to report the safety and feasibility of robotic surgery for well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients at a North American institution. We performed a retrospective cohort study using a prospectively collected single-center clinical database at Tulane University Medical Center. We included all well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients who underwent robotic-assisted or conventional cervical approach thyroid surgery with or without lymph node dissections at our institution from January 2015 to June 2017. Patient demographics and perioperative data were collected and analyzed. A total of 144 surgeries for thyroid cancer were performed; 35 ( 24.3 %) were robotic-assisted. There were no significant differences in estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , operative times , complication rates , specimen sizes , positive microscopic margins , number of lymph nodes removed with associated lymph node dissections , patient follow-up duration , or clinical recurrence rates between the two groups. Overall length of stay was shorter for robotic-assisted surgery , at 0.6 ± 0.9 d , versus 1.1 ± 1.2 d for conventional open surgery ( P = 0.009). For robotic-assisted surgery , 19 patients ( 54.3 %) were discharged on the day of procedure , and only one patient was admitted as inpatient to the hospital ( 2.9 %). Robot-assisted thyroid surgery is a safe , feasible , and oncologically sound approach for a select group of well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients. However , long-term studies are needed.
