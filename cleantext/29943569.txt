  A 300-year ( 1700-2007) chronological record of environmental perchlorate , reconstructed from high-resolution analysis of a central Greenland ice core , shows that perchlorate levels in the post-1980 atm were two-to-three times those of the pre-1980 environment. While this confirms recent reports of increased perchlorate in Arctic snow since 1980 compared with the levels for the prior decades ( 1930-1980) , the longer Greenland record demonstrates that the Industrial Revolution and other human activities , which emitted large quantities of pollutants and contaminants , did not significantly impact environmental perchlorate , as perchlorate levels remained stable throughout the 18
