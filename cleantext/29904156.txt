  Most cost-effectiveness analyses of colorectal cancer ( CRC) screening assume Medicare payment rates and a lifetime horizon. Our aims were to examine the implications of differential payment levels and time horizons for commercial insurers vs. Medicare on the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. We used our validated Markov cohort simulation of CRC screening in the average risk US population to examine CRC screening at ages 50-64 under commercial insurance , and at ages 65-80 under Medicare , using a health-care sector perspective. Model outcomes included discounted quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs) and costs per person , and incremental cost/QALY gained. Lifetime costs/person were 20-44 % higher when assuming commercial payment rates rather than Medicare rates for people under 65. Most of the substantial clinical benefit of screening at ages 50-64 was realized at ages ≥ 65. For commercial payers with a time horizon of ages 50-64 , fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT) and fecal immunochemical testing ( FIT) were cost-effective ( < $ 61,000/ QALY gained) , but colonoscopy was costly ( > $ 185,000/ QALY gained). Medicare experienced substantial clinical benefits and cost-savings from screening done at ages < 65 , even if screening was not continued. Among those previously screened , continuing FOBT and FIT under Medicare was cost-saving and continuing colonoscopy was highly cost-effective ( < $ 30,000/ QALY gained) , and initiating any screening in those previously unscreened was highly effective and cost-saving. Modeling suggests that CRC screening is highly cost-effective over a lifetime even when considering higher payment rates by commercial payers vs. Medicare. Screening may appear relatively costly for commercial payers if only a time horizon of ages 50-64 is considered , but it is predicted to yield substantial clinical and economic benefits that accrue primarily at ages ≥ 65 under Medicare.
