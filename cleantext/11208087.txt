  Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor primarily affecting children and adolescents. Its cause is not yet fully understood , and there is an urgent need for more effective treatment. In the present study we identified several miRNAs whose expression is altered in osteosarcoma compared to adjacent normal tissue. Moreover , expression levels of one of those miRNAs , miR-506-3p , correlated negatively with expression of RAB3D ( a Ras-related protein). Suppression of miR-506-3p in osteosarcoma led to increased expression of RAB3D , which in turn led to increased CDK4 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 4) and MMP9 ( matrix metalloprotein 9) activities. Our results suggest that miR-506-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma and that its downregulation leads to tumor cell proliferation and metastasis due to upregulation of RAB3D- and CDK4-mediated signaling. miR-506-3p thus appears be a potentially useful target for adjuvant therapy in osteosarcoma patients.
