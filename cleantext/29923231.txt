  With the loss of biodiversity accelerating , conservation translocations such as reintroductions are becoming an increasingly common conservation tool. Conservation translocations must source individuals for release from either wild or captive-bred populations. We asked what proportion of North American conservation translocations rely on captive breeding , and to what extent zoos and aquaria ( hereafter zoos) fulfill captive breeding needs. Our comprehensive literature review indicates that North American conservation translocations published before 2014 involved captive breeding for 162 ( 58 %) of the 279 animal species translocated. Fifty-four zoos contributed animals for release; the fourty species of animals bred for release by zoos represents only 14 % of all animal species for which conservation translocations were published , and only 25 % of all animal species that were bred for releases occurring in North<pathogen> America. Zoo contributions varied by taxon , ranging from zoo-bred animals released in 42 % of amphibian conservation translocations to zero contributions for marine invertebrates. Proportional involvement of zoos in captive breeding programs for release has increased over time as has the proportion of translocation-focused scientific papers co-authored by zoo professionals. While zoos also contribute to conservation translocations through education , funding , and professional expertise , increasing the contribution of animals for release in responsible conservation translocation programs presents a future conservation need and opportunity. We especially encourage increased dialogue and planning between the zoo community , academic institutions , and governments to optimize the direct contribution zoos can make to wildlife conservation through conservation translocations.
