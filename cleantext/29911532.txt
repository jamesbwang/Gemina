  78-year-old man presented with complaints of progressive nasal blockage and epistaxis<symptom> over the previous 2 months. Clinical examination revealed a nodular , polypoid , ulcerated nonpigmented tumor filling the right nasal cavity ( Figure 1). A punch biopsy was taken from the mass for histopathologic examination , which revealed many melanocytes in the submucosa. The stroma contained large numbers of spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic spindleoid nuclei ( Figure 2) , confirming the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The tumor cells stained positive for melan-A ( Figure 3) and HMB-45.
