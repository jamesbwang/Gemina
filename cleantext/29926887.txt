  This paper describes the stabilization of an intermolecular i-motif by lipophilic modification on the 3 '- terminus of oligonucleotides. The hydrophobic aliphatic chain connected at the 3 '- terminus of a trinucleotide ( dC) 3 promoted the formation of an i-motif and significantly enhanced the quadruplex 's stability. The impact of lipophilic modification on i-motif 's thermal stability was studied by UV-thermal denaturation melting experiments and isothermal titration calorimetry. We found that alkyl chains containing more than 14 carbon atoms could elevate the i-motif structure 's stability in a wide range of pH and concentrations.
