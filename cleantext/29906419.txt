  This meta-analysis aims to assess the prognostic value of long non-coding RNA ZEB1-AS1 in human solid tumors. We searched the available databases up to January 2018. Pooled hazard ratios ( HRs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were used to examine the prognostic impact of ZEB1-AS1 on patient survival. Eight eligible studies with a total of 586 patients were enrolled. A significant association was observed between ZEB1-AS1 overexpression and poor overall survival ( OS; HR = 2.195 , 95 % CI: 1.749-2.755) as well as unfavorable recurrence-free survival ( pooled HR = 2.205 , 95 % CI: 1.486-3.270) , and no heterogeneity was found across these studies ( p = .962 , I High expression level of ZEB1-AS1 was associated with unfavorable survival outcome for cancer patients , and ZEB1-AS1 could be used as a prognostic predictor for cancers.
