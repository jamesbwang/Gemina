  The current study investigated the behavior and visual attention of two groups of drivers with differing pedal cycling experience ( pedal cyclists and nonpedal cyclists) towards vulnerable road users at junctions in a driving simulator. Pedal cyclists and motorcyclists are involved in a disproportionate number of crashes given the distance they travel , with a high proportion of these crashes occurring at junctions. Many studies have found that car drivers who also hold a motorcycle license have increased awareness towards motorcycles. The task involved approaching a T-junction and turning right when it was deemed to be safe. In Study 1 , the junction was controlled by a give way sign , and in Study 2 , the junction was controlled by a stop sign. Each T-junction contained a target vehicle ( car , motorcycle , or pedal cycle) , approaching from a near , medium , or far distance from the junction. Participants did not look at pedal cycles approaching from a far distance for as long as they looked at approaching motorcycles and cars , despite all vehicles travelling at identical speeds. No differences were found between pedal cyclists and nonpedal cyclists on any visual attention measures , indicating that pedal cycling experience was not associated with differences in drivers ' attention toward pedal cycles. Findings have implications for road safety , demonstrating subtle differences in drivers ' everyday visual attention toward differing vehicle types. This research has the potential to inform the development of in-car technical assistive systems , improving the safety of vulnerable road users at junctions.
