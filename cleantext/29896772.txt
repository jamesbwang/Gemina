  Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP) patients possess multiple risk factors for osteoporosis , but few studies have evaluated bone mineral density ( BMD) in CIDP patients. We retrospectively compared the BMD of CIDP patients with that of normal controls , and evaluated the clinical factors associated with osteoporosis. Total BMD was lower in CIDP patients than in normal controls ( p = 0.017). In a comparison of 16 osteoporotic CIDP patients with 25 non-osteoporotic patients , the cumulative prednisolone dose was lower ( p = 0.022) and the duration from disease onset to BMD measurement was shorter ( p = 0.014) in osteoporotic patients than in non-osteoporotic patients. Function , as measured by modified Rankin Scale score within 3 years of the BMD measurement , was worse in osteoporotic than in non-osteoporotic patients ( p = 0.008). BMD in CIDP patients was significantly lower than in normal controls. Functional status rather than cumulative steroid dose was associated with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.
