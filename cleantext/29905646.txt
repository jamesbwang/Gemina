  To compare the exercise loads and cognitive effects of a classical workplace program from that for a motor-cognitive coordination workplace intervention. Twenty-eight ( 28) employed adults ( women 19 , men 9) participated in a motor-cognitive coordination and a classical workplace health promotion exercise intervention. Effects on attention and cognition ( trail making test ( TMT)) as well as exercise load ( heart rate and rates of perceived exhaustion<symptom> ( RPE)) were assessed. The motor-cognitive intervention does not improve cognitive abilities ( TMT-A: -4.6 ± 2.2 seconds; TMT-B: -8.5 ± 3.2 seconds) to a greater extent than the classical workplace health enhancement training ( TMT-A: -4.6 ± 3.1 seconds; TMT-B: -7.4 ± 3.9 seconds) ( P < 0.05). The exercise load was not different between the two interventions ( maximal heart rate: 107 ± 8 vs 111 ± 6 bpm; RPE: 11.8 ± 1.7 vs 11.9 ± 1.2 points). The motor-cognitive workplace intervention may be adopted as an additional/alternate enhancement in terms of varied activity , and not as a compensation intervention for workplace health. More research is needed to proof this assumption.
