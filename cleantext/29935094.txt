  Toll-like receptor-4 ( TLR4) is a key component of the innate immune system and activation of TLR4 signaling has a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Therefore , our objective was to identify the natural TLR4 antagonist and evaluate its activity in experimentally induced asthma. Soya lecithin origin phosphatidylcholine ( soya PC) was identified as a natural TLR4 antagonist by computational study. Based on the computational study , TLR4 antagonist activity of soya PC was confirmed in in vitro lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced neutrophil adhesion assay. In the in vivo study , rats were sensitized with ovalbumin ( OVA) ( 100 μg/kg , i.p.) on the 7th , 14th and 21st days and challenged intranasally with OVA ( 100 μg/100 μL) and LPS ( 10 ng/100 μL) , 4 days/wk for 3 weeks. At the end of the experiment , we performed lung function parameters ( respiratory rate , tidal volume , airflow rate) , inflammatory cytokines ( interleukin ( IL) -4 , IL-5 , IL-13) , total and differential leukocytes in blood as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALf) and histological examinations. The computational study indicated that TLR4 antagonist activity of soya PC is due to linoleic acid ( 18:2) fatty acid chain. Soya PC significantly suppressed the LPS-induced neutrophil adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner to 1 μg/mL. The treatment of soya PC ( 5 and 10 mg/kg , 18 days , i.p.) significantly improved the lung function parameters , total and differential leukocyte counts in blood and BALf in asthmatic rats. This efficacy of soya PC was in extent similar to dexamethasone ( 2.5 mg/kg , 18 days , i.p.). However , soya PC was superior to dexamethasone in terms of benefits. The protective action of soya PC may be due to TLR4 antagonist activity and linoleic acid composition.
