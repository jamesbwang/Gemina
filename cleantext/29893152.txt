  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is the main cause of death in the world. Coronary artery disease ( CAD) is the most common form of CVD presentation , but the prevalence of peripheral artery disease ( PAD) is increasing. Patients with polyvascular disease comprise a very high-risk population that has been infrequently studied. Areas covered: The authors review the current evidence of the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in the setting of acute coronary syndrome<disease> and stable patients post-MI with and without PAD and summarize its pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and regulatory issues. Expert opinion: Randomized studies showed that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes<disease> , and is superior to placebo in the chronic phase ( > 1 year) post-myocardial infarction. Sub-analyses of these studies suggest that patients with myocardial infarction and PAD , compared to patients without these characteristics , may have greater benefit with ticagrelor. Nonetheless , the global evidence about the role of ticagrelor in patients with myocardial infarction and PAD remains relatively sparse , and a prospective randomized trial testing this hypothesis would be necessary to provide more definite data regarding the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in this very high-risk population.
