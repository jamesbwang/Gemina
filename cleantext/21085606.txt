  Inflammation<symptom> has a key role and translates the effects of many known risk factors for the disease in atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques. Aiming to look into the elements that induce the development of either a vulnerable or stable atherosclerotic plaque , and considering that inflammation<symptom> has a central role in the progression of lesions<symptom> , we analyzed the expression of genes involved in the ACE/TLR4/PTGS2 signaling in carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Patients with internal carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy at Verona University Hospital were included in this study. A total of 71 patients was considered for gene expression analysis ( 29 atherothrombotic stroke patients and 42 asymptomatic patients). Total RNA was extracted from the excised plaques and expression of PTGS2 , ACE , TLR4 , PTGER4 , PTGER3 , EPRAP and ACSL4 genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. The correlation between the pair of genes was studied by Spearman coefficient. From the analyzed genes , we did not observe any individual difference in gene expression but the network of co-expressed genes suggests a different activation of pathways in the two groups of plaques.
