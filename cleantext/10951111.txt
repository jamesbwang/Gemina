  Analyze the percutaneous fixation technique for scaphoid fractures in the waist of the scaphoid and the proximal pole , and demonstrate its result. A retrospective cross-cohort study conducted from January 2005 to April 2015 , aiming at the consolidation time , epidemiological profile , level of function , return to work , and complications. Twenty-eight patients were selected , with a mean of eight weeks of follow-up. They presented a mean age of 30.5 years , male prevalence ( 25 patients; 89.2 %) , and no differences between dominant and non-dominant sides. The mean time from diagnosis was 4.16 weeks , but in three cases of fibrous union , the pre-operative period was over one year. The most frequent mechanism of injury was a fall on the outstretched hand , in 22 cases ( 78.5 %). Of all fractures , 24 cases were in the waist ( 85.8 %) and four were of the proximal pole ( 14.2 %); seven patients had displacement ( 25 %). There was consolidation in 26 cases ( 92.8 %) with a mean of 7.5 weeks after surgery. In cases of non-union , radiological follow-up was up to 24 weeks , requiring a new surgical intervention. Percutaneous fixation is an excellent , reproducible technique that allows early active mobility of the wrist with a low complication rate , although it requires a learning curve.
