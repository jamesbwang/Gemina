  A study was conducted to determine the effects of modified-atmosphere packaging ( MAP) treatments on fruit quality attributes and bioactive compounds of cornelian cherry fruits ( Cornus mas L.) harvested at two different maturity stages- maturity ( M): M-1 , skin red color < 10 %; M-2 , skin red color > 90 %- throughout the shelf life. Fruits were stored at 0 ± 0.5 °C and 90 ± 5 % relative humidity ( RH) for 30 days , and then kept at 22 ± 0.5 °C and 80 ± 5 % RH over 3 days for shelf life. In the measurements performed at harvest , MS-2 fruits had significantly greater respiration<symptom> rate , soluble solids content , acidity , anthocyanin , flavonoids , and phenolics and significantly lower ethylene productions , firmness , L It was concluded that the cornelian cherry fruits harvested at MS-2 stage of maturity and preserved in MAP better maintained quality attributes throughout their shelf life. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
