  While cause-and-effect knowledge assembly models encoded in Biological Expression Language are able to support generation of mechanistic hypotheses , they are static and limited in their ability to encode temporality. Here , we present BEL2ABM , a software for producing continuous , dynamic , executable agent-based models from BEL templates. The tool has been developed in Java and NetLogo. Code , data and documentation are available under the Apache 2.0 License at https://github.com/pybel/bel2abm. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
