  In late September 2016 , the Americas became the first region in the world to have eliminated endemic transmission of measles<pathogen> virus<pathogen> Several other countries have also verified measles<pathogen> elimination , and countries in all six World Health Organization regions have adopted measles<pathogen> elimination goals. The public health strategies used to respond to measles<pathogen> outbreaks in elimination settings are thus becoming relevant to more countries. This review highlights the strategies used to limit measles<pathogen> spread in elimination settings: ( 1) assembly of an outbreak control committee; ( 2) isolation of measles<pathogen> cases while infectious; ( 3) exclusion and quarantining of individuals without evidence of immunity; ( 4) vaccination of susceptible individuals; ( 5) use of immunoglobulin to prevent measles<pathogen> in exposed susceptible high-risk persons; ( 6) and maintaining laboratory proficiency for confirmation of measles<pathogen>. Deciding on the extent of containment efforts should be based on the expected benefit of reactive interventions , balanced against the logistical challenges in implementing them.
