  Ovarian cancer ( OvCa) is the leading cause of gynecological cancer-related deaths and novel therapeutic strategies are required. Programmed cell death 1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) , which are key mediators of host immune tolerance , are associated with OvCa progression. Recent evidence indicates the importance of IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 for immune tolerance in OvCa. This study aimed to reveal the therapeutic potential of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS-1) , an endogenous inhibitor of the janus kinase ( JAK)- signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT) signaling pathway , for the treatment of OvCa. Immunohistochemical assessment revealed that OvCa patients with high intratumoral STAT1 activation exhibited poor prognosis compared with patients with low STAT1 activation ( P < 0.05). Stimulation of OVISE , OVTOKO , OV2944-HM-1 ( HM-1) and CT26 cell lines with IFN-γ induced STAT1 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression. Adenovirus-mediated SOCS-1 gene delivery ( AdSOCS-1) in HM-1 and CT26 cells in vitro potently inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and PD-L1 upregulation , similar to the addition of JAK inhibitor I , but failed to inhibit their proliferation. Notably , intratumoral injection of AdSOCS-1 , but not AdLacZ , significantly inhibited the tumor growth of HM-1 and CT26 cells subcutaneously transplanted in immunocompetent syngeneic mice. AdSOCS-1 reduced PD-L1 expression on tumors and restored the activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Moreover , the anti-tumor effect of AdSOCS-1 was significantly attenuated by PD-L1 Fc-fusion protein administration in vivo , suggesting that the effect of AdSOCS-1 is mainly attributable to enhancement of tumor immunity. This study highlights the potential clinical utility of SOCS-1 as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
