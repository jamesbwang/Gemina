  Cyclosporin A ( CsA) is a calcium antagonist and can enhance the efficacy of some protein drugs , but its mechanism remains unknown. In this study , MAP30 , a ribosome-inactivating protein reported to have apoptotic effects on cancer cells , was fused with S3 , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)- targeting peptide. In addition , CsA was used to investigate whether it can further promote the apoptotic effects of S3 fused MAP30 ( MAP30-S3). Our result showed that the internalization of FITC-labeled MAP30-S3 was increased significantly by S3 in HeLa cells. Unexpectedly , MAP30-S3 only showed a minor decrease in the viability of EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells , including HeLa , SMMC-7721 , and MGC803 ( IC50 > 5 μmol/l). However , 2 μmol/l CsA significantly increased the cytotoxicity of MAP30-S3 , especially for HeLa cells ( IC50 = 40.3 nmol/l). In comparison , CsA did not further decrease the cytotoxicity of MAP30-S3 on MRC-5 , an EGFR low-expressing cell line from normal lung tissue , indicating that CsA did not affect the cancer-targeting specificity of MAP30-S3. Our results also showed that CsA further increased the apoptotic activity of MAP30-S3 in HeLa cells. CsA could promote the endosomal escape of FITC-MAP30-S3 with a diffused pattern in the cytoplasm. Five endocytic inhibitors were used to investigate the cellular uptake mechanism of MAP30-S3 , and the results showed that the endosomal escape-enhancing effect of CsA on MAP30-S3 may be associated with the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathways. Our study suggested that CsA could be a novel endosomal escape enhancer to potentiate the intracellular release of anticancer protein drugs , resulting in their improved therapeutic efficacy.
