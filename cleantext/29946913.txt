  The combination chemotherapy regimens of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( nab-p + G) and FOLFIRINOX ( FFX) have each demonstrated improved survival compared with gemcitabine monotherapy in clinical trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer; however , limited comparative data exist. The objective of this study was to compare patient characteristics and clinical outcomes including time to treatment failure and overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy in the community. We conducted a retrospective , multi-site , observational cohort study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving first-line nab-p + G , FFX , or gemcitabine monotherapy between April 2013 and October 2015 , using data from the iKnowMed electronic health record database. Patients on clinical trials or with other cancer diagnoses were excluded. Time to treatment failure and overall survival were assessed by Kaplan-Meier methods. Four hundred and eighty-six patients met selection criteria , 255 nab-p + G , 159 FFX , and 72 gemcitabine patients. Median age was 61 , 68 , and 73 years for FFX , nab-p + G , and gemcitabine patients , respectively ( p < 0.01 for nab-p + G vs. FFX). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 was 91 % for FFX , 77 % for nab-p + G , and 68 % for gemcitabine patients ( p < 0.01 for nab-p + G vs. FFX). For the nab-p + G vs. FFX cohorts , respectively , time to treatment failure was 3.7 vs. 4.3 months ( log-rank p = 0.25); and OS was 9.8 vs. 11.4 months ( log-rank p = 0.38). Among patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 , time to treatment failure was 4.2 vs. 4.3 months ( log-rank p = 0.47); and overall survival was 12.1 vs 11.4 months ( log-rank p = 0.68). The nab-p + G patients were older and had worse performance status than FFX patients. Time to treatment failure and overall survival were not observed to be significantly different in first-line nab-p + G and FFX patients. Results were similar after stratifying by performance status.
