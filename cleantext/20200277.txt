  Multidrug resistant ( MDR) bacterial pathogens are a serious problem of increasing importance facing the medical community. MDR bacteria typically infect the most immunologically vulnerable: patients in intensive care units , patients with extensive comorbidities , oncology patients , hemodialysis patients , and other immune suppressed individuals are likely to fall victim to these pathogens. One promising novel approach to treatment of MDR bacteria is immuno-adjuvant therapy to boost patient immunity. Success with this strategy would have the major benefit of providing protection against a number of MDR pathogens. This study had two main objectives. First , immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with sepsis<disease> associated with MDR bacteria was performed to examine for findings indicative of immunosuppression. Second , the ability of three immuno-adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action to reverse CD4 and CD8 T cell dysfunction , a pathophysiological hallmark of sepsis<disease> , was evaluated. Septic patients with MDR bacteria had increased expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 and decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression compared to non-septic patients. All three immuno-adjuvants , IL-7 , anti-PD-L1 , and OX-40L , increased T cell production of IFN-γ in a subset of septic patients with MDR bacteria: IL-7 was most efficacious. There was a strong trend toward increased mortality in patients whose T cells failed to increase IFN-γ production in response to the three treatments. Immuno-adjuvant therapy reversed T cell dysfunction , a key pathophysiological mechanism in septic patients with MDR bacteria.
