  To degrade the residual penicillin G in penicillin mycelial dreg ( PMD) , thermal treatment was used as a pretreatment for practical disposal. Given that the characteristics of treated-PMD are n't adequately clear , a lab-scale experiment was conducted to verify its safety assessment for land application under the following points: ( i) variation of penicillin G residue ( ii) maturity of organic matter ( OM) ( iii) phytotoxicity ( iv) abundance of antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs). A high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( HT-qPCR) method was used to perform an overall investigation of soil ARGs. The results show that heat treatment effectively degrades 98 % of penicillin in PMD within 120 min. After thermal treatment , the treated-PMD was applied to soil. The original penicillin level was considerably lower and completely degraded within 4 days. Variation of germination index ( GI) implied that the created phytotoxicity was significantly reduced. Furthermore , compared with PMD , the addition of treated-PMD did n't cause enrichment of soil ARGs in diversity and abundance. Therefore , heat treatment can be considered as an effective pretreatment for PMD practical application.
