  Many intercellular signals are synthesised as transmembrane precursors that are released by proteolytic cleavage ( ` shedding ') from the cell surface. ADAM17 , a membrane-tethered metalloprotease , is the primary shedding enzyme responsible for the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ± and several EGF receptor ligands. ADAM17 exists in complex with the rhomboid-like iRhom proteins , which act as cofactors that regulate ADAM17 substrate shedding. Here we report that the poorly characterised FERM domain-containing protein FRMD8 is a new component of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex. FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms and is necessary to stabilise iRhoms and ADAM17 at the cell surface. In the absence of FRMD8 , iRhom2 and ADAM17 are degraded via the endolysosomal pathway , resulting in the reduction of ADAM17-mediated shedding. We have confirmed the pathophysiological significance of FRMD8 in iPSC-derived human macrophages and mouse tissues , thus demonstrating its role in the regulated release of multiple cytokine and growth factor signals.
