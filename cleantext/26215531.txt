  Fecal calprotectin ( FC) has drawn attention as a biomarker in the evaluation of Crohn 's disease ( CD). However , few reports have provided a detailed examination of the relationship between small-bowel CD lesions<symptom> and FC levels. The present study aimed to examine the entire small bowel using double-balloon endoscopy ( DBE) and to determine the relationship between the endoscopic activity in small-bowel CD and FC levels. Twenty small-bowel CD patients , who underwent DBE , were prospectively enrolled. Endoscopic evaluation was based on the simple endoscopic score for CD , with the small bowel divided into four regions. This score was defined as the double-balloon endoscopic score for CD ( DES-CD). Furthermore , to focus on mucosal membrane damage , we used the partial DES-CD ( pDES-CD) , in which presence of stenosis was excluded from DES-CD. DES-CD revealed a correlation with FC ( Î³ = 0.691 ,
