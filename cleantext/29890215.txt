  Children in foster care suffer with serious illness at end of life. However , the relationship between prior trauma exposure and serious illness has received little empirical attention. The objectives were to examine the prevalence and type of trauma exposure , and investigate the relationship between prior trauma and serious illness among foster children at end of life. We used national longitudinal foster care data. We included children who were less than 18 years with residence in the United States. Serious illness ( i.e. , physical health , mental/behavioral health , developmental disabilities) was measured via the foster care files. Three measures of prior trauma exposure ( i.e. , maltreatment , drug/alcohol exposure , psychosocial stressors) were created. Using multivariate logistic regressions , we evaluated the influence of prior trauma on serious illness at end of life , while controlling for demographic , geographic , and foster care support characteristics. Sixty-eight percent of children experienced maltreatment , 28 % exposure to parental drug/alcohol misuse , and 39 % psychosocial stressors prior to entering foster care. Maltreatment was positively associated with physical health and developmental disabilities , while parental drug/alcohol exposure was inversely related to developmental disabilities. Psychosocial stressors contributed to the prediction of poor physical , mental , and developmental health. These findings suggest that trauma-informed end-of-life care may be a critical need among children in foster care with serious illness. Future directions are discussed , including collaboration between end-of-life clinicians and social service workers and the importance of future research to understand and improve the quality of health at end of life for this underserved population.
