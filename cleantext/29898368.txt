  GalNAc conjugation is emerging as a dominant strategy for delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides to hepatocytes. The structure and valency of the GalNAc ligand contributes to the potency of the conjugates. Here we present a panel of multivalent GalNAc variants using two different synthetic strategies. Specifically , we present a novel conjugate based on a support-bound trivalent GalNAc cluster , and four others using a GalNAc phosphoramidite monomer that was readily assembled into tri- or tetravalent designs during solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. We compared these compounds to a clinically used trivalent GalNAc cluster both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro , cluster-based and phosphoramidite-based scaffolds show a similar rate of internalization in primary hepatocytes , with membrane binding observed as early as 5 min. All tested compounds provided potent , dose-dependent silencing , with 2-4 % of injected dose recoverable from liver after 1 week. The two preassembled trivalent GalNAc clusters showed higher tissue accumulation and gene silencing relative to di- , tri- , or tetravalent GalNAc conjugates assembled via phosphoramidite chemistry.
