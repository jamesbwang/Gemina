  Trigeminal neuralgia ( TN) is a severe form of chronic facial neuropathic pain. Increasing interest in the neuroimaging of pain has highlighted changes in the root entry zone in TN , but also group level CNS grey and white matter abnormalities. Group differences in neuroimaging data are frequently evaluated with univariate statistics , however this approach is limited because it is based on single , or clusters of , voxels. In contrast , multivariate pattern analyses consider all the model 's neuroanatomical features to capture a specific distributed spatial pattern. This approach has potential use as a prediction tool at the individual level. We hypothesized that a multivariate pattern classification method can distinguish specific patterns of abnormal white matter connectivity of classic TN from healthy controls ( HC). Diffusion-weighted scans in 23 right-sided TN and matched controls were processed to extract whole brain inter-regional streamlines. We used a linear support vector machine ( SVM) algorithm to differentiate inter-regional normalized streamline count ( NSC) between TN and HC. This algorithm successfully differentiated between TN and HC with an accuracy of 88 %. The structural pattern highlighted white matter connectivity of regions that subserve sensory , affective and cognitive dimensions of pain , including insula , precuneus , inferior and superior parietal lobules , inferior and medial orbital frontal gyri. NSCs were associated with longer pain duration and white matter metric abnormality between the connections. This study demonstrates that machine-learning algorithms can detect characteristic patterns of structural alterations in TN , and highlights the role of structural brain imaging for identification of neuroanatomical features associated with neuropathic pain disorders.
