Additionally , SLE is one of the most variable diseases in its epidemiology and etiology with heterogenous types of immune dysfunction. Since the word ` lupus ' has first appeared in the literature in the Middle Ages , clinical/pathological knowledges have massively accumulated that contributed to the establishments and improvements of classification criteria , therapeutic agents or assessments of disease activity. Along with them , the survival rate of patients with SLE has dramatically improved.
