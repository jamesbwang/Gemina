  A quantitative assay using high-performance thin-layer chromatography ( HPTLC) was developed to investigate bile salt hydrolase ( BSH) activity in Pediococcus<pathogen> pentosaceus<pathogen> LAB6 and Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> LAB12 probiotic bacteria isolated from Malaysian fermented food. Lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) were cultured in de Man Rogosa and Sharpe ( MRS) broth containing 1 mmol/L of sodium-based glyco- and tauro-conjugated bile salts for 24 h. The cultures were centrifuged and the resultant cell free supernatant was subjected to chromatographic separation on a HPTLC plate. Conjugated bile salts were quantified by densitometric scans at 550 nm and results were compared to digital image analysis of chromatographic plates after derivatisation with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid. Standard curves for bile salts determination with both methods show good linearity with high coefficient of determination ( R
