  Runt-related transcription factor 3 ( RUNX3) exerts a tumor suppressor gene associated with gastric and other cancers , including glioma. However , how its anti-tumor mechanism in functions glioma is unclear. We assayed expression of RUNX3 with a tissue microarray ( TMA) , frozen cancer tissues and malignant glioma cell lines using immunohistochemistry , qRT-PCR and Western bolt analysis. Cell proliferation , invasion , cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were also examined to confirm the effect of RUNX3 medicated malignant phenotype. TOP/FOP experiment was used to detect the β-catenin/Tcf -4 transcription activity by RUNX3. Enforced RUNX3 expression inhibited proliferation and invasion , induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo , Bim siRNA partically reversed the effect of RUNX3-induced apoptosis in LN229 and U87 cells , suggesting a dependent role of Bim-caspase pathway. Moreover , Mechanism investigations revealed that restoration of RUNX3 suppressed β-catenin/Tcf -4 transcription activity. RUNX3 plays a pivotal role in glioma initiation and progression as a tumor suppressor via attenuation of Wnt signaling , highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target for glioma.
