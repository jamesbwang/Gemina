  Brominated flame retardants are used in consumer goods to increase product resistance to fire and/or high temperatures. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs) are the most commonly employed class of brominated flame retardants because they are inexpensive and can effectively prevent flame from spreading. PBDEs are persistent , can bioaccumulate , are transported over long distances , and display toxicity. However , their toxic mechanisms of action have not been well established. Because mitochondria are recognized as the main energy-producing cell organelle and play a vital role in cellular function maintenance , here we apply mitochondria as an experimental model to evaluate the toxic effects of the PBDE congener BDE-153 ( Hexa-BDE) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 25 Î¼M. We also assess BDE-153 cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells in order to elucidate its mechanisms of toxicity. Exposure to BDE-153 affects isolated mitochondria: this congener can interact with the mitochondrial membrane , to dissipate the membrane potential and to induce significant ATP depletion. Furthermore , BDE-153 can diminish MTT reduction and cell proliferation and can interfere in cell cycle , as evaluated in cell cultures. These cytotoxic effects are related to mitochondrial dysfunction due to mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and reactive oxygen species accumulation. These effects result in apoptotic cell death , as demonstrated by phosphatidylserine maintenance on the cell membrane external surface , nuclear condensation and fragmentation , and presence of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and Apoptosis-inducing Factor ( AIF) plus caspase 3 activation in the cytosol. Together , our results show PBDEs can induce cytotoxicity , reinforcing the idea that these compounds pose a risk to the exposed population.
