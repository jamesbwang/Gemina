  Monoterpene-glycosides are important aroma precursors that , undergo hydrolysis , confer intense floral notes to the wines. Therefore , the knowledge of the nature of the sugar residues and the structure of these molecules is of great interest. In present study , liquid chromatography ( LC) separation coupled with different mass spectrometry ( MS) experiments for the characterization of these compounds were explored. The LC parameters were tuned to optimize the resolution between the analytes present in grape sample extracts. Twenty principal peaks with a relative abundance > 1 % were selected and divided in 4 classes characterized by different molecular weight. In general , positive ionization of the studied compounds displayed the ( M + NH
