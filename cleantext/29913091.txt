  Viruses<pathogen> that infect bacteria , or bacteriophages , are among the most abundant entities in the gut microbiome. However , their role and the mechanisms by which they infect bacteria in the intestinal tract remain poorly understood. We recently reported that intestinal bacteria are an evolutionary force , driving the expansion of the bacteriophage host range by boosting the genetic variability of these viruses. Here , we expand these observations by studying antagonistic bacteriophage-bacteria coevolution dynamics and revealing that bacterial genetic variability is also increased under the pressure of bacteriophage predation. We propose a model showing how the expansion of bacteriophage-bacteria infection networks is relative to the opportunities for coevolution encountered in the intestinal tract. Our data suggest that predator-prey dynamics are perpetuated and differentiated in parallel , to generate and maintain intestinal microbial diversity and equilibrium.
