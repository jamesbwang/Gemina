  Rh ( III)- catalyzed enaminone-directed C-H coupling with α-diazo-α-phosphonoacetate has been used for the identification of fluoride-mediated dephosphonation C-C coupling reactivity for the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-1-naphthoates. Intermolecular C-C coupling of α-phosphonoacetate and benzaldehyde for ( E)- selective α,β-unsaturated ester synthesis has also been achieved.
