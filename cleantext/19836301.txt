  The purpose of this study was to examine the literature regarding the natural history and rehabilitative outcomes of sensorineural hearing loss from congenital cytomegalovirus infections. A systematic search was performed in PubMed , PsychINFO , CINAHL , and Web of Science to identify peer-reviewed research. Eligible studies were those containing original peer-reviewed research in English addressing either the natural history or rehabilitative outcomes of sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL) in congenital cytomegalovirus ( cCMV). Two investigators independently reviewed all articles and extracted data. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale. Thirty-six articles were reviewed. Universal screening identifies 0.2 to 1 % of newborns with cCMV infection. SNHL ranged from 8 to 32 % of infants and was more prevalent in symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases. Nine to 68 % of hearing loss occurs in a late or delayed fashion. In 7 to 71 % of cases hearing loss is progressive. Cochlear implantation ( CI) is a viable option for patients with cCMV associated hearing loss and leads to improvements in hearing and language. There is limited literature comparing rehabilitation outcomes in cCMV and non-cCMV CI recipients. Late onset and progressive hearing loss is seen in children who develop hearing loss from cCMV. Frequent audiologic follow-up is necessary considering the natural history of cCMV hearing loss. Universal screening should be pursued due to the number of asymptomatic children , at birth , who develop late onset/delayed hearing loss. CI is an effective means of improving speech and language in this population.
