  The genome exerts its functions through interactions with proteins. Hence , comprehensive identification of protein-occupied sites by genomic footprinting is critical to an in-depth understanding of genome functions. This unit describes the protocol of dimethyl sulfate-sequencing ( DMS-seq). DMS is an alkylating reagent that methylates guanine and adenine in double-stranded DNA. DMS added to the culture medium readily enters the cell and methylates its DNA throughout the genome except for the regions bound by proteins , thereby obviating the need for nuclear isolation in genomic footprinting. Polyamine/AP-endonuclease treatment of DNA isolated from DMS-treated cells induces cleavages at the methylated sites. Deep sequencing of these fragments identifies protein-bound sites as peaks of protected fragments or troughs of cleavage sites. Furthermore , DMS displays an unexpected preference to nucleosome centers , enabling their direct detection without genetic manipulation. Therefore , DMS-seq provides a unique method for non-targeted profiling of in vivo protein-DNA interactions. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
