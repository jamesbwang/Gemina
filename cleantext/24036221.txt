  The relative significance of indicators and determinants of health is important for local public health workers and planners. Of similar importance is a method for combining and evaluating such markers. We used a recently developed index , the Urban Health Index ( UHI) , to examine the impact of environmental variables on the overall health of cities. We used the UHI to rank 57 of the world & rsquo; s largest cities ( based on population size) in low- and middle-income countries. We examined nine variables in various combinations that were available from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in these countries. When arranged in ascending order , the distribution of UHIs follows the previously described pattern of gradual linear increase , with departures at each tail. The rank order of cities did not change materially with the omission of variables about women & rsquo; s health knowledge or childhood vaccinations. Omission of environmental variables ( a central water supply piped into homes , improved sanitation , and indoor solid fuel use) altered the rank order considerably. The data suggest that environmental indicators , measures of key household level risk to health , may play a vital role in the overall health of urban communities.
