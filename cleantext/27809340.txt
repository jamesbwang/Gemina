  Cyanobacteria are a well-known source of bioproducts which renders culturable strains a valuable resource for biotechnology purposes. We describe here the establishment of a cyanobacterial culture collection ( CC) and present the first version of the strain catalog and its online database ( http://lege.ciimar.up.pt/). The LEGE<symptom> CC holds 386 strains , mainly collected in coastal ( 48 %) , estuarine ( 11 %) , and fresh ( 34 %) water bodies , for the most part from Portugal ( 84 %). By following the most recent taxonomic classification , LEGE<symptom> CC strains were classified into at least 46 genera from six orders ( 41 % belong to the Synechococcales) , several of them are unique among the phylogenetic diversity of the cyanobacteria. For all strains , primary data were obtained and secondary data were surveyed and reviewed , which can be reached through the strain sheets either in the catalog or in the online database. An overview on the notable biodiversity of LEGE<symptom> CC strains is showcased , including a searchable phylogenetic tree and images for all strains. With this work , 80 % of the LEGE<symptom> CC strains have now their 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in GenBank. Also , based in primary data , it is demonstrated that several LEGE<symptom> CC strains are a promising source of extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS). Through a review of previously published data , it is exposed that LEGE<symptom> CC strains have the potential or actual capacity to produce a variety of biotechnologically interesting compounds , including common cyanotoxins or unprecedented bioactive molecules. Phylogenetic diversity of LEGE<symptom> CC strains does not entirely reflect chemodiversity. Further bioprospecting should , therefore , account for strain specificity of the valuable cyanobacterial holdings of LEGE<symptom> CC.
