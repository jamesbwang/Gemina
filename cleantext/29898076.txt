  A 4.5-year follow-up study was conducted to characterize baseline verbal episodic memory ( VEM) and its behavior and to assess the effects of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS) on this domain. Twenty-nine patients with RRMS underwent two neuropsychological assessments performed an average of 4.5 years apart. Twenty-six control participants underwent a single neuropsychological assessment. A significance level of p < 0.005 was adopted to denote a significant difference between the groups on the Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon paired statistical analyses. No statistical difference was found in the results of the VEM tests between the first and second neuropsychological assessments of the patients. However , a statistical difference was evident between the patient and control groups in the results of the VEM tests. The patient group showed changes in the VEM relative to the control group. After approximately 4.5 years of disease , the patient performance on the VEM stabilized or improved.
