  This study was conducted to explore the feasibility and safety of postoperative chest drainage with a Foley catheter for lung cancer patients undergoing a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS) lobectomy. Data from lung cancer patients who underwent a VATS lobectomy with insertion of a catheter ( Foley catheter or 28-F chest tube) were analysed. A total of 441 patients were included preoperatively for participation , with 208 patients in the Foley catheter group and 233 in the 28-F group. In the Foley catheter group , a shorter mean number of days was required until chest tube removal after lobectomy ( 2.6 ± 1.3 vs. 3.5 ± 2.0 d , P < 0.001) and postoperative length of stay was shorter ( 3.8 ± 2.5 vs. 5.2 ± 4.1 d , P < 0.001); The 28-F group had a higher average VAS score than did the Foley catheter group at 6 h ( P = 0.025) , and 48 h ( P < 0.001) after VATS lobectomy as well as at 6 h , 24 h , 48 h , 72 h , 30 days and 90 days after chest tube removal ( P < 0.001). Regarding postoperative pulmonary complications ( PPCs) and chest tube removal-related complications , the rate of PPCs was not found to be significant , and a significantly higher proportion of disordered wound<disease> healing at the drainage site was observed in the 28-F group ( 5.8 % , 12/208 vs. 11.6 % , 27/233; P = 0.043). The study indicated that placement of Foley catheter vs. 28-F chest tube was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain , with shorter mean days until chest tube removal after lobectomy , shorter in-hospital stay , and a smaller proportion of disordered wound<disease> healing at the drainage site. These results indicate the feasibility and safety of postoperative chest drainage with a Foley catheter for lung cancer patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. ChiCTR1800014816.
