  A new robotic stapler for the da Vinci Xi From December 2015 to December 2017 , 25 patients underwent anterior rectal resection for cancer with robotic EndoWrist staplers ( EndoWrist group). Using a case-control method , we compared the results with those of a similar group of patients treated with the same system and a traditional laparoscopic endostapler , controlled by a bedside assistant ( Control group). No conversions to laparoscopy or laparotomy were observed , in either group. The mean number of charges was 2.1 ± 0.2 in the EndoWrist group versus 2.7 ± 0.7 in the Control group ( P = .0004). The other perioperative results were comparable. During follow-up , the incidence of anastomotic fistula<disease> in a contrast enema study was higher in the Control group , although the difference was not statistically significant ( two leaks versus two leaks in EndoWrist group; P = .8). The interval between rectal resection and stoma closure was shorter in the EndoWrist group ( 3.4 ± 2.5 versus 4.2 ± 2.9 months in the Control group; P = .2) , although the difference was not significant. Our experience suggests that the new robotic staplers simplify transection , which could reduce the average number of stapler firings used during rectal resection and could decrease the incidence of anastomotic leakage. These findings require confirmation in larger studies.
