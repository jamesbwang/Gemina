  Phosphorylation and lysine ( K)- acetylation are dynamic post-translational modifications of proteins. Previous proteomic studies have identified over 170,000 phosphorylation sites , and 15,000 K-acetylation sites in mammals. We recently reported that the inner medullary collecting duct ( IMCD) , which functions in the regulation of water-reabsorption , via the actions of vasopressin , expresses many of the enzymes that can modulated K-acetylation. The purpose of this study was to determine the K-acetylated or phosphorylated proteins expressed in IMCD cells. Second we questioned whether vasopressin V2 receptor activation significantly affects the IMCD acetylome or phosphoproteome? K-acetylated or serine- , threonine- , or tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides were identified from native rat IMCDs using proteomic analysis with four different enzymes ( trypsin , chymotrypsin , ASP-N , or Glu-C) to generate a high resolution proteome. K-acetylation was identified in 431 unique proteins , and 64 % of the K-acetylated sites were novel. The acetylated proteins were expressed in all compartments of the cell , and were enriched in pathways including glycolysis , and vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption. In the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway , 8 proteins were acetylated including the novel identification of the basolateral water channel , AQP3 acetylated at K282. 215 proteins were phosphorylated in this IMCD cohort , including AQP2 peptides that were phosphorylated at 4 serines: 256 , 261 , 264 , and 269. Acute dDAVP did not significantly affect the IMCD acetylome; however it did significantly affect previously known vasopressin-regulated phosphorylation sites. In conclusion , presence of K-acetylated proteins involved in metabolism , ion and water transport in the IMCD points to multiple roles of K-acetylation beyond its canonical role in transcriptional regulation.
