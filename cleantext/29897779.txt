  The Pd-catalyzed regioselective C-H activation/arylation ,/ iodination , and/acetoxylation reactions of 4-arylpyrimidines using aryl iodides , N-iodosuccinimide , and ( diacetoxyiodo) benzene respectively as coupling partners are described. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and Sonogashira reactions of the resulting aryl iodides are demonstrated. The scalability of the C-H activation/functionalization starting with readily accessible 4-aryl pyrimidines is also reported.
