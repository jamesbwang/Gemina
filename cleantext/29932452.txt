  Zirconium complexes stabilized by amine-bridged bis ( phenolato) ligands showed good activity and chemo-selectivity in catalyzing intermolecular hydrophosphination of C-C multiple bonds with primary phosphines under mild conditions. A broad range of alkenes and alkynes underwent a mono-addition reaction with phenylphosphine , which generated secondary phosphines in 39-99 % yields and > 7: 1 selectivity ( over double hydrophosphination).
