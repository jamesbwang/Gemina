  An Euler-Lagrange CFD model is applied to a full-scale , biogas-mixed anaerobic digester to improve mixing efficiency and improve overall performance. Two quantitative mixing criteria previously adopted in anaerobic digestion ( viz. , uniformity index and dead volume) are critically assessed for the first time. A novel qualitative method is introduced to clarify the output of the quantitative methods. The first-ever quantitative assessment of mixing quality in full-scale , biogas-mixed anaerobic digestion is then proposed , and a strategy to improve mixing , involving the combined use of concentric nozzle manifolds at the base of the digester , is evaluated.
