  For enhanced anti-cancer performance , human serum albumin fragments ( HSAFs) nanoparticles ( NPs) were developed as paclitaxel ( PTX) carrier in this paper. Human albumins were broken into fragments via degradation and crosslinked by genipin to form HSAF NPs for better biocompatibility , improved PTX drug loading and sustained drug release. Compared with crosslinked human serum albumin NPs , the HSAF-NPs showed relative smaller particle size , higher drug loading , and improved sustained release. Cellular and animal results both indicated that the PTX encapsulated HSAF-NPs have shown good anti-cancer performance. And the anticancer results confirmed that NPs with fast cellular internalization showed better tumor inhibition. These findings will not only provide a safe and robust drug delivery NP platform for cancer therapy , but also offer fundamental information for the optimal design of albumin based NPs.
