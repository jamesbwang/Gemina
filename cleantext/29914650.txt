  Hydrogels are 3D hydrophilic polymer networks that absorb and hold huge amounts of water. Although hydrogels have traditionally been synthesized using chemical and physical methods , rapid developments in enzyme technology that , like chemical-based methods , enable the formation of stable covalent bonds are fast emerging as alternative ` green catalyst ' tools. Enzymes show great potential for the synthesis of complex multifunctional wound<disease> dressing hydrogels ( WDHs) ex situ and in situ as well as in acting as interactive molecules to promote the wound<disease> healing process. This review presents advances in the use of enzymes to synthesize WDHs and their fascinating role as bioactive molecules promoting the wound<disease> healing process , preventing microbial infection , and providing in situ , in-built infection-detection and diagnostic systems.
