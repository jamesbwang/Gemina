  The safety of vaccines , access to health care , the level of community 's knowledge and the attention of physicians play a critical role in the rate of adult vaccination. This study aims to determine the immunization rate of pneumococcal , influenza<disease> and tetanus<disease> vaccines among the patients and their knowledge and attitudes in the hospital. The study is a cross-sectional point prevalence survey. The patients who agreed to participate in the study were interviewed using a questionnaire. Patients ' gender , occupation , educational status , income level and risk factors ( immunosuppressed and over 65 years old) were compared with the knowledge and attitudes about vaccinations. Of the 251 participants , 51.4 % were female and 48.6 % were male. The self-reported vaccination rate was 3.5 % for pneumococcal , 8.6 % for influenza<disease> and 26.6 % for tetanus<disease> Most of the patients have knowledge about influenza<disease> vaccination ( 90.3 %). Patients with the high education level have significantly higher knowlege about tetanus<disease> vaccination and higher rate of tetanus<disease> vaccine compared to those with low education level ( p = 0.04; p = 0.006). It was found that those with higher income levels had the more pneumococcal vaccination , more knowledge on tetanus<disease> vaccination , and more attitude that tetanus<disease> vaccine is necessary compared to those with lower income level ( p < 0.05). Patients without risk factors have a higher rate of tetanus<disease> vaccination compared to those with risk factors ( p < 0.001). It was inferred that the high level of education and income have a positive effect on the patients vaccination rates and their knowledge and attitude.
