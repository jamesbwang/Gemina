  Previous studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of globulin ( GLB) , albumin ( ALB) , the ALB/GLB ratio ( AGR) , body mass index ( BMI) , hemoglobin ( Hb) , and prognostic nutritional index ( PNI) in breast cancer. The underlying mechanism has been investigated by examining the impact of nutritional parameters on T cells , natural killer cells , and dendritic cells , but little is known about their effect on checkpoint molecules. Here , we investigated the correlation of mRNA expression of programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) , cluster of differentiation 28 ( CD28) , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 ( CTLA-4) , and cluster of differentiation 25 ( CD25) with AGR , ALB , GLB , total protein , pre-ALB , Hb , BMI , and PNI in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients. One hundred and three patients and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to test relative mRNA expression. The results indicated that the mRNA levels of PD-1 and CD25 were 5.2- and 3.3-fold higher in patients with low AGR than in those with high AGR ( These results suggest that AGR is negatively correlated with PD-1 and CD25 mRNA levels , while GLB is positively associated with PD-1 mRNA levels. Nutritional status in breast cancer patients may influence the PD-1 pathway and have implications for the optimization of cancer therapy.
