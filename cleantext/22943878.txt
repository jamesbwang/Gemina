  Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in females worldwide. It has been demonstrated that microRNAs ( miRs) serve important roles in the occurrence and development of various types of cancer , including cervical cancer. The results of the present study revealed that miR-197 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-197 expression significantly inhibited cell viability and invasion of cervical cancer. Additionally , forkhead box M1 ( FOXM1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-197. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that FOXM1 was a potential target gene of miR-197. Luciferase reporter assay , reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis demonstrated that miR-197 decreased FOXM1 expression through direct binding to its 3 '- untranslated region. Furthermore , the effects of FOXM1 underexpression were comparable with the effects induced by miR-197 overexpression in cervical cancer cells , suggesting that FOXM1 acted as a downstream effector in miR-197-mediated proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells. The results of the present study suggested that miR-197 inhibited growth and metastasis of cervical cancer by directly targeting FOXM1.
