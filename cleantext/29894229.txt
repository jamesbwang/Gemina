  Sensitive , specific , and fast analysis of nucleic acids ( NAs) is strongly needed in medicine , environmental science , biodefence , and agriculture for the study of bacterial contamination of food and beverages and genetically modified organisms. Electrochemistry offers accurate , simple , inexpensive , and robust tools for the development of such analytical platforms that can successfully compete with other approaches for NA detection. Here , electrode reactions of DNA , basic principles of electrochemical NA analysis , and their relevance for practical applications are reviewed and critically discussed.
