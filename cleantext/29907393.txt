  Successful implementation of mRNA gene therapy is facing many hurdles , for example poor expression levels of the exogenously delivered mRNA transcripts. Herein we describe the synthesis of various 3 '- modified RNA oligonucleotides , and we show that 3 '- modification drastically stabilizes these oligonucleotides in cell extracts. Modification of the 3 '- terminus of gaussia luciferase mRNA results in 3-fold increased and extended ( > 48 h) translation of the mRNA. Our findings suggest 3 '- modification of RNA-transcripts as a valid approach to increase expression levels for application in mRNA gene therapy.
