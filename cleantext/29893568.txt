  Nanoscale encoding denotes the creation of distinct electric and photonic properties within small , artificially defined regions by physical or chemical means. An encoded single nanostructure includes independent subcomponents as functional units that can also work as functional integrated nanosystems. These can be applied in high-resolution displays , detection systems , and even more complex devices. However , there is still no agreed-upon best platform satisfying all requirements. This paper demonstrates a competitive candidate based on defect engineering , that is , low energy focused e-beam-induced oxygen ion migration in a carbon-doped Al
