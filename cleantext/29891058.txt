  The presence of spasticity and pyramidal features is a hallmark of some of hereditary ataxias<symptom> , such as autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia<symptom> of Charlevoix-Saguenay , other primary spastic ataxias<symptom> , Friedreich ataxia<symptom> , or ataxia<symptom> with isolated vitamin E deficiency. Certain spastic paraplegias<symptom> , such as spastic paraplegia<symptom> 7 , may present as an ataxic phenotype and often share common pathophysiologic pathways with cerebellar ataxias<symptom>. Because of the rarity and genetic heterogeneity of these conditions , their molecular diagnosis remains challenging and time consuming. Herein we review the clinical , epidemiologic , and genetic features of the best-defined spastic ataxias<symptom> with a focus on autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia<symptom> of Charlevoix-Saguenay , one of the most frequent ataxias<symptom> worldwide , which presents with a unique early-onset spastic ataxia<symptom> phenotype. We briefly discuss other genetic and metabolic multisystem disorders where spastic ataxia<symptom> is a secondary feature. Emphasis is placed on their typical age of onset and key clinical and imaging features that enable discrimination between these
