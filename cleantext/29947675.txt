  The caddisfly genus Contulma Flint , 1969 , with 30 described species , is endemic to the Neotropics. In addition to the five species currently recorded from Brazil , a new species of Contulma is described and illustrated in this work. Contulma vascaina sp. n. is similar to C. sana Jardim and Nessimian , 2011 in prominent , slender and rod-like posterolateral lobe of segment IX , but the new species has a shorter posterolateral lobe , with long , spine-like seta apically. Contulma vascaina sp. n. can also be characterized by the presence of a large , hood-like sclerotized plate on the endothecal phallic membrane. The female genital structure is also described and illustrated.
