  The intestinal mucus layer plays an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oxyresveratrol ( OXY) , an antioxidant , on the stimulation of mucin production in human LS 174T goblet cells and the underlying mechanism thereof. OXY increased MUC2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. By performing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , we found that the expression of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase1 ( NaPRT1) in OXY-treated LS 174T cells was greatly increased compared with that in negative control cells. In addition , the NAD
