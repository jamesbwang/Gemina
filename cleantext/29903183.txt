  To explore the effects of exercise and resveratrol on retinol binding protein 4 ( RBP4) mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue , plasma RBP4 concentration and blood glucose and insulin sensitivity of aged obese rats. To establish elderly obese SD rat model , 6 aged rats of natural growth were selected normal group , 24 obese rats were randomly divided into four groups: obesity control group , exercise group , resveratrol group , exercise combined with resveratrol group. For Resveratrol treatment , each rat was fed 52. 5 mg/ ( kg d) , 5 times/week , continuous intervention for 8 weeks. After intervention , measured blood glucose , insulin sensitivity , visceral adipose tissue RBP4 mRNA expression ( qRT-PCR) , protein expression ( Western blot) and plasma RBP4 concentration ( ELISA). After 8week intervention , ( 1) RBP4 mRNA expression: The obesity group ( 2. 63 ± 0. 45) was higher than that of the normal group ( 2. 10 ± 0. 15) ( P < 0. 05). The resveratrol group ( 1. 84 ± 0. 33) , exercise group ( 1. 91 ± 0. 15) , and exercise combined with resveratrol group ( 2. 131 ± 0. 111) were lower than that of the obesity group ( P < 0. 05 , P < 0. 01). ( 2) RBP4 protein expression: The obesity group ( 1. 346 ± 0. 025) was higher than that of the normal group ( 1. 196 ± 0. 017) ( P < 0. 01). The exercise group ( 1. 025 ± 0. 006) was lower than that of the obesity group ( P < 0. 01) , The resveratrol group ( 0. 735 ± 0. 015) and exercise combined with resveratrol group ( 0. 701 ± 0. 018) were lower than that of the exercise group ( P < 0. 01). The exercise combined with resveratrol group was lower than that of resveratrol group ( P < 0. 05). ( 3) Plasma RBP4 concentration: The obesity group ( ( 16. 00 ± 1. 54) μg/L) was higher than that of the normal group ( ( 13. 02 ± 2. 20) μg/L) ( P < 0. 01). The exercise group ( ( 14. 76 ± 1. 56) μg/L) was lower than that of the obesity group , but the difference was not statistically significant. The resveratrol group ( ( 13. 59 ± 0. 07) μg/L) and exercise combined with resveratrol group ( ( 12. 98 ± 1. 69) μg/L) were lower than that of the obesity group ( P < 0. 05 , P < 0. 01). ( 4) Blood glucose: The obesity group ( ( 17. 93 ± 6. 09) mmol/L) was higher than that of the normal group ( ( 11. 64 ± 3. 57) mmol/L) ( P < 0. 01). The exercise group ( ( 13. 36 ± 1. 82) mmol/L) was lower than that of the obesity group ( P < 0. 05) , the resveratrol group ( ( 15. 24 ± 2. 19) mmol/L) and exercise combined with resveratrol group ( ( 13. 95 ± 2. 26) mmol/L) were lower than that of the obesity group , but the difference was not statistically significant ( P > 0. 05). ( 5) Insulin sensitivity: The obesity group ( 0. 37 ± 0. 02) was lower than that of the normal group ( 0. 39 ± 0. 02) ( P < 0. 05). The resveratrol group ( 0. 38 ± 0. 01) and the exercise group ( 0. 39 ± 0. 02) were higher than that of the obesity group , but the difference was not statistically significant , the exercise combined with resveratrol group ( 0. 39 ± 0. 15) was higher than that of the obesity group ( P < 0. 05). Above indexes ( except protein expression) were no significant difference between the each intervene groups ( P > 0. 05). RBP4 mRNA expression and protein expression in the visceral adipose tissue of aged obese rats , plasma RBP4 concentration and blood glucose were increased , and insulin sensitivity was decreased. Exercise and resveratrol could reduce the expression of RBP4 mRNA and protein expression and plasma RBP4 concentration. The simple exercise could significantly reduce the blood glucose and exercise combined with resveratrol could significantlyimprove insulin sensitivity. The decrease in protein expression , plasma RBP4 concentration and improve insulin sensitivity , exercise combined with resveratrol showed synergy.
