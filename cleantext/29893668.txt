  During surgery for ascending aortic dissection , the dissected ascending aorta itself has traditionally been rejected as a cannulation option. The purpose of this study is to prove that direct cannulation of the ascending aorta in patients operated for acute aortic dissection type A ( AADA) is at least as effective and safe as classic femoral cannulation. Between September 2008 and January 2015 , we operated on 117 patients with AADA through median sternotomy. Cannulation was accomplished in 32 cases ( 27 %) through the femoral artery ( group A) , and in 85 patients ( 73 %) through the dissected ascending aorta ( group B). Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest with bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was used in 108 patients ( 92 %). The mean time of circulatory arrest was 17 minutes ( range: 9-52 minutes). The 30-day mortality rate was 22 % ( 7 patients) in group A , and 18 % ( 15 patients) in group B ( P = not significant). Temporary neurologic dysfunction ( TND) including postoperative confusion<symptom> , delirium<symptom> , or agitation occurred in four patients ( 13 %) in group A , and four patients ( 5 %) in group B ( P = not significant). The incidence of permanent neurologic dysfunction ( stroke) was 9 % ( 3 patients) in group A and 3 % ( 3 patients) in group B. The direct cannulation of the ascending aorta is a safe alternative for patients with AADA , offering the opportunity for antegrade cerebral perfusion. It is easy to perform , reliable , and associated with acceptable early results.
