  Previous work on the straddle effect in contrast perception ( Foley , 2011; Graham & Wolfson , 2007; Wolfson & Graham , 2007 , 2009) has used visual patterns and observer tasks of the type known as spatially second-order. After adaptation of about 1 s to a grid of Gabor patches all at one contrast , a second-order test pattern composed of two different test contrasts can be easy or difficult to perceive correctly. When the two test contrasts are both a bit less ( or both a bit greater) than the adapt contrast , observers perform very well. However , when the two test contrasts straddle the adapt contrast ( i.e. , one of the test contrasts is greater than the adapt contrast and the other is less) , performance drops dramatically. To explain this drop in performance-the straddle effect-we have suggested a contrast-comparison process. We began to wonder: Are second-order patterns necessary for the straddle effect? Here we show that the answer is `` no ''. We demonstrate the straddle effect using spatially first-order visual patterns and several different observer tasks. We also see the effect of contrast normalization using first-order visual patterns here , analogous to our prior findings with second-order visual patterns. We did find one difference between first- and second-order tasks: Performance in the first-order tasks was slightly lower. This slightly lower performance may be due to slightly greater memory load. For many visual scenes , the important quantity in human contrast processing may not be monotonic with physical contrast but may be something more like the unsigned difference between current contrast and recent average contrast.
