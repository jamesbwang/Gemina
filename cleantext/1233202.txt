  Therapeutic doses of tedizolid phosphate , an oxazolidinone antibiotic , lack monoamine oxidase inhibition in vivo , potentially resulting in an improved safety profile versus other oxazolidinones. This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-period , 2-sequence , crossover , phase 1 study ( NCT01577459) assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic ( PK) interactions between tedizolid and pseudoephedrine. Eighteen healthy volunteers ( age: 18 ‚Åª 45 years) were block-randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences containing 2 treatment periods ( tedizolid phosphate or placebo once daily for 4 days; single dose of pseudoephedrine 60 mg on day 5) separated by a 2-day washout. Median time to maximum plasma concentration for tedizolid and pseudoephedrine ranged from 3 to 4 h , regardless of treatment coadministration. Steady-state tedizolid had no effect on the PK of pseudoephedrine; geometric mean ratio and 90 % confidence interval remained within the no-effect 0.8 to 1.25 boundaries. The maximum observed concentration of tedizolid decreased by approximately 14 % when pseudoephedrine was coadministered; no changes in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve or the minimum observed plasma concentration occurred. All adverse events ( AEs) were mild , and there were no serious AEs or study drug discontinuations. No meaningful PK interactions occurred between tedizolid and pseudoephedrine , and tedizolid was well tolerated when administered in conjunction with pseudoephedrine.
