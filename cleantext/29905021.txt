  The benefit of school-based influenza<disease> vaccination policy has not been fully addressed in Beijing. To evaluate the benefit of school-based influenza<disease> vaccination policy launched in Beijing. Using existing surveillance and immunization data , we developed a dynamic transmission model to assess the impact of influenza<disease> vaccination in school-going children. The outcome was defined as the averted number of medically attended influenza<disease> illnesses and the prevented disease fraction to all children aged 5-14 years for the 2013/14 , 2014/15 , and 2015/16 seasons. We estimated that during the three consecutive influenza<disease> seasons , the averted number of medically attended influenza<disease> illnesses among children aged 5-14 years was around 104 000 ( 95 % CI: 101 000-106 000) , 23 000 ( 95 % CI: 22 000-23 000) , and 21 000 ( 95 % CI: 21 000-22 000) , respectively. Corresponding prevented fractions to all children aged 5-14 years were 76.3 % , 38.5 % , and 43.9 %. In Beijing , school-based vaccinations reduced a substantial number of medically attended influenza<disease> illnesses despite seasonal variation in the prevented fraction. This is strong supportive evidence for the continuation of school-based vaccination programs to reduce the influenza<disease> burden in this age group.
