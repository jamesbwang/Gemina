  Perceived upright depends on three main factors: vision , graviception , and the internal representation of the long axis of the body. We assessed the relative contributions of these factors in individuals with sub-acute and chronic stroke and controls using a novel tool; the Oriented Character Recognition Test ( OCHART). We also considered whether individuals who displayed active pushing or had a history of pushing behaviours had different weightings than those with no signs of pushing. Three participants experienced a stroke 6 months prior: eight with a history of pushing. In total , 12 participants served as healthy aged-matched controls. Visual and graviceptive cues were dissociated by orienting the visual background left , right , or upright relative to the body , or by orienting the body left , right , or upright relative to gravity. A three-vector model was used to quantify the weightings of vision , graviception , and the body<symptom> to the perceptual upright. The control group showed weightings of 13 % vision , 25 % graviception , and 62 % body. Some individuals with stroke showed a similar pattern; others , particularly those with recent stroke , showed different patterns , for example , being unaffected by one of the three factors. The participant with active pushing behaviour displayed an ipsilesional perceptual bias ( > 30 Â°) and was not affected by visual cues to upright. The results of OCHART may be used to quantify the weightings of multisensory inputs in individuals post-stroke and may help characterize perceptual sources of pushing behaviours.
