  Malaria<disease> , despite being preventable and treatable , continues to be a major public health problem worldwide. The archipelago nation of Cape Verde is in a malaria<disease> pre-elimination phase with the highest potential to achieve the target goal of elimination in 2020. Nationwide malaria<disease> epidemiological data were obtained from the Cape Verde health information system that includes the individual malaria<disease> case notification system from all of the country 's health structures. Each case is reported to the surveillance service then to the National Malaria Control Programme , which allowed for compilation in the national malaria<disease> case database. The database was analysed to assess the origin of the malaria<disease> cases , and incidence was calculated from 2010 to 2016 by sex and age. The health centre , health district and month of diagnosis were evaluated , as well as the sex and the age of the patients , allowing a direct descriptive analysis of national data to provide an up-to-date malaria<disease> epidemiological profile of the country. Malaria<disease> cases were classified as imported or indigenous , and then , geographical analyses were performed using a unique Geographical National Code with Quantum Geographic Information System 2.16.2 software to map the cases by municipalities. The overall temporal evolution of cases was analysed to assess their monthly and yearly variations from 2010 to 2016. Malaria<disease> is unstable in Cape Verde , with inter-annual variation and the majority of infections occurring in adult males ( > 20 years). The indigenous cases are restricted to Santiago ( 96 %) and Boavista ( 4 %) , while imported cases were recorded in all the nine inhabited islands , originating from neighbouring countries with ongoing malaria<disease> transmission; from Lusophone countries ( 25 % from Angola , 25 % from Guinea-Bissau) , followed by the Republic of Senegal ( 12 %) and Equatorial Guinea ( 10 %). In 2010-2012 , more imported ( 93 cases) than indigenous cases ( 26 cases) were observed; conversely , in 2013 and 2014 , more indigenous cases ( 49) than imported cases ( 42) were reported. In 2015 there were 20 imported cases and only 7 indigenous cases. Finally , in 2016 , there were 47 indigenous cases and 28 imported cases. The mapping of cases by municipality and country of origin was possible with GIS analyses. While Cape Verde remains on track to achieve malaria<disease> elimination by 2020 owing to the reduction of the annual incidence to below 0.1 % , the country still records cases of indigenous and imported malaria<disease> However , the indigenous cases are exclusively confined to the Santiago and Boavista islands , while the imported cases recorded nationwide originate only from the African continent , mainly from adult men from the Lusophone countries. Cape Verde needs to target interventions to remove residual foci on Santiago and Boavista islands to reduce malaria<disease> lethality to zero and prevent its reintroduction from African countries via transmission across the archipelago. Cape Verde is a good example of local authority 's commitment to tackle malaria<disease> and work towards its elimination by strengthening the health and surveillance systems.
