  Pancreatic fistula/PF is the most frequent and feared complication after distal pancreatectomy/DP. However , the safest technique of pancreatic stump closure remains an ongoing debate. Here , we aimed to compare the safety of different pancreatic stump closure techniques for preventing PF during DP. We performed a PRISMA-based meta-analysis of all relevant studies that compared at least two techniques of stump closure during DP with regard to PF rates/PFR. We further performed a retrospective analysis of our institutional PFR in correlation with stump closure techniques. 8301 studies were initially identified. From these , ten randomized controlled trials/RCTs , eleven prospective and 59 retrospective studies were eligible. Stapler closure ( 26 % vs. 31 % , OR: 0.73 , p = 0.02) , combination of stapler and suture ( 30 % vs. 33 % , OR: 0.70 , p = 0.05) , or stump anastomosis ( 14 % vs. 28 % , OR: 0.51 , p = 0.02) were associated with lower PFR than suture closure alone. Spleen preservation/splenectomy , or laparoscopic/open DP , TachoSil ® , fibrin-like glue-application , or bioabsorbable-stapler-reinforcements ( Seamguard ®) did not influence PFR after DP. In contrast , autologous patches ( falciform ligament/seromuscular patches) resulted in lower PFR than no patch application ( 21.9 % vs. 25,8 % , OR: 0.60 , p = 0.006). In our institution , the major three techniques of stump closure resulted in comparable PFR ( suture: 27 % , stapler: 29 % , or combination: 24 %). However , selective suturing/clipping of the main pancreatic duct during pancreatic stump closure prevented severe PF ( p = 0.02). After DP , stapler closure , pancreatic anastomosis , or falciform/seromuscular patches lead to lower PFR than suture closure alone. However , the differences are rather small , and further RCTs are needed to test these effects. Selective closure of the main pancreatic duct during stump closure may prevent severe PF.
