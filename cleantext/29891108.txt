  The overexpression and mutation of platelet-derived growth factors ( PDGFs) and their receptors ( PDGFRs) are widespread in cancers and have been recognized as attractive oncologic targets with diverse therapeutic targets. Reports of the overexpression of genes , proteins and mutations of PDGFs/PDGFRs in gastric cancer and their associations with clinicopathological features , Western and Asian patients , as well as prognostic role have shown variable outcomes. This study sought to employ meta-analysis to evaluate PDGFs/PDGFRs status prognostic significance and their association with clinicopathological features of gastric cancer. A comprehensive search of PubMed database for studies that investigated the overexpression of mRNA/Protein and mutation of PDGFs/PDGFRs in gastric cancer of Western and Asian patients , their prognostic significance and association with clinicopathological characteristics in May , 2017 or earlier was carried out by two reviewers independently. Pooled odd ratios and hazard ratios at 95 % confidence intervals were estimated and summarized using fixed-effect and random-effect Mantel-Haenszel models and Inverse Variance models in Review Manager software version 5.3. Fourteen studies with 16 datasets of 1178 patients were included in meta-analysis. Fourteen studies of 1178 patients with 1446 cases and 7 studies of 1076 patients with 1280 cases were included in meta-analysis of clinicopathological and prognostic significance of high or positive PDGF/PDGFR status respectively. Odd ratio at 95 % confidence intervals for different groups of analysis are as follows: males versus females ( OR = 1.38 , 95 % CI: 1.04-1.83 , P PDGFs/PDGFRs status amongst gastric cancer patients plays a key role in clinical variables and nodal metastasis. These insights might be helpful in providing guidelines for diagnosis , molecular target therapy , and prognosis of gastric cancer.
