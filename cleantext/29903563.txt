  Ultrasonography ( US) is a noninvasive , nonionizing , inexpensive , and painless imaging tool proven to be a valuable diagnostic tool in soft tissue assessment that also shows promise for hard tissue evaluation in dentistry. US has been investigated for its capability to identify carious lesions<symptom> , tooth fractures or cracks , periodontal bony defects , maxillofacial fractures , and more. It has been used as a diagnostic aid in temporomandibular disorders , implant dentistry , and to measure muscle and soft tissue thickness. Unfortunately , the use of US in dentistry is still in its infancy; however , relevant research is promising.
