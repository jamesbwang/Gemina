  Monitoring real-time apoptosis in-vivo is an unmet need of neurodegeneration science , both in clinical and research settings. For patients , earlier diagnosis before the onset of symptoms provides a window of time in which to instigate treatment. For researchers , being able to objectively monitor the rates of underlying degenerative processes at a cellular level provides a biomarker with which to test novel therapeutics. The DARC ( Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells) project has developed a minimally invasive method using fluorescent annexin A5 to detect rates of apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells , the key pathological process in glaucoma. Numerous animal studies have used DARC to show efficacy of novel , pressure-independent treatment strategies in models of glaucoma and other conditions where retinal apoptosis is reported , including Alzheimer & rsquo; s disease. This may forge exciting new links in the clinical science of treating both cognitive and visual decline. Human trials are now underway , successfully demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the technique to differentiate patients with progressive neurodegeneration from healthy individuals. We review the current perspectives on retinal ganglion cell apoptosis , the way in which this can be imaged , and the exciting advantages that these future methods hold in store.
