  A palladium ( II)- catalyzed β,γ-aminohydroxylation reaction of nonconjugated alkenyl carbonyl compounds has been developed. This reaction utilizes a cleavable bidentate directing group to achieve regioselective aminopalladation. The resulting chelation-stabilized alkylpalladium ( II) intermediate is then hydroxylated using oxygen/2 ,6-dimethylbenzoquinone in HFIP as the mild oxidation system. Under the optimized conditions , various nucleophiles and alkene substrates are capable of delivering good yields and high diastereoselectivities of the aminohydroxylated products.
