  Side chain-containing steroids are ubiquitous constituents of biological membranes<symptom> that are persistent to biodegradation. Aerobic , steroid-degrading bacteria employ oxygenases for isoprenoid side chain and tetracyclic steran ring cleavage. In contrast , a Mo-containing steroid C-25 dehydrogenase ( S25DH) of the dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) reductase family catalyzes the oxygen-independent hydroxylation of tertiary C-25 in the anaerobic , cholesterol-degrading
