  Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) , but not sedentary behavior ( SB) , is related to cardiometabolic risk among non-Hispanic white youth. Examine associations of SB and MVPA with cardiometabolic risk factors among Hispanic/Latino youth. Cross-sectional analysis. Four U.S. communities. Hispanic/Latino youth ( n = 1,426) age 8-16 years. Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations of MVPA and SB measured using 7-day accelerometer ( independent variables) with markers of glucose and lipid metabolism , inflammation<symptom> , and endothelial function ( dependent variables) , while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and accelerometer wear time. Further models controlled for obesity measures. SB comprised mean ( SD) 75 % ( 13 %) of accelerometer wear time , and mean ( SD) MVPA was 35 min/day ( 22 min/day). Deleterious levels of HDL-cholesterol , triglycerides , insulin resistance , C-reactive protein , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were each associated with lower levels of MVPA and higher levels of SB ( all P < 0.05). Associations of MVPA with log-transformed triglycerides ( β per 15-min/day increment , -0.039; SE , 0.018; P = 0.037) and SB with HDL-cholesterol ( β per 30-min/day increment , -0.63; SE , 0.26; P = 0.018) , but not those with other markers , remained significant after adjusting for MVPA or SB and further adjustment for body mass index and waist circumference. Higher SB tertiles were associated with lower soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products in fully adjusted models ( P-for-trend = 0.037). Physiological precursors of diabetes and cardiovascular disease were associated with MVPA and SB among U.S. Hispanic/Latino youth , a group that bears a disproportionate burden of metabolic disorders.
