  In eukaryotes , autophagy represents a highly evolutionary conserved process , through which macromolecules and cytoplasmic material are degraded into lysosomes and recycled for biosynthetic or energetic purposes. Dysfunction of the autophagic process has been associated with the onset and development of many human chronic pathologies , such as cardiovascular , metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancer. Recent Advances: Currently , comprehensive research is being carried out to discover new therapeutic agents able to modulate the autophagic process in vivo. Recent evidence has shown that a large number of natural bioactive compounds are involved in the regulation of autophagy by modulating several transcriptional factors and signaling pathways. Critical issues that deserve particular attention are the inadequate understanding of the complex role of autophagy in disease pathogenesis , the limited availability of therapeutic drugs and the lack of clinical trials. In this context , the effects that natural bioactive compounds exert on autophagic modulation should be clearly highlighted , since they depend on the type and stage of the pathological conditions of diseases. Research efforts should now focus on understanding the survival-supporting and death-promoting roles of autophagy , how natural compounds interact exactly with the autophagic targets so as to induce or inhibit autophagy and on the evaluation of their pharmacological effects in a more in-depth and mechanistic way. In addition , clinical studies on autophagy-inducing natural products are strongly encouraged , also to highlight some fundamental aspects , such as the dose , the duration and the possible synergistic action of these compounds with conventional therapy.
