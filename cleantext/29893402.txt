  Recent experimental results using in particular small-angle scattering to characterize the self-assembly of mainly hard spherical nanoparticles into higher ordered structures ranging from fractal aggregates to ordered assemblies are reviewed. The crucial control of interparticle interactions is discussed , from chemical surface-modification , or the action of additives like depletion agents , to the generation of directional patches and the use of external fields. It is shown how the properties of interparticle interactions have been used to allow inducing and possibly controlling aggregation , opening the road to the generation of colloidal molecules or potentially metamaterials. In the last part , studies of the microstructure of polymer nanocomposites as an application of volume-spanning and stress-carrying aggregates are discussed.
