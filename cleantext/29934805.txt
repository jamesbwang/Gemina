  The genus Laticauda ( Reptilia: Elapidae) , commonly known as sea kraits , is venomous marine amphibious snakes distributed throughout the south and southeast Asian islands and mostly found in coastal waters. To facilitate genetic studies , we have developed microsatellite loci for L. semifasciata using the 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing technique. A total of 65,680 sequences containing a minimum of five repeat motifs were identified from 451,659 reads. Among 80 loci containing more than nine repeat units , 34 primer sets ( 42.5 %) produced strong PCR products , of which 21 were polymorphic among 36 samples of L. semifasciata. All loci exhibited high genetic variability , with an average of 7.38 alleles per locus , and the mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.73 and 0.76 , respectively. The cross-species amplification of these loci in two laticaudine species , L. colubrina and L. laticaudata , revealed a high transferability ( 78.6 %) and polymorphism ( 59.5 %) of the loci. Our work demonstrated the utility of next-generation 454 sequencing as the rapid and cost-effective method for development of microsatellite markers. The high level of polymorphism in these microsatellite loci will be useful for the detection of population subdivision and the study of migration , gene flow , relatedness and philopatry of L. semifasciata and other laticaudine species.
