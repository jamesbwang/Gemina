  To evaluate the therapeutic effects of topical 8-oxo-2 '- deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxo-dG) on experimental ocular chemical injury models. We created ocular chemical injury models with 8-week-old BALB/c mice ( n = 70) by applying 100 % ethanol; the mice were then treated with 8-oxo-dG eye drops 10 and 5 mg/mL and phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS) twice daily. After 7 days , clinical findings such as corneal integrity , clarity , and neovascularization were assessed. Histology , immunohistochemistry findings , and inflammatory cytokine levels using real-time polymerase chain reactions in the corneas<symptom> of the mice were also analyzed. Topical application of 8-oxo-dG eye drops resulted in a significant improvement of epithelial defects and clarity , dose dependently ( each P < 0.001). Inflammatory cell infiltration and corneal stromal edema<symptom> were also decreased in the 8-oxo-dG-treated mice compared with PBS-treated controls , based on hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expressions of F4/80 and neutrophil elastase-positive inflammatory cells and IL-1 and TNF-Î± cytokine levels were significantly reduced in the 8-oxo-dG group compared with the PBS group ( each P < 0.01). Topical 8-oxo-dG application showed an excellent therapeutic effect in ocular chemical injury models by suppressing
