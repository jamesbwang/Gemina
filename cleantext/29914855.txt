  Aging is associated with an increased risk of accidental falls. Falls in older people have been widely studied in nursing homes and in the elderly with poor functionality , but there have been few investigations into functionally independent community-dwelling older adults. To determine the predictive factors for falls in functionally independent community-dwelling older adults. A cohort trial-nested case-control study was carried out. The participants were community-dwelling people aged 70 and over who were treated in primary care centers from December 2012 to May 2014 in la Ribera ( Valencia , Spain). There were a total of 374 participants , with a mean age of 76.1 ( SD 3.4) years ( 63.8 % females). The subjects presented high functionality scores: Barthel 96.5 ( SD 9.4) , Lawton 7.2 ( SD1 .2) , Tinetti 25.6 ( SD 3.3). The mean number of prescribed drugs was 4.7 ( SD 2.9). The cumulative incidence of falls was 39.2 % , and 24.1 % of these older adults suffered falls. The number of falls in the previous 12 months ( OR = 1.3; 95 % CI: 1.11-1.53; p < 0.001) and alpha-blockers ( OR = 6.72; 95 % CI: 1.62-27.79; p = 0.009) were predictors of falls. The presence of previous fractures ( OR = 9.55; 95 % CI: 4.1-22.25; p < 0.001) , a body mass index of â‰¥ 30kg/m Older people who use alpha-blockers , benzodiazepines and beta-blockers , had previous fractures , with increased body mass index are more likely to fall.
