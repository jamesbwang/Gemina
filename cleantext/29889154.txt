  To explore alterations in Î³-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) levels in response to levetiracetam ( LEV) treatment in patients with migraine. Patients with migraine ( N = 14) were treated with LEV for 12 weeks. The levels of GABA + in the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex ( ACC/mPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC) were examined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy before ( baseline) and after treatment. LEV showed good efficacy in the reduction of headache<symptom> frequency and intensity in patients with migraine. Among the 14 patients , good-quality spectral data of GABA + in the PCC region were obtained in 11 patients. There was a significant decrease in GABA + levels in the PCC region after LEV treatment. ACC/mPFC GABA + was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in eight patients with migraine. LEV had no significant effect on GABA + levels in the ACC/mPFC region. The decreased GABA + levels after LEV treatment in patients with migraine suggest that GABA is a migraine biomarker.
