  Objective The incidence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) increases after liver transplantation. This study was performed to evaluate the impact of MS on patients ' quality of life after liver transplantation. Methods We collected the medical records of 152 patients during their post-liver transplantation outpatient follow-up. Quality of life was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Data on the patients ' general condition as well as MS-related indicators were assessed in all patients. Based on the MS diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Diabetes Federation in 2005 , the patients were divided into two groups: those with and without MS. We then analyzed the factors influencing MS and their impact on the patients ' quality of life. Results After liver transplantation , age and underlying liver disease were significantly associated with MS and diabetes , and sex and body mass index were associated with central obesity. Central obesity affected the patients ' general health ( GH) score and health transition ( HT) score , and hypertension affected their GH score and physical component score ( PCS). Conclusions After liver transplantation , central obesity had a negative impact on patients ' GH score and HT score , and hypertension affected their GH score and PCS.
