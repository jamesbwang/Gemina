  Elevation of blood glucose results in increased glucose in the fluid that lines the surface of the airways and this is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection with respiratory pathogens. Infection induces an inflammatory response in the lung , but how this is altered by hyperglycemia and how this affects glucose , lactate and cytokine concentrations in the airway surface liquid is not understood. We used Wild Type ( WT) and glucokinase heterozygote ( GK
