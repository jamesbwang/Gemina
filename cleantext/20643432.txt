  To evaluate the performance of a combination of real-time strain elastography ( RTSE) and contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound ( CETRUS) for prostate cancer detection. Patients with serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) levels of ≥ 4.0 ng/ml were prospectively enrolled between June 2014 and December 2016. 153 prostate nodules<symptom> diagnosed by conventional ultrasound were prospectively enrolled and examined by CETRUS and RTSE before a biopsy. Multivariate logistic regression models were established for CETRUS , and CETRUS combined with RTSE to diagnose prostate malignancy. The diagnostic performances of CETRUS , RTSE , and their combined use were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve. The multivariate logistic regression for CETRUS combined with RTSE showed that enhanced strength , enhanced uniformity , and elasticity scores were the independent predictors of prostate malignancy. The area under the ROC curve of CETRUS combined with RTSE ( 0.921 ± 0.023) was higher than that of CETRUS and RTSE ( 0.88 ± 0.029 and 0.80 ± 0.038 , respectively; both
