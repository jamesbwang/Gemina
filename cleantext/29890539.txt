  Decompressive craniectomy is an urgent procedure that is increasingly used for treatment of intracranial hypertension. After recovery , reconstruction of the cranial defect is necessary. Cranioplasty is an elective procedure with a high potential for morbidity if care is not taken on different surgical factors such as the material used as the cranial flap. In Latin America , high costs in some materials used in cranioplasty make its use prohibitive for some patients and institutions , and looking for alternatives has become a priority in neurosurgical centers. An autologous bone flap is an excellent option possessing the characteristics of an ideal material for cranioplasty. Nevertheless , its use is associated with high morbidity and flap failure. We report our mono-institutional experience in a 10-year period of a hybrid technique for cranioplasty using an autologous bone flap with titanium plates. Sixty-five patients underwent the technique , with good cosmetic results in 89.2 % and success in functional result in 90.8 % of patients. No significant statistical differences were found on the timing of the surgery or the location of the cranial defect. We had a 1.5 % rate of surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> , less than that reported on previous series. We propose that the hybrid technique of cranioplasty is a safety and effective option for cranial defect reconstruction.
