  What is the central question of this study? In order to discern information about testing modalities when assessing neuroplastic responses to squat resistance training , the present study investigated whether corticospinal and intracortical function was different between a joint-angle matched isometric squat , and isometric knee extension. What is the main finding and its importance? The present data shows poor agreement of corticospinal and intracortical function between the isometric squat and isometric knee extension. The data reinforces the notion that task specificity is of utmost important for assessing neuroplasticity. It has been suggested that task-specific changes in neurophysiological function ( neuroplasticity) , should be assessed using testing modalities that replicate the characteristics of the intervention. The squat is a commonly prescribed resistance exercise that has been shown to elicit changes in central nervous system ( CNS) function. However , previous studies have assessed squat-induced neuroplasticity using isometric knee extension , potentially confounding the results. The present study aimed to assess the agreement between corticospinal and intracortical activity relating to the knee extensors during isometric knee extension compared to an isometric squat task. Eleven males completed a neurophysiological assessment in an isometric squat ( IS) , and knee extension ( KE) task matched for joint-angles ( hip , knee , and ankle). Single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) were delivered during isometric contractions at a range of intensities to assess short-interval cortical inhibition ( SICI) and corticospinal excitability. Group mean values for SICI ( 70 ± 14 % vs. 63 ± 12 % of unconditioned MEP during IS and KE , respectively) and corticospinal excitability ( mean differences 2-5 % of M
