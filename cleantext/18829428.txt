  Regret can be defined as the subjective experience of recognizing that one has made a mistake and that a better alternative could have been selected. The experience of regret is thought to carry negative utility. This typically takes two distinct forms: augmenting immediate postregret valuations to make up for losses , and augmenting long-term changes in decision-making strategies to avoid future instances of regret altogether. While the short-term changes in valuation have been studied in human psychology , economics , neuroscience , and even recently in nonhuman-primate and rodent neurophysiology , the latter long-term process has received far less attention , with no reports of regret avoidance in nonhuman decision-making paradigms. We trained 31 mice in a novel variant of the Restaurant Row economic decision-making task , in which mice make decisions of whether to spend time from a limited budget to achieve food rewards of varying costs ( delays). Importantly , we tested mice longitudinally for 70 consecutive days , during which the task provided their only source of food. Thus , decision strategies were interdependent across both trials and days. We separated principal commitment decisions from secondary reevaluation decisions across space and time and found evidence for regret-like behaviors following change-of-mind decisions that corrected prior economically disadvantageous choices. Immediately following change-of-mind events , subsequent decisions appeared to make up for lost effort by altering willingness to wait , decision speed , and pellet consumption speed , consistent with past reports of regret in rodents. As mice were exposed to an increasingly reward-scarce environment , we found they adapted and refined distinct economic decision-making strategies over the course of weeks to maximize reinforcement rate. However , we also found that even without changes in reinforcement rate , mice transitioned from an early strategy rooted in foraging to a strategy rooted in deliberation and planning that prevented future regret-inducing change-of-mind episodes from occurring. These data suggest that mice are learning to avoid future regret , independent of and separate from reinforcement rate maximization.
