  Perioperative care has been identified as an area of wide variability in quality , with conflicting models , and involving multiple specialties. In 2014 , the Loma Linda University Departments of Anesthesiology and Urology implemented a perioperative hospitalist service ( PHS) , consisting of anesthesiology-trained physicians , to co-manage patients for the entirety of their perioperative period. We hypothesized that implementation of this PHS model would result in an improvement in patient recovery. As a quality improvement ( QI) initiative , the PHS service was formed of selected anesthesiologists who received training on the core competencies for hospitalist medicine. The service was implemented following a co-management agreement to medically manage patients undergoing major urologic procedures ( prostatectomy , cystectomy , and nephrectomy). Impact was assessed by comparisons to data from the year prior to PHS service implementation. Data was compared with and without propensity matching. Primary outcome marker was a reduction in length of stay. Secondary outcome markers included complication rate , return of bowel function , number of consultations , reduction in total direct patient costs , and bed days saved. Significant reductions in length of stay ( Anesthesiologists can safely function as perioperative hospitalists , providing appropriate medical management , and significantly improving both patient recovery and throughput.
