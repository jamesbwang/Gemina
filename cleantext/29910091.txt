  Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) alters glucagon , glucagon-like peptide ( GLP) -1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP) and hepatic energy metabolism , yet the possible relationships remain unclear. In this observational study , lean insulin-sensitive control subjects ( BMI: 23.2 Â± 1.5 kg/m MMTT-derived peripheral insulin sensitivity was lowest in T2D patients ( P < 0.001) , while glucagon concentrations were comparable across all three groups. At 260 min , GLP-1 was lower in T2D patients than in controls , whereas GIP was lowest in obese individuals. Fasting glucagon concentrations correlated positively with fasting ( r = 0.60) and postprandial hepatocellular lipid levels ( 160 min: r = 0.51 , 240 min: r = 0.59) , and negatively with adipose tissue insulin sensitivity ( r = -0.73).
