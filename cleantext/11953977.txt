  The present study aimed to investigate risk factors for renal recurrence in patients with type IV lupus nephritis ( LN). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to using the Cox proportional hazard model and the Kaplan-Meier method. A total 244 patients were diagnosed with type IV LN; 100 ( 28.49 %) relapsed and 144 ( 41.03 %) recovered successfully. Kaplan-Meier method analysis indicated that patients with type IV LN affecting the digestive tract had high renal recurrence rates. Patients with hyperglobulinemia , positive anti-ribonucleoprotein and anti-Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease> type B ( anti-SSB) antibodies , thrombus in the loop or non-inflammatory necrotizing vasculopathy also had a high recurrence rate. Furthermore , patients achieving partial remission had an increased recurrence rate compared with patients achieving complete remission. Patients undergoing maintenance treatment with glucocorticoids alone had a higher recurrence rate compared with patients who used alternative treatment schemes. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses by the Cox proportional hazard model determined that the effect of systemic lupus erythematosus in the gastrointestinal tract , increased serum globulin levels and positive anti-SSB antibody at onset were risk factors for the recurrence of LN type IV. The present study demonstrated that clinical risk factors of renal recurrence in patients with LN type IV include LN in the gastrointestinal tract , increased serum globulin levels , positive anti-SSB antibodies at onset and the use of glucocorticoid-only maintenance treatment.
