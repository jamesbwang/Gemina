  Ultrasound is increasingly being recognized as a neuromodulatory and therapeutic tool , inducing a broad range of bio-effects in the tissue of experimental animals and humans. To achieve these effects in a predictable manner in the human brain , the thick cancellous skull presents a problem , causing attenuation. In order to overcome this challenge , as a first step , the acoustic properties of a set of simple bone-modeling resin samples that displayed an increasing geometrical complexity ( increasing step sizes) were analyzed. Using two Non-Destructive Testing ( NDT) transducers , we found that Wiener deconvolution predicted the Ultrasound Acoustic Response ( UAR) and attenuation caused by the samples. However , whereas the UAR of samples with step sizes larger than the wavelength could be accurately estimated , the prediction was not accurate when the sample had a smaller step size. Furthermore , a Finite Element Analysis ( FEA) performed in ANSYS determined that the scattering and refraction of sound waves was significantly higher in complex samples with smaller step sizes compared to simple samples with a larger step size. Together , this reveals an interaction of frequency and geometrical complexity in predicting the UAR and attenuation. These findings could in future be applied to poro-visco-elastic materials that better model the human skull.
