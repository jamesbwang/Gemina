  To investigate the effect of gut microbiota and diet on atherogenesis. Here , we investigated the interaction between the gut microbiota and diet on atherosclerosis by feeding germ-free or conventionally raised In conclusion , the impact of the gut microbiota on atherosclerosis is dietary dependent and is associated with plasma cholesterol levels. Furthermore , the microbiota was required for trimethylamine N-oxide production from dietary choline , but this process could not be linked to increased atherosclerosis in this model.
