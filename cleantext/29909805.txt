  Perinatal exposure to sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup-55 ( HFCS-55) in rats has previously been associated with altered hepatic fat content and composition post-weaning , although the effects on hepatic metabolism are unknown. The current study aimed to determine the sex-specific effects of maternal consumption of sucrose or HFCS-55 on the expression of hepatic lipogenic genes in the offspring. Liver samples were collected from offspring of albino Wistar rats provided with ad libitum access to either water ( control) , 10 % sucrose or 10 % HFCS-55 solution during pregnancy and lactation at 3 weeks ( control n = 16 , sucrose n = 22 , HFCS-55 n = 16) and 12 weeks ( control n = 16 , sucrose n = 10 , HFCS-55 n = 16) of age. Hepatic expression of the transcription factors such as carbohydrate response element-binding protein , sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and downstream genes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Sucrose-exposed offspring had higher hepatic SREBP-1c messenger RNA expression compared with control and HFCS-55 groups at both 3 weeks ( P = 0.01) and 12 weeks ( P = 0.03) of age. There were no differences in the expression of other hepatic lipogenic genes between groups at either 3 or 12 weeks. Thus , perinatal exposure to sucrose may be more detrimental to offspring hepatic metabolism compared with HFCS-55 , independent of sex , and it will be important to evaluate the longer-term effects of perinatal sucrose exposure in future studies.
