  Recently , several new materials for mattresses have been introduced. Although some of these , such as low rebound ( pressure-absorbing/memory foam) and high rebound mattresses have fairly different characteristics , effects of these mattresses on sleep have never been scientifically evaluated. In the current study , we have evaluated effects of a high rebound mattress topper ( HR) on sleep and its associated physiology , and the effects were compared to those of a low rebound mattress toppers ( LR) in healthy young ( n = 10) and old ( n = 20) adult males with a randomized , single-blind , cross over design. We found that sleeping with HR compared to LR induced a larger decline in core body temperature ( CBT) in the initial phase of nocturnal sleep both in young ( minimum CBT: 36.05 vs 36.35 °C) and old ( minimum CBT: 36.47 vs. 36.55 °C) subjects , and declines in the CBT were associated with increases in deep sleep/delta power ( +27.8 % in young and +24.7 % in old subjects between 11:00-01:00). We also found significantly smaller muscle activities during roll over motions with HR ( -53.0 to -66.1 % , depending on the muscle) during a separate daytime testing. These results suggest that sleeping with HR in comparison to with LR , may facilitate restorative sleep at the initial phase of sleep.
