  Computational homology is an emerging mathematical tool for characterizing shapes of data. In this work , we present a methodology using computational homology for obtaining quantitative measurements of the connectivity in bone morphometry. We introduce the Betti number ratios as novel morphological descriptor for the classification of bone fine structures in three dimensions. A total of 51 Japanese white rabbits were used to investigate the connectivity of bone trabeculae after the administration of alendronate in a tendon graft model in rabbits. They were divided into a control group C and an experimental group A. Knee joints specimens were harvested for examination of their bone trabecular structure by micro-CT. Applying the computational homology software to the reconstructed 3D image data , we extract the morphological feature of a steric bone structure as the Betti numbers set ( β We define the Betti number ratios β This study is the first application of computational homology to bone morphometry in three dimensions. We show the mathematical basis of the Betti numbers index which are useful in a statistical description of the topological features of sponge-like structures. The potential benefits associated with our method include both improved quantification and reproducibility for the stereology.
