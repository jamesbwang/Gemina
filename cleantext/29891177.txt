  A woman 's risk of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy is estimated to be two-to-six times higher than her risk when she is not pregnant. Such risk estimates are largely based on pregnancies that result in delivery of a newborn baby; no estimates exist for the risk of venous thromboembolism after induced abortion<disease> , another common pregnancy outcome. To fill this knowledge gap , we aimed to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism in women whose first pregnancy ended with induced abortion<disease> We did this propensity score-matched cohort study using data from the universal health-care system of Ontario , Canada. We included primigravid women who had an induced abortion<disease> between Jan 1 , 2003 , and Dec 31 , 2015 , and used a propensity score to match them to primigravid women who had a livebirth ( 1:1) or nulligravid women who were not pregnant on the procedure date of their matched counterpart and who did not conceive within 1 year afterwards ( 5:1). We excluded from our analysis women younger than 15 years or older than 49 years and individuals who had missing or invalid information about their sex , area of residence , residential income , or world region of origin. The primary outcome was risk of any venous thromboembolism within 42 days of the index date ( defined as the date of an induced abortion<disease> , delivery date for livebirth , or for non-pregnant women the induced abortion<disease> date of their matched counterpart). We compared the rate of venous thromboembolism in primigravid women who had an induced abortion<disease> with the rate of venous thromboembolism in propensity-score-matched non-pregnant women and propensity-score-matched primigravid women whose pregnancy ended with a livebirth. We generated hazard ratios ( HRs) of 42-day risk of venous thromboembolism after induced abortion<disease> using Cox proportional hazard models. We identified 194 086 eligible women whose first pregnancy ended with induced abortion<disease> , of whom 176 001 ( 90 · 7 %) could be matched with women whose first pregnancy ended in delivery of a newborn. These 176 001 women were also matched to 880 005 non-pregnant women. The rate of venous thromboembolism within 42 days of an induced abortion<disease> was 30 · 1 ( 95 % CI 22 · 0-38 · 2) per 100 000 women compared with 13 · 5 ( 11 · 1-16 · 0) per 100 000 women in the non-pregnant group ( HR 2 · 23 , 95 % CI 1 · 61-3 · 08). The HR was 0 · 16 ( 95 % CI 0 · 12-0 · 22) when compared with the women in the livebirth cohort , whose venous thromboembolism rate within 42 days postpartum was 184 · 7 ( 95 % CI 164 · 6-204 · 7) per 100 000 women. The 42-day risk of venous thromboembolism after an induced abortion<disease> is double that of a matched non-pregnant woman , and is significantly lower than after a livebirth. This novel information can inform estimates of peri-procedural risk of venous thromboembolism after induced abortion<disease> Clinicians could consider a lower threshold for ordering a diagnostic test to rule out venous thromboembolism after induced abortion<disease> than they would in a non-pregnant woman.
