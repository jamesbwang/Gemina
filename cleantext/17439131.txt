  Bis ( phosphine) cobalt dialkyl complexes have been reported to be highly active in the hydrogenation of tri-substituted alkenes bearing hydroxyl substituents. Alkene substrates containing ether , ester , or ketone substituents show minimal reactivity , indicating an activating effect of the hydroxyl group. The mechanistic details of bis ( phosphine) cobalt-catalysed hydrogenation were recently evaluated computationally ( X. Ma , M. Lei ,
