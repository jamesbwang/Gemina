  Two new coffee relatives ( tribe Coffeeae , Rubiaceae) , discovered during botanical expeditions to Cameroon , are examined for generic placement , and the placement of three previously known species ( Argocoffeopsis fosimondi , A. spathulata and Calycosiphonia pentamera) is reinvestigated using plastid sequence ( accD-psa1 , rpl16 , trnL-F) and morphological data. Seed biochemistry of the new species and pollen micromorphology ( only one of the two species) are also studied. Based on the plastid sequence data , the new taxa are nested in a well-supported monophyletic group that includes Argocoffeopsis and Calycosiphonia. Within this clade , three well-supported subclades are recovered that are morphologically easy to diagnose: ( 1) Calycosiphonia ( excluding C. pentamera) , ( 2) Argocoffeopsis ( excluding A. fosimondi and A. spathulata) , and ( 3) a clade including the above excluded species , in addition to the new species. Based on the results , Kupeantha , a new genus of five species , is described , including two new Critically Endangered taxa from the Highlands of Cameroon: Kupeantha ebo and K. kupensis. Phytochemical analysis of Kupeantha seeds reveals compounds assigned as hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives , amino acids and ent-kaurane diterpenoids; caffeine was not detected. Kupeantha is the first new genus described in tribe Coffeeae in 40 years.
