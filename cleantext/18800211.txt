  To report a series of cases of patients treated by fracture of the femoral head through the Ganz pathway with controlled dislocation of the hip. All patients who were surgically treated with a Ganz access route for femoral head fractures were identified in a tertiary referral service for trauma. A review of medical records with X-rays and CT scans was carried out. The radiographic evaluation was classified according to Pipkin and the functional evaluation was performed through the application of the modified Harris Hip Score. Data regarding the quality of reduction , type of fixation , and postoperative complications were collected. The sample consisted of three men and one woman , with a mean age of 30 years ( 20-51). Regarding Pipkin 's classification , two cases were type I , one type II , and one type IV. Regarding the Harris Hip Score , an average of 65.75 points was obtained ( range: 20-86). All cases had anatomical reduction in the intraoperative period. One case presented post-traumatic sciatic nerve praxis and evolved with infection at the surgical site. Surgical treatment of femoral head fractures through controlled hip dislocation is a viable option and can be considered an alternative to classical approaches.
