  Streptomyces<pathogen> cinnamonensis A495 is a variant of the monensin producer which instead of the native polyether antibiotic gives rise to antibiotic and anti-tumour shunt-product premonensin. Through the supplementation of the fermentation medium with suitable precursors , premonensin can be derivatized via the incorporation of new-to-nature extender units into the biosynthetic machinery. Polyketide extender units require activation , typically in form of coenzyme A-thioesters. These are membrane impermeable and thus in the past an artificial mimic was employed. Here , we show the use and preliminary characterization of a highly substrate promiscuous new enzyme for the endogenous thioester formation in a Streptomyces<pathogen> strain. These intracellularly activated alternative extender units are significantly better incorporated into premonensin than the synthetically activated counterparts. Polyketide natural products are of enormous relevance in medicine. The hit-rate in finding active compounds for the potential treatment of various diseases among this substance family of microbial origin is high. However , most polyketides require derivatization to render them suitable for the application. Of relevance in this field is the incorporation of artificial substances into the biogenesis of polyketides , hampered by both the microbial metabolism and the complexity of the enzymes involved. This manuscript describes the straightforward and selective biosynthetic incorporation of synthetic substances into a reduced polyketide and showcases a promising new enzyme to aid this purpose.
