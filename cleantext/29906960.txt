  We numerically examine ballistic active disks driven through a random obstacle array. Formation of a pinned or clogged state occurs at much lower obstacle densities for the active disks than for passive disks. As a function of obstacle density , we identify several distinct phases including a depinned fluctuating cluster state , a pinned single-cluster or jammed state , a pinned multicluster state , a pinned gel state , and a pinned disordered state. At lower active disk densities , a drifting uniform liquid forms in the absence of obstacles , but when even a small number of obstacles are introduced , the disks organize into a pinned phase-separated cluster state in which clusters nucleate around the obstacles , similar to a wetting phenomenon. We examine how the depinning threshold changes as a function of disk or obstacle density and find a crossover from a collectively pinned cluster state to a disordered plastic depinning transition as a function of increasing obstacle density. We compare this to the behavior of nonballistic active particles and show that as we vary the activity from completely passive to completely ballistic , a clogged phase-separated state appears in both the active and passive limits , while for intermediate activity , a readily flowing liquid state appears and there is an optimal activity level that maximizes the flux through the sample.
