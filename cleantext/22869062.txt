  Prospective multicenter study. To analyze the effect of the Ucar convex rod rotation technique on coronal and sagittal correction in the treatment of Lenke type I adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Various common curve correction techniques were used in scoliosis. This report describes the efficacy of the global vertebral correction technique with convex rod rotation. A total of 28 consecutive patients with Lenke type I adolescent idiopathic scoliosis managed with Ucar convex rod rotation technique between October 2012 and September 2015 were included. The average patient age was 14.8 years at the time of surgery. Measurements of curve magnitude and balance<symptom> were made on standing anteroposterior , and lateral radiographs were taken before surgery , postoperatively , and at the last follow-up to assess deformity correction , spinal balance<symptom> , and complications related to instrumentation. The average preoperative main thoracic angle was 64.8 째 and was decreased to 15.5 째 postoperatively. The average preoperative T4-T12 thoracic kyphosis was 19.6 째 and was improved to 24.8 째. All patients had mildly imbalanced or balanced shoulders at the final follow-up. Correction rates in the coronal and sagittal planes were as acceptable as those achieved with conventional methods.
