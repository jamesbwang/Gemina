  Field desorption mass spectrometry under ambient conditions is used to study solution-phase organic reactions in micro-volumes. Reagent solution is transferred onto the microdendrites of the field emitter and reaction products are examined online by mass spectrometry. Three reactions , hydrazone formation by phenyl hydrazine and indoline-2,3-dione , the Katritzky reaction between a pyrylium salt and anisidine , and the Hantzsch synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine , were investigated and reaction acceleration was observed to different extents. The increase in rate relative to the corresponding bulk reactions is attributed to solvent evaporation ( simple concentration effect) and to the increase of surface-to-volume ratio ( enhanced interfacial reactions). A distinguishing feature of this method of reaction acceleration , relative to that based on nano electrospray ionization is the observation of radical cations and the formation of radical cation products. The study also breaks new ground in using field emitters at atmospheric pressure.
