  Given the time demands of clinical practice it is not surprising that diagnoses are sometimes missed. To improve diagnostic recognition , self-administered screening scales have been recommended. A problem with much of the research effort on screening scales is the confusion<symptom> between diagnostic testing and screening. It is important for a screening test to have high sensitivity because the more time intensive/expensive follow-up diagnostic inquiry will presumably only occur in patients who are positive on the initial screen. Investigators vary in how they analyze their data in determining the recommended cutoff score on a self-administered screening questionnaire. To illustrate this , in the present report we examined how often each of the different approaches towards determining a cutoff score on bipolar disorder screening scales were used. We reviewed 68 reports of the performance of the 3 most commonly researched bipolar disorder screening scales to determine how the recommended cutoff on the scale was derived. Most studies recommended a cutoff point on the screening scale that optimized the level of agreement with the diagnostic gold standard. Only 11 ( 16.2 %) studies recommended a cutoff that prioritized the scale 's sensitivity. It is important for clinicians to understand the difference between screening and diagnostic tests. The results of the present study indicate that most studies of the performance of the 3 most commonly studied bipolar disorder screening measures have taken the wrong approach in deriving the cutoff score on the scale for the purpose of screening.
