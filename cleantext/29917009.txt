  Clubfoot is a common congenital anomaly with multiple potential risk factors. Identification of modifiable risk factors may minimize future incidence of clubfoot. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically review and analyze the best clinical evidence regarding risk factors associated with clubfoot. Medline , Embase , and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from 1967 to May 11 , 2016 for studies reporting risk factors for clubfoot. Randomized trials and observational studies were eligible for inclusion , and assessed in duplicate. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane risk of bias tool; low quality studies were excluded , all randomized trials were included. Two reviewers extracted data independently. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Pooled effect estimates for the odds of clubfoot were calculated using random or fixed-effects models based on heterogeneity. Forty-two studies ( 28 case-control , 10 cohort , 4 randomized trials) comprising 31,844 clubfoot cases and 6,604,013 controls were included. Risk factors associated with increased odds of clubfoot included maternal smoking ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.65; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.54-1.78) , paternal smoking ( OR = 1.72; 95 % CI , 1.05-2.84) , maternal body mass index > 30 ( OR = 1.46; 95 % CI , 1.29-1.65) , family history ( OR = 7.80; 95 % CI , 4.04-15.04) , amniocentesis ( OR = 2.08; 95 % CI , 1.34-3.21) , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor exposure ( OR = 1.78; 95 % CI , 1.34-2.37) maternal single status ( OR = 1.17; 95 % CI , 1.11-1.23) , gestational diabetes ( OR = 1.40; 95 % CI , 1.13-1.72) , nulliparity ( OR = 1.32; 95 % CI , 1.19-1.45) , male sex ( OR = 1.68; 95 % CI , 1.48-1.94) , and aboriginal Australian race ( OR = 2.35; 95 % CI , 1.63-3.38). Smoking , maternal obesity , family history , amniocentesis , and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor exposures are the most clinically relevant exposures associated with increased odds of clubfoot , with family history representing the greatest risk. Recognition of modifiable risk factors may help in counseling patients , and minimizing clubfoot incidence. Level II.
