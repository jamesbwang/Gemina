  Traditional views suggest that growth hormone and the growth hormone receptor ( GH/GHR complex) exert their functions only on the plasma membrane. This paradigm , however , has been challenged by recent new findings that the GH/GHR complex could translocate into cell nuclei where they could still exhibit important physiological functions. We also reported the nuclear localization of porcine GH/GHR and their potential functions in porcine hepatocytes. However , the basic path of pGH/GHR 's nuclear translocation remains unclear. Combining previous research results and our current findings , we proposed two basic routes of pGH/GHR 's nuclear transportation as follows: 1) after pGH binding to GHR , pGH/GHR enters into the cytoplasm though clathrin- or caveolin-mediated endocytosis , then the pGH/GHR complex enters into early endosomes ( Rab5-positive) , and the endosome carries the GH/GHR complex to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER). After endosome docking on the ER , the endosome starts fission , and the pGH/GHR complex enters into the ER lumen. Then the pGH/GHR complex transports into the cytoplasm , possibly by the ERAD pathway. Subsequently , the pGH/GHR complex interacts with IMPα/β , which , in turn , mediates GH/GHR nuclear localization; 2) pGH binds with the GHR on the cell membrane and , subsequently , pGH/GHR internalizes into the cell and enters into the endosome ( this endosome may belong to a class of endosomes called envelope-associated endosomes ( NAE)). Then , the endosome carries the pGH/GHR to the nuclear membrane. After docking on the nuclear membrane , the pGH/GHR complex fuses with the nuclear membrane and then enters into the cell nucleus.
