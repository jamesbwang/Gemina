  Quantitative evaluation of potential pharmacodynamic ( PD) interactions is important in tuberculosis<disease> drug development in order to optimize Phase 2b drug selection and ultimately to define clinical combination regimens. In this work , we used simulations to ( 1) evaluate different analysis methods for detecting PD interactions between two hypothetical anti-tubercular drugs in in vitro time-kill experiments , and ( 2) provide design recommendations for evaluation of PD interactions. The model used for all simulations was the Multistate Tuberculosis<disease> Pharmacometric ( MTP) model linked to the General Pharmacodynamic Interaction ( GPDI) model. Simulated data were re-estimated using the MTP-GPDI model implemented in Bliss Independence or Loewe Additivity , or using a conventional model such as an Empirical Bliss Independence-based model or the Greco model based on Loewe Additivity. The GPDI model correctly characterized different PD interactions ( antagonism , synergism , or asymmetric interaction) , regardless of the underlying additivity criterion. The commonly used conventional models were not able to characterize asymmetric PD interactions , i.e. , concentration-dependent synergism and antagonism. An optimized experimental design was developed that correctly identified interactions in â‰¥ 94 % of the evaluated scenarios using the MTP-GPDI model approach. The MTP-GPDI model approach was proved to provide advantages to other conventional models for assessing PD interactions of anti-tubercular drugs and provides key information for selection of drug combinations for Phase 2b evaluation.
