  Some of the closest reciprocal relationships are between parents and their children. As part of the attachment characterizing many parent-child bonds , individuals form mental representations that are chronically accessible and calibrate expectations for future relationships. We predict that there exist unique neural signatures of this chronic accessibility. Young ( N = 29 , 16 females) and older adults ( N = 27 , 12 females) made trait judgments for parent or child , respectively , during fMRI scanning. Multivariate analysis identified whole-brain patterns of activation that covaried with the magnitude of parent-child attachment when thinking about that individual. Higher levels of parent and child attachment were associated with lower neural recruitment in anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , posterior cingulate cortex , medial temporal lobe , and occipital face area. Results provide novel evidence for neural signatures of chronic accessibility , as bringing to mind one 's attached parent or child requires less engagement of brain regions involved in distress relief , memory , and facial processing.
