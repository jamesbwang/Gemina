  Serum therapy fell out of favor 80 years ago , but antibodies against infectious<disease> diseases<disease> are now experiencing a renaissance. With the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria , the emergence of new pathogens , and a growing population of immunocompromised individuals coupled with improvements in antibody manufacturing and biological efficacy , antibodies are an increasingly attractive therapeutic option. In this review , we highlight successful clinical strategies and discuss recent applications of advanced antibody engineering approaches to combat infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Case studies include antibody mixtures to neutralize
