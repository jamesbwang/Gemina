  Increased knowledge of the immune response of the intestine , a physiologically critical organ involved in absorption , secretion and homeostasis in a non-sterile environment , is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in the induction of long-lasting immunity and , subsequently , the development of efficacious gastrointestinal immunization approaches. To this end , analysis of isolated gut cells will give an insight into the cell types present and their immune capability. Hence , in this study we first optimised a method for salmonid gut leucocyte isolation and characterised the cells on the basis of their expression of a range of selected cell markers associated with T & B cells and dendritic cells. The GALT leucocytes were then stimulated with a variety of PAMPs , recombinant cytokines and PHA , as a means to help characterise the diversity of the immune repertoire present in such cells. The stimulants tested were designed to examine the nature of the antibacterial , antiviral and T cell type responses in the cells ( at the transcript level) using a panel of genes relevant to innate and adaptive immunity. The results showed distinct responses to the stimulants , with a clear delineation seen between the stimulant used ( eg viral or bacterial PAMP) and the pathway elicited. The changes in the expression patterns of the immune genes in these cells indicates that the salmonid intestine contains a good repertoire of competent immune cells able to respond to different pathogen types. Such information may aid the development of efficient priming by oral vaccination in salmonids.
