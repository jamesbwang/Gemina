  Human Yippee-like-4 ( YPEL4) is a member of the YPEL gene family. This family has been characterized as the first highly conserved family of genes coding for proteins that contain putative zinc-finger-like metal-binding domains , known as the Yippee domain. The YPEL family proteins are located at the centrosome adjacent to the nucleolus during interphase and mitotic apparatus during mitosis. Due to its subcellular localization , it is believed that YPEL4 may have an important role in the cell cycle and proliferation. Recent studies have shown the involvement of YPEL4 in biological processes such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and adrenal cell proliferation. Research on YPEL4 up to date also suggests that YPEL4 is a very important player in pulmonary diseases. YPEL4 may regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway to mediate adrenal cell proliferation; this molecule is also likely to be a very important player in pulmonary diseases. Although the function of YPEL4 is largely unknown , further research may substantiate the functional importance and underlying molecular processes in pulmonary and other diseases that would allow YPEL4 to become a therapeutic target.
