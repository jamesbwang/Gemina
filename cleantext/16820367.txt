  Patients with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) are at elevated risk of ischemic and bleeding events. However , the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT) after PCI in patients with PAD remains unclear. A systematic literature search was performed through June 2017 using PubMed , EMBASE and Cochrane databases with the following key terms: `` dual antiplatelet therapy '' , `` P2Y12 inhibitor '' , `` myocardial infarction '' , `` percutaneous coronary intervention '' , `` stent '' , `` peripheral arterial disease '' , and `` ankle-brachial index ''. The analysis was restricted to randomized trials published in English in patients with PAD receiving extended DAPT ( > 12-month) after PCI. Overall analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Two randomized controlled trials involving 895 patients were included in this review. Compared to the placebo group , there was no statistical significance in the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events ( MACCE) in patients receiving extended DAPT ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.76 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.37- 1.57; P = 0.46). The results were associated with substantial heterogeneity ( I Among patients with PAD , extended DAPT after PCI resulted in a non-significant difference in ischemic and bleeding events compared to placebo , respectively. The routine use of extended DAPT in this cohort should be carefully evaluated.
