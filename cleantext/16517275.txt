  We aimed to evaluate the long term effect of school based intervention to prevent non- communicable disease risk factors. It was a quasi experimental study conducted during the period of 2009-2015. We involved school children aged from 11 to 16 years old. For the assessment of the program 's effectiveness , subjects in both groups were examined at baseline , at the end of the 3-year intervention period and at the follow-up , one year after program 's cessation. In the intervention group , the prevalence of school children who reported to be eating 5 fruits and vegetable sdaily increased significantly from 30.0 % at pre-assessment to 33.2 % at post-assessment , one year after ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.41 respectively). For the control group , this prevalence had significantly decreased from 40.2 % at baseline to 35.0 % at post-intervention , at the follow up , this proportion increased to 44.5 % ( p = 0.001 , p < 10 The present work showed that interventions promoting healthy lifestyles should be maintained. Developing countries should be encouraged and supported to design , conduct , and evaluate robust preventive interventions.
