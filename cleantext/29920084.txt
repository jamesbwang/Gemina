  In contrast to colostral immunoglobulins , changes in metabolite composition of ingested colostrum in the gut have received little attention. Here , we characterized the metabolite profiles of colostrum and milk , ingested colostrum and milk , and serum of neonatal calves by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics approaches. Colostrum and milk underwent similar changes in metabolite profiles in the gut after being ingested. These changes were characterized by increases in methionine , glutamate , thymine , and phosphorylcholine. After ingestion , colostrum concentrations of several metabolites , such as Î³-aminobutyric acid , glutamate , cinnamic acid , and thymine increased , whereas concentrations of d-ribose , and arginine decreased. These increases and decreases occurred in a time-dependent manner and were associated with alanine , aspartate , glutamate , and pyrimidine metabolism , and valine , leucine , and isoleucine biosynthesis , respectively. Meanwhile , similar changes in serum metabolites were also observed in neonatal calves fed colostrum , which implies that colostrum metabolites are transported across the small intestine and into the bloodstream. In addition , several metabolites of ingested milk were detected in the gut , and were also transferred to the bloodstream. These metabolites were related to phenylalanine , tyrosine , tryptophan , valine , leucine , and isoleucine biosynthesis , the citrate cycle , and histidine metabolism. These findings reveal that the serum metabolome of neonatal calves ' changes as a result of ingesting colostrum , which can provide health-related benefits in early life.
