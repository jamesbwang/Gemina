  A parent of a child with a fatal lung disease decides to try to save her first with improved pharmaceuticals to hold the disease at bay , and then with an unlimited supply of transplantable lungs to cure the disease and manage the consequences of eventual organ rejection. The parent needs to surmount science , ethics , and commercialization issues for organ transplantation to be a practical cure , and several of those issues are particularly difficult for xenotransplanation. After half-a-decade of effort , the parent 's personal journey has resulted in a 100-fold increase in the number of hours that pulmonary xenografts are viable , but still remains significantly shy of commercial viability and still leaves some ethical issues open.
