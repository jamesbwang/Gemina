  To investigate the efficacy of quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM) in the assessment of osteoporosis for postmenopausal women. Between May and September 2017 , a total of 70 postmenopausal women who underwent MRI-based QSM and quantitative computed tomography ( QCT) were consecutively enrolled in this prospective study. The measurement of QSM and QCT values was performed on the L3 vertebrae body. On the basis of QCT value , all individuals were divided into three groups ( normal , osteopenia and osteoporosis). On the basis of QCT , 18 individuals were normal ( 25.7 %) , 26 osteopenic ( 37.1 %) and 26 osteoporotic ( 37.1 %). The QSM value was age-related ( p = 0.04) and significantly higher in the osteoporosis group than in either the normal or osteopenia group ( for all , p < 0.001). In addition , the QSM value was highly correlated with QCT value ( r =- 0.720 , p < 0.001). For QSM , the area under the curve ( AUC) , sensitivity and specificity for differentiating osteopenia from non-osteopenia were 0.88 , 86.5 % and 77.8 % , respectively , and for differentiating osteoporosis from non-osteoporosis they were 0.86 , 80.8 % and 77.3 % , respectively. MRI-based QSM could be used for quantifying susceptibility in vertebrae and has the potential to be a new biomarker in the assessment of osteoporosis for postmenopausal women. • Osteoporosis significantly increases risk of fracture for postmenopausal women. • QSM value was correlated with QCT value ( r =- 0.72 , p < 0.001). • QSM is feasible in the assessment of osteoporosis for postmenopausal women. • QSM offers the quantification of susceptibility within bone.
