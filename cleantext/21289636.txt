  This article describes preclinical development of cell-based medicinal products for European markets and discusses European regulatory mechanisms open to developers to aid successful product development. Cell-based medicinal products are diverse , including cells that are autologous or allogeneic , have been genetically modified , or not , or expanded ex vivo , and applied systemically or to an anatomical site different to that of their origin; comments applicable to one product may not be applicable to others , so bespoke development is needed , for all elements- quality , preclinical and clinical. After establishing how the product is produced , proof of potential for therapeutic efficacy , and then safety , of the product need to be determined. This includes understanding biodistribution , persistence and toxicity , including potential for malignant transformation. These elements need to be considered in the context of the intended clinical development. This article describes regulatory mechanisms available to developers to support product development that aim to resolve scientific issues prior to marketing authorization application , to enable patients to have faster access to the product than would otherwise be the case. Developers are encouraged to be aware of both the scientific issues and regulatory mechanisms to ensure patients can be supplied with these products.
