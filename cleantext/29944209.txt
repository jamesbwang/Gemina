  Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in regulatory networks controlling plant and animal gene expression. However , the roles of lncRNAs in regulating rubber biosynthesis in Eucommia ulmoides , an emerging source of natural rubber ( Eu-rubber) , are currently unknown. Here , we performed deep RNA sequencing of two parts of E. ulmoides fruits at two developmental time points. Using a stringent pipeline , we identified 29,103 lncRNAs and 9,048 transcripts of uncertain coding potential ( TUCPs). Two differentially expressed ( DE) TUCPs appear to simultaneously regulate 12 protein-coding genes involved in Eu-rubber biosynthesis ( GIEBs) , as well as 95 DE genes. Functional categorization of these 95 DE genes revealed that they are mainly related to subcellular microstructures and cellular processes , such as cell wall , cell division , and growth. These DE genes might be involved in the differentiation and development of laticifers , where Eu-rubber is synthesized. The `` commanders '' ( DE TUCPs) likely cause the `` builders '' ( DE genes) to construct the `` storehouse '' of materials needed for Eu-rubber synthesis and the `` workers '' ( GIEBs) to synthesize Eu-rubber. These findings provide insights into both cis- and trans-polyisoprene biosynthesis in plants , laying the foundation for additional studies of this crucial process.
