  This study aimed at evaluating the effects obtained by administering 30 mg of micronised dispersible ferric pyrophosphate plus 300 mg of alpha-lactalbumin ( MDFP-AL) compared to 80 mg of ferrous gluconate ( FG) in pregnant women affected by iron-deficiency anemia<symptom> ( IDA). We considered eligible all second-trimester singleton pregnancies in women affected by IDA. We excluded any other disease , twin pregnancies , any other pharmacologic/nutraceutical treatments ( besides folic acid) before/during pregnancy. We randomized patients in two groups: one underwent treatment with 1 tablet of MDFP-AL/day , the other one with 1 tablet of FG/day , for 30 days. We evaluated hemoglobin ( Hb) , ferritin , red blood cells ( RBCs) , serum iron , hematocrit ( Hct) , and side effects at baseline ( T0) , after 15 days ( T1) and 30 days ( T2). 50 women met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. We did not observe significant differences between the two groups for mean age , gestational age at the enrollment and parity. In MDFP-AL group , after 15 days ( T1) Hb , ferritin , serum iron and Hct and were significantly improved respect to baseline ( T0); after 30 days ( T2) , all the parameters , including RBCs , were significantly improved respect to baseline ( T0). Similarly , in FG group the investigated parameters were improved both after 15 ( T1) and 30 days ( T2) respect to baseline ( T0) , although less in percentage terms respect to MDFP-AL group. The side effects rate was 24 % in FG group , whereas MDFP-AL group did not show any significant side effect. Overall , MDFP-AL is more effective and safe than FG for the treatment of IDA in pregnant women.
