  The increasing number of older trauma patients has provoked a debate on the need for subsequent rehabilitative therapy for the elderly. Our findings revealed a lack of detailed data on this topic so we became interested in the effective differences in the longer-term outcomes for older and younger major trauma patients with TBI. As validation studies on the recently published specific Quality of Life after Brain Injury ( QOLIBRI) have only involved patients under the age of 68 years , we focused on testing this score in comparison to other outcome measures. Prospective cohort study of the differences in 1-year functional or health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) outcomes , such as the Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS) , the Quality of Life after Brain Injury ( QOLIBRI) score or the medical outcomes study Short Form-36 ( SF-36) between younger ( 16-64 years) and elderly ( > 65 years) adults following major trauma ( New Injury Severity Score , NISS ≥ 8) with TBI ( Abbreviated Injury Scale , AIS head > 0). Out of 326 TBI patients with a mean NISS of 20.6 ± 9.4 34 % ( n = 110 ( 33.7 %)) were aged 65 or older versus n = 216 ( 66.3 %) who were younger. Comparison of 1-year outcomes revealed no differences between younger versus elderly patients with regard to functional or HRQoL scores ( e.g. total QOLIBRI 77.4 ± 20.0 and 75.6 ± 18.1 , resp.). Univariate analysis showed no correlation of the total QOLIBRI with age ( Pearson r =- 0.09) or trauma severity ( AIS) of the head ( r =- 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed an association of age 80 or older ( R Given the rising rehabilitation demands of the elderly these pilot findings call for the utilisation of specific outcome scores such as the QOLIBRI in this age group as well , at least up to an age of 80 years and independently of the severity of TBI sustained.
