  Some explanations of abstract word learning suggest that these words are learnt primarily from the linguistic input , using statistical co-occurrences of words in language , whereas concrete words can also rely on non-linguistic , experiential information. According to this hypothesis , we expect that , if the learner is not able to fully exploit the information in the linguistic input , abstract words should be affected more than concrete ones. Embodied approaches instead argue that both abstract and concrete words can rely on experiential information and , therefore , there might not be any linguistic primacy. Here , we test the role of linguistic input in the development of abstract knowledge with children with developmental language disorder ( DLD) and typically developing children aged 8-13. We show that DLD children , who by definition have impoverished language , do not show a disproportionate impairment for abstract words in lexical decision and definition tasks. These results indicate that linguistic information does not have a primary role in the learning of abstract concepts and words; rather , it would play a significant role in semantic development across all domains of knowledge.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
