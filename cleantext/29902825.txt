  Liquid posterior fossa epidural hematoma ( LPFEH) following head trauma is uncommon , and very few such cases have been described in the literature. Eight patients with this entity and their treatments are presented here. We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of all patients with diagnosed LPFEH over a 3-year period. Collected data included clinical history , laboratory results , treatment , and review of all imaging studies performed. Eight pediatric cases were identified with imaging findings consistent with LPFEH; no adult case was identified. Enlargement of ventricles appeared on computed tomography ( CT) in six cases , and secondary epilepsy onset occurred in three cases with severe dilated ventricles. Routine hematologic and coagulation tests failed to disclose anemia<symptom> or abnormal coagulation in each case. Five patients underwent burr-hole drainage of the hematoma and recovered completely. Conservative therapy was adopted in three patients for small hematomas , and hematoma enlargement was not observed in the follow-up CT scans. LPFEH is a rare subtype of traumatic epidural hematoma specifically recognized in the pediatric population. Minimally invasive burr-hole drainage is a feasible procedure for the patient with evident space-occupying effect. Coagulation dysfunction or low hemoglobin as a possible contributing factor and its role in formation of LPFEH was excluded.
