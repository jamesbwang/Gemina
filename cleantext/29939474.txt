  Rats and hamsters are the most commonly used animal models for evaluating the hypocholesterolemic activity of potential probiotic strains , whereas little or no information has been reported on whether the animal models would affect the experimental conclusions regarding the hypocholesterolemic efficacy of the strains. Both high-cholesterol-fed rats and hamsters were intragastrically administered viable cells of bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus<pathogen> acidophilus<pathogen> K16 once daily ( 1 Ã— 10 These data suggest that the hypocholesterolemic efficacy of L.<pathogen> acidophilus<pathogen> K16 is substantially different between high-cholesterol-fed hamsters and rats and that hamsters are a better model system than rats for evaluating the hypocholesterolemic efficacy of potential probiotic strains due to their similarity to humans in biliary bile acid composition , including types of bile acids and their conjugation form.
