  Biodegradable pH-responsive polysuccinimide nanoparticles ( PSI-NPs) are synthesized for directly delivering agrochemicals to plant phloem to improve their efficacy. The PSI-NPs have an average size of 20.6 nm with negative charge on the surface. The desired responsiveness to changes in pH is demonstrated by release efficiency of the model molecule ( Coumarin 6) , which increases with increasing pH over 24 h. The internalization of PSI-NPs into grapefruit cells occurs in 10 min , and into nucleus in 2 h , with most of the PSI-NPs being distributed in cytoplasm and nucleus. The proportion of PSI-NPs in plant cells significantly increases with time , from 19.1 % at 10 min to 55.5 % at 2 h of administering. The PSI-NPs do not show significant inhibitory effects on soil microbial growth and activity. These results indicate that this smart nanodelivery system has potential of application in agriculture for mitigating phloem-limited diseases , such as citrus huanglongbing.
