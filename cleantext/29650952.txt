  Designing stimuli responsive , controllable and biocompatible multifunctional nanoparticles is an important progress in the current quest for drug delivery systems. Herein , we devoted to developing a β-cyclodextrin ( β-CD) based drug delivery nanoparticles ( NPs) that release Bovine serum albumin ( BSA) via glucose-responsive gate. The design involves synthesis of sodium alginate with β-CD modified ( Alg-β-CD) and methoxypolyethylene glycol ( mPEG-Fc) containing ferrocene ( Fc) uncharged end-capping. When α-cyclodextrin ( α-CD) was added with these two segments , the stable non-covalent supramolecular structure of Alg-β-CD/mPEG-Fc/α-CD can be self-assembled into NPs in aqueous solution. BSA loaded Alg-β-CD/mPEG-Fc/α-CD also has been prepared. Interestingly , these supramolecular Alg-β-CD/mPEG-Fc/α-CD/ BSA NPs showed uniform sphere structure and constant BSA loading content. Also , this new kind of NPs can disassemble in the present of hydrogen peroxide ( H
