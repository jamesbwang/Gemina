  The study is aimed to establish a simplified and practical tool for analyzing thyroid nodules<symptom>. A novel risk score model was designed , risk factors including patient history , patient characteristics , physical examination , symptoms of compression , thyroid function , ultrasonography ( US) of thyroid and cervical lymph nodes were evaluated and classified into high risk factors , intermediate risk factors , and low risk factors. A total of 243 thyroid nodules<symptom> in 162 patients were assessed with risk score system and Thyroid Imaging-Reporting and Data System ( TI-RADS). The diagnostic performance of risk score system and TI-RADS was compared. The accuracy in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules<symptom> was 89.3 % for risk score system , 74.9 % for TI-RADS respectively. The specificity , accuracy and positive predictive value ( PPV) of risk score system were significantly higher than the TI-RADS system ( Ï‡
