  Galectin-8 is a β-galactoside-recognising protein that has a role in the regulation of bone remodelling and is an emerging new target for tackling diseases with associated bone loss. We have designed and synthesised methyl 3-O- ( 1-carboxyethyl)- β-d-galactopyranoside ( compound 6) as a ligand to target the N-terminal domain of galectin-8 ( galectin-8N). Our design involved molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations that predicted 6 to mimic the interactions made by the galactose ring as well as the carboxylic acid group of 3 '- O-sialylated lactose ( 3 '- SiaLac) , with galectin-8N. Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC) determined that the binding affinity of galectin-8N for 6 was 32.8 μm , whereas no significant affinity was detected for the C-terminal domain of galectin-8 ( galectin-8C). The crystal structure of the galectin-8N-6 complex validated the predicted binding conformation and revealed the exact protein-ligand interactions that involve evolutionarily conserved amino acids of galectin and also those unique to galectin-8N for recognition. Overall , we have initiated and demonstrated a rational ligand design campaign to develop a monosaccharide-based scaffold as a binder of galectin-8.
