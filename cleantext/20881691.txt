  Direct observations with focused feedback are critical components for medical student education. Numerous challenges exist in providing useful comments to students during their clerkships. Students ' evaluations of the clerkship indicated they were not receiving feedback from preceptors or house officers. To encourage direct observation with feedback , Structured Patient Care Observation ( SPCO) forms were used to evaluate third-year medical students during patient encounters. In 2014-2015 , third-year medical students at a Midwestern medical school completing an 8-week pediatrics clerkship provided experiences on inpatient wards and in ambulatory clinics. Students were expected to solicit feedback using the SPCO form. A total of 121 third-year medical students completed the pediatrics clerkship. All of the students completed at least one SPCO form. Several students had more than one observation documented , resulting in 161 SPCOs submitted. Eight were excluded for missing data , leaving 153 observations for analysis. Encounter settings included hospital ( 70) , well-child visits ( 34) , sick visits ( 41) , not identified ( 8). Observers included attending physicians ( 88) and residents ( 65). The SPCOs generated 769 points of feedback , comments coalesced into themes of patient interviews , physical examination , or communication with patients and family. Once themes were identified , comments within each theme were further categorized as either actionable or reinforcing feedback. SPCOs provided a structure to receive formative feedback from clinical supervisors. Within each theme , reinforcing feedback and actionable comments specific enough to be useful in shaping future encounters were identified.
