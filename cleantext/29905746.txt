  A novel method is proposed for improving the performance of traditional laser heterodyne radiometry. The technique , which is based on the use of a wavelength modulated local oscillator laser , provides baseline-free spectra , lower limits of detection , and better precision and consistency than the conventional approach. This tool could , therefore , boost the accuracy of current terrestrial and planetary atmospheric studies.
