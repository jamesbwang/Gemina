  Bioresorbable scaffolds ( BRS) promise to be the treatment of choice for stenosed coronary vessels. But higher thrombosis risk found in current clinical studies limits the expectations. Three hemodynamic metrics are introduced to evaluate the thrombosis risk of coronary stents/scaffolds using transient computational fluid dynamics ( CFD). The principal phenomena are platelet activation and effective diffusion ( platelet shear number , PSN) , convective platelet transport ( platelet convection number , PCN) and platelet aggregation ( platelet aggregation number , PAN) were taken into consideration. In the present study , two different stent designs ( thick-strut vs. thin-strut design) positioned in small- and medium-sized vessels ( reference vessel diameter , RVD = 2.25 mm vs. 2.70 mm) were analyzed. In both vessel models , the thick-strut design induced higher PSN , PCN and PAN values than the thin-strut design ( thick-strut vs. thin-strut: PSN = 2.92/ 2.19 and 0.54/ 0.30; PCN = 3.14/ 1.15 and 2.08/ 0.43; PAN: 14.76/ 8.19 and 20.03/ 10.18 for RVD = 2.25 mm and 2.70 mm). PSN and PCN are increased by the reduction of the vessel size ( PSN: RVD = 2.25 mm vs. 2.70 mm = 5.41 and 7.30; PCN: RVD = 2.25 mm vs. 2.70 mm = 1.51 and 2.67 for thick-strut and thin-strut designs). The results suggest that bulky stents implanted in small caliber vessels may substantially increase the thrombosis risk. Moreover , sensitivity analyses imply that PSN is mostly influenced by vessel size ( lesion-related factor) , whereas PCN and PAN sensitively respond to strut-thickness ( device-related factor).
