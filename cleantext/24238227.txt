  Antifungal agents are routinely used in the post-transplant setting for both prophylaxis and treatment of presumed and proven fungal infections. Micafungin is an echinocandin-class antifungal with broad antifungal cover and favorable side effect profile but , notably , it has no activity against molds of the order Mucorales. A 47-year-old woman underwent multivisceral transplantation for intestinal failure-associated liver disease. She had a prolonged post-operative recovery complicated by invasive candidiasis and developed an intolerance to liposomal amphotericin B. In view of her immunosuppression , she was commenced on micafungin as prophylaxis to prevent invasive fungal infection. However , she developed acute graft versus host disease with bone<disease> marrow failure complicated by disseminated mucormycosis which was only diagnosed post mortem. Non- A high level of suspicion of invasive fungal infection is required at all times in immunosuppressed patients , even those receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Early biopsy is required. Even with early recognition and aggressive treatment of these infections , prognosis is poor.
