  In recent years , bats have been found to harbour many viruses , raising several questions about their role as reservoirs and potential disseminators of zoonotic viruses. We investigated the presence of six virus families in bats in three regions of Central-Southern Italy. Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses identified , with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26 % and 87.62 %. Astrovirus<pathogen> diversity was not associated with the bat species , the geographic areas or the bat colony , suggesting the circulation of several astrovirus<pathogen> strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat astroviruses and could provide , potentially , the bases for transmission to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the important ecosystem services bats provide.
