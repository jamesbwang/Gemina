  Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors ( IMTs) are neoplasms with low malignant potential , and the most common tumor in the lung and orbit. Their occurrence in the uterus is rare. Approximately 50 % of IMT patients have anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene ( ALK) rearrangements. Recent studies described novel fusions involving ROS1 , platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFR-β) , and ETS translocation variant ( ETV6) genes in a subset of ALK-negative patients. We report a 44-year-old woman with anemia<symptom> and uterine IMT. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a myxoid degenerative myoma-like mass , 7.4 cm in maximum diameter , on the left uterine side wall. Hysterectomy was performed as a definitive treatment. Microscopic examination revealed spindle cell proliferation with numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemically , the spindle cells were negative for ALK-1 , desmin , and smooth muscle actin. The pathological diagnosis was IMT arising from the uterus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated an ETV6-neurotrophic tyrosine kinase , receptor , type 3 gene ( NTRK3) translocation but no ALK , ROS1 , or PDGFR-β translocations. Lung and abdomen computed tomography at 31 months postoperatively revealed no disease recurrence. This association of an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion oncogene with an ALK-negative uterine IMT increases our understanding of this neoplasm , which may help the development of specific therapies.
