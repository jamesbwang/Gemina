  Hydrophilic polymers , or hydrogels , are used for a wide variety of biomedical applications , due to their inherent ability to withhold a high-water content. In recent years , a large effort has been focused on tailoring the mechanical properties of these hydrogels to become more appropriate materials for use as anatomical and physiological structural supports. A few of these such methods include using diverse types of polymers , both natural and synthetic , varying the type of molecular cross-linking , as well as combining these efforts to form interpenetrating polymer network hydrogels. While multiple research groups have characterized these various hydrogels under quasi-static conditions , their dynamic properties , representative of native physiological loading scenarios , have been scarcely reported. In this study , an E-glass fiber reinforced family of alginate/PAAm hydrogels cross-linked by both divalent and trivalent cations are fabricated and investigated. The effect of the reinforcement phase on the dynamic and hydration behaviors is then explicated. Additionally , a micromechanics framework for short cylindrical chopped fibers is utilized to discern the contribution of the matrix and fiber constituents on the hydrogel composite. The addition of E-glass fibers resulted in the storage modulus exhibiting a ~ 50 % , 5 % , and ~ 120 % , increase with a mere addition of 2 wt % of the reinforcing fibers to Na- , Sr- , and Al-alginate/PAAm , respectively. In studying the cross-linking effect of various divalent ( Ba , Ca , Sr) and trivalent ( Al , Fe) cations , it was noteworthy that the hydrogels were found to be effective in dissipating energy while resisting mechanical deformation when they are cross-linked with higher molecular weight elements , regardless of valency. This report on the dynamic properties of these hydrogels will help to improve their optimization for future use in biomedical load-bearing applications.
