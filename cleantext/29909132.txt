  Annual influenza<disease> vaccination campaigns emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated against influenza<disease> These campaigns offer potential opportunities to raise awareness of all vaccines. We explored the peak timing of the receipt of influenza<disease> and other routinely recommended vaccinations. We examined administrative claims data of 31 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries , eligible to receive vaccinations administered from 2013 to 2015 from Medicare Part B ( medical insurance) and Medicare Part D ( prescription drug benefit). From 2013 to 2015 , 88 % of over 50 million influenza<disease> vaccination claims occurred in September , October , and November. Claims for pneumococcal ( 42 %) , herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( 36 %) , and tetanus-containing ( 32 %) vaccines were also concentrated during these months. For pneumococcal vaccines , this concentration occurred across various provider settings , including traditional doctor 's offices , pharmacies , and hospitals. Herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( 92 %) and tetanus-containing ( 72 %) vaccines were largely administered in the pharmacy. Annual influenza<disease> vaccination efforts offer additional opportunities to assess , recommend , and administer other recommended vaccinations.
