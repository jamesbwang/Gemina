  Neurological manifestations in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC) are highly variable. Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) may reflect the neurological disease burden. We analyzed the association of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) , intellectual disability ( ID) and epilepsy with callosal DTI metrics in subjects with and without TSC. 186 children underwent 3T MRI DTI: 51 with TSC ( 19 with concurrent ASD) , 46 with non-syndromic ASD and 89 healthy controls ( HC). Subgroups were based on presence of TSC , ASD , ID , and epilepsy. Density-weighted DTI metrics obtained from tractography of the corpus callosum were fitted using a 2-parameter growth model. We estimated distributions using bootstrapping and calculated half-life and asymptote of the fitted curves. TSC was associated with a lower callosal fractional anisotropy ( FA) than ASD , and ASD with a lower FA than HC. ID , epilepsy and ASD diagnosis were each associated with lower FA values , demonstrating additive effects. In TSC , the largest change in FA was related to a comorbid diagnosis of ASD. Mean diffusivity ( MD) showed an inverse relationship to FA. Some subgroups were too small for reliable data fitting. Using a cross-disorder approach , this study demonstrates cumulative abnormality of callosal white matter diffusion with increasing neurological comorbidity.
