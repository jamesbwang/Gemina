  Although left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) has been established as a predictor of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , the relationship between the prevalence of LVH and CKD stage during the pre-dialysis period has not been fully examined. We measured left ventricular mass index ( LVMI) in a cross-sectional cohort of participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort ( CKD-JAC) study to identify factors that are associated with increased LVMI in patients with stage 3-5 CKD. We analyzed the baseline characteristics in 1088 participants ( male 63.8 % , female 36.2 %). Diabetes mellitus was the underlying disease in 41.7 % of the patients , and mean age was 61.8 Â± 11.1 years. LVH was detected in 23.4 % of the patients at baseline. By multivariate logistic analysis , independent risk factors for LVH were past history of cardiovascular disease ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.364; 95 % confidence interval ( ( CI) 1.463-3.822; P = 0.0004) , body mass index ( OR 1.108; 95 % CI 1.046-1.173; P = 0.0005) , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( OR 1.173; 95 % CI 1.005-1.369; P = 0.0433) , urinary albumin ( OR 1.425; 95 % CI 1.028-1.974; P = 0.0333) , and serum total cholesterol level ( OR 0.994; 95 % CI 0.989-0.999; P = 0.0174). The cross-sectional baseline data from the CKD-JAC study shed light on the association between LVH and risk factors in patients with decreased renal function. Further longitudinal analyses of the CKD-JAC cohort are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of LVH in CKD patients.
