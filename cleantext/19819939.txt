  Di ( 2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) , a widely used plasticizer , is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and may act as an endocrine disruptor. Early life exposures to DEHP may result in anti-androgenic effects , impairing the development of the male reproductive tract. However , data on the long-lasting consequences of such DEHP exposures on adult male reproductive function are still rare and discrepant. Previously , we identified 2 novel plasticizers , 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate ( BDB) and dioctyl succinate ( DOS) , as potential substitutes for DEHP that did not reproduce classically described endocrine disrupting phenotypes in prepubertal male offspring after maternal exposure. Here , we investigated the consequences of in utero and lactational exposure to BDB and DOS on adult male rat reproductive function in a comparative study with DEHP and a commercially available alternative plasticizer , 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester ( DINCH). Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged with vehicle or a test chemical ( 30 or 300 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 8 to postnatal day 21. While DEHP exposure ( 300 mg/kg/day) significantly increased epididymal weight in the adult , exposure to DINCH , BDB , or DOS did not affect reproductive organ weights , steroid levels , or sperm quality. Using a toxicogenomic microarray approach , we found that adult testicular gene expression was affected by exposure to the higher dose of DEHP; transcripts such as Nr5a2 , Ltf , or Runx2 were significantly downregulated , suggesting that DEHP was targeting estrogen signaling. Lesser effects were observed after treatment with either DINCH or BDB. DOS exposure did not produce such effects , confirming its potential as a responsible substitute for DEHP.
