  Entecavir ( ETV) is commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB) in China. However , certain percentages of e-Antigen ( HBeAg) positive CHB patients do not respond to ETV therapy. To investigate whether the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR) genes were associated with seroconversion in HBeAg positive CHB responder patients treated with ETV. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers ( PCR-SSP) method was performed to genotype KIR genes in 200 healthy controls and 198 HBeAg-positive CHB patients which 59 were defined as the complete response group ( CRG) to the treatment with ETV and 139 were defined as null or partial response group ( NPRG). The frequencies of KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS3 were significantly higher ( P = 0.030 , OR = 1.57 ， 95 % CI = 2.36-1.05 and P = 0.018 , OR = 1.773 ， 95 % CI = 2.77-1.13 , respectively) , while , the frequencies of KIR2DL3 , KIR2DS1 and KIR3DS1 were significantly lower ( P = 0.038 , OR = 0.525 , 95 % CI = 0.96-0.29 , and P = 0.031 , OR = 0.640 , 95 % CI = 0.95-0.43 , and P = 0.035 , OR = 0.641 , 95 % CI = 0.96-0.43 , respectively) in HBeAg-positive CHB patients than those in healthy controls. The frequency of KIR2DS3 gene was significantly higher in NPRG than that in CRG ( P = 0.018 , OR = 0.402 , 95 % CI = 0.83-0.20). The frequencies of KIR2DL3 and KIR3DS1 genes were significantly higher in CRG than those in NPRG ( P = 0.019 , OR = 3.625 , 95 % CI = 10.83-1.21 and P = 0.041 , OR = 1.949 , 95 % CI = 3.65-1.04 , respectively). Patients with KIR2DS3 might have negative responses to anti-HBV therapy with ETV and patients with KIR2DL3 and KIR3DS1 might have advantage in the therapy with ETV.
