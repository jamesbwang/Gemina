  Mechanical overloading can lead to skeletal muscle damage instead of remodeling. This is attributed to the excessive apoptosis of myoblasts , mechanism of which remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) and caspase-12 in mediating the stretch-induced apoptosis of myoblasts. Myoblast apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst staining , DNA fragmentation assay , Annexin V binding , and propidium iodide staining , as well as caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 cleavage. First , our results showed that apoptosis was elevated in a time-dependent manner when myoblasts were subjected to cyclic mechanical stretch ( CMS) for 12 , 24 , and 36 hr. Concomitantly , CMS triggered the ERS and caspase-12 cleavage; ERS inhibitor GSK 2606414 suppressed the CMS-induced cleavage of caspase-12 and myoblast apoptosis. Silencing caspase-12 attenuated the apoptosis of myoblasts under CMS. Furthermore , CMS-induced myoblast apoptosis was partially recovered by overexpressing wild-type caspase-12 in caspase-12-silenced myoblasts. In contrast , overexpressing mutant caspase-12 ( D94N) , which can not be cleaved into the active caspase-12 fragments , failed to accomplish the same effect. Finally , C2C12 overexpressing truncated caspase-12 segment ( TC-casp12-D94) , which starts from Asp94 and ends at Asn419 , underwent apoptosis under both static and stretched conditions. Interestingly , C2C12 myoblasts seemed to be resistant to stretch-induced apoptosis upon low-serum-induced differentiation. In conclusion , our study provided evidence that caspase-12 cleavage at Asp94 , induced by ERS under mechanical stimuli , is the key molecule in initiating the stretch-triggered apoptosis of myoblasts.
