  Core laboratory testing may increase length of stay and delay care. We compared length of emergency department ( ED) care in patients receiving point-of-care testing ( POCT) at triage vs. traditional core laboratory testing. We conducted a prospective , case-controlled trial of adult patients with prespecified conditions requiring laboratory testing and had POCT performed by a nurse after triage for: a basic metabolic panel , troponin I , lactate , INR ( i-STAT System) , urinalysis ( Beckman Coulter Icon) , or urine pregnancy test. Study patients were matched with controls based on clinical condition , gender , age , and time to be seen. Groups were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum or Fisher 's exact tests. We matched 52 POCT study patients with 52 controls. Groups were similar in age , gender , clinical condition , time to be seen by a physician ( 3.3 h , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.2-4.4 , vs. 3.1 h , 95 % CI 2.2-4.5 h , in POCT and control patients , respectively; p = 0.84) , use of imaging , and disposition. Of 52 study patients , 3 ( 5.8 % , 95 % CI 2.0-15.9) were immediately transferred to the critical care area to be urgently seen by an emergency physician. POCT patients had a significantly shorter median ( interquartile range ( IQR)) ED care time than matched controls ( 7.6 , 95 % CI 5.1-9.5 vs. 8.5 , 6.2-11.3 h , respectively; p = 0.015). Median ( IQR) ED length of stay was similar in study patients and controls ( 9.6 , 95 % CI 7.9-14.5 vs. 12.5 , 8.2-21.2 h , respectively; p = 0.15). Among stable adult patients presenting to the ED with one of the prespecified conditions , early POCT at triage , compared with traditional core laboratory testing after evaluation by an ED provider , reduced ED care time by approximately 1 h.
