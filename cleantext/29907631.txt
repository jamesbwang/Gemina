  To report the capsulotomy and lens fragmentation outcomes of white cataracts managed with the femtosecond laser ( FL). Outcomes of a prospective , observational consecutive case series of white cataracts ( June 2012-November 2016) that underwent FL-assisted cataract surgery ( FLACS) ( Victus , Bausch + Lomb , Munich , Germany) at the Singapore National Eye Centre were audited. 58 eyes of 54 patients underwent FLACS. White cataract types included dry white ( 24 eyes) , intumescent ( 28 eyes) and Morgagnian ( 6 eyes). Docking was level in 22 eyes ( 38.6 %). Following FL , the anterior capsule level dropped in 20 eyes ( 34.5 %). Incomplete capsulotomies occurred in 10 eyes ( 17.2 %). Lens fragmentation attempted in 38 eyes was effective or partially effective in 31 eyes ( 81.6 %). No anterior or posterior capsule tears occurred. LogMAR BCVA at 1 month was 0.073 ( SD 0.09). Risk factors for incomplete capsulotomy were Morgagnian cataract and lens thickness ( multiple logistic regression , p < 0.01 and p = 0.03 , respectively). The main complication of FLACS in white cataracts was incomplete capsulotomy ( 17.2 %) , significantly associated with Morgagnian cataracts and increased lens thickness. Lens fragmentation was effected in four-fifths of white cataracts but should be avoided in Morgagnian cataracts due to possible overlap of the lens fragmentation plan and the anterior capsule.
