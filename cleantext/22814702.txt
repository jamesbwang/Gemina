  Cholesterol is an essential molecule that exerts pleiotropic actions. Although its presence is vital to the cell , its excess can be harmful and , therefore , sustaining cholesterol homeostasis is crucial to maintaining proper cellular functioning. It is well documented that high plasma cholesterol concentration increases the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. In the last decades , several studies have investigated the association of plasma cholesterol concentrations and the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as the signaling pathways involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Here , we present an overview of several mechanisms involved in intestinal cholesterol absorption , the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake. We also discuss the importance of reverse cholesterol transport and transintestinal cholesterol transport to maintain cholesterol homeostasis and prevent atherosclerosis development. Additionally , we discuss the influence of dietary cholesterol on plasma cholesterol concentration and the new recommendations for cholesterol intake in a context of a healthy dietary pattern.
