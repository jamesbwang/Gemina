  A hybrid metal-semiconductor nanosystem for the generation of THz radiation , based on the fabrication of GaAs quantum molecules-Ga metal nanoparticles complexes through a self assembly approach , is proposed. The role of the growth parameters , the substrate temperature , the Ga and As flux during the quantum dot molecule ( QDM) fabrication and the metal nanoparticle alignment are discussed. The tuning of the relative positioning of QDMs and metal nanoparticles is obtained through the careful control of Ga droplet nucleation sites via Ga surface diffusion. The electronic structure of a typical QDM was evaluated on the base of the morphological characterizations performed by atomic force microscopy and cross sectional scanning electron microscopy , and the predicted results confirmed by micro-photoluminescence experiments , showing that the Ga metal nanoparticle-GaAs quantum molecule complexes are suitable for terahertz generation from intraband transition.
