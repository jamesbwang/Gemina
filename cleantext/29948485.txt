  The genus Pimpinella L. comprises about 150 species , being one of the largest genera within the family Apiaceae ( subfamily Apioideae). Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Pimpinella is a taxonomically complex group. In this study , evolutionary relationships among representatives from Western Europe have been inferred from phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer ( ITS 1 and ITS 2) and plastid sequences ( trnL intron and the trnL-F spacer) , with a representative sampling included ( 168 accessions in the ITS analysis , representing 158 species; and 42 accessions in the cpDNA analysis representing 35 taxa of Pimpinella and closely related species). All analyses resolved that Pimpinella is a non-monophyletic group , and Pimpinella 's taxa that grow in Western Europe are part of phylogenetically independent groups that correspond to three different tribes of the subfamily Apioideae: Pimpinelleae ( core group) , Pyramidoptereae and Smyrnieae.
