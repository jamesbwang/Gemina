  Due to potent bactericidal activity and low rate of drug-resistance , daptomycin is recognized as first line antibiotic to treat serious infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. However , the incidence of daptomycin resistance is increasing due to its widespread application. Alteration of cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism is involved in daptomycin resistance. The unique mode of action underlying daptomycin resistance in important pathogens , including Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Enterococci , is presented in this paper.
