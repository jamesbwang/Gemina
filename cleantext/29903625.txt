  This study aimed to present a novel technique for stapler-assisted laryngectomy under direct visualization using a videoendoscope with narrow-band imaging ( NBI-endoscopy). A case series of five consecutive patients were treated with stapler-assisted total laryngectomy from December 2014 to March 2016. The technique involved monitoring the stapler closure of laryngopharyngeal cavity under NBI-endoscopic vision , triple checking of neo-pharynx cavity by an endoscopic view inside and transillumination verification outside , air leakage test , and guiding the insertion of feeding tube under direct visualization. The main evaluation of this study was pharyngocutaneous fistula<disease> , surgical margin , and oral feeding time. All the patients healed well without a pharyngocutaneous fistula<disease>. The mean of surgical time , oral feeding , and hospitalization time were 40 min , 6 days , and 8 days , respectively. This study demonstrated a technique simple to learn and associated with decreased complication rates , which could be safe and efficient for stapler-assisted laryngectomy.
