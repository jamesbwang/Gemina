  The nuclear pore complex ( NPC) controls the passage of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm , but how the NPC directly participates in macromolecular transport remains poorly understood. In the final step of mRNA export , the DEAD-box helicase DDX19 is activated by the nucleoporins Gle1 , Nup214 , and Nup42 to remove Nxf1 • Nxt1 from mRNAs. Here , we report crystal structures of Gle1 • Nup42 from three organisms that reveal an evolutionarily conserved binding mode. Biochemical reconstitution of the DDX19 ATPase cycle establishes that human DDX19 activation does not require IP
