  Women with epilepsy ( WWE) are believed to be at risk of sexual dysfunction ( SD) and face many sexual challenges because of multiple factors. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with SD in Chinese Han WWE. This cross-sectional study examined 112 married WWE in the Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University with focal ( FE) or generalized epilepsy ( GE) on antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) , and 120 healthy controls without epilepsy , all of Chinese Han nationality. Data collection tools included the Chinese version of Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI) , the Chinese version of Zung Self-Rating Anxiety<symptom> Scale ( SAS) , the Chinese version of the Zung Self-Rating Depression<symptom> Scale ( SDS) , the Chinese version of the revised Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ( MMAS-8) , and the Chinese version of the National Hospital Seizure<symptom> Severity Scale ( NHS3). Chi-square test , t-test , one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) , and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. A high rate ( 70.5 %) of SD was detected in WWE , with 24.2 % in controls. Sexual dysfunction affected all dimensions: desire ( 85.7 %) , arousal ( 56.3 %) , lubrication ( 47.3 %) , orgasm ( 66.1 %) , satisfaction ( 58.9 %) , and pain ( 41.1 %). Elevated rates of anxiety<symptom> ( 40.2 %) and depression<symptom> ( 33 %) and poor medication adherence ( 31.3 %) were also found in WWE. Binary logistic regression found that poor economic status ( odds ratio ( OR) = 13.904 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.025-95.472 , P = 0.007 and OR = 6.350 , 95 % CI: 1.323-30.477 , P = 0.021) , anxiety<symptom> ( OR = 1.222 , 95 % CI: 1.055-1.415 , P = 0.007) , and poor medication adherence ( OR = 0.297 , 95 % CI: 0.124-0.707 , P = 0.006) were associated with SD. The associated factors of SD in Chinese Han WWE are multifactorial. The WWE have higher levels of anxiety<symptom> , poor family economic status , and poor medication adherence. Medical professionals should not only better control seizures<symptom> but also evaluate and improve patients ' sexual function so as to improve the quality of life of WWE.
