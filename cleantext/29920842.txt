  To measure carbonyl emissions from a heated tobacco product ( IQOS) in comparison with an e-cigarette ( Nautilus Mini) and a commercial tobacco cigarette ( Marlboro Red). Regular and menthol variants of the heated tobacco product were tested. A tank-type atomizer was tested with a tobacco-flavoured liquid at 10 and 14 W. Aerosol and smoke were collected in impingers containing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Health Canada Intense and two more intense puffing regimens were used. Analytical laboratory in Greece. Carbonyl levels in the aerosol and smoke. At the Health Canada Intense regimen , heated tobacco products emitted 5.0-6.4 μg/stick formaldehyde , 144.1-176.7 μg/stick acetaldehyde , 10.4-10.8 μg/stick acrolein , 11.0-12.8 μg/stick propionaldehyde and 1.9-2.0 μg/stick crotonaldehyde. Compared with the tobacco cigarette , levels were on average 91.6 % lower for formaldehyde , 84.9 % lower for acetaldehyde , 90.6 % lower for acrolein , 89.0 % lower for propionaldehyde and 95.3 % lower for crotonaldehyde. The e-cigarette emitted 0.5-1.0 μg/12 puffs formaldehyde , 0.8-1.5 μg/12 puffs acetaldehyde and 0.3-0.4 μg/12 puffs acrolein , but no propionaldehyde and crotonaldehyde. At more intense puffing regimens , formaldehyde was increased in heated tobacco products , but levels were three-fourfold lower compared with the tobacco cigarette. Based on the findings from Health Canada Intense puffing regimen , use of 20 heated tobacco sticks would result in approximately 85 % to 95 % reduced carbonyl exposure compared with smoking 20 tobacco cigarettes; the respective reduction in exposure from use of 5 g e-cigarette liquid would be 97 % to > 99 %. The IQOS heated tobacco product emits substantially lower levels of carbonyls than a commercial tobacco cigarette ( Marlboro Red) but higher levels than a Nautilus Mini<pathogen> e-cigarette.
