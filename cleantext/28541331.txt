  Sustainability of commercial fisheries is best achieved when fishing gears are selective and have low impacts on bottom habitat. Pots ( baited traps) are a fishing technology that typically has lower impacts than many other industrial gears. In this study we compared the efficiency of five models of pots ( baited traps) designed to catch Atlantic cod ( Gadus<pathogen> morhua<pathogen> for use in Newfoundland and Labrador ( NL) 's expanding cod fishery. We compared catch per unit effort ( CPUE) and total lengths of cod across each pot type , as well as bycatch rates of each model. All pot types were successful at catching cod , but two models ( the modified Newfoundland pot , and a four-entrance pot of our design) had highest CPUE. Specifically , we found that modifying Newfoundland pots increased their CPUE by 145 % without a corresponding increase in bycatch. None of the pot types produced substantial amounts of bycatch. This study demonstrated that potting gear is an effective way to catch cod in NL , and that there is flexibility in which pot fishers can use , depending on the layout of their fishing vessel.
