  The aim of this study was to investigate the local production of proinflammatory cytokines , pain-related sensory innervation of dorsal-root ganglia ( DRG) , and spinal changes in a rat model of induced hip osteoarthritis ( OA). Seventy-five Sprague-Dawley rats were used , including 25 controls and 50 injected into the right hip joints ( sham group , injected with 25 µl of sterile saline: N = 25; and monosodium iodoacetate ( MIA) group , injected with 25 µl of sterile saline with 2 mg of MIA: N = 25). We measured the local production of TNF-α , immunoreactive (- ir) neurons for calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) , and growth associated protein-43 ( GAP-43) in DRG , and immunoreactive neurons for ionized-calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 ( Iba-1) in the dorsal horn of spinal cord , on post-induction days 7 , 14 , 28 , 42 , and 56 ( N = 5 rats/group/time point). For post-induction days 7-42 , the MIA group presented significantly elevated concentrations of TNF-α than the other groups ( p < 0.01) , and a higher expression of CGRP-ir in FG-labeled DRG neurons than the sham group ( p < 0.01). MIA rats also presented significantly more FG-labeled GAP-43-ir DRG neurons than the sham group on post-induction days 28 , 42 , and 56 ( p < 0.05) , and a significantly higher number of Iba-1-ir microglia in the ipsilateral dorsal horn than the other groups , on post-induction days 28 , 42 , and 56. The results suggest that in rat models , pain-related pathologies due to MIA-induced hip OA , originate from inflammation<symptom> caused by cytokines , which leads to progressive , chronic neuronal damage that may cause neuropathic pain. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
