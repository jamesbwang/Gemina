  Surgeon volume has been identified as an important factor impacting postoperative outcome in patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries. With an absence of a detailed systematic review , we sought to collate evidence on the impact of surgeon volume on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. PubMed ( MEDLINE) and Google Scholar databases were queried for articles using the following search criteria: ( `` Surgeon Volume '' OR `` Provider Volume '' OR `` Volume Outcome '') AND ( `` THA '' OR `` Total hip replacement '' OR `` THR '' OR `` Total hip arthroplasty ''). Studies investigating total hip arthroplasty being performed for malignancy or hip fractures were excluded from the review. Twenty-eight studies were included in the final review. All studies underwent a quality appraisal using the GRADE tool. The systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Increasing surgeon volume was associated with a shorter length of stay , lower costs , and lower dislocation rates. Studies showed a significant association between an increasing surgeon volume and higher odds of early-term and midterm survivorship , but not long-term survivorships. Although complications were reported and recorded differently in studies , there was a general trend toward a lower postoperative morbidity with regard to complications following surgeries by a high-volume surgeon. This systematic review shows evidence of a trend toward better postoperative outcomes with high-volume surgeons. Future prospective studies are needed to better determine long-term postoperative outcomes such as survivorship before healthcare policies such as regionalization and/or equal-access healthcare systems can be considered.
