  The newly emerging , highly pathogenic avian influenza<pathogen> ( HPAI) H5N8<pathogen> virus<pathogen> of clade 2.3.4.4 was recently detected in wild birds and domestic poultry in Egypt in the 2016/2017 winter season. Vaccination based on commercial H5 vaccines is used as an essential control strategy in Egyptian poultry. Here , we studied the efficacy of the eight most common commercial H5 poultry vaccines in the Egyptian market and compared them with an experimental vaccine based on the Egyptian LPAI H5N8<pathogen> virus<pathogen> that was prepared by using reverse genetics. The experimental vaccine and Re-5 commercial vaccine were able to completely protect chickens and significantly reduce virus<pathogen> shedding. Our results indicate that most of the commercial poultry H5 vaccines used in the present study were ineffective because the seed viruses<pathogen> in these vaccines are genetically distinct from the H5N8<pathogen> viruses<pathogen> currently circulating in Egypt. Although some of the commercial vaccines protected chickens from mortality , they failed to prevent chickens from shedding the virus.<pathogen> Accordingly , we recommend updating and reinforcing the H5N8<pathogen> prevention and control strategies in Egypt. The vaccination strategy should be reconsidered based on currently circulating
