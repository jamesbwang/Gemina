  measuring the quality of primary palliative care for older people with dementia in different countries is important to identify areas where improvements can be made. using quality indicators ( QIs) , we systematically investigated the overall quality of primary palliative care for older people with dementia in three different countries. a mortality follow-back survey through nation- and region-wide representative Sentinel Networks of General Practitioners ( GPs) in Belgium , Italy and Spain. GPs registered all patient deaths in their practice. We applied a set of nine QIs developed through literature review and expert consensus. patients aged 65 or older , who died non-suddenly with mild or severe dementia as judged by GPs ( n = 874). findings showed significantly different QI scores between Belgium and Italy for regular pain measurement ( mild dementia: BE = 44 % , IT = 12 % , SP = 50 % | severe dementia: BE = 41 % , IT = 9 % , SP = 47 %) , acceptance of approaching death ( mild: BE = 59 % , IT = 48 % , SP = 33 % | severe: BE = 41 % , IT = 21 % , SP = 20 %) , patient-GP communication about illness ( mild: BE = 42 % , IT = 6 % , SP = 20 %) and involvement of specialised palliative services ( mild: BE = 60 % , IT = 20 % , SP = 77 %). The scores in Belgium differed from Italy and Spain for patient-GP communication about medical treatments ( mild: BE = 34 % , IT = 12 % , SP = 4 %) and repeated multidisciplinary consultations ( mild: BE = 39 % , IT = 5 % , SP = 8 % | severe: BE = 36 % , IT = 10 % , SP = 8 %). The scores for relative-GP communication , patient death outside hospitals and bereavement counselling did not differ between countries. while the countries studied differed considerably in the overall quality of primary palliative care , they have similarities in room for improvement , in particular , pain measurement and prevention of avoidable hospitalisations.
