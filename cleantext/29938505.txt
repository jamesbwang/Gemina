  Free flow electrophoresis is a versatile technique for the continuous separation of mixtures with both preparative and analytical applications. Microscale versions of free flow electrophoresis are particularly attractive strategies because of their fast separation times , ability to work with small sample volumes , and large surface area to volume ratios facilitating rapid heat transfer , thus minimizing the detrimental effects of Joule heating even at high voltages. The resolution of microscale free flow electrophoresis , however , is limited by the broadening of the analyte beam in the microfluidic channel , an effect that becomes especially pronounced when the analyte is deflected significantly away from its original position. Here , we describe and demonstrate how restricting spatially the sample injection and collection to the regions where the gradients in the velocity distribution of the carrier medium are the smallest allows this broadening effect to be substantially suppressed and hence the resolution of microscale free flow electrophoresis devices to be increased. To demonstrate this concept , we fabricated microfluidic free flow electrophoresis devices with spatially restricted injection nozzles implemented through the use of multilayer soft-photolithography and further integrated quartz based observation areas for fluorescent detection and imaging. With these devices , we demonstrated a 5-fold reduction in the extent of beam broadening relative to conventional free flow electrophoresis approaches with nonrestricted sample introduction. The manifold enhancement in the achievable resolution of microscale free flow electrophoresis devices opens up the possibility of rapid separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
