  Apatinib is a novel oral , anti-tumor , angiogenic-targeting drug that can selectively target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2). In clinical trials , this new tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for a variety of malignancies. Currently , there is a lack of studies of patients with thymic carcinoma; therefore , we present a case of advanced thymic carcinoma treated with apatinib after chemotherapy failure with multiple lung metastases. This patient has been taking a dose of 500 mg of apatinib per day , and his efficacy has achieved partial response ( PR) , according to the RECIST 1.1 standard , and progression-free survival ( PFS) is 6.3 months at this point. Apatinib will continue as his maintenance treatment. During the treatment , drug-related toxicity and side effects were tolerable. Thus , apatinib may be a meaningful option for the treatment of advanced metastatic thymic carcinoma after chemotherapy failure.
