  None South China. To address this problem , we genotyped 39 colonies ( two colonies were collapsed due to genetic similarity) using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequencing to compare colony genetic structure of An analysis of the colony genotypes showed that the genetic diversity of the mainland population was slightly higher than that of the island<disease> populations but not significantly so. However , the observed heterozygosity on Shangchuan Island ( SCD) was significantly lower than that of the other colonies. We also found six haplotypes in 111 mitochondrial DNA COI sequences. The relatedness ( Our study suggests that there was no significant difference in the genetic diversity among the islands and the mainland; however , the lower genetic diversity , the higher degree of genetic divergence from other colonies , and the higher relatedness among nestmates made the SCD population stand out from all the others.
