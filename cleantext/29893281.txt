  Given concerns about attrition and career outcomes of academic radiation oncologists , we sought to gather empirical evidence regarding mentorship experiences. We surveyed academic radiation oncologists in the United States and Canada who were within 5 years of board certification , using a pretested questionnaire that included 14 questions evaluating the following aspects of mentorship: relationship development , peer mentorship , satisfaction with mentorship , sponsorship , relationship nature , informal interactions , mentoring roles , presence of a primary mentor , and primary mentor characteristics. We described responses and evaluated associations with gender in separate multivariable regression models that adjusted for years in practice , nature of research , possession of higher degrees , and race. Of 347 faculty surveyed , 221 responded ( 64 % response rate); 66 % of respondents were men. Over half of respondents indicated difficulty in identifying role models ( 56 % , n = 124); just under half reported ease in developing mentoring relationships ( 49 % , n = 108). Peer-mentor use was commonly reported ( 62 % , n = 138). Most respondents ( 66 % , n = 145) spent â‰¤ 1 hour per month meeting with mentors. Only 51 % ( n = 112) reported having a primary mentor. Just under half of all respondents reported being very or somewhat satisfied with their mentorship experiences ( 49 % , n = 108). These findings suggest a need for academic radiation oncology departments to facilitate mentorship of all junior faculty through deliberate , structured programs , with training of mentors and mentees alike. It is heartening that substantial rates of sponsorship and peer-mentorship use were reported , which may serve as the grounding for further initiatives.
