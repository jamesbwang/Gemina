  The discovery of mutations within genes associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson 's disease allowed for the identification of PINK1/Parkin regulated mitophagy as an important pathway for the removal of damaged mitochondria. While recent studies suggest that AKT-dependent signalling regulates Parkin recruitment to depolarised mitochondria , little is known as to whether this can also regulate PINK1 mitochondrial accumulation and downstream mitophagy. Here , we demonstrate that inhibition of AKT signalling decreases endogenous PINK1 accumulation in response to mitochondria depolarisation , subsequent Parkin recruitment , phosphorylation of ubiquitin , and ultimately mitophagy. Conversely , we show that upon stimulation of AKT signalling via insulin , the mitophagy pathway is increased in SHSY5Y cells. These data suggest that AKT signalling is an upstream regulator of PINK1 accumulation on damaged mitochondria. Importantly , we show that the AKT pathway also regulates endogenous PINK1-dependent mitophagy in human iPSC-derived neurons.
