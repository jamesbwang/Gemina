  Young children make inferences about speakers based on their accents. Here , we show that these accent-based inferences are influenced by information about speakers ' geographic backgrounds. In Experiment 1 , 4- to 6-year-olds ( N = 60) inferred that a speaker would be more likely to have the same cultural preferences as another speaker with the same accent than a speaker with a different accent; in Experiment 2 ( N = 90) , children made similar inferences about speakers ' friendship preferences. Critically , in both experiments , children were less likely to make accent-based inferences when they were told that the speakers all came from different places ( both experiments) or from the same place ( Experiment 2). These results suggest that young children 's accent-based inferences hinge on information about geographic background and provide insight into how and why children make accent-based inferences. These findings are also the first to show that young children use accent to infer other people 's social preferences.
