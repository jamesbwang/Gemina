  MRSA infection following SOT is an important cause of morbidity and mortality , but epidemiology and risk factors for colonization prior to pediatric SOT remain unclear. A retrospective cohort of SOT patients â‰¤ 21 years of age from 2009 to 2014 was evaluated. Demographics , MRSA screens , timing of transplantation , and MRSA infection were abstracted. From 2013 to 2014 , 130 SOT candidates were screened or had known prior MRSA infection. Seventeen patients ( 13 %) were MRSA colonized. Liver transplant candidates were least likely to be colonized ( OR 0.22 , CI: 0.06-0.81 , P = .02); greatest risk of colonization was in lung ( OR 18.7 , CI: 1.9-182.3 , P = .03) , abdominal multivisceral ( OR 7.5 , CI: 1.5-38.6 , P = .02) , and cardiac patients with history of cardiothoracic surgery ( OR 8.0 , CI: 1.7-36.0 , P = .007). In univariable analysis , African American patients were more likely to be colonized ( OR 7.1 , CI: 2.49-19.41 , P = .0005). There were 3 early MRSA infections in screened patients , incidence of 3.9 %; only one in a colonized patient. Thirteen percent of screened pediatric SOT candidates were MRSA colonized , with greatest risk in lung , multivisceral and cardiac patients with prior cardiothoracic surgery. Early MRSA infection occurred in 3.9 % of transplanted patients. Cardiothoracic and multivisceral organ transplant candidates may benefit the most from targeted MRSA screening.
