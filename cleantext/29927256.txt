  A range of unsymmetrical biaryls bearing thiosugars could be synthesized in a one-pot multicomponent approach using one catalytic palladium system that permitted the C-S and C-C bonds to be formed sequentially. The reaction showed a high selectivity and was applied to a broad variety of substrates giving access to novel glycosylated biaryl structures in good yields.
