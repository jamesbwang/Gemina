  The first methodology of ruthenium carboxylate-catalysed single step oxidative cross coupling that challenges the conventional Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions , affording BT and MFBT derivatives in the absence of protecting groups , was developed. Both mono and bi-arylated derivatives are formed in moderate to high yields ( 30-75 %). Innately high selectivity , low catalyst loading and lack of formation of regio-isomers ensure the large-scale synthesis of various photonic and electronic materials employing this method.
