  To compare estimates of the prevalence of mobility and physical function limitations by race and ethnicity using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( MEPS). The sample comprised of 28,854 adults aged â‰¥ 60 from the MEPS ( 2004-2013). Physical function ( limitations in basic and instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL/IADL)) and mobility limitations were assessed by self-report. Non-Hispanic Whites ( NHWs) represented the majority of the sample followed by non-Hispanic Blacks ( NHBs) , Hispanic and non-Hispanic Other ( Other). For mobility limitation , NHBs had the highest prevalence followed by NHWs and Hispanics ( 33.3 % , 28.6 % , and 26.2 % , respectively). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for the primary outcome of mobility limitation. In the adjusted model , Hispanics had lower odds of mobility limitations ( prevalence odds ratio ( POR): 0.78; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = ( 0.67,0.91)) compared with NHWs. For ADL limitations , NHBs had higher odds of having ADLs ( POR: 1.87; 95 % CI = ( 1.44 , 2.44)) when compared with NHWs. This article evaluated the influence of race and ethnicity , on the prevalence of mobility and functional limitations that are not always consistent with expected racial and ethnic differences.
