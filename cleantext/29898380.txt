  To prospectively validate the Chronic Orchialgia Symptom Index ( COSI) , a newly created instrument with 12 questions in 3 domains ( pain , sexual symptoms ( SS) and quality of life ( QOL)). The COSI was given to 170 men with chronic orchialgia at 2 institutions. 78 men repeated the COSI before therapy and 42 repeated it after surgical therapy. Data was analyzed for test/retest internal reliability , internal consistency , floor/ceiling effects , construct validity , responsiveness and linear regression of all questions including age , duration and prior surgeries. The 170 men had a mean age of 44.3 ( range 18-82) and median symptom duration of 24 months ( 3-420). 22.4 % had prior vasectomy , 12.4 % had hernia repair and 12.9 % had other prior surgery. Mean total COSI was 20.0 +/ -7.7 ( range 1-37) with subscores of pain 9.1 +/ -3.5 ( 0-17) , SS 1.82 +/ -1.5 ( 0-5) and QOL 9.0 +/ -4.0 ( 0-15). Test/retest reliability was high with mean retest total score of 21.2 +/ -7.9 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.82. Internal consistency by Cronbach 's alpha was 0.86. There were no floor/ceiling effects for total score. Construct validity showed all items contributed to a good fit model ( p = 0.001). Patient age , duration and prior surgeries did not influence COSI. Finally , the COSI was responsive to improvement after therapy ( mean after treatment 13.5 +/- 9.8 , p = 0.00001). COSI is a valid and clinically relevant symptom index to assess severity of orchialgia symptoms and response to therapy in this challenging patient population.
