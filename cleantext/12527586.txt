  We reported the first case of inoperative thymic adenocarcinoma successfully palliative treated by the double-stent procedure. In a patient who expressed stridor , computed tomography was done and necrotic mediastinal mass , which protrudes into a trachea , was demonstrated. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed tracheal infiltration and 70 % stenosis; therefore , surgical resection was inapplicable. Recanalization with repeated argon plasma coagulation and debridement of necrotic mass was performed , followed by placement of the endotracheal stent , radiotherapy , and chemotherapy. After 1 year , the patient developed gastric aspiration and tracheoesophageal fistula<disease>; therefore , the esophageal stent was placed. The outcome was lethal , but the placement of endotracheal stent significantly increased a length of survival for the patient with invasive thymic adenocarcinoma.
