  Trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody against HER2 , has become standard of care for metastatic HER2-overexpressing esophagogastric adenocarcinoma and is currently investigated as ( neo) adjuvant treatment option in HER2-positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. The HER2 status is commonly determined on archived material of the primary tumor. However , this status may change over the course of treatment or disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of HER2 status in esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) in patients with resectable and recurrent disease , and to determine the associations of these changes with clinical outcome. Discordance , defined as any change in HER2 status between matched biopsy and post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy resection specimen (
