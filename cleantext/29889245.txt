  There is a clear association between alcohol use and offending behaviour and significant police time is spent on alcohol-related incidents. This study aimed to test the feasibility of a trial of screening and brief intervention in police custody suites to reduce heavy drinking and re-offending behaviour. We achieved target recruitment and high brief intervention delivery if this occurred immediately after screening. Low rates of return for counselling and retention at follow-up were challenges for a definitive trial. Conversely , high consent rates for access to police data suggested at least some outcomes could be measured remotely. A three-armed pilot Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial with an embedded qualitative interview-based process evaluation to explore acceptability issues in six police custody suites ( north east and south west<disease> of the UK). Interventions included: 1. Screening only ( Controls) , 2. 10 min Brief Advice 3. Brief Advice plus 20 min of brief Counselling. Of 3330 arrestees approached: 2228 were eligible for screening ( 67 %) and 720 consented ( 32 %); 386 ( 54 %) scored 8 + on AUDIT; and 205 ( 53 %) were enroled ( 79 controls , 65 brief advice and 61 brief counselling). Follow-up rates at 6 and 12 months were 29 % and 26 % , respectively. However , routinely collected re-offending data were obtained for 193 ( 94 %) participants. Indices of deprivation data were calculated for 184 ( 90 %) participants; 37.6 % of these resided in the 20 % most deprived areas of UK. Qualitative data showed that all arrestees reported awareness that participation was voluntary , that the trial was separate from police work , and the majority said trial procedures were acceptable. Despite hitting target recruitment and same-day brief intervention delivery , a future trial of alcohol screening and brief intervention in a police custody setting would only be feasible if routinely collected re-offending and health data were used for outcome measurement.
