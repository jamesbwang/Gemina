  A large proportion of people who are HIV<pathogen> positive do not know their serostatus because facility-based provider-initiated HIV<pathogen> testing and counseling , and voluntary counseling and testing , have not been efficiently implemented in China. Therefore , a new HIV<pathogen> testing strategy must be developed to improve testing services so that more HIV<pathogen> infections can be detected earlier. In this study , we established an anonymous internet-aided urine-based HIV<pathogen> testing service for men who have sex with men ( MSM) from 1 April 2016 to 20 January 2017. In total , 3092 urine sample collection packs were distributed by grassroots organizations to MSM; 1977 ( 69.3 %) packs were mailed back to the laboratory; and 1911 ( 96.7 %) eligible samples were tested for HIV<pathogen> antibody. The rate of HIV<pathogen> antibody positivity was 7.1 % ( 135/1901) , excluding 10 previously-identified HIV<pathogen> infections. Of those tested , 65.4 % ( 1243/1901) participants obtained their results from our website , 94 ( 69.6 %) of 135 newly-identified urine HIV<pathogen> antibody-positive participants were contacted by CDC staff , and 61.7 % ( 58/94) reported undergoing blood HIV<pathogen> antibody confirmation testing after learning of their urine HIV<pathogen> antibody test results. Of those who were tested for venous HIV<pathogen> antibody , 84.5 % ( 49/58) reported being confirmed HIV<pathogen> antibody positive. Thirty-six of the newly diagnosed participants were successfully referred to a hospital to receive antiretroviral therapy. The rate of confirmed HIV<pathogen> antibody positivity was estimated to be 72.8-89.2 times of that of routine HIV<pathogen> antibody testing. In conclusion , this approach offers an alternative efficient HIV<pathogen> testing strategy to identify HIV<pathogen> positive persons in vulnerable populations.
