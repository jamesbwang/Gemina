  Perceptions , thoughts , and actions unfold over millisecond timescales , while learned behaviors can require many days to mature. While recent experimental advances enable large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high temporal fidelity , it remains a formidable challenge to extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor component analysis ( TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected , low-dimensional descriptions of neural data: neuron factors , reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors , reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions , thoughts , and actions within each trial; and trial factors , describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks , large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation , and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning.
