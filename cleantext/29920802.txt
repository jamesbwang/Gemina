  Contact dermatitis<disease> from topical antiseptic use has been reported mostly in adults , but rare cases of chlorhexidine contact dermatitis<disease> have also been described in young children. To evaluate contact allergic dermatitis<disease> to antiseptics in young children. The children mostly referred for a misdiagnose ( cellulitis<disease> were patch tested with a selection of the European baseline series , an antiseptics series and the personal topical products used. Fourteen children ( 8 boys , 6 girls) received a diagnosis of contact dermatitis<disease> to antiseptics between May 2010 and December 2017. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 months ( 8 months to 8 years); three children only had a personal history of atopy. Chlorhexidine gluconate was positive in seven cases , and benzalkonium chloride in eight cases , and in four cases , both allergens were positive. These small case series confirm that both chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride are implicated in contact dermatitis<disease> from antiseptic use in the paediatric population. We emphasize the initial misdiagnose of these patients , the very young age of the children and the allergenic potential of common antiseptics in non-atopic children. We hypothesize that the systematic use of antiseptics for umbilical cord care could be responsible for the sensitization in newborns.
