  In the current paper , we sought to clarify when and why Asian Americans/Canadians and European Americans/Canadians differ in self-consistency ( the consistency of personality traits across situations). European Canadian ( n = 220) and second-generation Asian Canadian ( n = 166) undergraduates ( Mage = 19 years) described the traits they expressed and the traits others wanted them to express ( i.e. , injunctive norms , or injunctions) in four different social situations ( i.e. , with parents , with friends , with siblings , and with professors). Self-consistency was greater among European Canadians than Asian Canadians , but only when comparing behavior with parents versus with peers ( i.e. , friends and siblings). The same pattern was found for injunctive consistency ( cross-situational consistency of trait injunctions). Injunctions strongly predicted the behavior of both Asian and European Canadians , but because the injunctions from parents versus peers diverged more for Asian Canadians , so did their behaviors. Controlling for the effect of inconsistent injunctions across situations eliminated the ethnic difference in self-consistency. Finally , Asian Canadians who perceived their immigrant parents as embracing a Canadian identity were as cross-situationally consistent as European Canadians because they tended to behave-and believe their parents approved of their behaving-with parents similarly to how they behaved with peers ( e.g. , more carefree and outspoken). Contrary to previous theorizing , cultural influences on broad cognitive or motivational dispositions ( e.g. , dialecticism , collectivism) alone can not explain the observed pattern of ethnic differences in consistency. To understand when bicultural individuals are less consistent across situations also requires an understanding of the specific situations across which they tend to encounter divergent social norms.
