  In this work , we demonstrate the feasibility of gold bipyramidal-shaped nanoparticles ( AuBPs) to be used as active plasmonic nanoplatforms for the detection of the biotin-streptavidin interaction in aqueous solution via both Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance and Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering ( LSPR/SERS). Our proof of concept exploits the precise attachment of the recognition element at the tips of AuBPs , where the electromagnetic field is stronger , which is beneficial to the surface sensitivity of longitudinal LSPR on the local refractive index and to the electromagnetic enhancement of SERS activity , too. Indeed , successive red shifts of the longitudinal LSPR associated with increased local refractive index reveal the attachment of para-aminothiophenol ( p-ATP) chemically labeled Biotin to the Au surface and the specific capture of the target protein by biotin-functionalized AuBPs. Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations based on the reconstructed index of refraction confirm LSPR measurements. However , the molecular identification of the biotin-streptavidin interaction remains elusive by LSPR investigation alone. Remarkably , we succeeded to complement the LSPR detection with reliable SERS measurements which permitted to ( a) certify the molecular identification of biotin-streptavidin interaction and ( b) extend the limit of detection of streptavidin in solution toward 10
