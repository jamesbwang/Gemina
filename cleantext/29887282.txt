  Family-witnessed resuscitation ( FWR) offers the option for family to be present during a cardiac arrest , which has been proven to help them in their grieving process. International guidelines highlight the importance of FWR , but this has not yet been widely implemented in clinical practice in Europe. Explore nurses ' and physicians ' experiences and attitudes toward FWR in cardiac care units. Cross-sectional web-based multicentre survey study including the seven university hospitals in Sweden , with 189 participants. The most common concern was that family were very likely to interfere during resuscitation ( 61 %). Physicians opposed FWR more strongly than nurses ( 3.22 vs. 2.93 , p < .001). Twenty-five percent stated that family should not be present during resuscitation , as it would be far too painful for them , while 23 % of the nurses and 11 % of the physicians considered that FWR is beneficial to the patient , p < 0.001. There was strong agreement that there should always be a healthcare professional dedicated to take care of family ( 92 %). None of the hospitals had local guidelines regarding FWR. Many concerns still exist in relation to FWR , suggesting that those barriers must be taken into consideration when planning for implementation of FWR in everyday practice.
