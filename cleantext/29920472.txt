  Multiple myeloma ( MM) is a disease of unknown , complex etiology that affects primarily older adults. The course of the disease and the patients ' survival time are very heterogeneous , but over the last decade , clear progress in the treatment of this incurable disease has been observed. Therapeutics that have proven to be highly effective include the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide and its newer analogs , lenalidomide and pomalidomide , as well as the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However , the administration of some of the treatments , e.g. , thalidomide or bortezomib , has also been associated with the occurrence of a serious and common adverse effect , drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism of the development of the peripheral neuropathy is poorly understood. Nevertheless , one of its potential causes could be inadequate concentrations of crucial trophic factors , including neurotrophic and/or angiogenic factors , which are responsible for the proliferation , differentiation , survival and death of neuronal and nonneuronal cells.
