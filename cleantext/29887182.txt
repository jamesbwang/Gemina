  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombectomy using myocardial biopsy forceps for the treatment of acute limb ischemia ( ALI). A retrospective review of 11 ALI patients ( 12 affected limbs , 18 affected vessels) who underwent thrombectomy using biopsy forceps between November 2011 and April 2016 was performed. Of the 12 affected limbs , 2 limbs had stent thrombosis , 1 limb had thrombotic occlusion at a de novo stenosis site , and 9 limbs had embolic ALI. Biopsy forceps were used for angiographically limited arterial flow that persisted after the use of an aspiration catheter and conventional balloon angioplasty. The general technique for use of the biopsy forceps included advancement in parallel to a guidewire to the thrombus site , grasping of the thrombus with the forceps , and confirmation of grasping the thrombus with injection of a contrast medium prior to thrombus extraction. Partial or total retrieval of the thrombus was angiographically confirmed in 12 of the 18 affected vessels , with restoration of normal blood flow in 11 vessels. Unsuccessful results in the remaining 6 affected vessels appeared to be due to friction at the aortoiliac bifurcation caused by the contralateral approach , small vessel size , or curvature of the anterior tibial artery. None of the 18 treated vessels had any complications such as dissection or perforation of the target vessel wall and distal emboli. None of the surviving patients required major or minor amputation. Thrombectomy using biopsy forceps is a feasible technique for removal of an arterial thrombus in patients with ALI.
