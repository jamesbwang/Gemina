  Peptide nucleic acid ( PNA) is a powerful biomolecule with a wide variety of important applications. In this work , the molecular structures and binding affinity of PNA with a D-prolyl-2-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid backbone ( acpcPNA) that binds to both DNA and RNA were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulated structures of acpcPNA-DNA and acpcPNA-RNA duplexes more closely resembled the typical structures of B-DNA and A-RNA than the corresponding duplexes of aegPNA. The calculated binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental results that the acpcPNA-DNA duplex is more stable than the acpcPNA-RNA duplex regardless of the base sequences. The results provide further insights in the relationship between structure and stability of this unique PNA system.
