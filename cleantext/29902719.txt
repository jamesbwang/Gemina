  In light of the emergence of resistance against the currently available EGFR inhibitors , our study focuses on tackling this problem through the development of dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors with improved enzymatic affinities. Guided by the binding mode of the marketed dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor , Lapatinib , we proposed the design of dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors based on the 6-phenylthieno ( 2,3-d) pyrimidine as a core scaffold and hinge binder. After two cycles of screening aiming to identify the optimum aniline headgroup and solubilizing group , we eventually identified 27b as a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor with IC
