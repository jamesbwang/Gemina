  To establish the method of determination of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol ( 3-MCPD) in grease food by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). 3-MCPD in grease food represented by bean paste was extracted by ultrasound , purified by alkaline earth solid phase extraction column , derivatived using phenylboronic acid ( PBA) and detected by GC-MS. The linearity of 3-MCPD ranged from 1-100 ng/mL , with correlation coefficient at 0. 9993. The limits of quantitation ( LOQ) in soy sauce , bean paste , pepper oil were 0. 6,0. 5 and7. 0 μg/kg and limits of detection ( LOD) were 1. 9,1. 6 and 18. 8 μg/kg , respectively.Average recovery rate and relative standard deviation was 78. 3 % -106. 7 % and 1. 9 % -11. 6 % ( n = 6) , when 3-MCPD was added in grease food at 2. 5-1000 μg/kg. The method has good purification effect and the detection sensitivity and accuracy , and can be used for the determination of 3-MCPD in grease food.
