  Metastatic breast cancer is typically an extremely aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Metastasis requires the orchestration of homeostatic factors and cellular programs , many of which are potential therapeutic targets. Luteolin ( 2- ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) -5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone) , is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables that exhibits many anticancer properties. Luteolin obstructs metastasis through both direct and indirect mechanisms. For instance , luteolin may suppress breast cancer invasion by acting as an antiangiogenic therapeutic inhibiting VEGF production and its receptor 's activity. Furthermore , luteolin decreases epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and metastatic proclivity. Luteolin also acts as an antiproliferative by suppressing receptor tyrosine-kinase activity and apoptosis , both of which could prevent incipient colonization of breast cancer. Many of these antimetastatic characteristics accredited to luteolin are likely functionally related. For instance , the PI3K/Akt pathway , which is impeded by luteolin , has several downstream programs involved in increased proliferation , survival , and metastatic potential in breast cancer. In this review , luteolin 's ability to ameliorate breast cancer is summarized. The paper also offers insight into the molecular mechanisms by which luteolin may suppress breast cancer metastasis.
