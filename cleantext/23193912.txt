  Fentanyl is one of the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic agents during cancer resection surgery , but the effect of fentanyl on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of microRNA 302b ( miR-302b) in the anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of fentanyl in ESCC. In the present study , the effects of fentanyl on cell proliferation , apoptosis and invasion were detected using MTT assays , flow cytometry and Transwell assays in ESCC Eca109 and TE1 cell lines. Subsequently , expression of miR-302b was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were performed in order to evaluate the expression of ErbB4 , a target of miR-302b. Furthermore , anti-miR were used to inhibit miR-302b in fentanyl-treated ESCC cells in order to evaluate the role of miR-302b in the effect of fentanyl on malignant behaviors. Fentanyl inhibited the proliferation of Eca109 and TE1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Following exposure to fentanyl for 48 h , Eca109 and TE1 cells exhibited increased apoptosis and decreased invasion. Furthermore , fentanyl upregulated miR-302b expression , but downregulated ErbB4 expression. Finally , loss of miR-302b using the anti-miR technique reversed the effect of fentanyl on cell proliferation , apoptosis and invasion in the two ESCC cell lines. Taken together , the results of the present study indicated that fentanyl inhibits the proliferation and invasion of ESCC cells through upregulation of miR-302b.
