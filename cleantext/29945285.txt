  In severely injured patients , trauma-induced coagulopathy ( TIC) present at hospital admission is associated with increased transfusion requirements , morbidity and mortality. Early and effective treatment contributes to improved survival rates. Laboratory coagulation assays have long turn-around times and evidence for their usefulness , especially in the context of TIC , is weak. Due to the lack of appropriate guidance , transfusion of allogeneic blood products frequently follows a ratio-based concept ( e.g. , transfusion of erythrocytes and plasma in a 1: 1 ratio). Point-of-care ( PoC) tests enable the assessment of prothrombin time ( PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time in few minutes. However , although normal PT in these tests allows to rule out relevant effects of several anticoagulants , they are not able to detect patients with TIC and/or requiring subsequent massive transfusion. Viscoelastic tests ( VETs) make it possible to assess defects in thrombin generation , hypofibrinogenaemia , thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and hyperfibrinolysis , and thus enable targeted therapy. Impairment of platelet function is the common blind spot not detectable using both standard laboratory-based tests and VETs. However , PoC platelet function tests enable to detect platelet defects and patients taking anti-platelet. Furthermore , impaired platelet function has been identified as a strong predictor for coagulopathy and massive transfusion in trauma patients. In other clinical settings , coagulation management based on VETs is associated with decreased transfusion requirements , incidence of acute kidney failure , and mortality , respectively. Data of the first small prospective randomised trial indicate superiority of VET guided coagulation management solely using coagulation factor concentrates , when compared to plasma transfusions in severe trauma.
