  The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of using tibial nails inserted by the suprapatellar approach with tibial nails inserted by the infrapatellar approach in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed ( 1966 to January 2018) , EMBASE ( 1974 to January 2018) , Cochrane Library ( January 2018) , Web of Science ( 1990 to January 2018). We also used Google Search Engine to search more potentially eligible studies until January 2018. The methodological qualities of included studies were assessed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Cochrane Collaboration for Systematic Reviews. The statistical analysis all of included studies were performed by STATA 13.0 software. The outcomes were total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , postoperative pain , range of motion ( ROM) , Lysholm knee score , fluoroscopy time , operation time , and postoperative complications. Four RCTs published between 2015 and 2017 were selected in the meta-analysis. There was a significant difference between suprapatellar and infrapatellar approach surgery in total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , postoperative pain , ROM , Lysholm knee scores , and fluoroscopy times. The suprapatellar approach for intramedullary nailing appears superior to the infrapatellar approach , with a reduction in total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , improved postoperative pain , shorter fluoroscopy time , and better knee functionality outcomes. There was no increased incidence of postoperative complications between the 2 groups. Further research remains necessary.
