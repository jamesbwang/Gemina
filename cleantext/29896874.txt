  Self-rated health ( SRH) is an indicator of health status. It is a determinant of health-promoting behaviors and predictor of morbidity and mortality. Yet , little is known about the association between SRH and ideal cardiovascular health ( CVH) as measured by the American Heart Association Life 's Simple Seven ( LS7) metrics , or whether the relation of SRH and CVH differ by race/ethnicity. Favorable SRH is associated with better CVH. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 6457 men and women of 4 race/ethnicities who participated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. SRH was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ( excellent , very good , good , fair and poor). CVH was assessed using the LS7 metrics , each scored from 0-2 , with a total score ranging from 0-14. Scores of 0-8 indicate inadequate , 9-10 , average and 11-14 , optimal CVH. Odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the associations between SRH and CVH scores using multinomial logistic regression , adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , education , income , marital status , health insurance , and chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Mean age ( SD) of participants was 62 ( 10) years; 53 % were women. The odds of ideal CVH increased as SRH improved. Compared with poor-fair SRH , the adjusted ORs for optimal CVH by SRH status were: excellent 4.9 ( 3.4-7.0); very good 2.2 ( 1.6-3.1); good 1.5 ( 1.1-2.1). Results were similar by race/ethnic , sex , and age groups. A more favorable SRH was associated with better CVH irrespective of sex , race/ethnicity or age. Further research could explore whether optimization of SRH predicts CVH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
