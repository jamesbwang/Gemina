  The Internet of Things refers to network-enabled technologies , including mobile and wearable devices , which are capable of sensing and actuation as well as interaction and communication with other similar devices over the Internet. The IoT is profoundly redefining the way we create , consume , and share information. Ordinary citizens increasingly use these technologies to track their sleep , food intake , activity , vital signs , and other physiological statuses. This activity is complemented by IoT systems that continuously collect and process environment-related data that has a bearing on human health. This synergy has created an opportunity for a new generation of healthcare solutions.
