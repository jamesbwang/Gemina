  The glucose transporter GLUT1 , a plasma membrane protein that mediates glucose homeostasis in mammalian cells , is responsible for constitutive uptake of glucose into many tissues and organs. Many studies have focused on its vital physiological functions and close relationship with diseases. However , the molecular mechanisms of its activation and transport are not clear , and its detailed distribution pattern on cell membranes<symptom> also remains unknown. To address these , we first investigated the distribution and assembly of GLUT1 at a nanometer resolution by super-resolution imaging. On HeLa cell membranes<symptom> , the transporter formed clusters with an average diameter of ∼ 250 nm , the majority of which were regulated by lipid rafts , as well as being restricted in size by both the cytoskeleton and glycosylation. More importantly , we found that the activation of GLUT1 by azide or MβCD did not increase its membrane expression but induced the decrease of the large clusters. The results suggested that sporadic distribution of GLUT1 may facilitate the transport of glucose , implying a potential association between the distribution and activation. Collectively , our work characterized the clustering distribution of GLUT1 and linked its spatial structural organization to the functions , which would provide insights into the activation mechanism of the transporter.
