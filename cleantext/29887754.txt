  The nonlinear response of a reduced model of an orthotropic single-layered plate with thermomechanical coupling is investigated in the presence of thermal excitations , in addition to mechanical ones. Different issues are addressed via accurate and extended local and global analyses. ( i) Assessing the possible occurrence , disappearance or modification of mechanical buckling as a result of thermal aspects; ( ii) exploiting global dynamics to unveil the effects of coupling; ( iii) highlighting the crucial role played by the slow thermal transient evolution in modifying the fast steady mechanical response; ( iv) framing the influence of coupling and underlining the need to use a thermomechanical model to grasp the actual plate dynamics; and ( v) getting hints of technical interest as to the outcome robustness with respect to variations in the external/internal thermal parameters.
