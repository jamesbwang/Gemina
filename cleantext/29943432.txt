  Herein we describe the synthesis of lipophilic triphosphate prodrugs of abacavir , carbovir , and their 1 ' ,2 '- cis-substituted carbocyclic analogues. The 1 ' ,2 '- cis-carbocyclic nucleosides were prepared by starting from enantiomerically pure ( 1R ,2 S) -2- ( ( benzyloxy) methyl) cyclopent-3-en-1-ol by a microwave-assisted Mitsunobu-type reaction with 2-amino-6-chloropurine. All four nucleoside analogues were prepared from their 2-amino-6-chloropurine precursors. The nucleosides were converted into their corresponding nucleoside triphosphate prodrugs ( TriPPPro approach) by application of the H-phosphonate route. The TriPPPro compounds were hydrolyzed in different media , in which the formation of nucleoside triphosphates was proven. While the TriPPPro compounds of abacavir and carbovir showed increased antiviral activity over their parent nucleoside , the TriPPPro compounds of the 1 ' ,2 '- cis-substituted analogues as well as their parent nucleosides proved to be inactive against
