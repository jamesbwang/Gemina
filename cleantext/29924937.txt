  Desmoplakin ( DSP) , the most abundant component of desmosomes which maintain the mechanical integrity of epithelium , is a GWAS-identified genetic risk locus in human idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). IPF subjects express a significantly higher level of DSP than control subjects. Determine potential mechanisms by which DSP is regulated in lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> Methods: Matrigel-coated soft and stiff polyacrylamide gels were made to simulate the stiffness of normal and fibrotic lungs. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) were used to evaluate transcription factor binding to the DSP promoter. Targeted DNA methylation was achieved by CRISPR/dCas9-mediated DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3A expression under the guidance of sequence-specific sgRNAs. Stiff matrix promotes DSP gene expression in both human and rodent lung epithelial cells as compared to soft matrix. A conserved region in the proximal DSP promoter is hypermethylated under soft matrix conditions and becomes hypo-/ de-methylated under stiff matrix conditions. Demethylation of this conserved DSP promoter region is associated with transactivation of transcription factor EGR1 , resulting in EGR1-dependent DSP overexpression. Targeted DNA methylation by CRISPR/deactivated Cas9 ( dCas9)/ DNA methyltransferase 3A ( Dnmt3A)- mediated epigenome editing blocks EGR1 binding to the DSP promoter and inhibits stiff matrix-induced DSP overexpression. DSP is a matrix stiffness-regulated mechanosensitive gene. CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt 3A-mediated epigenome editing reverses DSP overexpression by re-establishment of the epigenetic control of DSP under the mechanically homeostatic environment. It provides a useful tool for investigations of the functional role of DSP in the pathogenesis of
