  The benefits of treating subclinical hypothyroidism are currently under debate , prevention of adverse cardiac events purporting to be one of the main benefits. The effect of subclinical hypothyroidism on the cardiovascular health of the Indian sub-population is largely unknown. This study was designed to examine these effects and to help guide treatment of this disorder. A cross-sectional adult population survey was carried out in urban coastal area of central Kerala. 986 volunteers underwent complete biochemical and physical examinations , 110 were found to have subclinical hypothyroidism ( 8.9 %). The ten-year risk of an adverse cardiac event , was calculated using the Framingham score algorithm. Eligible subclinical hypothyroid subjects ( This population was found to have high baseline levels of diabetes 19.5 % , hypercholesterolemia 57.2 % and systolic hypertension 24.6 %. No association was found between subclinical hypothyroid status or rising TSH and Framingham 10-year risk. While no difference between groups was noted with respect to lipid profile , a rising TSH was found to be significantly correlated with mild worsening of the lipid profile. A significant positive correlation was found between skinfold thickness and TSH. Subclinical hypothyroidism is not a contributing factor to elevated Framingham risk in this population , and while a mild effect was observed on the lipid profile , its effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. We hypothesize that in this population a genetic component may be responsible for the uniquely high rates of metabolic syndrome<disease> and other endocrine diseases.
