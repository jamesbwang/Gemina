  Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer ( EBVaGC) has traditionally been associated with high expression of PD-L1 and immune infiltration. Correlations between PD-L1 and other immune-related gene ( IRG) expressions in EBVaGC have not been previously described. We performed NanoString We identified 71 cases of EBVaGC and 193 EBV-negative ACRG samples as controls. EBVaGC showed higher expression of all queried immune genes compared to EBVnegACRG samples ( p < 0.01). PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression correlated with PD-L1 transcript expression ( r = 0.63 , p < 0.001). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte<symptom> patterns were also found to be different between PD-L1 A substantial proportion of EBVaGC does not express high levels of PD-L1 and other immune genes. EBVaGCs which have lower transcriptomic expression of PD-L1 tend to have a similarly low expression of other immune genes , IHC scores and a poorer prognosis.
