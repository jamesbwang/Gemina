  The objective of this study was to develop a nanodelivery system containing a mucoadhesive polymer hyaluronic acid ( HA) for oral delivery. Metformin was used as a model drug. Blank and drug-loaded HA nanostructures were prepared by precipitation method and characterized for particle size ( PS) , zeta potential ( ZP) , physical stability ( over 65 days) , surface morphology , moisture content , and physical state of the drug in the nanostructures. The cytotoxicity and hemolysis<symptom> potential of the delivery system was assessed in Caco-2 cells and whole human blood , respectively. The in vitro release of metformin and its uptake in Caco-2 cells was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography. Ex vivo permeability of metformin was measured through goat intestinal membrane. The nanoparticles were physically stable and neutrally charged with an average PS of 114.53 Â± 12.01 nm. This nanodelivery system existed as nanofibers containing metformin in a crystalline state. This delivery system released the drug rapidly with > 50 % of metformin released within 1 h. Cellular uptake studies on Caco-2 cells indicated higher uptake of metformin from nanoparticle as compared to metformin in solution , up to first 45 min. Ex vivo permeability studies on the other hand showed a higher metformin permeability from solution relative to that from nanoparticles through the goat intestinal membrane. Metformin nanoparticles were non-toxic at therapeutic concentrations in Caco-2 cells and showed no hemolytic effect to RBCs. This study indicates the preparation , characterization , as well as the potential use of HA nanostructures for oral delivery.
