  In this paper , a highly copper-resistant fungal strain NT-1 was characterized by morphological , physiological , biochemical , and molecular biological techniques. Physiological<symptom> response<symptom> to Cu ( II) stress , effects of environmental factors on Cu ( II) biosorption , as well as mechanisms of Cu ( II) biosorption by strain NT-1 were also investigated in this study. The results showed that NT-1 belonged to the genus Gibberella , which exhibited high tolerance to both acidic conditions and Cu ( II) contamination in the environment. High concentrations of copper stress inhibited the growth of NT-1 to various degrees , leading to the decreases in mycelial biomass and colony diameter , as well as changes in morphology. Under optimal conditions ( initial copper concentration: 200 mg L
