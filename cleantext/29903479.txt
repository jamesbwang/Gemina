  Axillary lymph node ( ALN) status is a key indicator in assessing and determining the treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that sonographic features of a primary tumor have the potential to predict ALN status in the preoperative staging of breast cancer. In this study , a computer-aided prediction ( CAP) model as well as the tumor features for ALN metastasis in breast cancers were developed using breast ultrasound ( US) images. A total of 249 malignant tumors were acquired from 247 female patients ( ages 20-84 years; mean 55 Â± 11 years) to test the differences between the non-metastatic ( 130) and metastatic ( 119) groups based on various features. After applying semi-automatic tumor segmentation , 69 quantitative features were extracted. The features included morphology and texture of tumors inside a ROI of breast US image. By the backward feature selection and linear logistic regression , the prediction model was constructed and established to estimate the likelihood of ALN metastasis for each sample collected. In the experiments , the texture features showed higher performance for predicting ALN metastasis compared to morphology ( Az , 0.730 vs 0.667). The difference , however , was not statistically significant ( p-values > 0.05). Combining the textural and morphological features , the accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , and Az value achieved 75.1 % ( 187/249) , 79.0 % ( 94/119) , 71.5 % ( 93/130) , and 0.757 , respectively. The proposed CAP model , which combines textural and morphological features of primary tumor , may be a useful method to determine the ALN status in patients with breast cancer.
