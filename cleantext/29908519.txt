  In disaster victim identification ( DVI) , DNA profiling is considered to be one of the most reliable and efficient means to identify bodies or separated body parts. This requires a post mortem DNA sample , and an ante mortem DNA sample of the presumed victim or their biological relative ( s). Usually the collection of an adequate ante mortem sample is technically simple , but the acquisition of a good quality post mortem sample under unfavourable DVI circumstances is complicated due to the variable degree of preservation of the human remains and the high risk of DNA ( cross) contamination. This paper provides the community with an efficient method to collect post-mortem DNA samples from muscle , bone , bone<disease> marrow and teeth , with a minimal risk of contamination. Our method has been applied in a recent , challenging DVI operation ( i.e. the identification of the 298 victims of the MH17 airplane crash in 2014). 98,2 % of the collected PM samples provided the DVI team with highly informative DNA genotyping results without the risk of contamination and consequent mistyping the victim 's DNA. Moreover , the method is easy , cheap and quick. This paper provides the DVI community with a step-wise instructions with recommendations for the type of tissue to be sampled and the site of excision ( preferably the upper leg). Although initially designed for DVI purposes , the method is also suited for the identification of individual victims.
