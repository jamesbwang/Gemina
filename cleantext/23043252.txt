  The potentials of the magnetic resonance ( MR) methods in the research of biomedical systems have been demonstrated during the 70 years of its existence. It is presented that the Cuban experience in quantitative magnetic resonance associated with molecular , preclinical and clinical studies of significant diseases and drugs development. MR `` in vitro '' and `` in vivo '' studies of sickle cell disease , the diabetic foot ulcer<disease> , the brain tumor response and the magnetic nano-particle pharmacokinetics , are presented as example. Furthermore , contributions and restrictions of magnetic resonance to diagnostic and optimization of therapeutic pathways are discussed in some concrete cases.
