  Crystalline/particulate substances trigger a plethora of signaling events in host cells. The most prominent consequence is the inflammatory reactions that underlie crystal arthropathies , such as gout and pseudogout. However , their impact on our health was underestimated. Recent work on the role of cholesterol crystal in the development of atherosclerosis and the harm of environmental particulates has set up new frontiers in our defense against their detrimental effects. On the other hand , in the last 100 years , crystalline/particulate substances have been used with increasing frequencies in our daily lives as a part of new industrial manufacturing and engineering. Importantly , they have become a tool in modern medicine , used as vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery vehicles. Their biological effects are also being dissected in great detail , particularly with regard to their inflammatory signaling pathways. Solid structure interaction with host cells is far from being uniform , with outcomes dependent on cell types and chemical/physical properties of the particles involved. In this review , we offer a systematic and broad outlook of this landscape and a sage analysis of the complex nature of this topic.
