  There have been limited data on the impact of hyperuricemia on long-term clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) for in-stent restenosis ( ISR). From January 2009 to July 2015 , 317 patients who underwent repeat PCI for ISR were divided into two groups: patients with normal serum uric acid ( UA) levels ( normal UA group) and patients with higher serum UA levels ( higher UA group). The higher UA group included patients with serum UA levels > 6.8 mg/dL or patients who were taking anti-hyperuricemic medication. During a median follow-up period of 1088 days , the cumulative incidence rates of major adverse event ( MAE) , including a composite of all-cause death , non-fatal myocardial infarction , and any revascularization , were similar between the two groups ( higher UA 36.4 % vs. normal UA 29.9 % , p = 0.389 , log-rank p = 0.367). Follow-up angiographic data showed similar outcomes of late lumen loss ( 0.8 ± 0.9 mm vs. 0.8 ± 1.1 mm , p = 0.895) and binary restenosis rate ( 28.1 % vs. 34.7 % , p = 0.622). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.011 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.003-1.019 , p = 0.006) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction ( HR 0.972 , 95 % CI 0.948-0.996 , p = 0.022) , but not UA levels , to be the independent risk predictors of MAE. Hyperuricemia is not associated with poor clinical outcomes after repeat PCI for ISR
