  We here assessed the in vitro efficacy of the naptho-quinone buparvaquone ( BPQ) against Besnoitia besnoiti tachyzoites in vitro. BPQ is currently licensed for the treatment of theileriosis in cattle in many countries , but not in the EU. In 4-day treatment assays , BPQ massively impaired tachyzoite proliferation with an IC50 of 10 ± 3 nm , and virtually complete inhibition was obtained in the presence of nm BPQ. Exposure to 1 µm BPQ leads to ultrastructural changes affecting initially the mitochondrial matrix and the cristae. After 96 h , most parasites were largely distorted , filled with cytoplasmic amylopectin granules and vacuoles containing components of unknown composition. Host cell mitochondria did not appear to be notably affected by the drug. However , upon prolonged exposure ( 14-16 days) to increased BPQ concentrations , B. besnoiti tachyzoites exhibited the capacity to adapt , and they resumed proliferation at dosages of up to 10 µm BPQ , albeit at a lower rate. These BPQ-adapted parasites maintained this lower susceptibility to BPQ treatment after freeze-thawing , and inspection by the transmission electron microscopy revealed that they underwent proliferation in the absence of structurally intact mitochondria.
