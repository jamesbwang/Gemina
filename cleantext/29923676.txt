  Lower posterior mediastinal tumors are traditionally excised by conventional thoracotomy or thoracoscopic approaches; however , use of the transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneoscopic approach for these tumors has rarely been reported. Herein , we report a case of a left lower posterior mediastinal paravertebral benign schwannoma in an adult male that was successfully treated with transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneoscopic surgery. The patient presented with no symptoms but had noticed a lesion<symptom> in the left lower posterior mediastinum two months prior. He underwent transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneoscopic surgery with total resection of the mediastinal mass. To the best of our knowledge , this is the most detailed and challenging case of transdiaphragmatic retroperitoneoscopic surgery to treat a schwannoma in the left lower posterior mediastinum reported to date.
