  While studying the etiology of multiple sclerosis ( MS) in children has several methodological advantages over studying etiology in adults , studies are limited by small sample sizes. Using a rigorous methodological process , we developed the Pediatric MS Tool-Kit , a measurement framework that includes a minimal set of core variables to assess etiological risk factors. We solicited input from the International Pediatric MS Study Group to select three risk factors: environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS) exposure , sun exposure , and vitamin D intake. To develop the Tool-Kit , we used a Delphi study involving a working group of epidemiologists , neurologists , and content experts from North<pathogen> America and Europe. The Tool-Kit includes six core variables to measure ETS , six to measure sun exposure , and six to measure vitamin D intake. The Tool-Kit can be accessed online ( www.maelstrom-research.org/mica/network/tool-kit). The goals of the Tool-Kit are to enhance exposure measurement in newly designed pediatric MS studies and comparability of results across studies , and in the longer term to facilitate harmonization of studies , a methodological approach that can be used to circumvent issues of small sample sizes. We believe the Tool-Kit will prove to be a valuable resource to guide pediatric MS researchers in developing study-specific questionnaire.
