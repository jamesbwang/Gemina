  Illusory correlations ( IC) are the perception of covariation , where none exists. For example , people associate majorities with frequent behavior and minorities with infrequent behavior even in the absence of such an association. According to the information loss account , ICs result from greater fading of infrequent group-behavior combinations in memory. We conducted computer simulations based on this account which showed that ICs are expected under standard conditions with skewed category frequencies ( i.e. 2:1 ratio for positive and negative descriptions) , but not under conditions with equated category frequencies ( i.e. 1:1 ratio for positive and negative descriptions). Contrary to these simulations , our behavioral experiments revealed an IC under both conditions , which did not decrease over time. Thus , information loss alone is not sufficient as an explanation for the formation of ICs. These results imply that negative items contribute to ICs not only due to their infrequency , but also due to their emotional salience.
