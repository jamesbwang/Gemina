  Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. MALAT1 and SOX9 have important roles in tumour formation and development in several types of cancers. However , little is known about the function and co-relationship of these 2 factors in NSCLC in vivo. To explore the role of MALAT1 and SOX9 expression relationship , their clinical pathological characteristics and OS on NSCLC patients. Paired of primary lung cancer tissues and the matched tumour adjacent tissues were collected in 121 NSCLC patients. MALAT1 and SOX9 mRNA expression was measured by SYBR green q RT-PCR assay. SOX-9 protein expression was measured by streptavidin-peroxidase ( SP) staining method. MALAT1and SOX9 expression was higher in NSCLC tissues than the adjacent tissues , and they have positive correlation. Moreover , SOX9 protein expression was higher in NSCLC tissues , especially in MALAT1 mRNA higher expressed NSCLC tissues. MALAT1 and SOX9 mRNA expression were associated with age ( x MALAT1 and SOX9 could be used as prognostic co-biomarker in NSCLC.
