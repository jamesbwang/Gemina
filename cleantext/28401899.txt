  EPIGEN-Brazil is one of the largest Latin American initiatives at the interface of human genomics , public health , and computational biology. Here , we present two resources to address two challenges to the global dissemination of precision medicine and the development of the bioinformatics know-how to support it. To address the underrepresentation of non-European individuals in human genome diversity studies , we present the EPIGEN-5M +1 KGP imputation panel-the fusion of the public 1000 Genomes Project ( 1KGP) Phase 3 imputation panel with haplotypes derived from the EPIGEN-5M data set ( a product of the genotyping of 4.3 million SNPs in 265 admixed individuals from the EPIGEN-Brazil Initiative). When we imputed a target SNPs data set ( 6487 admixed individuals genotyped for 2.2 million SNPs from the EPIGEN-Brazil project) with the EPIGEN-5M +1 KGP panel , we gained 140,452 more SNPs in total than when using the 1KGP Phase 3 panel alone and 788,873 additional high confidence SNPs (
