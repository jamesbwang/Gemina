  Regulation of gene expression on a post-transcriptional level by small non-coding regulatory RNAs ( sRNAs) is very common in bacteria. sRNAs base pair with sequences in their target messenger RNAs ( mRNAs) and thereby regulate translation initiation or mRNA stability. Specialized RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs) facilitate these regulatory sRNA/mRNA interactions by acting as RNA chaperones. A well-known example for such an RNA chaperone which is widespread in bacteria is the Hfq protein. Recently , the ProQ/FinO protein family was identified as a new class of RNA chaperones involved in sRNA based regulation. Only a few members of this protein family have been structurally characterized so far. In particular , the structural basis for RNA-binding and recognition has not yet been established for this class of proteins. Here , we report the
