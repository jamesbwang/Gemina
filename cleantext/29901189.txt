  The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of scoparone on ischemia‑reperfusion ( I/R) injury in primary cultured cardiac myocytes and rats. An in vivo rat model of I/R injury and an in vitro primary cultured cardiac myocyte model of oxygen‑glucose deprivation/reoxygenation were used to investigate the protective effects of scoparone. Cell viability , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) release , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , creatine kinase ( CK) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production were subsequently measured. In addition , cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl‑transferase‑mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining , and myocardial infarct area ( IA) was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Furthermore , the protein expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl‑2) , Bcl‑2‑associated X protein ( Bax) , cytochrome c ( Cyt C) and caspase‑3 were assessed by western blotting. The results demonstrated that treatment with scoparone markedly increased cell viability , SOD levels and Bcl‑2 protein expression , and decreased LDH release , MDA production , CK levels , ROS concentration , cell apoptotic rate , myocardial IA , and Bax , caspase‑3 and Cyt C protein expression. These findings indicated that scoparone may have a protective effect against I/R injury , thus suggesting that scoparone may be a considered a potential drug for the treatment of I/R injury via the inhibition of oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.
