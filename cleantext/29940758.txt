  The value of adjuvant chemotherapy in T2N0 gastric cancer ( GC) remains controversial. The aim of this retrospective study is to define a high-risk subgroup of pathological T2N0 GC patients and examine the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival ( OS). A total of 225 patients underwent R0 resection for T2N0 gastric adenocarcinoma between 2002 and 2012 and 51/225 ( 22.7 %) of these received adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariate Cox regression identified tumor location in the Upper1/3 of the stomach ( peast one of the independent risk factor listed above , and we found that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved OS for this subgroup.
