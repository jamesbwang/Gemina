  Safety concerns regarding long-acting Î² As members of the joint oversight committee , we performed a combined analysis of the four trials comparing an inhaled glucocorticoid plus a LABA ( combination therapy) with an inhaled glucocorticoid alone. The primary outcome was a composite of asthma-related intubation or death. Post hoc secondary outcomes included serious asthma-related events and asthma exacerbations. Among the 36,010 patients in the intention-to-treat study , there were three asthma-related intubations ( two in the inhaled-glucocorticoid group and one in the combination-therapy group) and two asthma-related deaths ( both in the combination-therapy group) in 4 patients. In the secondary analysis of serious asthma-related events ( a composite of hospitalization , intubation , or death) , 108 of 18,006 patients ( 0.60 %) in the inhaled-glucocorticoid group and 119 of 18,004 patients ( 0.66 %) in the combination-therapy group had at least one composite event ( relative risk in the combination-therapy group , 1.09; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.83 to 1.43; P = 0.55); 2100 patients in the inhaled-glucocorticoid group ( 11.7 %) and 1768 in the combination-therapy group ( 9.8 %) had at least one asthma exacerbation ( relative risk , 0.83; 95 % CI , 0.78 to 0.89; P < 0.001). Combination therapy with a LABA plus an inhaled glucocorticoid did not result in a significantly higher risk of serious asthma-related events than treatment with an inhaled glucocorticoid alone but resulted in significantly fewer asthma exacerbations.
