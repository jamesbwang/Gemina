  The use of plastic materials in daily life , industry , and agriculture can cause soil pollution with plastic fragments down to the micrometer scale , i.e. , microplastics. Quantitative assessment of microplastics in soil has been limited so far. Until now , microplastic analyses in soil require laborious sample cleanup and are mostly restricted to qualitative assessments. In this study , we applied thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry ( TGA-MS) to develop a method for the direct quantitative analysis of poly ( ethylene terephthalate) ( PET) without further sample pretreatment. For this , soil samples containing 1.61 Â± 0.15 wt % organic matter were spiked with 0.23-4.59 wt % PET bottle recyclate microplastics. dl-Cysteine was used as the internal standard ( IS). Sample mixtures were pyrolyzed with a 5 K min
