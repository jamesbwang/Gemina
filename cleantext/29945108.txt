  An effective method to rapidly determine the presence of seven unmetabolized synthetic musks in human urine samples is developed. The target musks are five synthetic polycyclic musks ( i.e. , celestolide ( ADBI) , phantolide ( AHMI) , traseolide ( ATII) , galaxolide ( HHCB) , tonalide ( AHTN)) , and two nitro-aromatic musks ( i.e. , musk xylene ( MX) and musk ketone ( MK)). The method involved an ultrasound-assisted emulsification microextraction ( USAEME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). The factors that affect USAEME efficiency were optimized in detail , and the optimized procedure involved the rapid injection of 50 μL of carbon tetrachloride into 1.0 mL of urine sample ( contained 0.1-g of sodium chloride) in a conical bottom glass tube. After 1.0 min ultrasonication and 3 min centrifugation ( at 7000 rpm) , the sedimented extract 10 μL was directly injected into the GC-MS system. The limits of quantitation ( LOQs) varied from 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL. The precisions for both repeatability and reproducibility were < 8 %. The trueness varied from 79 to 96 % with the RSD ranging from 2 to 8 %. The total concentrations of the seven unmetabolized target musks in collected human urine samples were in the range from 0.93 to 3.74 ng/mL. HHCB and AHTN were detected in all the collected samples , and the daily excretion doses were evaluated.
