  To investigate the relation between level of antibodies against lactoferrin ( LfAb) in maternal serum ( MS) and birth anthropometry of healthy full-term newborns. The study included 105 pairs of mother-newborn. MS LfAb level was determined using ELISA kit. Spearman 's correlation and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) were applied to establish the relationship between MS LfAb level and birth weight ( BW) , birth weight-to-birth length ratio ( BW/BL) , and head circumference ( HC) of newborns. The U-shaped relation of MS LfAb and BW was demonstrated ( p = .019). Negative correlation between MS LfAb and BW/BL was observed ( p = .016). The most optimal birth weight and body proportion were observed in newborns of mothers with MS LfAb level of 49 Â± 4 U/ml. Significant relationship between MS LfAb and birth anthropometry suggests serum Lf of pregnant women can be considered as a promising indirect biomarker of intrauterine homeostasis , verifiable noninvasively already during pregnancy and thus allowing predict , or even prevent , potential short- and long-term postnatal health consequences.
