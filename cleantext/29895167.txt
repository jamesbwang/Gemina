  Objectives To explore the association between patients ' perceptions of communication quality with their provider and a range of patients ' outcomes in T2DM. Also , to identify barriers and facilitators to effective communication from the patients ' perspective. Methods English and Persian papers published from 2000 to 2017 were searched in Web of Science , Pubmed , Scopus , Embase and SID , IranMedex , and MAGIRAN databases using appropriate search terms. Twenty-two studies complied the inclusion criteria. Each study was assessed for the focus of the study , study design ( cross-sectional or qualitative study) , population , outcome measures , patients ' outcomes , and methodological quality. Results The quality of most studies was moderate to high based on the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists. Higher perceived quality of provider-patient communication in patients with T2DM was associated with improved self-management , adherence to diabetes care and greater well-being , perceived personal control , self-efficacy , and less diabetes distress. Factors that patients with T2DM perceived as important factors in facilitating or hampering effective communication were more related to the provision of emotional support. Discussion The limited evidence shows patient-perceived communication quality is a significant modifiable approach for improving a range of outcomes in patients with T2DM. Due to socio-cultural differences , further high-quality research is needed for deciding the best communication style in various societies.
