  Arachidonic acid ( AA) can be converted into prostaglandins ( PGs) or leukotrienes ( LTs) by the enzymatic actions of cyclooxygenases ( COX-1 and COX-2) or 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO) , respectively. PGs and LTs are lipid signaling molecules that have been implicated in various diseases , including multiple cancers. 5-LO and its activating protein ( FLAP) work together in the first two conversion steps of LT production. Previous work has suggested a role for LTs in cancer development and progression. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally , and have previously been shown to be involved in cancer. Here , we show that high FLAP expression is associated with lower overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients , and FLAP protein is overexpressed in lung cancer cells compared to normal lung cells. Our lab has previously shown that miR-146a regulates COX-2 in lung cancer cells , and this miRNA is also predicted to target FLAP. Transient and stable transfections of miR-146a repress endogenous FLAP expression in lung cancer cells , and reporter assays show this regulation occurs through a direct interaction between the FLAP 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR) and miR-146a. Restoration of miR-146a also results in decreased cancer cell Leukotriene B4 ( LTB
