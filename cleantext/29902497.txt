  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Emerging evidence has suggested a role for miRNAs in the development of diabetic kidney disease ( DKD) , indicating that miRNAs may represent potential biomarkers of this disease. However , results are still inconclusive. Therefore , we performed a systematic review of the literature on the subject , followed by bioinformatic analysis. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify all studies that compared miRNA expressions between patients with DKD and diabetic patients without this complication or healthy subjects. MiRNA expressions were analyzed in kidney biopsies , urine/urinary exosomes or total blood/plasma/serum. MiRNAs consistently dysregulated in DKD patients were submitted to bioinformatic analysis to retrieve their putative target genes and identify potentially affected pathways under their regulation. As result , twenty-seven studies were included in the systematic review. Among 151 dysregulated miRNAs reported in these studies , 6 miRNAs were consistently dysregulated in DKD patients compared to controls: miR-21-5p , miR-29a-3p , miR-126-3p , miR-192-5p , miR-214-3p , and miR-342-3p. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that these 6 miRNAs are involved in pathways related to DKD pathogenesis , such as apoptosis , fibrosis<disease> , and extracellular matrix accumulation. In conclusion , six miRNAs seem to be dysregulated in patients with different stages of DKD , constituting potential biomarkers of this disease.
