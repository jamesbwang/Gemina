  The purpose of this study is to observe and compare the effects of continuous femoral nerve block ( cFNB) and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia ( PCIA) on postoperative analgesia and Th1/Th2 in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Forty-six TKA were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the cFNB group and PCIA group. Patients in the two groups all underwent general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask. In the cFNB group , the femoral nerve block and catheterization were performed after induction of general anesthesia: 0.375 % ropivacaine hydrochloride with a 20 mL loading dose was provided. After the end of the operation , the electronically controlled analgesia pump was connected. In the PCIA group , fentanyl with a 0.05 mg loading dose was provided and the electronic controlled analgesia pump was connected at the end of the operation. Venous blood was collected before anesthesia ( T0) , 1 h postoperatively ( T1) , 24 h postoperatively ( T2) and 48 h postoperatively ( T3). Th1/Th2 was calculated and analyzed by flow cytometry , and other indexes of these time points were recorded. The results show that there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding changes in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , heart rate and postoperative sedation Ramsay score. There was no significant difference in Th1 percentages ( Th1 %) , Th2 percentages ( Th2 %) and ratios of Th1-to-Th2 ( Th1/Th2) between the two groups at T0 , T1 and T2 ( P > 0.05) , while the Th1 % , Th2 % and Th1/Th2 of the PCIA group were lower than those of the cFNB group at T3 ( P less than 0.05). It was concluded that cFNB represents a better postoperative analgesia for patients than PCIA , and has a lesser effect on Th1/Th2 balance<symptom> , which can improve the outcome of patients.
