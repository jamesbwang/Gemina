  Branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO) may be complicated with retinal ischemia in some cases. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the relationship between optical intensity on optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and retinal ischemia in BRVO. Twenty-seven eyes diagnosed with BRVO without macular edema<symptom> were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of retinal ischemia. The optical intensity of inner retinal layers and photoreceptor inner segment ellipsoid zone/retinal pigment epithelium layer ( ISe/RPE) in the affected and unaffected regions were measured on OCT.. Their ratio ( Optical intensity ratio , OIR) was calculated and compared between affected and unaffected region. In the retinal ischemia group , the optical intensity of inner retinal layers was higher in the affected region compared to the unaffected region while the optical intensity of ISe/RPE was low. The OIR was significantly higher in the affected region compared to control ( 0.83 ± 0.17 vs 0.68 ± 0.09 , p < 0.001). However , in the non-ischemic group , there was no significant difference between the affected and unaffected region. The BCVA was moderately correlated with OIR of affected region ( r = 0.489 , p = 0.010). Our study suggests that optical intensity ratio on OCT is correlated with retinal ischemia in BRVO.
