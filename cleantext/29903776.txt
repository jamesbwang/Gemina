  Extragonadal retroperitoneal seminomas are a rare cause of testicular<symptom> pain<symptom> in males. We report the case of a 46-year-old man , who presented with right-sided testicular<symptom> pain<symptom> , clinically mimicking testicular torsion. The patient underwent a scrotal exploration , which revealed normal testes. He went on to have a contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis , which revealed a 55 mm para-aortic mass , displacing the duodenum and inferior vena cava , with an adjacent 22 mm lymph node. Histological analysis revealed that it was a seminoma.
