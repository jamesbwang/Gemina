  Pituitary adenomas are among the most common primary brain tumors. Recently , overlapping surgery has been curbed in many institutions because of the suggestion there might be more significant adverse events , despite several studies showing that complication rates are equivalent. To assess complications and costs associated with overlapping surgery during the transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas. A single-center , retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate the cases of patients who underwent a transsphenoidal approach for pituitary tumor resection. Patient , surgical , complication , and cost ( value-driven outcome) variables were analyzed. A total of 629 patients ( 302 nonoverlapping , 327 overlapping cases) were identified. No significant differences in age ( P = .6) , sex ( P = .5) , tumor type ( P = .5) , or prior rates of pituitary adenoma resection ( P = .5) were seen. Similar presenting symptoms were observed in the 2 groups , and follow-up length was comparable ( P = .3). No differences in tumor sizes ( P = .5) , operative time ( P = .4) , fat/fascia use ( P = .4) , or cerebrospinal fluid diversion ( P = .8) were seen between groups. The gross total resection rate was not significantly different ( P = .9) , and no difference in recurrence rate was seen ( P = .4). A comparable complication rate was seen between groups ( P = .6). No differences in total or subtotal costs were seen either. The results of this study offer additional evidence that overlapping surgery does not result in worsened complications , lengthened surgery , or increased patient cost for patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas. Thus , studies and policy aiming to improve patient safety and cost should focus on optimizing other aspects of healthcare delivery.
