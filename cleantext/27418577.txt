  Consideration to add empiric MRSA therapy with vancomycin is a common clinical dilemma. However , vancomycin overuse has important adverse events. MRSA colonization screening is commonly performed for infection control. We hypothesized that in cases of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bacteremia , a score based on patient level factors and MRSA colonization could predict the risk of MRSA infection and inform the need for empiric coverage. Using modern machine learning statistical methods ( LASSO regression and random forests) , we designed a predictive score for MRSA infection based on patient level characteristics , and MRSA colonization as measured by screening done 30 days before infection ( 30-Day criteria) , or at any time before infection ( Ever-Positive criteria). Patient factors ( age , sex , number of previous admissions , and other medical comorbidities) were obtained through our electronic records. With random forests , MRSA colonization largely surpassed all other factors in terms of accuracy and discriminatory power. Using LASSO regression , MRSA colonization was the only factor with MRSA infection predictive power with odds ratio of 10.3 ( min: 5.99 , max: 16.1) and 8.14 ( min: 6.01 , max: 14.8) for the 30-Day and Ever-Positive criteria , respectively. Further , patient comorbidities were not adequate predictors of MRSA colonization. In an era of community acquired MRSA , colonization status appears to be the only independent and reliable predictor of MRSA infection in cases of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bacteremia. A clinical approach based on a patient 's known MRSA colonization status and on local susceptibility patterns may be appropriate.
