  Research reporting that greater body<symptom> weight is associated with lower wages and employment , particularly among women , focuses on how employers perceive workers. In contrast , we examine whether workers ' own perceptions of body<symptom> weight influence labor market outcomes. Numerous studies find that misperception of body<symptom> weight influences health behaviors and health , both mental and physical. For example , anorexia<symptom> nervosa involves the over-perception of weight and raises the risk of cardiovascular disease. Do the health consequences of inaccurate self-perceived weight carry through to the labor market? We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 ( NLSY97) to investigate patterns in weight misperception and three labor market outcomes. We find little evidence that either over-perception or under-perception of weight is associated with wages , weeks worked , or the number of jobs held for women and men.
