  Two new sesquiterpenoids ( 1 and 2) and a new ent-pimarane type diterpenoid ( 3) , together with eighteen known compounds ( 4-21) , were isolated from the whole plants of Siegesbeckia pubescens. The structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of 1D- , 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Of these , highly oxygenated germacrane type sesquiterpenoids ( 1-2 and 13-14) showed significant inhibitory effects with IC
