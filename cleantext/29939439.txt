  Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes for mother and infant both at birth and later in life. A large body of evidence is now available relating to antenatal prevention of GDM. Overall , despite some individual trials of a variety of lifestyle interventions revealing benefit , many more have shown no effect from the second trimester onwards , even with significant gestational weight gain limitation. At-risk women often seem reluctant to engage in lifestyle changes and frequently can not adhere to recommended interventions even within a clinical trial setting. Many trials have not considered the heterogeneity of diabetes first discovered in pregnancy , something of importance into the future. Future work should focus on designing interventions acceptable to the population at risk , whether those taking place before or during the first trimester of pregnancy are effective , and whether greater individualization can identify those women most likely to benefit.
