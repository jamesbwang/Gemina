  A magnetically modified rice husk biochar ( MBC) was successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method from original biochar ( BC) and subsequently used to remove phenanthrene ( PHE) from aqueous solutions. The porosity , specific surface area and hydrophobicity of BC were significantly improved ( approx. two times) after magnetic modification. The adsorption data fitted well to pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir models. Compared with BC , MBC had a faster adsorption rate and higher adsorption capacity of PHE. The adsorption equilibrium for PHE on MBC was achieved within 1.0 h. The maximum adsorption capacity of PHE on MBC was 97.6 mg g
