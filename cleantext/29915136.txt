  Sparse neural activity in the dentate gyrus is enforced by powerful networks of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in combination with low intrinsic excitability of the principal neurons , the dentate granule cells ( GCs). Although the cellular and circuit properties that dictate synaptic inhibition are well studied , less is known about mechanisms that confer low GC intrinsic excitability. Here we demonstrate that intact G protein-mediated signaling contributes to the characteristic low resting membrane potential that differentiates mature dentate GCs from CA1 pyramidal cells and developing adult-born GCs. In mature GCs from male and female mice , intact G protein signaling robustly reduces intrinsic excitability , whereas deletion of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 ( GIRK2) increases excitability and blocks the effects of G protein signaling on intrinsic properties. Similarly , pharmacological manipulation of GABA
