  Robotic urology has evolved in parallel with the development of new robotic systems. A recently conceived robotic platform , specifically designed for single-port ( SP) surgery , has reignited the interest for the approach. In this review , the evolution of robotic SP surgery was analyzed. Since the first published experience with a robot-assisted SP urological procedure in 2010 , despite technical adjustments , robotic SP has remained with limited diffusion. However , the limitations of the available instrumentation are going to be softened with an upcoming next-generation robotic platform. Indeed , a purpose-built SP platform is being tested. The new purpose-built SP robotic system seems to represent a step forward. Based on the preliminary available experience , it facilitates the SP approach being the platform specifically designed for SP surgery. The novel SP robot could sponsor the alternative approaches to common urological interventions , allowing for potentially further minimization of the invasiveness of robotic surgery. Clinical trials will be awaited when this technology is commercially available. A novel robotic platform has been designed to be used for single-port surgery. With this particular approach , the surgery is performed through a single skin incision. Alternative access for common urological interventions will be sponsored by the new robotic platform , allowing for further reduction of the invasiveness of robotic surgery.
