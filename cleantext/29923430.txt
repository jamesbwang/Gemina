  Autoimmune Pancreatitis<disease> ( AIP) is a peculiar form of pancreatitis<disease> different from all other type of pancreatitis<disease> ( ` one like no one pancreatitis<disease> ') and characterized by a dramatic response to steroids. AIP can be classified histologically in type 1 , included in a larger group of diseases named IgG4-related disease , and type 2. At imaging , AIP may involve all ( diffuse form) or only a part ( focal form) of the pancreatic gland. Areas covered: In this article , the clinical approach to diagnosis and different therapeutic strategies of this complicated disease are reviewed. Literature search was undertaken using PubMed database entering autoimmune pancreatitis<disease> ( title) or IgG4-related diseases ( title) , and selecting the more relevant papers for diagnosis and therapy of AIP in clinical practice. We focus on diagnosis of AIP in focal and diffuse form , and how to achieve diagnosis for type 1 and type 2 AIP. We finally analyzed the different strategies proposed in induction of remission and maintenance therapy ( long-term low-dose steroids , immunosuppressants or biologics). Expert commentary: The main issue in clinical practice is how to achieve the diagnosis. A second key point is how to prevent the disease relapse.
