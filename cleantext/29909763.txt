  Pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia spectrum disorders: State of the Art Abstract. Schizophrenia is a disorder , whose cause and course are still a puzzle. Nevertheless its treatment has made big progresses during the last decades. Early recognition and early treatment of the disorder are very important for a good outcome. Any of the four stages of the illness needs its own treatment concept. Today the gold standard during a acute/ progressive psychotic phase is primarily the prescription of an 2nd generation antipsychotic ( atypicals). Regarding the goal of remission and relapse prevention close monitoring of side effects ( TEE = treatment emergent events) are key. Adherence and an appropriate relapse prevention can change the course of this severe disorder significantly to the better. Long acting injectables ( LAI 's) turned out to be helpful in this regard.- Patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disoder have a significant shortened life expectancy compared to the normal population. Therefor close monitoring of cardio-metabolic parameters by general practitioners is very important.
