  The circulation of the Southern Ocean connects ocean basins , links the deep and shallow layers of the ocean , and has a strong influence on global ocean circulation , climate , biogeochemical cycles and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Processes that act on local and regional scales , which are often mediated by the interaction of the flow with topography , are fundamental in shaping the large-scale , three-dimensional circulation of the Southern Ocean. Recent advances provide insight into the response of the Southern Ocean to future change and the implications for climate , the carbon cycle and sea-level rise.
