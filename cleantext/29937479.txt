  Upregulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT) expression is an important factor in the cellular survival and cancer. Although growing evidence suggests that hTERT inhibits cellular apoptosis by telomere-independent functions , the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here , we show that hTERT contains a BH3-like motif , a short peptide sequence found in BCL-2 family proteins , and interacts with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL , suggesting a functional link between hTERT and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Additionally , we propose that hTERT can be categorized into the atypical BH3- only proteins that promote cellular survival , possibly due to the non-canonical interaction between hTERT and antiapoptotic proteins. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying the hTERT BH3-like motif functions and interactions between hTERT and BCL-2 family proteins have not been elucidated , this work proposes a possible connection between hTERT and BCL-2 family members and reconsiders the role of the BH3-like motif as an interaction motif.
