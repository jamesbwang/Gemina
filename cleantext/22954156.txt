  Sphaeroma terebrans , an economically and ecologically important marine wood-boring isopod , is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical mangroves. Nevertheless , available genomic and transcriptomic information for this isopod is extremely deficient. Here , we first performed the assembly of S. terebrans transcriptome by Illumina sequencing. A total of 51,092 high-quality unigenes with an average length of 641 bp were obtained and 19,915 unigenes were successfully annotated in four public databases. Only 9932 out of 19915 unigenes were commonly annotated by all four databases. In addition , 9609 unigenes were categorized into 54 function categories of Gene Ontology ( GO) , and 14,512 unigenes were successfully grouped into 25 functional categories of the EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups ( KOG) database. Moreover , 11,507 unigenes were assigned to 228 pathways of the Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG). Out of 51,092 unigenes , a total of 4257 different microsatellites with motifs range from di- to hexa-nucleotide were identified from 3324 unigene sequences. Among 64 primer pairs selected for validation , 35 were successful in PCR amplification and 13 exhibited obvious repeat polymorphisms in the wild population of S. terebrans in Dongzhaigang ( Hainan Island). The transcriptome dataset and the identified microsatellite markers ( SSRs) will provide abundant information for researches on the discovery of new genes , metabolic mechanism and genetic diversity of S. terebrans.
