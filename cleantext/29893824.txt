  Endoscopy and histopathology are pivotal for evaluating disease activity in ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC); correlation between validated endoscopic and histological indices has not been examined. We aim to correlate the Ulcerative<disease> Colitis<disease> Endoscopic Index of Severity ( UCEIS) with two new validated histological indices in patients with established UC. A single centre cohort of patients with established UC who underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy by a single endoscopist. The UCEIS was scored at the worst affected area in the distal colon , which was biopsied; histological disease activity using Nancy ( NI) and Robarts ' Histological ( RHI) indices was scored by a pathologist blinded to the endoscopy. Spearman correlation between the UCEIS , NI and RHI , and between NI and RHI were performed. 125 patients , median age 37 years ( range 16-81 years) , with UCEIS scores ( scale 0-8) 0 = 21; 1-3 = 48; 4-6 = 51; 7-8 = 5. Correlation coefficients between UCEIS and NI ( scale 0-4) were r = 0.84 ( 95 % CI 0.76-0.89 , p < 0.001) and between UCEIS and RHI ( scale 0-33) r = 0.86 ( 95 % CI 0.80-0.90 , p < 0.001). The difference in correlation was not significant ( p = 0.57). There was excellent correlation between the two histological indices ( r = 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.87-0.95 , p < 0.001). Quiescent disease activity defined as the absence of neutrophils ( Nancy 0-1 , Robarts 0-3) was most closely correlated with UCEIS = 0. The UCEIS strongly correlates with both NI and RHI. Complete mucosal healing is best defined as a UCEIS = 0/8 , since this correlates with the absence of microscopic disease activity.
