  Silver and copper foil were found to be effective , versatile and selective heterogeneous catalysts for the cyclopropenation of terminal and internal alkynes under mechanochemical reaction conditions. This methodology enables the functionalization of a wide range of terminal or internal alkynes under ambient , aerobic , and solvent-free conditions. Finally , we have demonstrated a unique and versatile one-pot domino Sonogashira-cyclopropenation mechanochemical reaction for the formation of complex cyclopropenes.
