  Visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) hosts a population of regulatory T ( Treg) cells , with a unique phenotype , that controls local and systemic inflammation<symptom> and metabolism. Generation of a T cell receptor transgenic mouse line , wherein VAT Tregs are highly enriched , facilitated study of their provenance , dependencies , and activities. We definitively established a role for T cell receptor specificity , uncovered an unexpected function for the primordial Treg transcription-factor , Foxp3 , evidenced a cell-intrinsic role for interleukin-33 receptor , and ordered these dependencies within a coherent scenario. Genesis of the VAT-Treg phenotype entailed a priming step in the spleen , permitting them to exit the lymphoid organs and surveil nonlymphoid tissues , and a final diversification process within VAT , in response to microenvironmental cues. Understanding the principles of tissue-Treg biology is a prerequisite for precision-targeting strategies.
