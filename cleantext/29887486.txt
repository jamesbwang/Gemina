  To increase understanding of parental perspectives on time alone and of factors that influence adolescent communication with physicians in a pediatric clinic. The sample consisted of 91 parents of adolescents aged 14-17 years who attended a well child visit at one primary care pediatric practice and completed a 2-week follow-up phone call as part of a larger study on adolescent health and communication. Parents reported whether their child met alone with the pediatrician , rated the importance of him or her having time alone with the physician , and responded to open-ended questions regarding barriers and facilitators of adolescent-physician communication. Bivariate and multivariate analyses tested associations of parent and adolescent characteristics with perceived parental importance of time alone. We conducted content analyses of responses to open-ended questions. Slightly more than half of parents ( n = 53 , 58 %) indicated that it was `` a lot '' important for their adolescents to meet alone with the pediatrician; parents of males were more likely than parents of females to select this highest rating ( 73 % vs. 43 % , Ï‡ Most parents thought time alone was highly important for their own adolescent in a primary care setting , and parents described additional strategies to facilitate adolescent communication.
