  To investigate the impact of knee joint loading exercise on articular cartilage in people at risk of , or with established , knee osteoarthritis ( OA) by conducting a systematic review of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. We performed a literature search with no restriction on publication year or language in MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to September 2017. RCTs investigating the impact of exercise on MRI-assessed articular cartilage in people over 18 years of age. We included nine trials , including a total of 14 comparisons of cartilage morphometry , morphology and composition outcomes , of which two included participants at increased risk of knee OA and 12 included participants with knee OA. In participants at increased risk , one study comparison reported no effect on cartilage defects and one had positive effects on glycosaminoglycans ( GAG). In participants with OA , six study comparisons reported no effect on cartilage thickness , volume or defects; one reported a negative effect and one no effect on GAG; two reported a positive effect and two no effect on collagen. Knee joint loading exercise seems to not be harmful for articular cartilage in people at increased risk of , or with , knee OA. However , the quality of evidence was low , including some interventions studying activities considered outside the therapeutic loading spectrum to promote cartilage health.
