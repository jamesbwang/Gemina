  Monitoring infants ' exposure to 10 phthalates by measuring their urinary metabolites using a modified high performance liquid chromatography tandemelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method. A total of 50 infants at 0-6 month-old were recruited and their urine samples were collected by commercial available gel diapers. After the urine expression , phthalates were hydrolyzed by β-glucuronidase , cleaned up by HLB cartridge , then these metabolites were measured by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS equipped with a Hypersil Gold Phenyl column. The target compounds were quantified by the stable isotope dilution technique. The limit of detection ( LOD) was 0. 06-0. 16 μg/L with linear ranged 0. 2-500 μg/L. 8 of 10 phthalate metabolites could be detected with > 98 % frequencies , from the high to low levels ( geometric mean , μg/L) they were Mi BP ( 10. 35) , MECPP ( 5. 13) , MBP ( 4. 53) , MEP ( 1. 98) , MMP ( 1. 69) , MEHP ( 1. 22) , MEHHP ( 1. 18) and MEOHP ( 0. 99). MBz P and MCHP could be detected in very low frequencies of 28 % and 2 % , respectively. Formula feeding might be one of the major routes of infant exposure to DEHP ( parent compound of MEHP , MEOHP , MEHHP and MECPP) and BBz P ( parent compound of MBz P). The modified HLB-HPLC-MS/MS method can be used for determination of PAEs metabolites in infant urine effectively , and it is valuable for monitoring the infant ` exposure risk to PAEs.
