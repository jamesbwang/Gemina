  A major challenge for effective application of CRISPR systems is to accurately predict the single guide RNA ( sgRNA) on-target knockout efficacy and off-target profile , which would facilitate the optimized design of sgRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Here we present DeepCRISPR , a comprehensive computational platform to unify sgRNA on-target and off-target site prediction into one framework with deep learning , surpassing available state-of-the-art in silico tools. In addition , DeepCRISPR fully automates the identification of sequence and epigenetic features that may affect sgRNA knockout efficacy in a data-driven manner.
