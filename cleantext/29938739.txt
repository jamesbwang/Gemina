  Aim of the present study was twofold. First , to evaluate in vitro , the performance of two different NiTi rotary instruments in one molar case; then , to evaluate their resistance to cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , compared to new ones. 25 ProTaper Next ( PTN) nickel-titanium ( NiTi) instruments ( Maillefer-Dentsply , Baillagues , CH) for each of the following two sizes: X1 ( 17.04) and X2 ( 25.06) were randomly divided into two groups. The first group ( n = 10) immediately under- went to a cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> test. The second group ( n = 15) was initially used to prepare 15 extracted molar teeth and then subjected to a cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> test. Same was done for 25 Horizen ( HZ) instruments ( Kerr Endodontics , Orange , Ca) for each of the following two sizes: 20.04 and 25.06. Instruments were rotated in curved artificial canal until fracture occurred and times to fracture were recorded. All data were collected and statistically analyzed using a variance test ( confidence interval CI = 95 %). HZ reached working length more rapidly than PTN , and with less deformations. For the fatigue<symptom> tests , all the new instruments were significantly more resistant than the used ones. The HZ instru- ments were significantly more resistant in all sizes than PTN , both when new and used instruments were tested. Since in previous studies ProTaper Next demonstra- ted a better resistance to cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> than most of nickel-titanium instruments , Horizen 's performance put them in a high rank amongst the most resistant nickel-titanium rotary instruments.
