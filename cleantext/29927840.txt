  Self-measurement of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) is increasingly being used for the diagnosis of hypertension and to monitor BP at home. Whenever compared with ambulatory BP measurements , home BP values are frequently higher and less predictive for incident cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that this could be caused by a pressor response elicited by the self-measurement of BP. A total of 50 patients ( mean age 62.0 ± 11.2 years , 44 % women) were included , 25 with and 25 without at least 10/5 mmHg higher home BP compared with daytime ambulatory BP. All patients performed 10 consecutive oscillometric BP measurements after 10 min of rest , followed by another resting period of 10 min , whereas continuously monitoring BP and central hemodynamics using finger photoplethysmography. Baseline BP before the start of the self-measurements was compared with the average BP during the first 10 s of inflation of the cuff. In both groups , we observed a significant increase in SBP and DBP during cuff inflation. The mean rise in average BP was 6.9 ± 6.3/ 4.5 ± 4.3 mmHg in the group with and 4.4 ± 9.4/ 2.7 ± 5.3 mmHg in the group without a BP difference between home and daytime ambulatory BP compared with baseline , whereas the maximum increase in average BP was 17.4/ 8.4 mmHg and 17.7/ 7.5 mmHg ( P < 0 01). The increase in BP coincided with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. BP differences attenuated after multiple readings , but did not disappear. Our results support the existence of a pressor response during self-BP measurement that remains present after multiple BP readings.
