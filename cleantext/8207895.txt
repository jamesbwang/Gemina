  Pulmonary hemangioma is a rare thoracic condition that can lead to hemoptysis<symptom>. Here we report a case that presented with lumen dilatation suggestive of bronchiectasis on high-resolution computed tomography ( CT) and was misdiagnosed as bronchiectasis for more than 10 years. A 41-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine due to hemoptysis<symptom>. The patient was misdiagnosed as having bronchiectasis for more than 10 years. Enhanced chest CT was not performed until treatment of recurrent hemoptysis<symptom> with antibiotics and hemostatic therapy was no longer effective. With lumen dilation and the `` signet ring '' sign as the main findings on CT , pulmonary hemangiomas are easily misdiagnosed. A left lower lobe lobectomy was performed , and the postoperative pathology revealed a hemangioma of the left lower lobe of the lung without bronchiectasis. After treatment , the patient no longer had hemoptysis<symptom>. Therefore , in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with hemoptysis<symptom> , enhanced CT/CT angiography ( CTA) is necessary for differential diagnosis.
