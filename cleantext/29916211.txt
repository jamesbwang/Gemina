  Two studies investigated whether parent-child discussion of peer provocations reduces young children 's hostile attributional bias. Study 1 ( N = 109 , age 4-7)- an observational study-showed that parent-child discussion of nonhostile attributions ( when reading a picture book) predicted reductions in children 's hostile attributional bias from pre- to postdiscussion. Study 2 ( N = 160 , age 4-6)- an experimental study-showed that stimulating parents to discuss either nonhostile attributions or normative beliefs ( vs. a control condition) reduced children 's hostile attributional bias in response to hypothetical vignettes , but not in response to a staged peer provocation. These findings suggest that by framing social situations , parents may help their children perceive less hostility in their social worlds.
