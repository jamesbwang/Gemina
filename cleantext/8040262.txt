  Psoriasis , which is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease , endangers human health and brings about a major economic burden worldwide. To date , treatments for psoriasis remain unsatisfied because of their clinical limitations and various side effects. Thus , developing a safer and more effective therapy for psoriasis is compelling. Previous studies have explicitly shown that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that is predominantly mediated by T helper 17 ( Th17) cells , which express high levels of interleukin-17 ( IL-17) in response to interleukin-23 ( IL-23). The discovery of the IL-23-Th17-IL-17 axis in the development of psoriasis has led to the paradigm shift of understanding pathogenesis of psoriasis. Although anti-IL-17 antibodies show marked clinical efficacy in treating psoriasis , compared with antibodies targeting IL-17A or IL-17R alone , targeting Th17 cells themselves may have a maximal benefit by affecting multiple proinflammatory cytokines , including IL-17A , IL-17F , IL-22 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , which likely act synergistically to drive skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in psoriasis. In this review , we mainly focus on the critical role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Especially , we explore the small molecules that target retinoid-related orphan receptor γt ( RORγt) , a vital transcription factor for Th17 cells. Given that RORγt is the lineage-defining transcription factor for Th17 cell differentiation , targeting RORγt
