  Molecular testing on advanced metastatic melanoma is critical for guiding targeted therapy. Traditionally , this analysis has relied on isolated BRAF V600E analysis; however , more recently targeted next generation sequencing ( NGS) is being utilized. The clinical utility of BRAF V600E allele-specific PCR and targeted NGS were compared for metastatic melanoma samples sent to UHCMC pathology during a two and half year span. In two thirds of cases , negative for BRAF V600E , additional mutations were detected that may stratify patients for potential or approved targeted therapies. Targeted-NGS testing is feasible and cost-affordable and provides additional potentially actionable information for patients with BRAF V600E/K negative metastatic melanoma. Based on this analysis , we have adopted to screen patients with advanced melanoma with allele-specific V600E/K PCR and reflex negative cases for targeted NGS to maximize patient benefit.
