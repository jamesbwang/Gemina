  Endocrine abnormalities are common among childhood cancer survivors. Abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPAA) are the least common , but the consequences are severe if missed. Patients with tumours located and/ or had surgery performed near the hypothalamic-pituitary region and those treated with an accumulative cranial radiotherapy dose of over 30 Gy are most at risk of adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH) deficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency may occur in patients with tumours located in or involving one or both adrenals. The effects of adjunct therapies also need to be considered , particularly new immunotherapies. High dose and/ or prolonged courses of glucocorticoid treatment can result in secondary adrenal insufficiency which may take months to resolve and hence re-assessment is important to ensure patients are not left on long-term replacement steroids inappropriately. The prevalence and cumulative incidences of HPAA dysfunction are difficult to quantify because of its non-specific presentation , and lack of consensus regarding its investigations. The insulin tolerance test remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of central cortisol deficiency , but due to its risks , alternative methods with reduced diagnostic sensitivities are often used and must be interpreted with caution. ACTH deficiency may develop many years after the completion of oncological treatment alongside other pituitary hormone deficiencies. It is essential that health professionals involved in the long term follow up of childhood cancer survivors are aware of individuals at risk of developing HPAA dysfunction and implement appropriate monitoring and treatment.
