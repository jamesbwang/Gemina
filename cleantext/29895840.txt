  There is an emerging evidence that pulmonary hypertension is associated with amino acid , carnitine , and thyroid hormone aberrations. We aimed to characterize metabolic profiles measured by the newborn screen ( NBS) in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN) METHODS: Nested case-control study from population-based database. Cases were infants with ICD-9 code for PPHN receiving mechanical ventilation. Controls receiving mechanical ventilation were matched 2:1 for gestational age , sex , birth weight , parenteral nutrition administration , and age at NBS collection. Infants were divided into derivation and validation datasets. A multivariable logistic regression model was derived from candidate metabolites , and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ( AUROC) was generated from the validation dataset. We identified 1076 cases and 2152 controls. Four metabolites remained in the final model. Ornithine ( OR 0.32 , CI 0.26-0.41) , tyrosine ( OR 0.48 , CI 0.40-0.58) , and TSH 0.50 ( 0.45-0.55) were associated with decreased odds of PPHN; phenylalanine was associated with increased odds of PPHN ( OR 4.74 , CI 3.25-6.90). The AUROC was 0.772 ( CI 0.737-0.807). In a large , population-based dataset , infants with PPHN have distinct , early metabolic profiles. These data provide insight into the pathophysiology of PPHN , identifying potential therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers to assess the response.
