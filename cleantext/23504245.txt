  Postexposure prophylaxis ( PEP) with antiretroviral therapy ( ART) and vaccination against hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) aides in preventing human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection and HBV , respectively , from accidental or occupational exposure. We assessed compliance to guidelines for HIV<pathogen> and HBV prevention after occupational exposure among hospital staff at a referral Kenyan hospital. We reviewed PEP registers for hospital staff reporting an occupational injury at a referral hospital in Western Kenya between January 2011 and December 2012. Proportions were used to summarize number of participants receiving the recommended services , Kaplan-Meier curves were used to describe time to ART initiation , and Chi-square statistics was used to describe the association between participant characteristics and PEP completion rates. Majority of documented hospital staff ( Low rates of completion and follow-up negate intended benefits of PEP. Efforts should be directed to enforce universal precaution practices and completion of PEP. Low rates of HBV testing and vaccination illustrate the need for support for the implementation of HBV prevention guidelines.
