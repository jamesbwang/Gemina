  It is very important to control methane emissions to mitigate global warming. An intermittent micro-aeration control system was used to control methane emissions from an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland ( IVCW) to treat agricultural domestic wastewater pollution in this study. The optimized intermittent micro-aeration conditions were a 20-min aeration time and 340-min non-aeration time , 3.9 m
