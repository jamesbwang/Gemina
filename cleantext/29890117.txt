  How life can emerge from non-living matter is one of the fundamental mysteries of the universe. A bottom-up approach to this problem focuses on the potential chemical precursors of life , in particular the nature of the first replicative molecules. Such thinking has led to the currently most popular idea: that an RNA-like molecule played a central role as the first replicative and catalytic molecule. Here , we review an alternative hypothesis that has recently gained experimental support , focusing on the role of amyloidogenic peptides rather than nucleic acids , in what has been by some termed `` the amyloid-world '' hypothesis. Amyloids are well-ordered peptide aggregates that have a fibrillar morphology due to their underlying structure of a one-dimensional crystal-like array of peptides in a Î²-strand conformation. While they are notorious for their implication in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer 's disease , amyloids also have many biological functions. In this review , we will elaborate on the following properties of amyloids in relation to their fitness as a prebiotic entity: they can be formed by very short peptides with simple amino acids sequences; as aggregates they are more chemically stable than their isolated component peptides; they can possess diverse catalytic activities; they can form spontaneously during the prebiotic condensation of amino acids; they can act as templates in their own chemical replication; they have a structurally repetitive nature that enables them to interact with other structurally repetitive biopolymers like RNA/DNA and polysaccharides , as well as with structurally repetitive surfaces like amphiphilic membranes<symptom> and minerals.
