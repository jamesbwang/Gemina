  Therapeutic applications of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) are limited due to their early death within the first few days of transplantation. Therefore , to improve the efficacy of cellbased therapies , it is necessary to manipulate MSCs so that they can resist various stresses imposed by the microenvironment. Moreover , the role of superoxide dismutase 3 ( SOD3) in regulating such survival under different stress conditions remain elusive. In this study , we overexpressed SOD3 in MSCs ( SOD3-MSCs) and evaluated its effect under serum starvation conditions. Nutritional limitation can decrease the survival rate of transplanted MSCs and thus can reduce their efficacy during therapy. Interestingly , we found that SOD3-MSCs exhibited reduced reactive oxygen species levels and greater survival rates than normal MSCs under serum-deprived conditions. In addition , overexpression of SOD3 attenuated starvationinduced apoptosis with increased autophagy in MSCs. Moreover , we have demonstrated that SOD3 protects MSCs against the negative effects of serum deprivation via modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase/sirtulin 1 , extracellular signalregulated kinase activation , and promoted Forkhead box O3a trafficking to the nucleus. Taken together , these results demonstrate that SOD3 promotes MSCs survival and add further evidence to the concept that SOD3-MSCs may be a potential therapeutic agent with better outcomes than normal MSCs for various diseases involving oxidative stress and compromised MSCs survival during therapy.
