  This article presents the thorough design procedure , specifications , and performance of a mobile social robot friend Arash for educational and therapeutic involvement of children with cancer based on their interests and needs. Our research focuses on employing Arash in a pediatric hospital environment to entertain , assist , and educate children with cancer who suffer from physical pain caused by both the disease and its treatment process. Since cancer treatment causes emotional distress , which can reduce the efficiency of medications , using social robots to interact with children with cancer in a hospital environment could decrease this distress , thereby improving the effectiveness of their treatment. Arash is a 15 degree-of-freedom low-cost humanoid mobile robot buddy , carefully designed with appropriate measures and developed to interact with children ages 5-12 years old. The robot has five physical subsystems: the head , arms , torso , waist , and mobile-platform. The robot 's final appearance is a significant novel concept; since it was selected based on a survey taken from 50 children with chronic<disease> diseases<disease> at three pediatric hospitals in Tehran , Iran. Founded on these measures and desires , Arash was designed , built , improved , and enhanced to operate successfully in pediatric cancer hospitals. Two experiments were devised to evaluate the children 's level of acceptance and involvement with the robot , assess their feelings about it , and measure how much the robot was similar to the favored conceptual sketch. Both experiments were conducted in the form of storytelling and appearance/performance evaluations. The obtained results confirm high engagement and interest of pediatric cancer patients with the constructed robot.
