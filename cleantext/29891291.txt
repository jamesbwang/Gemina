  Inspired by the supramolecular structure of cellulose , cellulose-gelatin supramolecular hydrogels with high strength and pH-sensitivity were constructed in a basic-based solvent system , ethylene diamine/potassium thiocyanate ( EDA/KSCN) with the aid of cyclic freezing-thawing. The investigation on the characteristics of supramolecular hydrogels revealed that repeated freezing-thawing cycles played an important role in the formation of the physical cross-linked supramolecular network structure between cellulose and gelatin. The mechanical properties of supramolecular hydrogels were much higher than pure cellulose and gelatin hydrogel , and the compressive strength was 9.6 times higher than that of pure gelatin hydrogel. The synergistic effect between hydrogen-bonding interaction and the reinforcement of regenerated cellulose nanofibrils ( CNF) contributed to the superior mechanical performance. Furthermore , the swelling kinetics tests showed that the supramolecular hydrogels exhibited excellent pH-responsibility , indicating potential applications in biomedical fields. Thus , a straightforward route to construct natural polymer-based hydrogels with supramolecular structure through physical crosslinking strategy without employing hazardous crosslinking agents was developed , paving the way for the design of new types of hydrogels.
