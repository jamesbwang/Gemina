  The American College of Rheumatology ( ACR) case definitions for 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes<disease> constitute a comprehensive classification of nervous system events in SLE patients. However , additional strategies are needed to determine whether a neurological<disease> syndrome<disease> is attributable to SLE versus a competing co-morbidity. Cognitive function is a clinical surrogate of overall brain health with applications in both diagnosis and determination of clinical outcomes. Ischemic and inflammatory mechanisms are both key components of the immunopathogenesis of NPSLE , including abnormalities of the blood-brain-barrier and autoantibody mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Advances in neuroimaging provide a platform to assess novel disease mechanisms in a non-invasive way. The convergence of more rigorous clinical characterization , validation of biomarkers and brain neuroimaging provides opportunities to determine the efficacy of novel targeted therapies in the treatment of NPSLE.
