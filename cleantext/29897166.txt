  Most mental health conditions affect adolescent and young adults. The onset of many mental disorders occurs in the young age. This is a critical period to implement interventions to enhance mental health literacy ( MHL) and to prevent the occurrence of mental health problems. This systematic review examined the effectiveness of information and communication technologies interventions on MHL ( recognition of conditions , stigma and help-seeking). The authors searched for both published and unpublished studies. Nineteen studies were included with 9 randomized controlled trials and 10 quasi-experimental studies. Informational interventions were useful to enhance MHL of less-known disorders such as anxiety<symptom> disorder and anorexia<symptom> , but not depression<symptom> Interventions that were effective in enhancing depression<symptom> MHL comprised active component such as videos or quizzes. Interventions that successfully elevated MHL also reduced stigma. Elevated MHL levels did not improve help-seeking , and reduction in stigma levels did not enhance help-seeking behaviours. Future good quality , large-scale , multi-sites randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate MHL interventions.
