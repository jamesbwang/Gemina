  Roundup ® is extensively used for weed control worldwide. Residues of this compound may lead to side effects of the male reproductive system. However , the toxic effects and mechanisms of Roundup ® of male germ cells remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the apoptosis-inducing effects of Roundup ® on mouse male germ cells and explore the role of a novel tumor suppressor XAF1 ( X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1) involved in this process. We demonstrated that Roundup ® can impair spermatogenesis , decrease sperm motility and concentration , and increase the sperm deformity rate in mice. In addition , excessive apoptosis of germ cells accompanied by the overexpression of XAF1 occurred after Roundup ® exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore , the low expression of XIAP ( X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) induced by Roundup ® was inversely correlated with XAF1. Moreover , the knockdown of XAF1 attenuated germ cell apoptosis , improved XIAP expression and inhibited the activation of its downstream target proteins , caspase-3 and PARP , after Roundup ® exposure. Taken together , our data indicated that XAF1 plays an important role in Roundup ®- induced male germ cell apoptosis. The present study suggested that Roundup ® exposure has potential negative implications on male reproductive health in mammals.
