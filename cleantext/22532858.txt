  Socioeconomic status ( SES) is regarded as consisting of education , income and employment. However , the relationship of these three components to alcohol use behaviours , such as risky single occasion drinking ( RSOD) is unclear. The aim of the present paper is to specify how the three SES components relate to RSOD in a cross-sectional survey sample of the Danish general population. Data from a 2011 Danish national representative survey ( n = 3600) was analysed by multiple logistic regression to assess the influence of three dimensions of individual SES ( education , income , employment) on RSOD. Components of SES were not found to be significantly associated with RSOD independently nor in combination. In the Danish context , SES was not associated with RSOD.
