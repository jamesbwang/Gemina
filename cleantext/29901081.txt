  The aim of the present study was to prepare spirulina polysaccharide ( PSP) into an oral nanoemulsion ( NE) with the aim of improving its oral bioavailability and prolonging its sustained release effect. The PSP‑NE was prepared through a phase transformation method , and its formulation components were screened through the use of a pseudo‑ternary phase diagram. The optimal formulation of PSP‑NE was determined to be: 11.9 % Span 80 , 6.0 % Tween-80 , 9.0 % ethanol , 62.8 % soybean oil , and 10.3 % PSP aqueous solution. The prepared PSP‑NE was clear and transparent , had a uniform color and spherical morphology , exhibited stability and no adhesion. The average particle size was 79.93 ± 19 nm , the polydispersity index was 0.185 ± 0.04 ( n = 3) , and the entrapment rate was 62 %. Small‑animal imaging results showed that the prepared PSP‑NE exhibited a sustained release and tissue effect in contrast to the PSP aqueous solution. The present study showed that the prepared PSP‑NE not only exhibited a sustained release and tissue effect in contrast to the PSP aqueous solution , but also had superior performance in terms of antitumor and antioxidant effects.
