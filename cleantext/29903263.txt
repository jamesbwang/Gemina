  To understand the occurrence and change of mutagencity of water samples in the process of drinking water treatment and distribution in a waterworks taking Yangtze River as its water source in Jiangsu Province. Large volume of inlet water , finished water and tap water samples were extracted by XAD-2 resin. Mutagencities were assessed by Ames test and a mutation ratio ( MR) of 2 or greater was judged as a positive result. Compared with the samples with S9 , samples without S9 presented more positive results ( P = 0. 005). That water treatment elevated MR values ( P = 0. 007) while the pipe transport made MR values down ( P = 0. 038) was observed in samples without S9. The tap water showed weaker mutagenicities than the raw water in samples with S9 ( P = 0. 008). Compared to the raw water samples , the finished water samples showed more positive results (- S9) and lower MR values ( + S9 , P = 0. 002). Significant mutagenicities of water samples from the Yangtze Riverand its processed water were presented , and frame shit and direct mutagens deserved special concern.
