  Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) oncoprotein and is an effective therapy for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. MYL-1401O is a trastuzumab biosimilar. Here , we report results from a phase 1 study that investigated bioequivalence among MYL-1401O , reference EU-trastuzumab , and US-trastuzumab. This single-center , randomized , double-blind , three-arm , parallel-group , phase 1 study was conducted in healthy adult male volunteers. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single 8 mg kg Of 132 subjects enrolled ( 44/treatment) , 120 ( MYL-1401O , n = 42; EU-trastuzumab , n = 41; US-trastuzumab , n = 37) were included in the PK analysis. The 90 % CIs of the ratios of geometric means for the primary endpoints were bounded within the predefined bioequivalence criterion of 80 % to 125 %. Secondary endpoints tmax , Î»z , and t MYL-1401O was well tolerated , and demonstrated PK and safety profiles similar to EU-trastuzumab and US-trastuzumab in healthy volunteers ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02594761).
