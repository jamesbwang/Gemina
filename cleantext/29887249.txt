  The COPD-LUCSS-DLCO score had been validated as a predictive tool capable of identifying patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and a high mortality risk associated with lung cancer ( LC); however , studies have not been conducted yet on its use in standard clinical practice. The aim of this study was to estimate the COPD-LUCSS-DLCO scores for patients with COPD treated in Pulmonology consultations and to determine the incidence of LC in each of the subgroups. A retrospective observational study was conducted with a cohort of 159 patients with COPD in Pulmonology outpatient follow-up consultations. We calculated the COPD-LUCSS-DLCO score ( 0-8) for each patient , with low risk considered at 0-3 points and high risk at â‰¥ 3.5 points. We calculated the incidence rate of LC in each of the subgroups. Sixty-two percent of the patients had a high-risk score. We estimated an overall LC rate of 30 per 1000 patients with COPD-year ( 95 % CI: 16-53) , 44 per 1000 patients with COPD-year ( 95 % CI: 18-76) among those categorised as high risk and 17 per 1000 patients with COPD-year among those categorised as low risk ( 95 % CI: 4-50). The use of the COPD-LUCSS-DLCO score in standard clinical practice could help detect patients with a greater risk of developing LC , which could help to better manage cases in an LC screening programme.
