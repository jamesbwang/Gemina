  Veratridine is a lipid-soluble neurotoxin derived from plants in the family Liliaceae. It has been broadly investigated for its action as a sodium channel agonist. However , the effects of veratridine on subtypes of sodium channels , especially Nav1 .7 , remain to be studied. Here , we investigated the effects of veratridine on human Nav1 .7 ectopically expressed in HEK293A cells and recorded Nav1 .7 currents from the cells using whole-cell patch clamp technique. We found that veratridine exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the peak current of Nav1 .7 , with the half-maximal inhibition concentration ( IC
