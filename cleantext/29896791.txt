  Neutrophil recruitment during acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> critically depends on the spatial and temporal regulation of β This review provides a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge on proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 , the conserved β-subunit of β A total of 22 proteins including Talin , Kindlin 3 and Coronin 1A have been reported to interact with the CD18 cytoplasmic tail. Here , proteins binding to the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 in experiments using purified , recombinant proteins or peptides in , for example , pull-down assays , are defined as direct interactors. Proteins that have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 using whole cell lysates in , for example , pull-down experiments are claimed as interacting proteins without evidence for direct interaction. In summary , β The knowledge of proteins interacting with β
