  Few data are available about the functionality of type II focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD). Identification of high-frequency activities ( HFAs) induced by cognitive tasks has been proposed as an additional way to map cognitive functions in patients undergoing presurgical evaluation using stereoelectroencephalography ( SEEG). However , the repetitive subcontinuous spiking pattern which characterizes type II FCD might limit the reliability of this approach , and its feasibility in these patients remains to be evaluated. Seven patients whose magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) data , SEEG data , and/or pathological data were consistent with the diagnosis of type II FCD were included. All patients performed standardized cognitive tasks specifically designed to map task-induced increase of HFA ( 50 Hz to 150 Hz) at the recorded sites. Electrode contacts which showed an interictal SEEG pattern typical of type II FCD were considered to be localized within the FCD. A site was considered responsive if it was significantly different from baseline in at least one cognitive task. Three of the seven patients ( 43 %) had significant task-induced increase of HFA in the FCD for a total of 15 sites with an interictal SEEG pattern typical of type II FCD. These sites were always localized at the external border of the FCD whereas no HFA response was in the core of FCD. In three of the four other patients , a significant task-induced increase of HFA was observed in a cortical site immediately adjacent to the dysplastic cortex. Detection of task-induced HFA remains feasible despite the repetitive subcontinuous spiking pattern which characterizes type II FCD. Depending on the localization of the FCD , some sites of the dysplastic cortex were included in large-scale functional networks. However , these sites were always those closest to the nondysplastic cortex suggesting that persistence of cortical functions might be restricted to a limited part of the FCD.
