  Near infrared light ( NIR) photodetectors based on one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires have generated considerable interest due to their practical application in versatile fields. We present a facile yet efficient approach to rationally integrating KCu7S4 semiconductor nanowires by the Langmuir-Blodgett ( LB) technique. A self-powered near infrared ( NIR) light photodetector is fabricated by transferring a close-packed KCu7S4 nanowire monolayer to the surface of a silicon wafer. The as-fabricated Si/KCu7S4 heterojunction with a close-packed and well-aligned nanowire array exhibits splendid photovoltaic performance when illuminated by NIR light , allowing the detection of NIR light without an exterior power supply. The photodetector exhibits a high sensitivity to NIR light ( 980 nm , 295.3 μW cm-2) with responsivity ( R) 15 mA W-1 and detectivity ( D *) 2.15 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W-1. Significantly , the device shows the capability to work under high pulsed light irradiation up to 50 kHz with a high-speed response ( response time τr 7.4 μs and recovery time τf 8.6 μs). This facilitates the fabrication of low-cost and high-speed photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.
