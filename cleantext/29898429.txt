  Cyanidin-3-O-Î²-glucoside ( Cy-3-G) the most abundant monomer of anthocyanins has multiple protective effects on many diseases. To date , whether Cy-3-G could regulate the function of brown adipose tissue ( BAT) is still unclear and whether this regulation could influence the secretion of adipokines from BAT to prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) indirectly remains to be explored. In this study we investigated the effect of Cy-3-G on BAT and the potential role of Cy-3-G to prevent fatty liver through regulating the secretion of BAT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with a high fat high cholesterol ( HFC) diet with or without 200 mg/kg B.W Cy-3-G for 8 weeks. In in vitro experiments , the differentiated brown adipocytes ( BAC) and C3H10T1/2 clone8 cells were treated with 0.2 mM palmitate with or without Cy-3-G for 72 or 96 h. Then the culture media of C3H10T1/2 clone8 cells were collected for measuring the adipokines secretion by immunoblot assay and were applied to culture HepG2 cells or LO2 cells for 24 h. Lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells or LO2 cells were evaluated by oil red O staining. Here we found that Cy-3-G regulated the activation of BAT and the expression of adipokines in BAT which were disrupted by HFC diet and alleviated diet induced fatty liver in mice. In in vitro experiments , Cy-3-G inhibited the release of adipokines including extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ( eNAMPT) and fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21) from differentiated C3H10T1/2 clone8 cells induced by palmitate , which was accompanied by a reduction of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and LO2 cells cultured by the corresponding collected media of C3H10T1/2 clone8 cells. These results indicate that Cy-3-G can regulate the thermogenic and secretory functions of BAT. Furthermore , our data suggest that the protective effect of Cy-3-G on hepatic lipid accumulation is probably via regulating the secretion of adipokines from BAT.
