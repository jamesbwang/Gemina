  Breast lesions<symptom> include a heterogeneous group of entities with variable clinical behaviour and morphological presentation , mostly classified as benign or malignant , with predictable behaviour. However , there are lesions<symptom> with clinical , breast imaging and/or biopsy characteristics that do not clarify their nature. These lesions<symptom> have an uncertain behaviour regarding their malignant potential at diagnosis.We intend to relate the preoperative diagnosis of neoplasm of uncertain behaviour of the breast ( NUnBB) regarding the core needle biopsy and the histological result after excisional biopsy. This is a retrospective study of patients submitted to local excision of breast lesions<symptom> with a perioperative diagnosis of NUnBB , classified as 2383 at ` International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ' ( ICD 9) , between January 2007 and October 2016 in a breast unit. Ninety-two cases with the diagnosis of NUnBB were analysed: 91 females with a mean age of 59 Â± 14 years. All were submitted to local excision of breast lesion<symptom> as ambulatory surgery with the following histology: 64 % benign , 3 % malignant potential and 33 % malignant. Of those who presented malignant results , 69 % underwent a surgical re-intervention for local control of the disease. Regarding the considerable number of malignant lesions<symptom> at final histology and the high percentage of which are re-operated , NUnBB should be treated with the same priority as a confirmed malignant neoplasm and whenever possible , using the most appropriate surgical technique.
