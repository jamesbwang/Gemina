  The delicate biochemistry of coagulation and anticoagulation is greatly affected by deviations from the optimal temperature required for the interactions between various coagulation enzymes , cellular receptors , and intracellular mechanisms. Hyperthermia<symptom> will lead to a prothrombotic state and , if sufficiently severe such as in heatstroke , a consumption coagulopathy , which will clinically manifest with the simultaneous appearance of intravascular thrombotic obstruction and an increased bleeding tendency. Hypothermia<symptom> slows down the coagulation process , but as this seems to be adequately balanced by impairment of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic processes , its clinical effects are modest; however , hypothermia<symptom> may be modestly linked to a somewhat higher risk of localized thrombosis. Restoration of a normal body temperature in patients affected by hyper- or hypothermia<symptom> is the cornerstone for the management of associated coagulation derangements.
