  QSAR ( quantitative structure-activity relationship) is a method for predicting the physical and biological properties of small molecules; it is today in large use in companies and public services. However , as any scientific method , it is nowadays challenged by more and more requests , especially considering its possible role in assessing the safety of new chemicals. Posing the question whether QSAR is a way not only to exploit available knowledge but also to build new knowledge , we shortly review QSAR history , thus searching for a QSAR epistemology. We consider the three pillars on which QSAR stands: biological data , chemical knowledge , and modeling algorithms. Most of the time we assume that biological data is a true picture of the world ( as they result from good experimental practice) , that chemical knowledge is scientifically true; so if a QSAR is not working , blame modeling. This opens the way to look at the role of modeling in developing scientific theories , and in producing knowledge. QSAR is a mature technology; however , debate is still active in many topics , in particular about the acceptability of the models and how they are explained. After an excursus in inductive reasoning , we relate the QSAR methodology to open debates in the philosophy of science.
