  Public health threats , such as emerging infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , terrorism , environmental catastrophes , and natural disasters , all require effective communication. Emergency risk communication is a critical component of public health emergency planning and response. It is a complex process involving a variety of constructs that interact in dynamic ways over time. While emergency risk communication is generally recognized as an important tool for risk management and emergency response , the specific elements , processes , and outcomes are not well described and have not been systematically assessed. In this article , we describe a conceptual model for public health developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC). We propose using this model to inform practice and to guide evaluations of emergency risk communication. The model was informed by an extensive review of the emergency risk communication literature , interviews with researchers , and discussions with CDC stakeholders. This model can be adapted for a wide range of emergency events and incorporates key constructs to assess internal processes , as well as outcomes of emergency risk communication on audiences. Evaluating internal processes can help identify and correct messaging deficiencies. Outcome constructs describe expected target audience responses to emergency risk communication , such as changes in knowledge , attitudes , beliefs , and behaviors that may occur over time. This can help public health communicators learn how their various activities contribute to emergency risk communication outcomes.
