  To assess the feasibility and efficacy of PuraStat ® , a novel haemostatic agent , in achieving suture line haemostasis in a wide range of cardiac surgical procedures and surgery of the thoracic aorta. A prospective , non-randomised study was conducted at our institution. Operative data on fifty consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery where PuraStat ® was utilised in cases of intraoperative suture line bleeding was prospectively collected. Questionnaires encompassing multiple aspects of the ease of use and efficacy of PuraStat ® were completed by ten surgeons ( five consultants and five senior registrars) and analysed to gauge the performance of the product. No major adverse cardiac events were reported in this cohort. Complications such as atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , pacemaker requirement and pleural effusions<symptom> were comparable to the national average. Mean blood product use of packed red cells , platelets , fresh-frozen plasma ( FFP) and cryoprecipitate was below the national average. There was one incidence of re-exploration , however this was due to pericardial constriction rather than bleeding. Analysis of questionnaire responses revealed that surgeons consistently rated PuraStat ® highly ( between a score of 7 and 10 in the various subcategories). The transparent nature or PuraStat ® allowed unobscured visualisation of suture sites and possessed excellent qualities in terms of adherence to site of application. The application of PuraStat ® did not interfere with the use of other haemostatic agents or manipulation of the suture site by the surgeon. PuraStat ® is an easy-to-use and effective haemostatic agent in a wide range of cardiac and aortic surgical procedures.
