  Therapies are needed to limit progression of fatty liver diseases in patients with HIV<pathogen> infection. We analyzed data from a prospective study of the effects of rosuvastatin ( a statin) on hepatic steatosis in HIV-positive adults. We performed secondary analysis of data from a double-blind trial of adult patients with HIV<pathogen> infection ( 78 % male; 68 % African American; mean age , 46 years; body mass index , 29 kg/m The placebo and rosuvastatin groups each had significant increases in LFS , compared to baseline , at 96 weeks ( P = .01 and P < .01; P = .49 for difference increase between groups). Baseline LFS was independently associated with blood level of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 ( CXCL10) ( P = .04) and soluble CD163 molecule ( P = .01). After we adjusted for baseline characteristics , an increase in LFS over time was significantly associated with blood level of CXCL10 ( P = .04) , insulin resistance ( P < .01) , and viral load ( P = .02) , but not rosuvastatin use ( P = .06). In a secondary analysis of data from a trial of patients receiving treatment for HIV<pathogen> infection , hepatic steatosis increased over time , regardless of statin treatment , and was independently associated with markers of immune activation. Patients who received rosuvastatin appeared to have a nonsignificant increase hepatic steatosis over 96 weeks. Despite their ability to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease , statins do not appear to reduce hepatic steatosis. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01218802.
