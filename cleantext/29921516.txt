  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. With widespread and growing use of smart phones and mobile devices , the use of mobile health ( mHealth) in transmission of physiologic parameters and patient-referred symptoms to healthcare providers and researchers , as well as reminders and care plan applications from providers to patients , has potential to revolutionize both clinical care and the conduct of clinical trials with improved designs , data capture , and potentially lower costs. In randomized early phase proof-of-concept studies , focusing on lifestyle intervention , there is evidence that mHealth technology can improve outcomes. By contrast , results from small randomized controlled trials that tested mHealth interventions in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients were disappointing with inconsistent findings. These inconclusive results could be partially attributed to a lack of methodological rigor ( insufficient sample size , quasi-experimental design , inadequate mHealth equipment). Therefore , there is an urgent need to develop systematic evidence-based guidelines and parameters for mHealth to be effectively utilized in cardiovascular clinical trials.
