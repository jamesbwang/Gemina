  Oxidative stress is associated with the increased risk of hypertension ( HTN). This cross-sectional study is aimed to identify the association between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î´ ( PPARD) polymorphism and plasma malondialdehyde ( MDA) , an oxidative stress marker which is related to HTN development , and to determine whether PPARD gene is a candidate gene for HTN. One thousand seven hundred ninety-three individuals with normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and HTN were included in this cross-sectional study. The Korean Chip was used to obtain genotype data. Through the analysis , the ten most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were nominated for an MDA-related SNP. Among them , the rs7770619 polymorphism was identified in the PPARD gene. The CT genotype of the PPARD rs7770619 C > T polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of HTN before and after adjustments for age , sex , body mass index , smoking , and drinking. Significant associations were observed between plasma MDA and the PPARD rs7770619 C > T polymorphism and between systolic BP and the PPARD rs7770619 SNP in the controls. The CT controls showed significantly lower systolic BP and plasma MDA than the CC controls. Additionally , in both controls and HTN patients , the CT subjects showed significantly lower serum glucose and higher adiponectin levels than the CC subjects. Furthermore , the CT subjects showed significantly higher serum free fatty acid levels than the CC subjects among the HTN patients. This is a new finding that the PPARD rs7770619 C > T SNP is a novel candidate variant for HTN based on the association between PPARD and plasma MDA in a Korean population.
