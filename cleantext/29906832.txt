  A method is introduced to measure the entanglement entropy using a wavelet analysis. Using this method , the two-dimensional Haar wavelet transform of a configuration of Fortuin-Kasteleyn ( FK) clusters is performed. The configuration represents a direct snapshot of spin-spin correlations since spin degrees of freedom are traced out in FK representation. A snapshot of FK clusters loses image information at each coarse-graining process by the wavelet transform. It is shown that the loss of image information measures the entanglement entropy in the Potts model.
