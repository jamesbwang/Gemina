  BACKGROUND Eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) granules are important for the regulation of RNA fate. RNP granules exist in trypanosomatids; however , their roles in controlling gene expression are still not understood. XRNA is a component of granules in Trypanosoma brucei but has not been investigated in Trypanosoma cruzi. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate the TcXRNA dynamic assembly and its interaction with RNP components under conditions that affect the mRNA availability. METHODS We used in vitro metacyclogenesis of T. cruzi to observe changes in RNP granules during the differentiation process. TcXRNA expression was analysed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Colocalisation assays were performed to investigate the interaction of TcXRNA with other RNP components. FINDINGS TcXRNA is constantly present during metacyclogenesis and is localised in cytoplasmic granules. TcXRNA does not colocalise with TcDHH1 and TcCAF1 granules in the cytoplasm. However , TcXRNA granules colocalise with mRNP granules at the nuclear periphery when mRNA processing is inhibited. MAIN CONCLUSIONS TcXRNA plays a role in mRNA metabolism as a component of mRNP granules whose assembly is dependent on mRNA availability. TcXRNA granules colocalise with distinct RNP granules at the nuclear periphery , suggesting that the perinuclear region is a regulatory compartment in T. cruzi mRNA metabolism.
