  Depersonalization and Derealization are characterised by feelings of detachment from one 's bodily self/surroundings and a general emotional numbness. We explored predisposition to trait-based experiences of depersonalization/derealization-type experiences and autonomic arousal toward simulated body-threats , which were delivered to the participant 's own body ( i.e. Self) and when observed being delivered to another individual ( i.e. Other). Ninety participants took part in an `` Implied Body-Threat Illusion '' task ( Dewe , Watson , & Braithwaite , 2016) and autonomic arousal was recorded via standardised skin conductance responses and finger temperature. Autonomic suppression in response to threats delivered to the Self correlated with increases in trait-based depersonalization-type experiences. In contrast , autonomic suppression for threats delivered to Others correlated with trait-based derealization-like experiences. Body-temperature and anticipatory arousal did not correlate reliably with predisposition to depersonalization- or derealization-type experiences. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a fronto-limbic autonomic suppression mechanism.
