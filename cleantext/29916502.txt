  Investigating the change in expression level of mercapto biomolecules ( GSH/Cys/Hcy) necessitates a rapid detection method for a series of physiological and pathological processes. Herein , we present a ligand-displacement-based two-photon fluorogenic probe based on an Fe ( iii) complex<pathogen> , TPFeS , which is a GSH/Cys/Hcy rapid detection fluorogenic probe for in vitro analysis and live cell/tissue/in vivo imaging. The `` in situ '' probe is non-fluorescent and was prepared from a 1: 2 ratio of Fe ( iii) and TPS , a novel two-photon ( TP) fluorophore with excellent one-photon ( OP) and TP properties under physiological conditions , as a fluorescent ligand. This probe shows a rapid and remarkable fluorescence restoration ( OFF-ON) property due to the ligand-displacement reaction of mercapto biomolecules in a recyclable manner in vitro. A significant two-photon action cross-section , good selectivity for biothiols , low cytotoxicity , and insensitivity to pH over the biologically relevant pH range allowed the direct visualization of mercapto biomolecules at different levels between normal/drug-treated live cells , as well as in Drosophila brain tissues/zebrafish based on the use of two-photon fluorescence microscopy.
