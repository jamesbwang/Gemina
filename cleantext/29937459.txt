  Two dogs with low plasma testosterone ( T) levels and poor semen quality were administered one tablet of 12.5 mg clomiphene citrate orally per day at 2-day intervals for 4 weeks. Plasma T levels , total sperm count , and sperm motility in both dogs temporarily increased between 3 and 6 weeks after the start of treatment. These results indicate that poor semen quality in dogs with low plasma T level can be improved by oral administration of clomiphene citrate.
