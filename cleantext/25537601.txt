  The development of in-vitro techniques to characterise the behaviour of cells in biomedical scaffolds is a rapidly developing field. However , until now it has not been possible to visualise , directly in 3D , the extent of cell migration using a desktop X-ray microCT. This paper describes a new technique based on cell labelling with a radio opacifier ( barium sulphate) , which permits cell tracking without the need for destructive sample preparation. The ability to track cells is highlighted via a comparison of cell migration through demonstrator lyophilised collagen scaffolds with contrasting pore size and interconnectivity. The results demonstrate the ease with which the technique can be used to characterise the effects of scaffold architecture on cell infiltration.
