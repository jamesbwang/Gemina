  Physical inactivity is a major public health problem associated with an increased risk of several psychiatric and physical conditions. This study investigated the association between leisure time physical activity ( PA) and incident use of prescription tranquilizers in a regionally representative and prospective cohort. A total of 4043 men and women ( mean age: 61.3 years; 57 % women) from the Troms√∏ Study were followed for six years. Leisure time PA was captured at baseline. Psychiatric morbidity was measured by use of prescription tranquilizers , captured at both baseline and follow-up. Leisure time PA at baseline was used as a predictor of subsequent ( incident) use of prescription tranquilizers. We used multinomial regression models and Poisson regression models to estimate relative risk-ratios ( RRRs) , and relative risks ( RRs) , respectively , and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). In the fully-adjusted model , accounting for socio-demographic factors , parental history of psychopathology , years of education , smoking , respondent 's psychopathology at baseline , and occupational PA , a lower leisure time PA conferred a 41 % increased risk of incident use of prescription tranquilizers at follow-up ( RR = 1.41 , 95 % CI: 1.09 , 1.83; p = 0.010). These findings suggest that physical inactivity increases the risk of psychiatric morbidity ( albeit , measured via use of prescription tranquilizers). Future regionally representative and longitudinal research is required to confirm/refute our findings and explore underlying mechanisms.
