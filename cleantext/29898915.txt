  HNF4α is a key nuclear receptor for regulating gene expression in the gut. Although both P1 and P2 isoform classes of HNF4α are expressed in colonic epithelium , specific inhibition of P1 isoforms is commonly found in colorectal cancer. Previous studies have suggested that P1 and P2 isoforms might regulate different cellular functions. Despite these advances , it remains unclear whether these isoform classes are functionally divergent in the context of human biology. Here , the consequences of specific inhibition of P1 or P2 isoform expression was measured in a human colorectal cancer cell transcriptome. Results indicate that P1 isoforms were specifically associated with the control of cell metabolism , whereas P2 isoforms globally supported aberrant oncogenic signalization , promoting cancer cell survival and progression. P1 promoter-driven isoform expression was found to be repressed by β-catenin , one of the earliest oncogenic pathways to be activated during colon tumorigenesis. These findings identify a novel cascade by which the expression of P1 isoforms is rapidly shut down in the early stages of colon tumorigenesis , allowing a change in HNF4α-dependent transcriptome , thereby promoting colorectal cancer progression.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
