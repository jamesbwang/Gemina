  The high-probability ( high-p) instructional sequence , which involves the delivery of a series of high-p instructions immediately before delivery of a low-probability ( low-p) instruction , is a commonly used procedure to increase compliance among children and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Although the modal ratio of high-p instructions to low-p instructions is 3:1 , other ratios may be more effective. In the current study , we compared three ratios of high-p with low-p instructions ( i.e. , 1:1 , 3:1 , and 5:1) during use of the high-p instructional sequence to increase compliance among three children with autism. Results suggest that the high-p sequence was effective to increase compliance for two of three participants and that the 5:1 ratio was most effective overall , although differences among ratios were slight for some participants. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.
