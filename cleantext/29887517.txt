  Hypoglycemia can be considered the most common complication of Diabetes Mellitus treatment. So far , controversial studies have been carried out to examine the impacts of hypoglycemia on the cognitive function. This study was conducted as case-control. The case group was 35 patients with Diabetes Mellitus Types I or II hospitalized in Imam Hussein Hospital , Tehran , Iran , who have experienced hypoglycemic attacks ( glucose level below 70 mg/dl). The control group consisted of diabetic patients hospitalized in hospital , but they had no history of hypoglycemia. As the blood glucose level became in normal range and the patients ' Mental<symptom> status<symptom> became stable , the brain cognitive function was examined using Mini-Mental State test. The mean age of the subjects in the case and control groups was 56.77 , 53.73 years old , respectively. The mean cognitive score in the control and hypoglycemic groups was 29.09 and 25.29 , respectively. The mean MMSE cognitive score was significantly diminished in the hypoglycemic group ( p < 0.001). This study indicated that incidence of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients is associated with cognitive disorders. Further , there is a linear association between cognitive disorders and hypoglycemia , age and diabetes mellitus complication.
