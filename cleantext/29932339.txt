  Various active ingredients play a crucial role in providing and supplementing the nutritional requirements of organisms. In this work , we attempted to chemically manipulate the interfacial microstructure of oil-water microemulsions ( ME) with carbon dots ( CDs) , concentrating on substantially enhancing the antioxidant capacity of Î±-linolenic acid ( ALA). To this end , CDs were synthesized and introduced into an ME. The molecular interaction of surfactant with CDs was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR). The microstructure of the ME was monitored by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM). The cryo-EM result showed the oil-water interface in the ME was better defined after the CDs were loaded , and
