  In this contribution , a rigorous numerical calibration is proposed to characterize the excitation of propagating mechanical waves by interdigitated transducers ( IDTs). The transition from IDT terminals to phonon waveguides is modeled by means of a general circuit representation that makes use of Scattering Matrix ( SM) formalism. In particular , the three-step calibration approach called the Thru-Reflection-Line ( TRL) , that is a well-established technique in microwave engineering , has been successfully applied to emulate typical experimental conditions. The proposed procedure is suitable for the synthesis/optimization of surface-acoustic-wave ( SAW) based devices: the TRL calibration allows to extract/de-embed the acoustic component , namely resonator or filter , from the outer IDT structure , regardless of complexity and size of the letter. We report , as a result , the hybrid scattering parameters of the IDT transition to a mechanical waveguide formed by a phononic crystal patterned on a piezoelectric AlN membrane , where the effect of a discontinuity from periodic to uniform mechanical waveguide is also characterized. In addition , to ensure the correctness of our numerical calculations , the proposed method has been validated by independent calculations.
