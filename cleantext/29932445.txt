  Plasma electrolytic oxidation ( PEO) technique is one of the important methods used in the surface modification of magnesium alloys. In this paper , the ceramic coatings on pretreated KBM10 magnesium alloy with Nd ( NO ₃) ₃ solution were prepared by PEO. The effects of Nd ( NO ₃) ₃ solution concentration on the microstructure and corrosion resistance of PEO coatings on magnesium alloys were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , X-ray diffractometer ( XRD) , and electrochemical workstation. It was found that the surface of the coatings was porous after PEO , and element Nd could be deposited on the surface of the coatings by pretreatment and existed in the PEO coatings. The coating formed at Nd ( NO ₃) ₃ solution concentration of 0.06 mol/L exhibited the best corrosion resistance among all the as-prepared coatings.
