  Clozapine is an antipsychotic that produces serious withdrawal effects in schizophrenic patients. Olfactory deficits are well known as part of negative symptoms , but it is not known whether antipsychotic use and/or withdrawal are implicated. Then , we tested clozapine withdrawal in association with two widely used schizophrenia models: Neonatal immune challenge by Polycitidilic-polyinosinic acid ( polyI: C) and ketamine. PolyI: C ( or saline) was injected subcutaneously in neonatal period , dose of 5 mg/kg from 2 to 6 Post Natal Days , and ketamine or saline at the dose 25mg/kg intraperitoneally ( i.p.) , daily for 7 days from 53 to 60 post natal day. Clozapine 10mg/kg ( or saline) was administered i.p. from 46 to 60 post natal day. Olfactory discrimination test ( sensorial and cognitive deficit) was performed at 61 post natal day , 24h after the last injections. The association of PolyI: C , ketamine and clozapine disrupted Olfactory Discrimination , equating time in familiar and non-familiar compartments. PolyI: C plus ketamine increased crossings between compartments. It was produced , for the first time , an olfactory deficit induced by clozapine withdrawal in Wistar rats subjected to schizophrenia animal models.
