  Pathway analysis of gastric atrophy to find new molecular prospective of disease. Gastric atrophy as a process which is accompanied with `` loss of glans '' in stomach can be considered as a risk factor of gastric cancer. Here , the correlated biochemical pathways to the disorder have been analyzed via protein-protein interaction ( PPI) network analysis. The genes related to gastric atrophy were retrieved by STRING database and organized in a network by Cytoscape. Three significant clusters were determined by ClusterONE plug-in of Cytoscape. The elements of cluster-2 which contained all central nodes of the network were enriched by ClueGO and the biochemical pathways discussed in details. The number of seven central nodes ( which are included in cluster-2); INS , TP53 , IL6 , TNF , SRC , MYC , and IL8 were identified. The biochemical pathways related to the elements of cluster-2 were determined and clustered in nine groups. The pathways were discussed in details. Pathway analysis indicates that the introduced central genes of the network can be considered as biomarkers of gastric atrophy.
