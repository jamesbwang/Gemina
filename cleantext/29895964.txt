  Alzheimer disease ( AD) is the most common form of dementia. Pathologically , AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain , with associated loss of synapses and neurons , resulting in cognitive deficits and eventually dementia. Amyloid-β ( Aβ) peptide and tau protein are the primary components of the plaques and tangles , respectively. In the decades since Aβ and tau were identified , development of therapies for AD has primarily focused on Aβ , but tau has received more attention in recent years , in part because of the failure of various Aβ-targeting treatments in clinical trials. In this article , we review the current status of tau-targeting therapies for AD. Initially , potential anti-tau therapies were based mainly on inhibition of kinases or tau aggregation , or on stabilization of microtubules , but most of these approaches have been discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently , the majority of tau-targeting therapies in clinical trials are immunotherapies , which have shown promise in numerous preclinical studies. Given that tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments than do Aβ lesions<symptom> , targeting of tau is expected to be more effective than Aβ clearance once the clinical symptoms are evident. With future improvements in diagnostics , these two hallmarks of the disease might be targeted prophylactically.
