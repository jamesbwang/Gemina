  An empirical approach was taken to screen a novel synthetic compound library designed to be active against Gram-positive bacteria. We obtained five compounds that were active against spores from the model organism Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and the food-borne pathogen Bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> during our population based experiments. Using single cell live imaging we were able to observe effects of the compounds on spore germination and outgrowth. Difference in sensitivity to the compounds could be observed between B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> using live imaging , with minor difference in the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of the compounds against the spores. The compounds all delayed the bursting time of germinated spores and affected the generation time of vegetative cells at sub-inhibitory concentrations. At inhibitory concentrations spore outgrowth was prevented. One compound showed an unexpected potential for preventing spore germination at inhibitory concentrations , which merits further investigation. Our study shows the valuable role single cell live imaging can play in the final selection process of antimicrobial compounds.
