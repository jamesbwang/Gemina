  Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC) 2 is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ABCB11 gene , which encodes the bile salt export pump ( BSEP). Recurrence of BSEP deficiency after liver transplantation ( LT) is caused by the development of anti-BSEP antibodies. Antibody-induced BSEP deficiency ( AIBD) is typically treated by increasing immunosuppressive therapy. We report the first case of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) for AIBD in a child refractory to intensive pharmacological immunosuppression and immunoadsorption. After HSCT , anti-BSEP antibodies were cleared from the patient 's serum and later from the canalicular space of the liver graft.
