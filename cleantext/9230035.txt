  Comparing to primary surgery , revision ACL reconstruction is more technically demanding and has a higher failure rate. Theoretically , rehabilitation can improve knee function after ACL reconstruction surgery. This study aimed to compare knee stability , strength , and function between primary and revision ACL reconstructed knees. 40 primary and 40 revision ACL reconstruction surgeries were included between April 2013 and May 2016. Patients with revision surgery had a higher anteroposterior translation comparing those with primary reconstruction ( median laxity , 2.0 mm vs. 3.0 mm , p = 0.0022). No differences were noted in knee extensor at 60 째/ sec or 180 째/ sec ( p = 0.308 , p = 0.931 , respectively) or in flexor muscle strength at 60 째/ sec or 180 째/ sec between primary and revision ACL reconstruction knees ( p = 0.091 , p = 0.343 , respectively). There were also no significant differences between functional scores including IKDC score and Lysholm score in primary versus revision surgeries at 12th months after index operation ( p = 0.154 , p = 0.324 , respectively). In conclusion , despite having higher anteroposterior instability , patients with revision ACL reconstruction can have non-inferior outcomes in isokinetic knee strength and function compared to those with primary ACL reconstruction after proper rehabilitation.
