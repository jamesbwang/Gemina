  Working alliance between the physiotherapist and patient is important for successful treatment in physiotherapy. Working alliance can be measured by a 12-item self-reporting measure with 7-point Likert scale , the Working Alliance Inventory Short-Form Client ( WAI-SC). To develop a shorter version of the Japanese WAI-SC through examination of factor structure and test-retest reliability. Survey. A convenience sample of 118 outpatients with musculoskeletal disorders completed the WAI-SC immediately after the third consultation and 101 of them completed the WAI-SC immediately before the fourth consultation. Through investigations of internal consistency , test-retest reliability , and factor structure , a single structure was detected by excluding Item 4 and Item 10. Score calculation was also modified to dichotomous variables ( Score 7 or other scores) due to serious ceiling effects , where > 50 % of responses were Score 7. A five-item questionnaire with dichotomous score rating ( Modified WAI-SC Japanese musculoskeletal version) was developed through consideration of internal consistency and item-total correlation analysis. This questionnaire demonstrated adequate internal consistency ( Cronbach 's α = 0.88) and excellent test-retest reliability for each item ( Cohen 's κ for all > 0.4) and total scores ( intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84). The five-item Modified WAI-SC Japanese musculoskeletal version was developed with a single factor structure showing adequate internal consistency and excellent test-retest reliability.
