  Emerging evidence has identified that exosomes play a pivotal role in intercellular signal transmission. However , the standardized purification techniques to isolate high quality exosomes are still deficient at present. This study was to evaluate reproducibility and efficiency of differential ultracentrifugation and solvent precipitation-based kits by isolating plasma-derived exosomes from oral lichen planus patients. Morphology , exosomal biomarkers , particle size distribution , proteomic components , and protein yield of isolated exosomes were evaluated by transmission electron microscope , western blot , laser diffraction instrument , Coomassie staining , and BCA protein assay kit , respectively. TEM displayed representative cup-shaped morphology of exosomes and western blot identified exosomal biomarkers CD9 and CD63. The size distribution showed that particles by differential ultracentrifugation were mainly from 26.15 nm to 166.5 nm , while some of the particles obtained by solvent precipitation kits were larger than 1,000 nm. In addition , exosomes isolated by solvent precipitation kits showed a significantly higher amount of protein yield due to plasma albumin contamination. Both differential ultracentrifugation and precipitation based kits could successfully isolate plasma exosomes , and exosomes by differential ultracentrifugation were purer and more appropriate for further proteomic analysis.
