  Dimethylsulfide ( DMS) plays a globally significant role in carbon and sulfur cycling and impacts Earth 's climate because its oxidation products serve as nuclei for cloud formation. While the initial steps of aerobic DMS degradation and the fate of its carbon atoms are reasonably well documented , oxidation of the contained sulfur is largely unexplored. Here , we identified a novel pathway of sulfur compound oxidation in the ubiquitously occurring DMS-degrader Hyphomicrobium denitrificans<pathogen> X
