  While epidemiological studies have reported a potential role for hypercholesterolemia ( HCE) in osteoarthritis ( OA) , the association between HCE and OA has yet to be clarified. Adipose tissue is a primary locus for cholesterol metabolism and the presence of HCE reportedly causes adipose dysfunction. The knee joint contains adipose tissue in the form of the infrapatellar fat pad ( IPFP) , which has been shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of OA in the knee via the secretion of inflammatory mediators. However , the effect of HCE on the expression of inflammatory mediators in the IPFP has not been elucidated. IPFP and synovial tissues ( ST) were extracted from 145 subjects with OA , diagnosed by radiography , during total knee arthroplasty. OA patients were divided into three groups according to their total cholesterol levels ( Desirable , Borderline high and High) based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEPATP III). We examined the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) , microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 ( mPGES1) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β , and IL-6 using real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared results among the Desirable , Borderline high and High groups. The mRNA expression levels of TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6 in ST and the IPFP were not significantly different among the three groups. COX-2 mRNA expression in ST and IPFP was likewise not different among the three groups. While the mRNA expression level of mPGES1 in ST was also not significantly different , that of mPGES1 in the IPFP was significantly lower in the High group than in the Desirable and Borderline high groups. mRNA levels of mPGES-1 are reduced in the IPFP of knee OA patients with HCE. Additional studies are need to clarify the effect of mPGES-1 down-regulation in OA pathology.
