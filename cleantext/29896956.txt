  Mechanical phenotypes of cells are found to hold vital clues to reveal cellular functions and behaviors , which not only has great physiological significance but also is crucial for disease diagnosis. To this end , we developed a set of electrodeformation-based biomechanical microchip assays to quantify mechanical phenotypes on the single-cell level. By investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of cancer cells driven by dielectrophoresis forces , we captured the key global viscoelastic indexes including cellular elasticity , viscosity , and transition time that was defined as the ratio of the transient viscosity and elasticity , simultaneously , and thus explored their intrinsic correlation with cell cycle progression. Our results showed that both global elasticity and viscosity have a significant periodic variation with cell cycle progression , but the transition time remained unchanged in the process , indicating that it might be an intrinsic property of cancer cells that is independent of the cell cycle and the type of cell in the experiments. Further , we investigated the molecular mechanism regulating cellular viscoelastic phenotypes on the biomechanical chips through intracellular cytoskeletal perturbation assays. These findings , together with the electrodeformation-based microchip technique , not only reveal the relation between mechanical phenotypes of cancer cells and cell cycle progression but also provide a platform for implementing multi-index mechanical phenotype assays associated with cancer cell cycles in the clinic.
