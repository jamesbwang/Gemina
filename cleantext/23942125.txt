  Being successful in an academic environment places many demands on junior scientists. Science communication currently may not be adequately valued and rewarded , and yet communication to multiple audiences is critical for ensuring that it remains a priority in today 's society. Due to the potential for science communication to produce better scientists , facilitate scientific progress , and influence decision-making at multiple levels , training junior scientists in both effective and ethical science communication practices is imperative , and can benefit scientists regardless of their chosen career path. However , many challenges exist in addressing specific aspects of this training. Principally , science communication training and resources should be made readily available to junior scientists at institutions , and there is a need to scale up existing science communication training programs and standardize core aspects of these programs across universities , while also allowing for experimentation with training. We propose a comprehensive core training program be adopted by universities , utilizing a centralized online resource with science communication information from multiple stakeholders. In addition , the culture of science must shift toward greater acceptance of science communication as an essential part of training. For this purpose , the science communication field itself needs to be developed , researched and better understood at multiple levels. Ultimately , this may result in a larger cultural change toward acceptance of professional development activities as valuable for training scientists.
