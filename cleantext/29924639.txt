  Although the body is central to health outcomes , the provider 's body has been largely absent in the provider-patient relationship. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM) providers ( N = 17) , this study examines how CAM providers use their body<symptom> to characterize their work as healers. The findings suggest the provider 's self-reflexive awareness of their own body 's illness and faith experiences informs their understanding of the patients ' experience of health and disease. The study foregrounds the intersubjective nature of the provider-patient relationship as an embodied interaction in the mutual construction of therapeutic goals. Provider reflection on their own bodies to make sense of their patients ' experiences emphasizes provider-patient coproduction of meaning and suggests ways for including the provider 's self-reflexive awareness of their own body in a patient-centered healthcare relationship in ways that benefit both the patient and the provider.
