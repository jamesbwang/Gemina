  Shared decision making ( SDM) is a key attribute of patient-centered care , which empowers palliative care patients to be able to make optimal medical decisions about end-of-life treatments based on their own values and preferences. The aim of this systematic literature review is to detail and compare interventions supporting SDM over the last 10 years ( January 2008 to December 2017) and to analyze patient/caregiver outcomes at the end of life. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed , CINAHL , Embase , and Cochrane Library were searched with key search terms: SDM , decision aid , decision support , palliative care , and hospice care. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The initial search yielded 2705 articles , and 12 studies were included in the final review. The quality of the studies was modest and technology-enabled delivery modes ( e.g. , video , DVD , web-based tool) were most commonly used. Patient/caregiver knowledge of end-of-life care was the most common primary outcome across studies. The strength of the association between the SDM interventions and patient/caregiver outcomes varied. The findings from the studies that examined the effects of the SDM intervention on patient outcomes were inconsistent , highlighting the need for further SDM intervention studies among diverse patient populations using consistent measures. Given the availability of health technologies , future studies should focus on developing individual-tailored , technology-enabled interventions to support patient-centered medical decision making.
