  Acute ischemic stroke is devastating to patients and their families because of few viable therapeutic options to promote recovery after reperfusion windows close. Recent breakthroughs in biotechnology have resulted in a reproducible patented process for the purification of extracellular vesicles ( EVs) from human cardiosphere-derived cells ( CDCs). Because CDC-EVs have many features potentially beneficial to treat acute ischemic stroke , CDC-EVs were evaluated in an established small-clot rabbit embolic stroke model , where clinically relevant end points were used to assess recovery in a more translational large animal model. Biodistribution studies with fluorescent DiD-labeled CDC-EVs showed intense uptake in the ischemic region of the brain. In this report , we show that intravenous ( IV) CDC-EVs ( 0.75 mg/kg) administered 1-hour post-embolization significantly attenuate behavioral deficits following an embolic stroke in rabbits. In CDC-EV-treated rabbits , P
