  The Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> is a rapidly spreading Aedes<pathogen> mosquito-borne sickness , which creates an unanticipated linkage birth deformity and neurological turmoil. This study represents the use of the combinatorial immunoinformatics approach to develop a multiepitope subunit vaccine using the structural and nonstructural proteins of the Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> The designed subunit vaccine consists of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and helper T-lymphocyte epitopes accompanied by suitable adjuvant and linkers. The presence of humoral immune response specific B-cell epitopes was also confirmed by B-cell epitope mapping among vaccine protein. Further , the vaccine protein was characterized for its allergenicity , antigenicity , and physiochemical parameters and found to be safe and immunogenic. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies of the vaccine protein with the toll-like receptor-3 were performed to ensure the binding affinity and stability of their complex. Finally , in silico cloning was performed for the effective expression of vaccine construct in the microbial system ( Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K12 strain). Aforementioned approaches result in the multiepitope subunit vaccine which may have the ability to induce cellular as well as humoral immune response. Moreover , this study needs the experimental validation to prove the immunogenic and protective behavior of the developed subunit vaccine.
