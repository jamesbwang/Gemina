  Anisotropically compartmentalized microparticles have attracted increasing interest in areas ranging from sensing , drug delivery , and catalysis to microactuators. Herein , a facile method is reported for the preparation of helically decorated microbuilding blocks , using a modified electrohydrodynamic cojetting method. Bicompartmental microfibers are twisted in situ , during electrojetting , resulting in helical microfibers. Subsequent cryosectioning of aligned fiber bundles provides access to helically decorated microcylinders. The unique helical structure endows the microfibers/microcylinders with several novel functions such as translational motion in response to rotating magnetic fields. Finally , microspheres with helically patterned compartments are obtained after interfacially driven shape shifting of helically decorated microcylinders.
