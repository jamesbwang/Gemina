  Simultaneous augmentation-mastopexy is a particularly tricky operation with a considerable reoperation rate. The pectoralis muscle sling has proven to be a suitable alternative technique for long-term results in breast parenchyma suspension without silicone implants. This study aims to propose a promising approach to simultaneous augmentation-mastopexy revisional surgery using an inverted dual-plane technique acting as a muscular sling. A 10-year historic cohort was conducted to obtain the following variables from our preexisting database: age , preoperative measurements , operative technicalities , implant details , time from procedure to revision , complications , and outcomes. Twenty-six patients assessed after the initial postoperative year were analyzed. Review of this series of patients revealed a revision rate of 3.8 % and overall rate of morbidity of 11.5 %. Simultaneous augmentation-mastopexy using an inverted dual-plane technique acting as a muscular sling is a reliable and safe procedure. Review of this series of patients revealed low rates of morbidity and reoperation need. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
