  Hydrogels are attractive matrices for cell-based cartilage tissue regeneration given their injectability and ability to fill defects with irregular shapes. However , most hydrogels developed to date often lack cell scale macroporosity , which restrains the encapsulated cells , leading to delayed new extracellular matrix deposition restricted to pericellular regions. Further , tissue engineered cartilage using conventional hydrogels generally suffers from poor mechanical property and fails to restore the load-bearing property of articular cartilage. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of macroporous gelatin-based microribbon ( µRB) hydrogels as novel 3D matrices for accelerating chondrogenesis and new cartilage formation by human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in 3D with improved mechanical properties. Unlike conventional hydrogels , these µRB hydrogels are inherently macroporous and exhibit cartilage-mimicking shock-absorbing mechanical property. After 21 days of culture , MSC-seeded µRB scaffolds exhibit a 20-fold increase in compressive modulus to 225 kPa , a range that is approaching the level of native cartilage. In contrast , HGs only resulted in a modest increase in compressive modulus of 65 kPa. Compared to conventional hydrogels , macroporous µRB scaffolds significantly increased the total amount of neocartilage produced by MSCs in 3D , with improved interconnectivity and mechanical strength. Together , these results validate gelatin-based μRBs as promising scaffolds for enhancing and accelerating MSC-based cartilage regeneration and may be used to enhance cartilage regeneration using other cell types as well.
