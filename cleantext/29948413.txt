  Busseola fusca<pathogen> is a maize and sorghum pest that can cause significant damage to both crops. Given that maize is one of the main cereals grown in the worldwide , this pest is a major challenge for maize production and therefore for the economies of several countries. In this paper , based on the life cycle of B. fusca<pathogen> , we propose a mathematical model to study the population dynamics of this insect pest. A sensitivity analysis using the eFast method was performed to show the most important parameters of the model. We present the theoretical analysis of the model. More precisely , we derive a threshold parameter ( Formula: see text) , called basic offspring number and show that the trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever ( Formula: see text) , while if ( Formula: see text) , the non trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.
