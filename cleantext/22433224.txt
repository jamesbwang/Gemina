  We described an 88-year-old woman presented with large aneurysm<disease> on the carotid siphon of the right internal carotid artery ( ICA). Digital subtraction angiography showed extravasation from the distal cervical segment of the right ICA due to positioning a guiding catheter for intra-aneurysmal coil embolization. Transoral carotid ultrasonography ( TOCU) showed arrested bleeding and a pseudolumen in the distal cervical segment of the right ICA. We originally described that TOCU was useful for evaluating iatrogenic extravasation and extracranial ICA dissection during neurointervention.
