  The complications of Alzheimer 's disease AD were deadly dangerous cause of neurodegenerative disorders connected with the decline of the cognitive functions and loss of memory. The common form of dementia is accounted as the sixth leading cause of the death affecting any stage of people in a lifetime. Synthetic natural chalcone analogs were currently a hot research topic for the treatment of ( AD) which has affected millions of peoples throughout the world. The present aim was set to understand the important problems of the AD and its treatment based on natural derivatives of novel chalcones. One interesting strategy currently of searching for the treatment of AD is to find inhibitors for acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) and using metal chelators to target amyloid-β ( Aβ) peptides , and then metal-Aβ complexes for the AD pathogenesis. The present compressed review focuses and highlights the design and synthesis of new approaches for the construction of important chalcones playing multiple beneficiary roles in the AD treatments. These hallmarks of concurred research represent the immediate needs of development of novel therapeutic drugs for effective treatment of ADs by understanding the specific pharmacology targets.
