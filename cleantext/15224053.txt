  Managing mild-to-moderate Class II malocclusion is one of the common and major challenges to orthodontists. Class II discrepancies with mandibular deficiency during active growth are usually treated using myofunctional appliances. Fixed functional appliances evolved due to the noncompliance with conventional myofunctional appliances. One of the latest Class II correctors is the PowerScope appliance. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount , time , and rate of molar correction and efficacy of PowerScope. A total of 10 participants , between 15 and 19 years ' age group ( mean = 16.8 years; 5 males and 5 females) , requiring treatment of Class II malocclusion were considered for this study. All routine records were made. After initial leveling and alignment , lateral cephalogram was taken in standardized natural head position using Planmeca ProMax unit. Later , PowerScope was installed and a patient was monitored every month for further adjustment and reactivation. On achieving Class I molar relation , skeletal , dental , and soft-tissue linear and angular parameters were measured using Dolphin Imaging Software. Amount , rate , and total treatment time for molar correction were measured. Molar correction was calculated by taking S vertical as reference plane. The obtained values were statistically analyzed using paired There were statistically significant changes seen in dentoalveolar parameters such as lower incisor proclination , mandibular molar advancement , and reduction in both overjet and overbite. In skeletal parameters , due to the anterior positioning of the mandible , sagittal parameters showed statistically significant changes. In the soft tissue , a significant improvement in facial profile was seen , due to the anterior movement of soft-tissue pogonion. The results of this study have shown that statistically significant differences were found in dentoalveolar , soft-tissue , and skeletal parameters.
