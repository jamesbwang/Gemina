  GlycoStore is a curated chromatographic , electrophoretic and mass-spectrometry composition database of N- , O- , glycosphingolipid ( GSL) glycans and free oligosaccharides associated with a range of glycoproteins , glycolipids and biotherapeutics. The database is built on publicly available experimental data sets from GlycoBase developed in the Oxford Glycobiology Institute and then the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training ( NIBRT). It has now been extended to include recently published and in-house data collections from the Bioprocessing Technology Institute ( BTI) A * STAR , Macquarie University and Ludger Ltd.. GlycoStore provides access to approximately 850 unique glycan structure entries supported by over 8500 retention positions determined by: 1) hydrophilic interaction chromatography ( HILIC) ultra-high performance liquid chromatography ( U/HPLC) and reversed phase ( RP)- U/HPLC with fluorescent detection; 2) porous graphitized carbon ( PGC) chromatography in combination with ESI-MS/MS detection; and 3) capillary electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection ( CE-LIF). GlycoStore enhances many features previously available in GlycoBase while addressing the limitations of the data collections and model of this popular resource. GlycoStore aims to support detailed glycan analysis by providing a resource that underpins current workflows. It will be regularly updated by expert annotation of published data and data obtained from the project partners. http://www.glycostore.org. m.campbell2@griffith.edu.au.
