  O-GlcNAcylation is an essential post-translational modification important for integrating metabolism with cell physiology. Using diverse model systems , studies of this evolutionarily conserved intracellular glycosylation have highlighted its role in stem cell maintenance , lineage specification , and disease. Although discovered over 30 years ago , the study of O-GlcNAc continues to evolve and uncover surprising roles for O-GlcNAc and the enzymes of O-GlcNAc cycling: O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT) and O-GlcNAcase ( OGA). In this review , using the immune system as a model of stem cell biology and cell fate determination , we discuss how O-GlcNAc is at the nexus of metabolism , proliferation , and disease.
