  Oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the vessel wall , but paradoxically , global loss of Nrf2 in apoE deficient mice alleviates atherosclerosis. In this study , we investigated the effect of global Nrf2 deficiency on early and advanced atherogenesis in alternative models of atherosclerosis , LDL receptor deficient mice ( LDLR-/-) and LDLR-/- mice expressing apoB-100 only ( LDLR-/- ApoB100/100) having a humanized lipoprotein profile. LDLR-/- mice were fed a high fat diet ( HFD) for 6 or 12 weeks and LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 mice a regular chow diet for 6 or 12 months. Nrf2 deficiency significantly reduced early and more advanced atherosclerosis assessed by lesion<symptom> size and coverage in the aorta in both models. Nrf2 deficiency in LDLR-/- mice reduced total plasma cholesterol after 6 weeks of HFD and triglycerides in LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 mice on a chow diet. Nrf2 deficiency aggravated aortic plaque maturation in aged LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 mice as it increased plaque calcification. Moreover , approximately 36 % of Nrf2-/- LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 females developed spontaneous myocardial infarction or sudden death at 5 to 12 months of age. Interestingly , Nrf2 deficiency increased plaque instability index , enhanced plaque inflammation<symptom> and calcification , and reduced fibrous cap thickness in brachiocephalic arteries of LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 female mice at age of 12 months. Absence of Nrf2 reduced atherosclerotic lesion<symptom> size in both atherosclerosis models , likely via systemic effects on lipid metabolism. However , Nrf2 deficiency in aged LDLR-/- ApoB100/100 mice led to an enhanced atherosclerotic plaque instability likely via increased plaque inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress , which possibly predisposed to myocardial infarction and sudden death.
