  The immunological characteristics of young Korean children with walnut ( WN) allergy and the influence of different cooking methods on WN proteins have not been evaluated to date. This study aimed to evaluate the major WN allergens identified among Korean children , together with changes in WN antigenicity caused by common cooking methods. We enrolled children under the age of 13 years with WN serum-specific immunoglobulin ( Ig) E concentrations. The protein fractions of dry-fried and boiled WN extracts were compared with those of raw WNs using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE) , 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis ( 2DE) and a proteomic analysis using electrospray ionization ( liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS)). An immunoblotting analysis was conducted to examine IgE reactivity toward raw WNs using serum samples from 6 children with a clinical WN allergy. To determine the processed WN proteins with IgE-binding capacity , a 2D-immunoblotting analysis was performed using the pooled sera of 20 WN-sensitized children. Protein bands from raw WNs were identified at 9 , 16 , 28 , 52 , 58 , and 64 kDa via SDS-PAGE. The 9- and 16-kDa protein bands were enhanced by boiling , whereas the 52- and 64-kDa bands were considerably diminished. On LC-MS analysis , of the 66 IgE-binding proteins present in raw WNs , 57 were found in dry-fried WNs , but only 4 in boiled WNs. The sera of 5 out of 6 participants reacted with the 52-kDa protein bands and those of 4 out of 6 participants reacted with the 16- and 28-kDa protein bands , respectively. Meanwhile , a 2D-immunoblotting result confirmed the presence of different binding patterns among children who consumed cooked WNs. The protein profile of boiled WNs is substantially different from that of raw WNs. However , 4 proteins including prolamins remained stable after dry-frying or boiling. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings.
