  Despite similarities with BRCA-mutated breast cancers , triple-negative breast cancers ( TNBC) remain resistant to poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) inhibitors as single agents. Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi) can decrease expression of proteins involved in DNA repair. We thus hypothesized that a HDACi ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA) or belinostat) could sensitize TNBC to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Human TNBC cells were co-treated with olaparib and either SAHA or belinostat , and their effects on survival , proliferation , cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair pathways were evaluated. Subcutaneous xenografts were used to determine the effect of the combination treatment in vivo. HDACi and olaparib synergistically inhibited proliferation of a panel of 8 TNBC cell lines in vitro and in nude mice harboring TNBC xenografts in vivo. We noted a weaker synergism in PTEN-deficient TNBC cells and a stronger synergism in BRCA1-mutated TNBC cells. In the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC-1937 , we observed a drastic decrease in the expression of proteins involved in homologous recombination ( HR) , leading to a large imbalance of the ratio P-H2AX/ RAD51. In BRCA1 wild type ( wt) cell lines , effect of the combination treatment relied on DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest followed by induction of apoptosis. In summary , these results provide a preclinical rationale to combine a HDACi with a PARP inhibitor to reduce HR efficiency in TNBC and sensitize these aggressive tumors to PARP inhibition.
