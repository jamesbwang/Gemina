  Although the role of ethylene-response factor ( ERF) Pti4 in disease resistance has been demonstrated in higher plants , it is presently unknown whether the tomato SlPti4 protein plays a role in the regulation of fruit development and the stress response. Here , we show that SlPti4 is involved in the regulation of fruit ripening , seed germination , and responses to drought and Botrytis<pathogen> cinerea<pathogen> infection through adjustments to ABA metabolism and signaling. SlPti4 gene expression is very low early in fruit development , but increases rapidly during ripening and can be induced by exogenous ABA and 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylate ( ACC). RNA interference ( RNAi)- induced silencing of SlPti4 leads to the increase of ABA accumulation together with the decrease of ethylene release which causes the high expression level of SlBcyc , thereby the transgenic fruit is orange instead of red of the WT fruit during ripening. SlPti4-RNAi seeds accumulate less ABA and mRNA for ABA receptor SlPYL genes , which causes insensitivity to ABA treatment. SlPti4-RNAi transgenic plants with low ABA levels and high ethylene release were more sensitive to drought stress. SlPti4-RNAi plants showed weaker resistance on B. cinerea<pathogen> infection than WT plants as well. Thus , SlPti4 is an important regulator of tomato fruit ripening , seed germination , and abiotic/biotic stress responses. This study expands our knowledge on diverse plant physiologies which is regulated by ABA signaling and function of SlPti4.
