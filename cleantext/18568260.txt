  Providing preferred methods of contraceptive for HIV-positive women and avoiding unintended pregnancy is one of the primary means of preventing mother to child transmission of HIV<pathogen>. This study assessed the prevalence of contraceptive use and method preference among HIV-positive women in Amhara region , Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among HIV-positive women in three referral hospitals of Amhara region. Data were collected by interviewing HIV-positive women using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with contraceptive use , and odd ratio with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was calculated to measure the strength of association. A total of 803 women living with HIV<pathogen> ( with a response rate of 95.4 %) were interviewed. The mean age of the study participants was 32.2 years ( SD Â± 6.2 years). The prevalence of current contraceptive use was 30.3 % ( 95 % CI: 27.0-33.7 %). The preferred and most commonly used contraceptive methods were injectable ( 42.8 %) and male condom ( 32.9 %). Younger age group ( 15-24 years) ( AOR = 9.67; 95 % CI: 3.45 , 27.10) , one or more number of living children ( AOR = 4.01; 95 % CI: 2.07 , 7.79) , HIV<pathogen> diagnosis > 2-4 years ( AOR = 2.37; 95 % CI: 1.10 , 5.08) , and having high CD4 count > 500 cell/ul ( AOR = 3.25; 95 % CI: 1.42 , 7.44) were significantly associated with contraceptive use. The prevalence of contraceptive use among HIV-positive women in Amhara region referral hospitals is low , which suggests a high risk of unintended pregnancy. Injectable and male condoms are the most preferred type of contraceptive methods. Thus , it is better to integrate these contraceptive methods with ART clinic.
