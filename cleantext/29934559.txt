  The suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) of the hypothalamus is remarkable. Despite numbering only about 10,000 neurons on each side of the third ventricle , the SCN is our principal circadian clock , directing the daily cycles of behaviour and physiology that set the tempo of our lives. When this nucleus is isolated in organotypic culture , its autonomous timing mechanism can persist indefinitely , with precision and robustness. The discovery of the cell-autonomous transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops that drive circadian activity in the SCN provided a powerful exemplar of the genetic specification of complex mammalian behaviours. However , the analysis of circadian time-keeping is moving beyond single cells. Technical and conceptual advances , including intersectional genetics , multidimensional imaging and network theory , are beginning to uncover the circuit-level mechanisms and emergent properties that make the SCN a uniquely precise and robust clock. However , much remains unknown about the SCN , not least the intrinsic properties of SCN neurons , its circuit topology and the neuronal computations that these circuits support. Moreover , the convention that the SCN is a neuronal clock has been overturned by the discovery that astrocytes are an integral part of the timepiece. As a test bed for examining the relationships between genes , cells and circuits in sculpting complex behaviours , the SCN continues to offer powerful lessons and opportunities for contemporary neuroscience.
