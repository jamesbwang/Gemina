  The standardisation working group of the International Continence Society has updated the Good Urodynamic Practice directives. This evidence-based ICS-GUP2016 has defined the terminology and standards of Urodynamic practice , for the laboratory and for individual practice , in quality control during cystometry and pressure-flow analysis. In addition , the working group included recommendations prior to the test and information about how to prepare the patient , as well as recommendations for the reporting of urodynamics. Based on earlier International Continence Society standardisations and current evidence , the practice of uroflowmetry , cystometry and pressure-flow study have been detailed with a view to ensuring that this Good Urodynamic Practice update contributes towards improving clinical and research quality in urodynamics.
