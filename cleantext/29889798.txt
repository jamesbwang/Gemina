  Prospective cohort study OBJECTIVE.: Analyze ground reaction force ( GRF) parameters in cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM) patients to elucidate gait alterations as compared to healthy controls. During the human gait cycle , the magnitude and direction of the force each foot imparts on the ground varies in a controlled fashion to propel the body 's center of mass forward. Alterations in GRF patterns can both point to subtle gait disturbances and explain altered<symptom> gait<symptom> patterns such as that seen in CSM. Thirty-two patients with symptomatic CSM who have been scheduled for surgery , along with 30 healthy controls ( HC) , underwent clinical gait analysis a week before surgery. Vertical GRF parameters and force magnitude and timing at various points of the gait cycle ( i.e. heel contact , maximum weight acceptance , mid-stance , and push off) were analyzed and compared between groups. Increased heel contact ( CSM: 60.13 % vs HC: 27.82 % of Body<symptom> Weight , p = 0.011) , maximum weight acceptance ( CSM: 120.13 % vs HC: 100.97 % of Body<symptom> Weight , p = 0.016) , and diminished push off ( CSM: 91.35 % vs HC: 106.54 % of Body<symptom> Weight , p = 0.001) forces were discovered in CSM patients compared to HC. Compared to controls CSM patients had delayed heel contact ( CSM: 9.32 % vs HC: 5.12 % of gait cycle , p = 0.050) and earlier push off ( CSM: 54.96 % vs HC: 59.0 % of gait cycle , p = 0.050) , resulting in a shorter stance phase. This study reinforces how CSM patients commonly exhibit altered<symptom> gait<symptom> patterns , but also uniquely demonstrates the increased heel-contract and maximum weight acceptance forces , diminished toe-off forces , and the shorter stance phase to absorb the body<symptom> weight load. When examined from a global perspective , these altered GRF parameters reflect the difficulty CSM patients have with catching their center of mass during heel-contact to avoid falling and with subsequently propelling themselves forward. 3.
