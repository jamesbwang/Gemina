  Today computational chemistry is a consolidated tool in drug lead discovery endeavors. Due to methodological developments and to the enormous advance in computer hardware , methods based on quantum mechanics ( QM) have gained great attention in the last 10 years , and calculations on biomacromolecules are becoming increasingly explored , aiming to provide better accuracy in the description of protein-ligand interactions and the prediction of binding affinities. In principle , the QM formulation includes all contributions to the energy , accounting for terms usually missing in molecular mechanics force-fields , such as electronic polarization effects , metal coordination , and covalent binding; moreover , QM methods are systematically improvable , and provide a greater degree of transferability. In this mini-review we present recent applications of explicit QM-based methods in small-molecule docking and scoring , and in the calculation of binding free-energy in protein-ligand systems. Although the routine use of QM-based approaches in an industrial drug lead discovery setting remains a formidable challenging task , it is likely they will increasingly become active players within the drug discovery pipeline.
