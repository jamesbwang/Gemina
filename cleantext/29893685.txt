  To paraphrase the lyrics of a song by Matchbox Twenty ( `` It 's 3AM , I must be lonely '') , it 's 3 AM , I must be on a Lear jet. We 're heading out to get a pair of lungs for a transplant. It 's pitch black out tonight , and there 's small rain falling. At least it 's not ice or snow , which we 've heard is falling to the north of us. I am glad that we 'll be heading south on this run. These organ procurement runs tend to violate one of the basic safety rules of flying , which is to avoid , whenever possible , being required to fly. The edgy flights tend to stick in one 's mind , of course. I 've flown , literally , into a hurricane ( Isaac) , slid around on icy runways in Michigan and New<pathogen> York , and landed at the same mountaintop airport that was featured in the movie ` We Are Marshall ' ( which recounted the story of the fatal crash of a plane carrying Marshall University 's football team back from a game in North Carolina). I have one of my splendid surgery residents with me. We settle in for the ride south. There 'll be time for a nap , if I can get comfortable. But , I 'm awake now , and I 'm reminded of the overall mission that we are on. Inevitably , I find myself reflecting on my three decades as a transplanter of hearts and lungs and recalling some of my most memorable patients and the lessons I have learned from them and their families. Memories and lessons that will always be with me.
