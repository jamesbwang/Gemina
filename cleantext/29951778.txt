  In Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC) , informal coltan mining has been expanding amidst increased insecurity due to armed conflicts. We investigated the impact of occupational dust-exposure on the respiratory health of Congolese coltan miners. In total , 441 Congolese workers participated in this study , including 199 informal coltan miners and 242 office workers ( controls). Information on respiratory complaints was collected using two standardized questionnaires. Physical examination ( vital signs , auscultation) and lung function test ( Peak Flow meter) were performed. In addition , workplace airborne PM2 .5 and volatile organic compounds ( VOC) concentrations were measured. Higher airborne PM2 .5 ( range 180-210 Âµg/m This study showed high prevalence of respiratory complaints in Congolese informal coltan miners , suggesting the necessity to implement efficient occupational safety measures and regulate this informal mining business.
