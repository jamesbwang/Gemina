  In mammals , mitoferrin-1 and mitoferrin-2 , two homologous proteins of the mitochondrial solute carrier family are required for iron delivery into mitochondria. However , there is only one kind , called W02B12 ( mitoferrin-1 or mfn-1) , in Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> and its regulatory mechanism is unknown. In this study , we used C. elegans<pathogen> strains CL2006 and GMC101 as models to investigate what role mitoferrin-1 played in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). We found that knockdown of mitoferrin-1 by feeding-RNAi treatment extended lifespans of both strains of C. elegans<pathogen>. In addition , it reduced the paralysis rate in the GMC101 strain. These results suggest that mitoferrin-1 may be involved in the progression of Alzheimer 's disease. Knockdown of mitoferrin-1 was seen to disturb mitochondrial morphology in the CB5600 strain. We tested whether knockdown of mitoferrin-1 could influence mitochondrial metabolism. Analysis of mitochondrial iron metabolism and mitochondrial ROS showed that knockdown of mitoferrin-1 could reduce mitochondrial iron content and reduce the level of mitochondrial ROS in the CL2006 and GMC101 strains. These results confirm that knockdown of mitoferrin-1 can slow the progress of disease in Alzheimer model of C. elegans<pathogen> and suggest that mitoferrin-1 plays a major role in mediating mitochondrial iron metabolism in this process.
