  A new myxobolid , Thelohanellus gabori ( Myxosporea: Myxozoa) parasitizing gill filaments of Crossocheilus latius ( Hamilton , 1822) has been described using light microscopy , histopathology , and molecular analyses. A total of 80 live specimens of C. latius were examined , revealing a prevalence of infection of 25.66 % ( 21 of 80 fish sampled). The plasmodia were of intrafilamental epithelial type , FE as per their location in the gill filaments of the fish host. The plasmodia were cylindrical and creamy-white , 1.0-1.7 mm in diameter containing about 500-700 myxospores. The myxospores had a mean length of 8.56 ± 0.21 μm , width 3.66 ± 0.08 μm , mean length of polar capsule 5.50 ± 0.28 μm , and width 2.50 ± 0.14 μm. The 18S rDNA of Thelohanellus gabori sp. nov. ( accession number KX757025) clustered phylogenetically with other related myxozoan parasites being T. pathankotensis and T. boggoti the most closely related species with 97 % sequence similarity followed by T. sp.. FCO with 89 % sequence similarity. The mean abundance ( gill plasmodial index) was calculated by counting the number of plasmodia on each side of the gill apparatus per host and was found to be 4 indicating severe infection causing fusion of many large-sized plasmodia in the gill filament. During the present study , it was found that the phylogenetic tree for Thelohanellus spp. depends upon the tissue location , vertebrate host group , and geographical region.
