  Advances in nano-computed X-ray tomography ( nCT) , nano X-ray fluorescence spectrometry ( nXRF) , and high-performance computing have enabled the first direct comparison between observations of three-dimensional nanoscale microstructure evolution during cement hydration and computer simulations of the same microstructure using HydratiCA. nCT observations of a collection of triclinic tricalcium silicate ( Ca
