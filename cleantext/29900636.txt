  Myogenesis is precisely proceeded by myogenic regulatory factors. Myogenic stem cells are activated , proliferated and fused into a multinuclear myofiber. Pax7 , paired box 7 , one of the earliest markers during myogenesis. It has been reported that Pax7 regulates the muscle marker genes , Myf5 and MyoD toward differentiation. The possible roles of Pax7 in myogenic cells have been well researched. However , it has not yet been clarified if Pax7 itself is able to induce myogenic fate in nonmyogenic lineage cells. In this study , we performed experiments using stably expressed Pax7 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to elucidate if Pax7 inhibits adipogenesis. We found that Pax7 represses adipogenic markers and prevents differentiation. These cells showed decreased expression of PDGFRα , PPARγ and Fabp4 and inhibited forming lipid droplets.
