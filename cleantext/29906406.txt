  No unambiguous role of the involvement of uroplasminogen activator ( uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 ( PAI-1) in prostate cancer has emerged , with current evidence suggesting that neither biomarker is likely of significant clinical value , save as an overall contributor. In this study , we attempt to discriminate prostate cancer from non-cancer in a cohort of plasma samples , using the Imubind ELISA assay. In this cohort , PAI-1 levels are higher in prostate cancer patients than healthy donors; uPA levels are higher in healthy donors than prostate cancer patients; and the uPA/PAI -1 ratio is higher in healthy donors than in prostate cancer patients. To date , and across three prostate sample types , i.e. transurethral resection tissue , needle biopsies , and blood plasma , data have been disparate. Given the inconsistency , a malignancy index was created by dividing the product of three biomarkers ( uPA , PAI-1 , and prostate specific antigen ( PSA)) by the age of the patient/donor. The malignancy index clearly distinguishes prostate disease from non-disease in peripheral blood plasma samples ( P = 0.0127) , concurring with findings in core needle biopsies and transurethral resection tissue , reported elsewhere. This is an important finding given the gravity of prostate cancer and the legions of over-diagnosed and over-treated men worldwide.
