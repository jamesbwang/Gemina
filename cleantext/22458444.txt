  Access the completeness in IUD services provided by trained professionals and find out the weak links. Study was conducted on 100 IUD trained professionals of tertiary care hospital and nursing teaching institute. All were given questionnaire that was duly filled by them. Data obtained were analysed. Protocols of case selection , pre-insertion counselling , insertion process and follow-up were assessed. All the four criteria were assessed on score of ten. Study group could not get ten points under any of the set criteria. Average of 53 % case selection , 31.4 % pre-insertion counselling , 42.5 % insertion protocols and 46.1 % follow-up counselling criteria were observed by study group. Highest compliance of protocols was seen among postgraduate students. Although IUD training is given to all medical professionals and IUD facility is available up to subcentres but the study shows that completeness in services is still lacking. Ensuring ideal place for IUD insertion , proper case selection , use of specific instruments for insertion and observance of insertion protocols are very vital for the success of IUD.
