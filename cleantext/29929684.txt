  Over the past few decades , sensors have been gaining a lot of popularity in the medical field. These sensors have helped shift the paradigm in medicine from having things done manually to digitalizing them. In the medical field , sensors have been manufactured in different forms and shapes including wearable and implantable wireless devices. With the aid of these sensors , healthcare professionals hope to revolutionize the system in a cost-effective way. In fact , this is already evident in most healthcare systems with the use of sensors for blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , oxygen saturation , and arrhythmias on a daily basis. Also , more sophisticated sensors have made way into the medical field with a feedback loop , such as insulin pumps. On the other hand , similar technologies have been introduced in the orthopaedics world in the past decade. In this paper we summarize some of the sensors used in the medical field in general , and in orthopaedics in particular.
