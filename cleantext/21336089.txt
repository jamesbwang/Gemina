  Results from novel therapeutics trials are not always generalizable to real-world patients. We aimed to determine the pattern in which trial findings are applied in a population-based setting of melanoma patients and consequent treatment outcomes. Patients with unresectable disease during 2011-2014 and referred to cancer centers in a large Canadian province were retrospectively reviewed. Based on eligibility criteria as described in registration trials of vemurafenib ( Vem) and ipilimumab ( Ipi) , we classified patients into trial-eligible and ineligible and those treated and untreated with these agents. We identified 290 patients with known BRAF status for the Vem analysis and 212 patients previously treated with first-line agents for the Ipi analysis. For the Vem cohort , a total of 49 patients were considered trial-eligible , of whom 36 ( 73 %) received treatment. For the Ipi cohort , there were 119 trial-eligible cases of whom 43 ( 36 %) received therapy. Factors other than eligibility criteria most frequently associated with non-treatment in these cohorts included concerns regarding treatment harm and patient preferences. In multivariable analysis , overall survival was improved in Vem cohort patients considered trial-eligible and treated compared to those who were ineligible. Within the Ipi cohort , survival was improved in trial-eligible patients regardless of whether they received Ipi compared to ineligible patients. Real-world uptake of new melanoma treatments was suboptimal , and non-use in trial-eligible patients was frequent. Future clinical trials that are more pragmatically designed to include participants who better reflect the real-world population may facilitate increased uptake of novel therapeutics into routine clinical practice.
