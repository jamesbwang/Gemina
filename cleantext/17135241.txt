  Affinity reagents are of central importance for selectively identifying proteins and investigating their interactions. We report on the development and use of cyclic peptides , identified by mRNA display-based RaPID<symptom> methodology , that are selective for , and tight binders of , the human hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases ( PHDs)- enzymes crucial in hypoxia sensing. Biophysical analyses reveal the cyclic peptides to bind in a distinct site , away from the enzyme active site pocket , enabling conservation of substrate binding and catalysis. A biotinylated cyclic peptide captures not only the PHDs , but also their primary substrate hypoxia inducible factor HIF1-Î±. Our work highlights the potential for tight , non-active site binding cyclic peptides to act as promising affinity reagents for studying protein-protein interactions.
