  Movement disorders are characterized by a marked genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity , complicating diagnostic work in clinical practice and molecular diagnosis. To develop and evaluate a targeted sequencing approach using a customized panel of genes involved in movement disorders. We selected 127 genes associated with movement disorders to create a customized enrichment in solution capture array. Targeted high-coverage sequencing was applied to DNA samples taken from 378 eligible patients at 1 Luxembourgian , 1 Algerian , and 25 French tertiary movement disorder centers between September 2014 and July 2016. Patients were suspected of having inherited movement disorders because of early onset , family history , and/or complex phenotypes. They were divided in 5 main movement disorder groups: parkinsonism , dystonia , chorea , paroxysmal movement disorder , and myoclonus. To compare approaches , 23 additional patients suspected of having inherited cerebellar ataxia<symptom> were included , on whom whole-exome sequencing ( WES) was done. Data analysis occurred from November 2015 to October 2016. Percentages of individuals with positive diagnosis , variants of unknown significance , and negative cases; mutational frequencies and clinical phenotyping of genes associated with movement disorders. Of the 378 patients ( of whom 208 were male ( 55.0 %)) , and with a median ( range) age at disease onset of 31 ( 0-84) years , probable pathogenic variants were identified in 83 cases ( 22.0 %): 46 patients with parkinsonism ( 55 % of 83 patients) , 21 patients ( 25.3 %) with dystonia , 7 patients ( 8.4 %) with chorea , 7 patients ( 8.4 %) with paroxysmal movement disorders , and 2 patients ( 2.4 %) with myoclonus as the predominant phenotype. Some genes were mutated in several cases in the cohort. Patients with pathogenic variants were significantly younger ( median age , 27 years; interquartile range ( IQR) , 5-36 years)) than the patients without diagnosis ( median age , 35 years; IQR , 15-46 years; P = .04). Diagnostic yield was significantly lower in patients with dystonia ( 21 of 135; 15.6 %; P = .03) than in the overall cohort. Unexpected genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with pathogenic variants deviating from the classic phenotype were highlighted , and 49 novel probable pathogenic variants were identified. The WES analysis of the cohort of 23 patients with cerebellar ataxia<symptom> led to an overall diagnostic yield of 26 % , similar to panel analysis but at a cost 6 to 7 times greater. High-coverage sequencing panel for the delineation of genes associated with movement disorders was efficient and provided a cost-effective diagnostic alternative to whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing.
