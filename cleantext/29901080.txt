  Physical exercise is beneficial for the functional recovery of neurons after stroke. It has been suggested that exercise regulates proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells ( NSCs); however , the underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. In the present study , the aim was to investigate whether physical exercise activates the extracellular signal‑regulated kinase ( ERK) signaling pathway to promote proliferation and differentiation of NSCs in rats with cerebral infarction , thereby improving neurological function. Following middle cerebral artery occlusion , rats underwent physical exercise and neurological behavior was analyzed at various time points. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect proliferation and differentiation of NSCs , and western blotting was used to analyze cyclin‑dependent kinase 4 ( CDK4) , Cyclin D1 , retinoblastoma protein ( p‑Rb) , P‑16 , phosphorylated ( p) ERK1/2 and c‑Fos expression. The results indicated that physical exercise promoted proliferation and differentiation of NSCs , and led to improved neural function. In addition , the expression levels of CDK4 , Cyclin D1 , p‑Rb , p‑ERK1/ 2 and c‑Fos were upregulated , whereas the expression of P‑16 was downregulated following exercise. U0126 , an inhibitor of ERK signaling , reversed the beneficial effects of exercise. Therefore , it may be hypothesized that physical exercise enhances proliferation and differentiation of endogenous NSCs in the hippocampus of rats with cerebral infarction via the ERK signaling pathway.
