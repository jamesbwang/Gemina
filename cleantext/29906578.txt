  Classic trigeminal neuralgia ( TN) involves sharp , shooting pain in any trigeminal nerve distribution , whereas atypical TN presents with constant aching , numbness or burning that can appear with classic features , leading to a mixed presentation. Microvascular decompression ( MVD) is an effective treatment for classic TN , but its utility in treating mixed TN is less studied. We retrospectively studied 73 adult patients with mixed TN and 386 classic TN patients , who all underwent MVD between December 2007 and October 2016. Recorded variables included demographics , graded radiologic and intraoperative findings , and graded pain outcomes in the immediate postoperative period ( up to 3 months after MVD) and long-term follow-up. Mean age of mixed TN patients was 53.2 years. Immediate postoperative outcomes were as follows: 67 ( 91.8 %) had pain relief including improvement of atypical pain , while six patients ( 8.2 %) had no pain relief. Having pre-existing pain syndromes<disease> ( p = 0.001) or distortion of trigeminal nerve intraoperatively ( p = 0.001) were associated with poor surgical outcome for mixed TN. Mean length of follow-up was 20.6 months. Forty-four patients ( 60.3 %) developed recurrence of any TN pain. In comparison , 93 % of classic TN patients had pain relief in the immediate postoperative period , and recurrence rate was 19.9 %. Patients with mixed TN suffer from both classic and atypical TN symptoms. 91.8 % of our cohort reported partial or complete pain relief including improvement of atypical pain following MVD in the immediate post-operative stage , compared to 93 % of the classic TN cohort. 60.3 % of mixed TN patients eventually developed TN recurrence.
