  Stroke is a serious complication of both transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) and carotid artery disease ( CD). The implications of CD in patients undergoing TAVR are unclear. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapies Registry , consisting of data from consecutive US TAVR cases during the years 2013 to 2015 , was linked to Medicare claims data to ascertain 30-day and 1-year cumulative incidence rates of stroke and all-cause mortality. We compared 30-day and 1-year stroke and mortality outcomes between patients with no-CD and patients with moderate , severe , and occlusive CD and adjusted for baseline covariates using proportional hazards models. Among 29143 patients undergoing TAVR across 390 US sites , 22 % had CD. Patients with CD had higher rates of prior hypertension , diabetes mellitus , stroke , and myocardial infarction. Observed in-hospital stroke rates were 2.0 % among no-CD , 2.5 % among moderate CD , 3.0 % among severe CD , and 2.6 % among occlusive CD. There was no association between the presence of CD and 30-day stroke ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.16; 95 % confidence interval , 0.94-1.43) or mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.10; 95 % confidence interval , 0.95-1.28). There was no association between CD and 1-year stroke ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.03; 95 % confidence interval , 0.86-1.24) or mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio , 1.02; 95 % confidence interval , 0.93-1.12). Furthermore , there was no significant risk-adjusted association between severity of CD and 30-day or 1-year stroke or mortality. CD is common among TAVR patients , present in 1 of 5. CD was not associated with an increased risk of stroke or mortality at 30 day or 1 year. Post-TAVR stroke seems to be because of mechanisms other than CD.
