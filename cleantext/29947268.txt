  Inguinal canal-related groin pain is common in athletes and may involve numerous structures such as the conjoint tendon and the transversalis fascia. Ultrasound is the only dynamic tool that shows the passage of preperitoneal fat at the level of the Hesselbach triangle and allows excluding true inguinal hernias. Fascia transversalis bulging and inguinal ring dilatation may also be described. MRI assesses injuries of rectus<pathogen> abdominis and adductor longus enthesis and osteitis symphysis but its accuracy for the diagnosis of inguinal-related groin pain remains debated.
