  We sought to evaluate the factors affecting the outcome of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy ( ESWL) in urinary stone treatment. We conducted a retrospective review of 235 adult patients treated with ESWL , for radiopaque renal or ureteric stones between January 2015 and December 2016. Patient 's age , sex , stone size , laterality , location , density , skin-to-stone distance ( SSD) , and presence of double J stent were studied as potential predictors. At the end of three months , the patients were divided into success and failure groups and the significance was determined. Of the 235 patients ( 188 males and 47 females) analyzed , ESWL was successful in 79.1 %. Univariate analysis of both groups revealed no significant difference in patient 's age and stone laterality. Statistically significant differences in gender , stone size , stone site , stone density , SSD , and patients with stents were observed. Statistically significant factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis were sex and stent. Females had three-times higher risk for ESWL failure than males ( odds ratio ( OR) = 3.213; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.194-8.645; This study revealed that ESWL can treat renal and ureteric stones successfully with an inverse association between outcome and predictors such as stone size and density , SSD , and stent presence. These factors can help us in improving patient selection and ensure better results at lower cost.
