  A fibrillar , polymeric intermediate ( Cd2Se) n was isolated from the synthesis of CdSe nanorods , which suggests that the reactants themselves can template anisotropic growth. It is shown that high monomer concentration is the principal factor favouring this reaction pathway. The intermediate is distinct from crystalline semiconductor or small clusters and is surprisingly temperature-stable below 250 Â°C.
