  Chylous ascites is considered to be an intra-abdominal collection of creamy colored fluid with triglyceride content of > 110 mg/dL. Chylous ascites is an uncommon but serious complication of numerous surgical interventions. However , it is a rare complication of LRYGB. An internal hernia limb defect is thought to be the underlying etiology , where the hernia will cause lymphatic vessel engorgement and lymphatic extravasation. We report a case of a 29 years old male with a 9 year history of laparoscopic Roux en y gastric bypass ( LRGYB) , presenting with recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> for 2 months radiating to the right shoulder. Ultrasound examination revealed gallstones and the patient was subsequently admitted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively , whitish colored fluid , high in triglycerides content was aspirated. During exploration , an internal hernia limb defect was found and corrected. Post LRGYB patients with symptoms of recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> should be suspected for chylous ascites reflecting an internal hernia.
