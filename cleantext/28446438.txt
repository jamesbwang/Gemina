  A cascade of care framework has been proposed to identify and address implementation gaps in addiction medicine. Using this framework , we characterized temporal trends in engagement in care for opioid use disorder ( OUD) in Vancouver , Canada. Using data from two cohorts of people who use drugs , we assessed the yearly proportion of daily opioid users achieving four sequential stages of the OUD cascade of care ( linkage to addiction care; linkage to opioid agonist treatment ( OAT); retention in OAT; and stability) between 2006 and 2016. We evaluated temporal trends of cascade indicators , adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics , HIV/HCV status , substance use patterns , and social-structural exposures. We included 1615 daily opioid users. Between 2006 and 2016 , we observed improvements in linkage to care ( from 73.2 % to 78.9 % , p = < 0.001) , linkage to ( from 69.2 % to 70.6 % , p = 0.011) and retention in OAT ( from 29.1 % to 35.5 % , p = < 0.001) , and stability ( from 10.4 % to 17.1 % , p = < 0.001). In adjusted analyses , later calendar year of observation was associated with increased odds of linkage to care ( Adjusted Odds Ratio ( AOR) = 1.02 , 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI): 1.01-1.04) , retention in OAT ( AOR 1.02 , 95 % CI: 1.01-1.04) and stability ( AOR = 1.03 , 95 % CI: 1.01-1.05) , but not with linkage to OAT ( AOR 1.00 , 95 % CI: 0.98-1.01). Temporal improvements in OUD cascade of care indicators were observed. However , only a third of participants were retained in OAT in 2016. These findings suggest the need for novel approaches to improve engagement in care for OUD to address the escalating opioid-related overdose crisis.
