  Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) internalization<pathogen> into bovine mammary epithelial cells<pathogen> ( bMECs<pathogen>) is considered an important pathogenic mechanism<pathogen> for the establishment<pathogen> of mastitis<pathogen>. Given the interesting link<pathogen> between selenium<pathogen> ( Se<pathogen>) status<pathogen> and mastitis<pathogen> , our objective<pathogen> was to prove that Se<pathogen> was essential to suppress pro-inflammatory mediators<pathogen> , in part<pathogen> , by modulation<pathogen> of Toll-like receptor2<pathogen> ( TLR2<pathogen>) , nuclear factor<pathogen> kappaB<pathogen> ( NF-κB<pathogen>) and mitogen<pathogen> activated protein<pathogen> kinase<pathogen> ( MAPK<pathogen>) signal<pathogen> transduction<pathogen> pathway<pathogen> in bMECs<pathogen>. Results<pathogen> showed that Se<pathogen> ( 0 ~<pathogen> 16 μM<pathogen>) did not affect the growth<pathogen> of bMECs<pathogen>. The mRNA<pathogen> expression<pathogen> of TLR2<pathogen> , Myeloid differentiation<pathogen> factor<pathogen> 88 ( Myd88<pathogen>) , Interleukin-1<pathogen> receptor-associated kinase4<pathogen> ( Irak4<pathogen>) , Interleukin-1<pathogen> receptor-associated kinase1<pathogen> ( Irak1<pathogen>) and TNF<pathogen> receptor-associated factor6<pathogen> ( Traf6<pathogen>) in TLR2<pathogen> signal<pathogen> pathway<pathogen> were increased or significantly increased by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Se<pathogen> played an important role<pathogen> in regulating the genes<pathogen> expression<pathogen> of TLR2<pathogen> , Myd88<pathogen> , Traf6<pathogen> but not in controlling the expression<pathogen> of Irak4<pathogen> and Irak1<pathogen>. In addition<pathogen> , Se<pathogen> exerted strong inhibitory effects<pathogen> on the genes<pathogen> expression<pathogen> of tumor<pathogen> necrosis<pathogen> factor-alpha<pathogen> ( TNF-α<pathogen>) , interleukin-1β<pathogen> ( IL-1β<pathogen>) and interleukin-6<pathogen> ( IL-6<pathogen>) induced by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. To further investigate the possible signaling<pathogen> mechanisms<pathogen> involved in the processes<pathogen> , we analyzed the role<pathogen> of MAPK<pathogen> and NF-κB<pathogen> signaling<pathogen> pathway<pathogen> in inflammation<pathogen> response<pathogen> in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs<pathogen> in<pathogen> vitro<pathogen>. Results<pathogen> showed that the phosphorylation<pathogen> of inhibitory kappaB<pathogen> alpha<pathogen> ( IκBα<pathogen>) , p65<pathogen> , p38<pathogen> and extracellular regulated protein<pathogen> kinase<pathogen> ( Erk<pathogen>) were significantly increased in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs<pathogen>. It indicated that S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> activated NF-κB<pathogen> and MAPK<pathogen> signaling<pathogen> pathway<pathogen>. We also examined the effects<pathogen> of Se<pathogen> on the phosphorylation<pathogen> of IκBα<pathogen> , p65<pathogen> , p38<pathogen> and Erk in NF-κB<pathogen> and MAPK signaling<pathogen> pathway<pathogen> , which have well been proved to control the synthesis<pathogen> and release<pathogen> of pro-inflammatory mediators<pathogen> during inflammation<pathogen>. The findings<pathogen> are exciting , that pretreatment<pathogen> with Se<pathogen> ( 4 , 8 μM<pathogen>) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation<pathogen> of IκBα<pathogen> , p65<pathogen> , p38<pathogen> and Erk. These results<pathogen> suggest that Se<pathogen> down-regulates inflammatory mediators<pathogen> TNF-α<pathogen> , IL-1β<pathogen> and IL-6<pathogen> gene<pathogen> expressions<pathogen> via TLR2<pathogen> , NF-κB<pathogen> and MAPK signaling<pathogen> pathway<pathogen> in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs<pathogen> , which may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect<pathogen> of
