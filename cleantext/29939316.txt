  Risk stratification in atherosclerotic renovascular disease ( ARVD) can influence treatment decisions and facilitate patient selection for revascularization. In this study , we aim to use variables with the best predictive value to design a risk calculator that can assist clinicians with risk stratification and outcome prediction. Patients with a radiological diagnosis of ARVD referred to our tertiary renal centre were recruited into this prospective cohort study between 1986 and 2014. Primary clinical endpoints included: death , progression to end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular events ( CVE). A stepwise regression model was used to select variables with the most significant hazard ratio for each clinical endpoint. The risk calculator was designed using Hypertext Markup Language. Survival and CVE-free survival were estimated at 1 , 5 and 10 years. In total , 872 patients were recruited into the Salford ARVD study with a median follow-up period of 54.9 months ( interquartile range 20.2-96.0). Only models predicting death and CVE showed good performance ( C-index > 0.80). Survival probabilities obtained from the risk calculator show that most patients with ARVD have reduced long-term survival. Revascularization improved outcomes in patients with higher baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower proteinuria<symptom> but not in those with co-existing comorbidities and higher levels of baseline proteinuria<symptom>. Although this risk calculator requires further independent validation in other ARVD cohorts , this study shows that a small number of easily obtained variables can help predict clinical outcomes and encourage a patient-specific therapeutic approach.
