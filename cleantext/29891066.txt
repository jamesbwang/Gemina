  The cerebellum is the most common site of presentation of central nervous system tumors in children but exceedingly rare in adults. Children often present with acute symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure , requiring urgent surgical intervention. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes a variety of benign and malignant entities. Cerebellar low-grade gliomas are the most common and benign , slow-growing tumors , for which surgical resection alone is curative. Embryonal tumors , on the other hand- most commonly medulloblastomas- are highly aggressive and treatment includes intensive postsurgical radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Driven by multiple genomewide profiling studies , the field of neuro-oncology is making great strides towards understanding how different tumors develop and embarking on a new generation of molecularly informed clinical trials.
