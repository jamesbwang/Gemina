  Ezrin , Radixin and Moesin ( ERM) are critical membranous component involved in cross-linking of actin filaments. Moesin ( Msn) is recognized as a pivotal protein involved in regulation of cell signalling events associated with the maintenance of epithelial integrity , actin organization and polarity. Radixin ( Rad) is known to cell-to-cell adherens junction as a barbed end-capping protein whereas ezrin ( Ezr) is recognized at cell adhesion , motility , apoptosis and phagocytosis. The current study for the first time reports the transcriptional and RNA secondary structural variations among brain-specific ERM genes. Firstly , we analyzed brain-specific transcriptomic expression in selected embryonic and postnatal developmental stages ( E10 .5 , E14 .5 , E18 .5 , P0 .5 , P3 .5 , P5 .5 , P10 .5 and P20 .5) of Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> Among designated developmental stages , Ezr has highest fold difference in early embryonic and postnatal stages ( E10 .5 , P0 .5 and P5 .5). Rad showed a similar pattern of high expression especially at embryonic stages ( E10 .5 and E18 .5) and postnatal ( P0 .5 and P5 .5) , however , Msn exhibited non-significant fold differences in comparison to controls leading to its curial role in development. Furthermore , computational prediction of ERM coding mRNA transcripts , reveals compact and less dynamic Msn secondary structure and pseudoknots configurations , in contrast to Ezr and Rad. Conclusively , transcriptomic levels are greatly associated with compact base pairing organization of its secondary structures. These findings open a new domain to understand the occurrence of ERM-specific cytoskeleton proteins during developmental stages.
