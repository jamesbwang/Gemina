  The dynamic changes that take place along the phases of microbial growth ( lag , exponential , stationary , and death) have been widely studied in bacteria at the molecular and cellular levels , but little is known for archaea. In this study , a high-throughput approach was used to analyze and compare the proteomes of two haloarchaea during exponential and stationary growth: the neutrophilic Haloferax volcanii and the alkaliphilic Natrialba magadii. Almost 2000 proteins were identified in each species ( â‰ˆ 50 % of the predicted proteome). Among them , 532 and 432 were found to be differential between growth phases in H. volcanii and N. magadii , respectively. Changes upon entrance into stationary phase included an overall increase in proteins involved in the transport of small molecules and ions , stress response , and fatty acid catabolism. Proteins related to genetic processes and cell division showed a notorious decrease in amount. The data reported in this study not only contributes to our understanding of the exponential-stationary growth phase transition in extremophilic archaea but also provides the first comprehensive analysis of the proteome composition of N. magadii. The MS proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier JPST000395.
