  The abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids ( AAS) has remained on the rise despite their well-known deleterious effects. We describe a case of AAS-induced multisystem failure following an extensive history of abuse in a 41-year-old bodybuilder. Furthermore , we review pertinent literature and discuss the different pathophysiologic mechanisms through which AAS affect the heart and other organs. This case points to the possibility of multiorgan involvement and severe cardiac effects of AAS abuse in young individuals who may not have any past medical history.
