  Previously , metalloproteinase was isolated and identified from Trichomonas vaginalis<pathogen> , belonging to the aminopeptidase P-like metalloproteinase subfamily A/B , family M24 of clan MG , named TvMP50. The native and recombinant TvMP50 showed proteolytic activity , determined by gelatin zymogram , and a 50 kDa band , suggesting that TvMP50 is a monomeric active enzyme. This was an unexpected finding since other Xaa-Pro aminopeptidases/prolidases are active as a biological unit formed by dimers/tetramers. In this study , the evolutionary history of TvMP50 and the preliminary crystal structure of the recombinant enzyme determined at 3.4 Ã… resolution is reported. TvMP50 was shown to be a type of putative , eukaryotic , monomeric aminopeptidase P , and the crystallographic coordinates showed a monomer on a `` pseudo-homodimer '' array on the asymmetric unit that resembles the quaternary structure of the M24B dimeric family and suggests a homodimeric aminopeptidase P-like enzyme as a likely ancestor. Interestingly , TvMP50 had a modified N-terminal region compared with other Xaa-Pro aminopeptidases/prolidases with three-dimensional structures; however , the formation of the standard dimer is structurally unstable in aqueous solution , and a comparably reduced number of hydrogen bridges and lack of saline bridges were found between subunits A/B , which could explain why TvMP50 portrays monomeric functionality. Additionally , we found that the Parabasalia group contains two protein lineages with a `` pita bread '' fold; the ancestral monomeric group 1 was probably derived from an ancestral dimeric aminopeptidase P-type enzyme , and group 2 has a probable dimeric kind of ancestral eukaryotic prolidase lineage. The implications of such hypotheses are also presented.
