  We summarise the evidence for an association between screening scores from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT) and all-cause mortality. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines , prospective cohort studies reporting all-cause mortality risk by AUDIT scores ( complete AUDIT-10 or AUDIT-C) were identified through MEDLINE , Embase , PubMed and Web of Science up to September 2016. Risk estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analyses. Seven observational studies with 18920 observed deaths among 309991 participants were identified. At-risk drinking ( ie , hazardous/harmful consumption , AUDIT-10 ≥ 8 and AUDIT-C ≥ 4) was associated with elevated mortality risk after 2-10 years of follow-up ( pooled relative risk ( RR) = 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.12 to 1.37) compared with moderate drinking ( AUDIT-10 = 1-7 , AUDIT-C = 1-3). Compared to past year abstainers ( AUDIT = 0) , moderate drinkers had a lower mortality risk ( RR = 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.71 to 0.79) in US Veterans and a similar mortality risk ( RR = 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.72 to 1.38) in population-based studies. Most data came from studies among Veterans using the short AUDIT-C in men and showed a dose-response relationship ( RR = 1.04 , 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.05 for each AUDIT-C score among drinkers). Data for women and young adults were scarce. AUDIT screening scores were associated with mortality risk. The association was differential depending on the population examined , which may be related to prevalence of former drinkers among current abstainers. Due to heterogeneity between studies and the small number of populations examined , generalisability may be limited.
