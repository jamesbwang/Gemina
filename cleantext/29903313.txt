  To investigate the oxidative damage induced by cadmium choride and the expression of nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) in brain tissue of mice. A total of 32 adult ICR mice were divided into 4 groups randomly including CdCl_2 2. 0 , 1. 0 and 0. 5 mg/kg and NS control group , all mice were through intraperitoneally injected administration for 14 days , after the last exposure , open-field test were used and all mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation , the expression of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was measured and the expression of TNF-α , ICAM-1 were observed by ELISA , the level of NF-κB P65 in the brain were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot , the slices of the brain were stained with HE for histopathological examination. Thebody weight gain in CdCl_22. 0 mg/kg was significant lower than others ( P < 0. 05) , the number of crossing lattice in CdCl_2 2. 0 mg/kg was higher than the NS control group in the open field test. The expression of ROS increased in CdCl_2 2. 0 and 1. 0 mg/kg groups ( P < 0. 05) , the expression of TNF-α increased in CdCl_2 2. 0 mg/kg group ( P < 0. 05) , no obvious change was found among every group of ICAM-1 , the expression of NF-κB P65 in the brain increased in cadmium 2. 0 mg/kg group. The neuropathological test showed that the cerebral cortex and hippocampal cells were more loose in 2. 0 mg/kg group than the control. The level of ROS in mouse brain tissue increased , NF-κB pathway was activated by ROS and the expression of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was increased.
