  A gas field ion source ( GFIS) has many advantages that are suitable for ion microscope sources , such as high brightness and a small virtual source size , among others. In order to apply a tip-based GFIS to an ion microscope , it is better to create a trimer/single atom tip ( TSAT) , where the ion beam must be generated in several atoms of the tip apex. Here , unlike the conventional method which uses tip heating or a reactive gas , we show that the tip surface can be cleaned using only the field evaporation phenomenon and that the TSAT can also be fabricated using an insulating layer containing tungsten oxide , which remains after electrochemical etching. Using this method , we could get TSAT over 90 % of yield.
