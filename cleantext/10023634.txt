  Currently , 15 % of women in fertility age are infertile and the frequency is increasing. Among the various causes of infertility<symptom> , end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) has been shown to decrease the frequency of pregnancies compared with normal females. However , dialysis of patients with ESRD increases the likelihood of pregnancy.Herein , we report successful pregnancy and delivery after peritoneal dialysis in a patient who was misdiagnosed as primary infertility<symptom>. A 37-year-old female who was unaware of her ESRD was misdiagnosed with primary infertility<symptom>. After undergoing artificial insemination , she was referred to department of internal medicine because of generalized edema<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and poor oral intake. After evaluation , she was diagnosed with ESRD and initiated peritoneal dialysis. The patients was on peritoneal dialysis for a year and discovered that she was pregnant. During pregnancy , the patient maintained a residual urine output , BUN levels below 50 mg/dL , controlled blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and a targeted hemoglobin range. She obtained adequate calories and protein and was managed by a multidisciplinary team. The patient delivered a preterm male baby with no anomalies. ESRD should also be considered among the several causes of infertility<symptom> in fertile women. If ESRD is the cause of infertility<symptom> , the frequency of pregnancy increases following dialysis. If pregnancy is diagnosed early , intensive renal replacement therapy , adequate nutritional intake and regular fetal monitoring during pregnancy increase the chances of successful delivery while maintaining PD.
