  This paper aims to serve three purposes , providing: 1. a half-century retrospective on research in on nonmaternal care of the young , with an emphasis on key advances; 2. a commentary on the research papers in this special issue on nonmaternal care; and 3. a summary of nonmaternal care among hunting-and-gathering cultures-representing the human Environments of Evolutionary Adaptedness ( EEAs)- in the broader context of human evolution. While the research being done now is excellent and uses appropriate evolutionary theory and cutting-edge methods ranging across behavioral biology ( field and laboratory observational studies , controlled experiments , careful behavioral measures , energetics , neurotransmitter function , neuroendocrinology , neuroimaging , and genetics , among others) , it is difficult to make generalizations beyond stating that nonmaternal care is a multifaceted evolved function in some species , which usually contributes to the reproductive success of the mother and the survival of the young. Why it evolved when and where it did is not an impenetrable question , but needs further research. The same is true for the mechanistic biology of various types of allomaternal care. I conclude with some observations on historical changes in non-maternal care since the hunting-gathering era , including in industrial and postindustrial cultures. It is evident that in the human species at least , many arrangements for care of the young are possible and adaptive.
