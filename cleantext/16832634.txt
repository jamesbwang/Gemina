  Minigastrin ( MG) analogs show high affinity to the cholecystokinin-2 receptor ( CCK2R) and have therefore been intensively studied to find a suitable analog for imaging and treatment of CCK2R-expressing tumors. The clinical translation of the radioligands developed thus far has been hampered by high kidney uptake or low enzymatic stability. In this study , we aimed to develop new MG analogs with improved targeting properties stabilized against degradation through site-specific amino acid modifications.
