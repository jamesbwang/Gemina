  Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) is an established risk factor for the development of neurodegeneration and dementia late in life. Repetitive mild TBI ( r-mTBI) is directly associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE) , a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by focal perivascular to widespread Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary pathology of hyperphosphorylated tau. Studies in animal models have shown hyperphosphorylation of tau after TBI. However , the molecular mechanisms by which TBI leads to tau pathology are not understood. In this study , we employed western blots and immunohistochemistry to test , in triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer 's disease ( 3xTg-AD) , the effect of r-mTBI on tau hyperphosphorylation and activation of asparaginyl endopeptidase ( AEP) , a cysteine proteinase which is known to be involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that the level of active AEP was increased and correlated with the level of tau hyperphosphorylation following r-mTBI , and that fimbria showed increased immunoreactivity to phospho-tau. In addition , inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 2A ( I2PP2A) was translocated from neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm and colocalized with hyperphosphorylated tau. These data suggest the involvement of AEP-I2PP2A-PP2A-ptau pathway in tau pathology in TBI.
