We also observed no statistically significant differences in the posterior evaluation between the in-person and telemedicine courses ( p = 1.0) , however , there was a significant difference at the pre-test evaluative moment ( p < 0.001). videoconferencing can be effectively used to train health professionals in disaster management , being able to provide adequate knowledge and become an important tool to distance reaching in continuing education.
