  To determine normative values for stereoacuity , accommodative and vergence measures for high school populations. Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling , 1211 children ( 481 males and 730 females) between 13 and 18 years of age , with a median age of 16 years , were selected. Visual acuity , stereoacuity and suppression , refractive errors , near point of convergence , heterophoria and fusional vergences , as well as , amplitude of accommodation , accommodative response , facility and relative accommodation were evaluated. Most data did not have a normal distribution. The range of normality for the vergence measures were: near point of convergence break , 5-10cm , recovery , 6-13cm , near lateral phoria , 2.5-6 prism dioptre ( pd) ( nasal) , near vertical , orthophoria to 0.50 pd , negative fusional vergence break , 12-23pd , recovery , 8-17pd , positive fusional vergence break , 16-35 and recovery 11-24pd. For accommodative measures , the range of normality for accommodative measures was: amplitude of accommodation , 12-18pd , accommodative response , plano to +0.75 D , binocular accommodative facility , 5-12 cycles per minute ( cpm) , negative relative accommodation , 1.75-2.50 DS , positive relative accommodation , -2.0 to -3.0 DS and 17-69s arc for stereoacuity. This study provides norms for clinical measures which could be used to classify accommodative and vergence parameters for children aged 13-18 years in this population or beyond. Findings should be applied in the context of the measurement techniques and the associated limitations outlined in this report.
