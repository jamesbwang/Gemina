  We evaluated the prognostic impact of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC) after radical nephroureterectomy treatment. A total of 717 patients were identified between 2003 and 2016. The cutoff value of NLR was set as 2.5. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox 's proportional hazards regression models were utilized to analyze the association between NLR and oncological outcomes. The median follow-up was 42 months. The results suggested that preoperative elevated NLR was associated with worse pathological features. Also , patients with NLR ≥ 2.5 had worse survival outcomes than those with NLR < 2.5 ( all P < .001). Multivariate cox analysis revealed that NLR ≥ 2.5 was an independent predictor of worse cancer-specific survival , disease recurrence-free survival , metastasis-free survival and overall survival ( HR 1.95 , 95 % CI: 1.42-2.69 , P < .001; HR 1.70 , 95 % CI: 1.31-2.20 , P < .001; HR 1.67 , 95 % CI: 1.22-2.31 , P = .002; and HR 1.88 , 95 % CI: 1.42-2.50 , P < .001; respectively). Notably , NLR was ascertained to be a useful prognostic predictor in patients with high-grade disease , but not in those with low-grade UTUC. Preoperative elevated NLR was associated with worse outcomes in patients with UTUC. Subgroup analysis affirmed that NLR was a useful predictor in patients with high-grade disease , but not in those with low-grade UTUC.
