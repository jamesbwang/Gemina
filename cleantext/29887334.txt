  Intravitreal bevacizumab is increasingly used to treat severe retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP) , but it enters the bloodstream , and there is concern that it may alter development of other organs. Previously we reported short-term outcomes of 61 infants enrolled in a dose de-escalation study , and we report the late recurrences and additional treatments. Masked , multicenter , dose de-escalation study. A total of 61 premature infants with type 1 ROP. If type 1 ROP was bilateral at enrollment , then the study eye was randomly selected. In the study eye , bevacizumab intravitreal injections were given at de-escalating doses of 0.25 mg , 0.125 mg , 0.063 mg , or 0.031 mg; if needed , fellow eyes received 1 dose level higher: 0.625 mg , 0.25 mg , 0.125 mg , or 0.063 mg , respectively. After 4 weeks , additional treatment was at the discretion of the investigator. Early and late ROP recurrences , additional treatments , and structural outcomes after 6 months. Of 61 study eyes , 25 ( 41 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 29 % -54 %) received additional treatment: 3 ( 5 %; 95 % CI , 1 % -14 %) for early failure ( within 4 weeks) , 11 ( 18 %; 95 % CI , 9 % -30 %) for late recurrence of ROP ( after 4 weeks) , and 11 ( 18 %; 95 % CI , 9 % -30 %) for persistent avascular retina. Re-treatment for early failure or late recurrence occurred in 2 of 11 eyes ( 18 %; 95 % CI , 2 % -52 %) treated with 0.25 mg , 4 of 16 eyes ( 25 %; 95 % CI , 7 % -52 %) treated with 0.125 mg , 8 of 24 eyes ( 33 %; 95 % CI , 16 % -55 %) treated with 0.063 mg , and 0 ( 0 %; 95 % CI , 0 % -31 %) of 10 eyes treated with 0.031 mg. By 6 months corrected age , 56 of 61 study eyes had regression of ROP with normal posterior poles , 1 study eye had developed a Stage 5 retinal detachment , and 4 infants had died of preexisting medical conditions. Retinal structural outcomes are very good after low-dose bevacizumab treatment for ROP , although many eyes received additional treatment.
