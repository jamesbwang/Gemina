  The characteristics and treatment outcomes of status asthmaticus patients in emergency department ( ED) have not been described previously especially in Thailand. To describe the characteristics , treatment outcomes and factors associated with status asthmaticus in Thai patients presenting to a single center ED. A prospective observational study was performed at Thammasat University hospital , Thailand. The data collected included demographics , asthma history and control , previous ED attendances and hospital admissions , presenting clinical , laboratory and radiographic features , treatments given , and outcomes. Multivariable regression was used to determine independent factors associated with status asthmaticus. Over one year ( 2015-16) , 209 patients were recruited , aged 6- 54 years ( median 33 y) , of whom 145 ( 69.3 %) had status asthmaticus. The factors associated with status asthmaticus were: ( i) age > 60 y , ( ii) presence of a comorbidity , ( iii) having uncontrolled asthma , ( iv) hospitalizations or visits to the ED in the last year , and ( v) using > 1 metered dose inhaler canister per month. Status asthmaticus patients were significantly less likely to speak in sentences ( p = 0.001) and more likely to have poor air entry and chest wall retraction ( p < 0.0001) , an abnormal chest X ray ( p = 0.011) , receive magnesium sulphate and be admitted into hospital ( p < 0.0001). No patients died. Status asthmaticus was common in this cohort of patients in our setting. Our findings are consistent with previous studies and underscore the need for better patient management.
