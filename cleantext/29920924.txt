  Due to its high potential for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds , Michael addition reaction is one of the closest reactions to the heart of synthetic organic chemists. Electrochemistry presents a very stimulating and divergent resource for selective oxidation and reduction in organic chemistry , generating activated species , for example radical anions or radical cations. In this review , we try to underscore usefulness of electrogenerated Michael addition reaction with the hope of encouraging synthetic organic chemists to contemplate it , as an efficient and green strategy when it is required in their designed multi-step reaction pathways.
