  Anthropogenic environmental change can impact community and population traits such as species diversity and population densities , which have been shown to influence the prevalence of viruses in wildlife reservoirs. In particular , host species resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers , which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus<pathogen> prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages , which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial ( Didelphis marsupialis , Philander opossum) and rodent ( Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus<pathogen> host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that , in addition to the effects of host age and sex , host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability , the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages ( e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host 's intraspecific contact rates , the probability of virus transmission and , thus , the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and , therefore , on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors.
