  Genetic alterations in the complement system have been linked to a variety of diseases , including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome<disease> ( aHUS) , C3 glomerulopathy ( C3G) , and age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). We performed sequence analysis of the complement genes complement factor H ( CFH) , complement factor I ( CFI) , and complement C3 ( C3) in 866 aHUS/C3G and 697 AMD patients. In total , we identified 505 low-frequency alleles , representing 121 unique variants , of which 51 are novel. CFH contained the largest number of unique low-frequency variants ( n = 64; 53 %) , followed by C3 ( n = 32; 26 %) and CFI ( n = 25; 21 %). A substantial number of variants were found in both patients groups ( n = 48; 40 %) , while 41 ( 34 %) variants were found only in aHUS/C3G and 32 ( 26 %) variants were AMD specific. Genotype-phenotype correlations between the disease groups identified a higher frequency of protein altering alleles in short consensus repeat 20 ( SCR20) of factor H ( FH) , and in the serine protease domain of factor I ( FI) in aHUS/C3G patients. In AMD , a higher frequency of protein-altering alleles was observed in SCR3 , SCR5 , and SCR7 of FH , the SRCR domain of FI , and in the MG3 domain of C3. In conclusion , we observed a substantial overlap of variants between aHUS/C3G and AMD; however , there is a distinct clustering of variants within specific domains.
