  An asymmetric membrane of polysulfone ( PSf) was synthesized by phase inversion method. Permeation experiments were carried out between 2 to 5 bar pressure , and at temperatures 20 to 45 °C. The dense-selective layer of PSf membrane presents regular thickness ( about 5 µm) , and was not possible to observe the formation of macrovoids in porous layer. The CO2 permeability through membrane was 18.8 Barrer at 35 °C and 2 bar pressure , and this relationship between the pressure and the CO2 permeability was described adequately by Dual-mode model. The absence of CH4 permeability at 2 and 3 bar pressure , qualifies the PSf membrane for gases separation with high selectivity in this range.
