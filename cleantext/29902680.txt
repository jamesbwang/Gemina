  Paeonia ostii var. lishizhenii , a well-known medicinal and horticultural plant , is indigenous to China. Recent studies have shown that its seed has a high oil content , and it was approved as a novel resource of edible oil with a high level of α-linolenic acid by the Chinese Government. This study measured the seed oil contents and fatty acid components of P. ostii var. lishizhenii and six other peonies , P. suffruticosa , P. ludlowii , P. decomposita , P. rockii , and P. lactiflora Pall. ` Heze ' and ` Gansu '. The results show that P. ostii var. lishizhenii exhibits the average oil characteristics of tested peonies , with an oil content of 21.3 % , α-linolenic acid 43.8 % , and unsaturated fatty acids around 92.1 %. Hygiene indicators for the seven peony seed oils met the Chinese national food standards. P. ostii var. lishizhenii seeds were used to analyze transcriptome gene regulation networks on endosperm development and oil biosynthesis. In total , 124,117 transcripts were obtained from six endosperm developing stages ( S0-S5). The significant changes in differential expression genes ( DEGs) clarify three peony endosperm developmental phases: the endosperm cell mitotic phase ( S0-S1) , the TAG biosynthesis phase ( S1-S4) , and the mature phase ( S5). The DEGs in plant hormone signal transduction , DNA replication , cell division , differentiation , transcription factors , and seed dormancy pathways regulate the endosperm development process. Another 199 functional DEGs participate in glycolysis , pentose phosphate pathway , citrate cycle , FA biosynthesis , TAG assembly , and other pathways. A key transcription factor ( WRI1) and some important target genes ( ACCase , FATA , LPCAT , FADs , and DGAT etc.) were found in the comprehensive genetic networks of oil biosynthesis.
