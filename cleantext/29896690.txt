  Heart is the first mesodermal organ<symptom> to develop and is sensitive to life-threatening toxic effects of drugs during development. A number of methods have been devised to study developmental cardiotoxic effects of drugs including micromass system. The micromass system involves the culture of primary embryonic cells and reestablishment of tissue system in vitro. In chick embryonic cardiomyocyte micromass system the chick heart cells are cultured in a small volume at a very high cell density. These cells form synchronized contracting foci. Addition of drugs to this system allows us to study the developmental cardiotoxic effects at molecular level. Using appropriate end points and molecular marker or adopting high-throughput screening , this method can further help to identify and avoid the use of cardiotoxic compounds during development.
