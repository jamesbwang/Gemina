  To evaluate differences in clinical results according to age among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML). 207 consecutive CML patients treated with imatinib frontline were revised , dividing them in young adults ( > 20 < 45 years) ( YA) , middle-aged adults ( ≥ 45 < 65 years) ( MA) and elderly ( ≥ 65 years) ( EL). Cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR) and major molecular response ( MMolR) were significantly higher in MA compared with YA and EL ( p < 0.001 for CCyR and p = 0.001 for MMolR). Number of total events was lower in MA ( 8 ( 11.1 %) vs 21 ( 34.4 %) in YA and 28 ( 37.8 %) in EL , p = 0.001): no difference was observed for blastic evolution ( p = 0.478). Number of deaths was higher in the EL ( 12 ( 16.2 %) vs 2 ( 3.2 %) in YA and 0 in MA , p < 0.001): however , 11/12 deaths in EL were not related to CML. The PFS curve in MA was significantly longer than in YA and in EL ( p = 0.02). The OS curve in EL was significantly shorter than in YA and in MA ( p < 0.001). Age at diagnosis influences significantly the course of CML patients treated with imatinib: a possible explanation of the counterintuitive worse course in YA is the delayed diagnosis compared to elderly.
