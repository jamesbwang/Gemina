  Diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH) is complicated due to the lack of reliable serum biomarkers. Up-regulation of alpha-2-macroglobulin ( A2M) gene has been reported in glucocorticoid-induced ANFH rat model. This study aimed to investigate whether the serum level of alpha-2-macroglobulin ( A2M) can be used for ONFH diagnosis. Serum protein capillary electrophoresis was performed on the sera of 36 ONFH patients. Also , human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate the serum levels of A2M. Alpha-2 subunit level , composed of alpha-2-macroglobulin , ceruloplasmin and 2-2 haptoglobin phenotype , was increased significantly as compared to healthy subjects ( Our findings suggest that avascular necrotic femur head presumably directly or indirectly elevates A2M in the bloodstream. Thus , serum level of A2M might be used as a reliable diagnostic tool in clinical practice.
