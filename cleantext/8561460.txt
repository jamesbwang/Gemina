  The inflammatory process is an essential phenomenon in the induction of immune responses. Monocytes are key effector cells during the inflammatory process. A wide range of evidence indicates that mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue ( ASC) are endowed with immunomodulatory capacity. However , the interaction between ASC and monocytes in the innate immune response is not well understood. The aim of this work was to investigate the possible paracrine anti-inflammatory effects of ASC in human monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats and ASC from fat of non-obese patients. Conditioned medium ( CM) from ASC in primary culture was used. We have assessed the effects of CM on the production of inflammatory mediators , degranulation , migration , phagocytic activity , senescence , oxidative stress , mitochondrial membrane potential and macrophage polarization. We have shown that ASC exert paracrine anti-inflammatory actions on human monocytes. CM significantly reduced the production of TNFÎ± , NO and PGE
