  Mildew damage is a major reason for chestnut poor quality and yield loss. In this study , a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system in the 874 ‚Åª 1734 nm spectral range was applied to detect the mildew damage to chestnuts caused by blue mold. Principal component analysis ( PCA) scored images were firstly employed to qualitatively and intuitively distinguish moldy chestnuts from healthy chestnuts. Spectral data were extracted from the hyperspectral images. A successive projections algorithm ( SPA) was used to select 12 optimal wavelengths. Artificial neural networks , including back propagation neural network ( BPNN) , evolutionary neural network ( ENN) , extreme learning machine ( ELM) , general regression neural network ( GRNN) and radial basis neural network ( RBNN) were used to build models using the full spectra and optimal wavelengths to distinguish moldy chestnuts. BPNN and ENN models using full spectra and optimal wavelengths obtained satisfactory performances , with classification accuracies all surpassing 99 %. The results indicate the potential for the rapid and non-destructive detection of moldy chestnuts by hyperspectral imaging , which would help to develop online detection system for healthy and blue mold infected chestnuts.
