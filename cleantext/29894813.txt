  Enzyme immobilization often achieves reusable biocatalysts with improved operational stability and solvent resistance. However , these modifications are generally associated with a decrease in activity or detrimental modifications in catalytic properties. On the other hand , protein engineering aims to generate enzymes with increased performance at specific conditions by means of genetic manipulation , directed evolution and rational design. However , the achieved biocatalysts are generally generated as soluble enzymes ,- thus not reusable- and their performance under real operational conditions is uncertain. Combined protein engineering and enzyme immobilization approaches have been employed as parallel or consecutive strategies for improving an enzyme of interest. Recent reports show efforts on simultaneously improving both enzymatic and immobilization components through genetic modification of enzymes and optimizing binding chemistry for site-specific and oriented immobilization. Nonetheless , enzyme engineering and immobilization are usually performed as separate workflows to achieve improved biocatalysts. In this review , we summarize and discuss recent research aiming to integrate enzyme immobilization and protein engineering and propose strategies to further converge protein engineering and enzyme immobilization efforts into a novel `` immobilized biocatalyst engineering '' research field. We believe that through the integration of both enzyme engineering and enzyme immobilization strategies , novel biocatalysts can be obtained , not only as the sum of independently improved intrinsic and operational properties of enzymes , but ultimately tailored specifically for increased performance as immobilized biocatalysts , potentially paving the way for a qualitative jump in the development of efficient , stable biocatalysts with greater real-world potential in challenging bioprocess applications.
