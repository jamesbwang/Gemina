  Hand transplantation requires precise preoperative planning and surgical execution. Coordinating a transplant team-including surgeons , anesthesiologists , nurses , and supporting staff-is a time-sensitive challenge when a donor-recipient match is confirmed. International human limb transplantation occurs when the recipient and donor are in separate countries. We describe the logistics behind the first trans-Atlantic adult bilateral hand transplantation , which , to date , required the highest level of coordination and timing. Our experience serves as a proof of concept that international limb transplantation or salvage is possible when the complex logistics of such an endeavor are carefully anticipated.
