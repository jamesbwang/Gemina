  Natural killer ( NK) cells therapy has the potential to prolong survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). We conducted a clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of cetuximab plus NK cells therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Between June 2015 and August 2016 , 54 patients with advanced EGFR-expressing NSCLC were assigned randomly to the cetuximab plus NK cells therapy group ( A; n = 27) or cetuximab alone group ( B; n = 27). Patients in group A received two courses of NK cells therapy continuously. Cetuximab was administered intravenously and the weekly maintenance dose was continued until tumor progression. All adverse effects were manageable and no significant difference was noted between the two groups (
