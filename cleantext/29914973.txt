  Characterization , diagnosis , and treatment of colorectal cancers ( CRC) are difficult due to limited biopsy information , impracticality of repeated biopsies , and cancer biomarker fallibility. Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) has recently been investigated as a non-invasive way to gain representative gene mutations in tumors , in addition to monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. We analyzed ctDNA mutations and concentrations in 47 early- and late-stage CRC patients using a targeted sequencing approach using a panel that covers 50 cancer-related genes. ctDNA mutations in 37 genes ( were identified in 93.6 % of the patients ( n = 47). The results showed that
