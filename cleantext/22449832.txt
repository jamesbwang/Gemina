  Two major issues with laparoscopic inguinal hernia ( IH) repair are recurrences and chronic groin pain ( CGP). The procedure involves fixing the mesh with the tackers which is believed to increase the rate of CGP due to nerve injuries. Thus , non-fixation of mesh is being proposed but concerns remain regarding increased recurrences. We sought to look at our outcomes after we switched over to non-fixation of mesh in totally extraperitoneal repair ( TEP). Retrospective review of prospectively maintained database of 171 repairs was done on 122 patients ( fixation 59 and non-fixation 112) during a period of 4 years with an endeavor to complete a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up. The primary objective was to assess the recurrence rates and CGP and the secondary objective was to assess operative times , immediate post-op pain , incidence of urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> , duration of hospital stay , days taken to return to activity , and cost. The mean operative times for unilateral IH for the fixation and non-fixation groups were 41.8 ± 11.4 and 35.9 ± 9.7 min , respectively (
