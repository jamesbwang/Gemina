  Cancer immunotherapy fights against cancer by modulating the immune response and is delivering encouraging results in clinical treatments. However , it is challenging to achieve durable response in all cancer patients during treatment due to the diversity and dynamic nature of immune system as well as inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. A comprehensive assessment of system immunity and tumor microenvironment is crucial for effective and safe cancer therapy , which can potentially be resolved by single-cell proteomic analysis. Single-cell proteomic technologies enable system-wide profiling of protein levels in a number of single cells within the immune system and tumor microenvironment , and thereby provide direct assessment of the functional state of the immune cells and tumor-immune interaction that could be used to evaluate efficacy of immunotherapy and to improve clinical outcome. In this chapter , we summarized current single-cell proteomic technologies and their applications in cancer immunotherapy.
