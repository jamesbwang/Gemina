  Rare investigation on tick-borne pathogens was carried out in Yunnan , China. In this study , we did a survey on Ehrlichia<pathogen> infection in small mammals and ticks. A total of 40 small mammals and 49 ticks were collected from Tengchong , Yunnan province. PCR targeting 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) , citrate synthase , GroEL heat-shock protein operon , and major outer membrane protein genes was performed and positive amplicons were sequenced. The 40 small mammals were identified as 10 species , 2 ( 5.0 %) of which were infected with Ehrlichia , 4 ( 10.0 %) were infected with Anaplasma<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen> and another 2 ( 5.0 %) were infected with Candidatus<pathogen> Neoehrlichia mikurensis. Six ( 12.2 %) ticks were positive for Ehrlichia and another two ( 4.1 %) were infected with A.<pathogen> phagocytophilum<pathogen>. Neither small mammals nor ticks had coinfection. The detected Ehrlichia was named as Ehrlichia sp.. YN04 , which was in the same clade of Ehrlichia<pathogen> sp. 360 by phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of the pathogen recovered from small mammals and ticks were identical with each other. The study reports one Ehrlichia<pathogen> species first detected from small mammals and ticks in mainland China. As Yunnan is a famous `` Global Biodiversity Hotspot '' in the world , we may expect much more tick-borne infectious pathogens existing and declare more public health attention in this region.
