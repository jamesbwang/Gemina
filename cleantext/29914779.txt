  Type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in older adults ( ≥ 65 years of age) and increases fall risk. Fear of falling and low balance<symptom> confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself. Therefore , the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance<symptom> confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes. A search of CINAHL , EMBASE and PubMed was conducted. The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet * AND fear OR falls AND self-efficacy OR balance<symptom> confidence. Inclusion criteria were 1) population: older adults ( ≥ 65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes; and 2) outcome measure: balance<symptom> confidence or fear of falling. We included 21 studies: fear of falling ( n = 14); balance<symptom> confidence ( n = 7). We categorized them into 4 themes: prevalence , severity , determinants and interventions. Determinants were further categorized into physical , psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance<symptom> confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance<symptom> confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions ( e.g. gait and balance<symptom> training , tai chi , yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance<symptom> confidence. Future work is needed to generate best practices related to fear of falling and low balance<symptom> confidence in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
