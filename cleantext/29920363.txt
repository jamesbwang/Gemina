  The common fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding model to analyze the regulation of conserved signaling pathways. In this study , we examined whether signaling components in the Bone Morphogenic Protein ( BMP) branch of the TGF-β signaling pathway are involved in the response to wounding caused by either sterile injury or infection by parasitic nematodes in D. melanogaster adult flies. We found that following sterile injury , the BMP pathway Type I receptor sax and intracellular transcription factor Mad were substantially upregulated. Also , inactivation of Mad or dpp promoted fly survival and increased antimicrobial peptide gene transcript levels upon sterile injury or H. bacteriophora nematode infection , respectively , but not against the bacterial pathogen Photorhabdus<pathogen> luminescens<pathogen> Our findings indicate the roles of certain BMP signaling components in the regulation of the fly immune response against sterile injury or nematode infection. In conclusion , this study highlights the ability of D. melanogaster to activate the BMP branch of TGF-β signaling in order to modulate the response to injury in the absence or presence of pathogenic infection.
