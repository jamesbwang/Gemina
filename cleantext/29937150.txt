  To retrospectively investigate the safety , efficacy , and complications associated with TrapEase inferior vena cava filters. All patients who received a TrapEase filter at a single institution between April 2003 and January 2013 were identified , and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. During the study period , 594 patients ( 278 women; mean age , 68.9 Â± 13.6 years; range , 19.2-96.3 years) received a TrapEase filter. The duration of this study was 88 months , with a median clinical follow-up of 3.6 months ( range , 0-148.3 months). During follow-up , 489 of 594 patients ( 82.3 %) died and 105 remained alive with filters in situ. Nine cases of breakthrough pulmonary embolism occurred among the 582 patients with clinical follow-up ( 1.5 %). Among 128 patients with imaging that contained the filter , there were 17 cases of filter fracture ( 13.3 %). Of the 39 patients with available computed tomography scans , eight had filling defects within the filter suggestive of thrombus or embolus ( 20.5 %) , including two patients with complete caval occlusion. Recurrent deep vein thrombosis occurred in 109 out of 582 patients ( 18.7 %) with clinical follow-up. Most patients who received TrapEase filters died during follow-up , possibly because operators chose to implant a permanent filter in patients with known terminal illnesses. The filter fracture rate seemed to be high , but there were no instances of free fracture fragment or distant migration. Although the filter may theoretically be effective in preventing thrombus migration owing to the double basket design , pulmonary embolism breakthrough rates were comparable with rates seen with other filters.
