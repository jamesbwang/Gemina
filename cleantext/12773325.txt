  Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) , a devastating progressive interstitial lung disease ( ILD) with no known cause , is the most common and deadly of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias<disease>. With a median survival of 3 ‚Åª 5 years following diagnosis , IPF is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function and quality of life in most patients. Prognostic factors recognized classically that influence mortality include functional , clinical and radiological parameters. However , in recent years , there has also been progress in the knowledge of genetic factors and biomarkers that may be useful in the prognostic evaluation of these patients. On the other hand , the monitoring of the disease throughout its evolution is key to improving the prognosis of the patients , as it allows for taking therapeutic measures based on this evolution , even early remission for lung transplantation. This article reviews the main prognostic factors of the disease , as well as the most useful way to monitor the disease follow-up.
