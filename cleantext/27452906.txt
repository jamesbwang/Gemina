  The breast cancer ( BC) epidemic is a multifactorial disease attributed to the early twenty-first century: about two million of new cases and half a million deaths are registered annually worldwide. New trends are emerging now: on the one hand , with respect to the geographical BC prevalence and , on the other hand , with respect to the age distribution. Recent statistics demonstrate that young populations are getting more and more affected by BC in both Eastern<disease> and Western countries. Therefore , the old rule `` the older the age , the higher the BC risk '' is getting relativised now. Accumulated evidence shows that young premenopausal women deal with particularly unpredictable subtypes of BC such as triple-negative BC , have lower survival rates and respond less to conventional chemotherapy compared to the majority of postmenopausal BC. Here we hypothesised that a multi-level diagnostic approach may lead to the identification of a molecular signature highly specific for the premenopausal BC. A multi-omic approach using machine learning was considered as a potent tool for stratifying patients with benign breast alterations into well-defined risk groups , namely individuals at high versus low risk for breast cancer development. The study resulted in identifying multi-omic signature specific for the premenopausal BC that can be used for stratifying patients with benign breast alterations. Our predictive model is capable of discriminating individually between high and low BC-risk with high confidence ( > 90 %) and considered of potential clinical utility. Novel risk assessment approaches and advanced screening programmes-as the long-term target of this project-are of particular importance for predictive , preventive and personalised medicine as the medicine of the future , due to the expected health benefits for young subpopulations and the healthcare system as a whole.
