  Nitroaromatic explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene ( 2,4,6-TNT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene ( 2,4-DNT) are two common nitroaromatic compounds in ammunition. Their leakage leads to serious environmental pollution and threatens human health. It is important to remove or decompose them rapidly and efficiently. In this work , we present that light-powered TiO
