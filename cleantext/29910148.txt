  This study focuses on actions at the political and administrative level in Spain in relation to the implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP). We analysed a whole range of different formal initiatives taken by the political and administrative actors involved. The information was obtained from official public data sources. As of February 2018 , PrEP had not been implemented. The decision is dependent on both state and regional governments. The Ministry of Health and some Autonomous Regions are working on different interventions , but without providing an implementation timetable. The political parties have kept a very low profile in terms of initiatives related to the implementation of PrEP. From a legal point of view , proceedings are passing back and forth with the extension of the patent. The role of intergovernmental and interdepartmental institutions is very important for the implementation of PrEP in Spain.
