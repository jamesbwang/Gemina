  Inflammatory markers are significantly associated with cardiovascular disease. The ratio between neutrophils and lymphocytes ( NLR) is a potential new biomarker , which can single out individuals at risk for future cardiovascular events. Among total white blood cell count ( WBC) and its subtypes , NLR seems to have the greatest predictive value for death and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS). We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the relation between NLR and cardiovascular outcomes in STEMI/NSTEMI patients. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. Two reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Pooled results were reported as odds ratios ( ORs) and were presented with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). Twenty-three studies for a total of > 16,000 patients were included. Compared to those with low NLR , high NLR on-admission was associated with a higher overall mortality both in patients with STEMI ( OR: 4.60 , 95 % CI: 2.84-7.45; P < 0.00001) and in patients with NSTEMI ( OR: 6.41 , 95 % CI: 2.65-15.50; P < 0.00001). An increased MACE risk was found in STEMI patients with high NLR ( OR: 3.71 , 95 % CI: 2.67-5.17; P < 0.00001). Post-PCI mortality risk was significantly increased in patients with high NLR ( OR: 3.76 , 95 % CI: 2.64-5.34; P < 0.00001). In this large meta-analysis on prognostic significance of NLR in ACS we found that on-admission high NLR in patients with STEMI/NSTEMI appeared to affect clinically important outcomes including both in-hospital and long-term mortality and MACE.
