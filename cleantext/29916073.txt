  The isolation of vacuoles is an essential step to unravel the important and complex functions of this organelle in plant physiology. Here , we describe a method for the isolation of vacuoles from Catharanthus roseus leaves involving a simple procedure for the isolation of protoplasts , and the application of a controlled osmotic/thermal shock<symptom> to the naked cells , leading to the release of intact vacuoles , which are subsequently purified by density gradient centrifugation. The purity of the isolated intact vacuoles is assayed by microscopy , western blotting , and measurement of vacuolar ( V)- H
