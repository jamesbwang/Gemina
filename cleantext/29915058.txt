  Multidrug and toxic-compound extrusion ( MATE) proteins comprise an important but largely uncharacterized family of secondary-active transporters. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes , these transporters protect the cell by catalyzing the efflux of a broad range of cytotoxic compounds , including human-made antibiotics and anticancer drugs. MATEs are thus potential pharmacological targets against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria and tumor cells. The activity of MATEs is powered by transmembrane electrochemical ion gradients , but their molecular mechanism and ion specificity are not understood , in part because high-quality structural information is limited. Here , we use computational methods to study PfMATE , from
