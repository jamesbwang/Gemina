  Polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA) has been considered a suitable material for cranioplasty. However , no consensus has been reached concerning the best material for cranioplasty with regard to minimizing complications. Thus , this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the complication rates of PMMA with those of autologous bone and titanium mesh. This review was registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42016042725). Systematic searches were conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE , Scopus , and Web of Science. The focus question was , `` Do PMMA prostheses used in cranioplasty have complications rates similar to those of autologous bone and titanium mesh? '' A meta-analysis of complication rates was performed on the basis of dichotomous outcomes assessed by risk ratio ( RR) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). From 1014 data sources , 11 articles were selected according to eligibility criteria. These articles involved 1,256 individuals and 1,278 cranioplasties using autologous bone ( n = 408) , PMMA ( n = 379) , or titanium ( n = 151). The follow-up period ranged from 63 days to 54.3 months. No difference was observed between the complication rates of PMMA and autologous bone ( p = 0.94; RR , 0.98; 95 % CI , 0.54-1.75) or between PMMA and titanium ( p = 0.38; RR , 1.59; 95 % CI , 0.57-4.48). Sub-analysis of the reasons for craniotomy ( trauma/non-trauma) was conducted , which revealed no significant difference ( p = 0.91; RR , 0.95; 95 % CI , 0.37-2.42). The meta-analysis indicated that the use of PMMA yields complication rates that are near those of autologous bone and titanium mesh.
