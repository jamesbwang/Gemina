  In view of recent revised recommendations for human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) confirmatory testing , the performance of 3 HIV<pathogen> confirmatory assays was compared. Using the HIV<pathogen> Blot 2.2 ( MP-WB) , the INNO-LIA HIV<pathogen> I/II Score ( INNO) , and the Geenius HIV<pathogen> 1/2 Confirmatory Assay ( Geenius) , we tested 199 HIV-1 positive , 161 HIV<pathogen> negative , 65 HIV<pathogen> western blot indeterminate , 26 HIV<pathogen> seroconversion , 34 early HIV<pathogen> infection and 4 HIV-2 positive archived specimens. We show that all 3 assays had comparable test sensitivity in the detection of HIV-1 positive cases. However , less non-specific reactivity was observed with the INNO and Geenius assays , where both of them were able to resolve MP-WB indeterminate cases. When early HIV<pathogen> cases were considered , INNO and Geenius were more likely to confirm an early-stage infection as positive. Nevertheless , overall poor sensitivity ( 25.5 %- 44.7 %) of these assays for the detection of early cases was observed , likely because these cases had very low or non-detectable levels of HIV<pathogen> antibodies. Hence , further testing by a nucleic acid test or a p24 antigen test of specimens reactive on screening with a fourth generation Ag/Ab assay that are negative on confirmatory testing for HIV-specific antibody , may be useful. In conclusion , INNO and Geenius had comparable test performance , although the ease of use and shorter assay time for Geenius may make it the preferred choice for laboratories. In that regard , of note is our observation of non-specific reactivity of lipaemic specimens to the HIV-2 gp140 band in the Geenius assay , which should prompt caution when interpreting results of such specimens.
