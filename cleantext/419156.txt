  A safe and effective vaccine against RSV remains an important unmet public health need. Intranasally ( IN) delivered live-attenuated vaccines represent the most extensively studied approach for immunization of RSV-naïve infants and children , however , achieving an effective balance<symptom> of attenuation and immunogenicity has proven challenging. Here we report pre-clinical immunogenicity and efficacy data utilizing a live-attenuated vaccine candidate , RGΔM2-2 , which was obtained by deleting the M2-2 open reading frame from the genome of the MSA1 clinical isolate. Intramuscular ( IM) administration of RGΔM2-2 in cotton rats induced immunity and protective efficacy that was comparable to that induced by intranasal ( IN) immunization. In contrast , the protective efficacy of RGΔM2-2 delivered by the IM route to African green monkeys was substantially reduced as compared to the efficacy following IN administration , despite comparable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. This result suggests that mucosal immunity may play an important role in RSV protection. The RGΔM2-2 vaccine also demonstrated different attenuation profiles when tested in cotton rats , non-human primates , and a human airway epithelial ( HAE) cell model. The data suggest RGΔM2-2 is less attenuated than a similarly designed vaccine candidate constructed on the A2 genetic background. These findings have important implications with regard to both the design and the preclinical safety testing of live-attenuated vaccines.
