  Recent reports suggest United States military service members who deployed in support of the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have higher rates of new-onset asthma than those who did not deploy. However , it is unknown whether combat experiences , in addition to deployment , contribute to new-onset asthma risk. This study aimed to longitudinally determine the risk factors for developing asthma , including combat deployment ( categorized as deployed with combat experience , deployed without combat experience , and nondeployed) , among Millennium Cohort Study participants from 2001 to 2013. A total of 75,770 participants completed a baseline and at least one triennial follow-up survey on deployment experiences , lifestyle characteristics , and health outcomes. Complementary log-log models stratified by sex were used to estimate the relative risk of developing asthma among participants who reported no history of asthma at baseline. In adjusted models , those who deployed with combat experience were 24 % -30 % more likely to develop asthma than those who did not deploy. Deployed personnel without combat experience were not at a higher risk for new-onset asthma compared with nondeployers. Further research is needed to identify specific features of combat that are associated with greater asthma risk to inform prevention strategies.
