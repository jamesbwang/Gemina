  The aim of this study was to assess the association between weight-loss maintenance and weight-loss satisfaction , adherence to diet and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , all measured session-by-session during the weight-loss phase of cognitive behavioral therapy. The present exploratory study examined a subgroup of fifty-eight patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial and who lost at least the 10 % of their baseline weight. Patients were grouped into weight-loss ` Maintainers ' ( i.e. , those who maintained a weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of â‰¥ 10 % of baseline body<symptom> weight at 6 months after the weight-loss phase) and ` Regainers ' ( i.e. , those who did not maintain > 10 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> at 6 months after the weight-loss phase). Body<symptom> weight , adherence to diet and weight-loss satisfaction were measured session-by-session during the weight-loss phase. Thirteen patients ( 22.4 %) were classified as ` Regainers ' , and 45 ( 77.6 %) as ` Maintainers '. Compared to ` Maintainers ' , ` Regainers ' had a lower adherence to diet after the initial 11 weeks , and a progressively declining weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and weight-loss satisfaction from week 15 or 19 of the weight-loss phase. 11-week dietary adherence and 15-week weight<symptom> loss<symptom> were significantly associated with weight maintenance. Similar results were obtained using the amount of weight change as dependent variable. Adherence to diet , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and weight-loss satisfaction , measured during the late weight-loss phase , are associated with weight-loss maintenance. Level III , evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytical studies.
