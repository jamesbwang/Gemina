  Absence seizures<symptom> are thought to be linked to abnormal interplays between regions of a thalamocortical network. However , the complexity of this widespread network makes characterizing the functional interactions among various brain regions challenging. Using whole-brain functional connectivity and network analysis of magnetoencephalography ( MEG) data , we explored pre-treatment brain hubs ( `` highly connected nodes '') of patients aged 6 to 12 years with childhood absence epilepsy. We analyzed ictal MEG data of 74 seizures<symptom> from 16 patients. We employed a time-domain beamformer technique to estimate MEG sources in broadband ( 1-40 Hz) where the greatest power changes between ictal and preictal periods were identified. A phase synchrony measure , phase locking value , and a graph theory metric , eigenvector centrality ( EVC) , were utilized to quantify voxel-level connectivity and network hubs of ictal > preictal periods , respectively. A volumetric atlas containing 116 regions of interests ( ROIs) was utilized to summarize the network measures. ROIs with EVC ( z-score) > 1.96 were reported as critical hubs. ROIs analysis revealed functional-anatomical hubs in a widespread network containing bilateral precuneus ( right/left , z = 2.39 , 2.18) , left thalamus ( z = 2.28) , and three anterior cerebellar subunits of lobule `` IV-V '' ( z = 3.9) , vermis `` IV-V '' ( z = 3.57) , and lobule `` III '' ( z = 2.03). Findings suggest that highly connected brain areas or hubs are present in focal cortical , subcortical , and cerebellar regions during absence seizures<symptom>. Hubs in thalami , precuneus and cingulate cortex generally support a theory of rapidly engaging and bilaterally distributed networks of cortical and subcortical regions responsible for seizures<symptom> generation , whereas hubs in anterior cerebellar regions may be linked to terminating motor automatisms frequently seen during typical absence seizures<symptom>. Whole-brain network connectivity is a powerful analytic tool to reveal focal components of absence seizures<symptom> in MEG. Our investigations can lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of CAE.
