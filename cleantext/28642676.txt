  High Intensity Functional Training ( HIFT) is a training modality , characterized by multimodal exercises performed at high-intensity. Little is known about the training adaptations that occur as a prolonged training program. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in body composition , bone metabolism , strength , and skill-specific performance over 16-weeks of HIFT. Twenty-six recreationally active adult males ( n = 9; 34.2 ± 9.1 y; 91.5 ± 17.7 kg; 178.5 ± 5.4 cm) and females ( n = 17 = 36.4 ± 7.9 y; 91.5 ± 17.7 kg; 162.9 ± 7.0 cm) completed pre and post training assessments of body composition ( Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry) and performance measures. Performance was assessed using three HIFT workouts ( WOD 1-3) to assess strength , skill , and metabolic performance. Aside from the body composition measurements , all assessments were carried out at the local training facility. Training included participation in HIFT a minimum of twice a week for 16-weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant gender x time interaction in Bone Mineral Content ( BMC) ( p = 0.027) , where improvements favored women ( 1.0 % ± 1.1 % , p = 0.004) over men ( -0.1 % + 0.8 % , p = 0.625). Further , region-specific analysis indicated that women ( 2.5 % ± 3.0 % , p < 0.005) experienced greater improvements in the trunk compared to men ( -0.3 % ± 1.8 % , p = 0.621) , while changes in leg BMC were comparable between women ( 0.8 % ± 1.0 % , p < 0.001) and men ( 0.3 % ± 0.6 % , p < 0.001). Although no other interactions were observed , significant performance improvements were noted for all participants in WOD 1 ( 18.3 % ± 16.8 %) , absolute 5RM ( 14.4 % ± 9.7 %) , relative 5RM ( 15.4 % ± 9.2 %) , WOD 2 ( 5.7 % ± 6.5 %) , and WOD 3 ( -17.3 % ± 14.7 %). These data indicate that 16-weeks of HIFT resulted in positive outcomes in strength , metabolic conditioning performance , and body composition.
