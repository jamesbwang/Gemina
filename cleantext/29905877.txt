  Surgical resection of insular lesions<symptom> is challenging due to their proximity to critical neurovascular structures such as the middle cerebral arteries ( MCA) , Sylvian veins , thalamus , internal capsule ( IC) , and lenticulostriate arteries. A surgical series using the transsylvian-transinsular approach to treat cerebrovascular pathologies reported âˆ¼ 5 % permanent neurological morbidity .1,2 This case demonstrates the utility of this approach for resecting an insular cavernous malformation ( CM). A 25-yr-old female presented with an acute-onset right homonymous hemianopsia. Neuroimaging revealed a large left insular CM , adjacent to the posterior limb of IC. After obtaining IRB approval and patient consent , a left pterional craniotomy with a wide distal Sylvian fissure split was completed. Using neuronavigation , an insular entry point was chosen for corticectomy. The CM was opened with subsequent hematoma evacuation and intracapsular resection technique. Inspection of the cavity revealed remnants anteromedially near the IC , which were removed meticulously , mobilizing the CM away from the IC. Postoperative MRI demonstrated gross total resection of the CM. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5 with persistent homonymous hemianopia.This case describes the use of a transsylvian-transinsular approach to access deep lesions<symptom> with the shortest surgical distance and minimal cortical transgression. A wide Sylvian fissure split exposes the M2 MCA and accesses a safe insular zone , keeping the most eloquent structures deep to the lesion<symptom> in the surgical corridor. This approach can safely expose vascular pathologies in the insular region without the risk of injury to overlying eloquent frontal and temporal lobes , even in the dominant hemisphere.
