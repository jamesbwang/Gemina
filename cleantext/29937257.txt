  Several states have made considerable investments into large-scale implementation of evidence-based treatments ( EBTs) , yet little is known about key success indicators for these implementation efforts such as cost and sustainability. To that end , the present study examined the economic impact of statewide implementation of multisystemic therapy ( MST; Henggeler , Schoenwald , Borduin , Rowland , & Cuningham , 2009) , a family- and community-based behavioral EBT for serious juvenile offenders in New Mexico. Participants were 1,869 youth who received MST across 23 teams during the study period. We conducted a cost-benefit analysis using metrics from state data sources that compared the cost of MST to its benefits ( i.e. , avoided expenses from pre- to posttreatment) in two domains: ( a) behavioral health services ( i.e. , Medicaid claims) and ( b) juvenile crime ( i.e. , taxpayer expenses , tangible and intangible expenses to crime victims). MST costs were based on Medicaid claims , which were reimbursed at an enhanced billing rate that was intended to cover expenses for both clinical and implementation ( e.g. , training , quality assurance) activities. Results suggest that implementation of MST in New Mexico over the 7-year study period may have produced net benefits , through 2 years posttreatment , of more than $ 4,643 per youth in avoided behavioral health claims and $ 15,019 per youth through reductions in juvenile crime. Stated differently , every dollar that New Mexico spent on MST appeared to have returned $ 3.34 for a total benefit of $ 64.2 million over the course of the study. We discuss implications of these findings for policymakers , administrators , and researchers who are interested in increasing the sustainability of complex EBTs in community settings.
