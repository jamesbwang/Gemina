  Ethnicity , skin phototype and colour influenced minimal erythema dose ( MED). Sun exposure has been postulated to increase MED. We determined immediate pigment darkening dose to UVA ( IPDDA) , MED and minimal melanogenic dose ( MMD) for UVB and UVA , and investigated factors affecting these doses. Skin phototype was determined using Fitzpatrick phototype quiz , DSMII ColorMeter measured skin colours , sun exposure quantified using an index ( SEI) and phototest performed with MEDlight-Multitester. A total of 167 healthy volunteers participated. There were 110 ( 66 %) females and 56 ( 34 %) males; 124 ( 74.7 %) were Malay , 27 ( 16.3 %) Chinese and 14 ( 8.4 %) Indians. One hundred and nine ( 65.7 %) skin phototype IV , 30 ( 18.1 %) phototype III and 27 ( 16.3 %) phototype V. IPDDA ranges from 6 ± 1.5-5.7 ± 1.4 J/cm Minimal erythema doses in our cohort were slightly different from other regional countries. Constitutive and facultative skin whiteness , erythema and melanin content correlated with MED. There was no association between skin phototype and sun exposure with MED or MMD.
