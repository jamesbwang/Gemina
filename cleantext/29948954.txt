  To review the diagnosis and treatment of prosthetic joint infection ( PJI) with a focus on two-stage revision arthroplasty. The text will discuss different spacer constructs in total knee and total hip arthroplasty and will present clinical outcome data for these various options. There is no appreciable difference in infection eradication between mobile and static antibiotic spacers. Mobile spacers have shown improved knee range of motion after second-stage re-implantation. Two-stage revision arthroplasty is the gold standard treatment for PJI. The first stage involves removal of all components , cement , and compromised soft tissues with placement of an antibiotic-impregnated spacer. Spacer options include both mobile and static spacers. Mobile spacers offer maintenance of ambulation and joint range of motion between staged procedures and have shown to be as effective in eradicating infection as static spacers.
