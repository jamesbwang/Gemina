  To study the clinical effects of modified plantar fascia stretching manipulation combined with needle Dao loosing in the treatment of heel spur syndrome<disease>. From September 2010 to September 2015 , 115 patients diagnosed as heel spur syndrome<disease> were divided into two groups: treatment group and control group. There were 58 patients in the treatment group , including 21 males and 37 females , ranging in age from 26 to 73 years old , with the course of disease from 6 to 51 months. The patients in the treatment group were treated with modified plantar fascia stretching manipulation combined with needle Dao loosing. There were 57 patients in the control group , including 22 males and 35 females , ranging in age from 31 to 75 years old , with the course of disease from 7 to 58 months. The patients in the control group were treated with traditonal stretching manipulation combined with needle Dao loosing. The NRS scores of heel pain were evaluated at the 1st week , 1 and 3 months after treatment; and the clinical effects of the two groups were evaluated with the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM) scale evaluation system. The numerical rating scale ( NRS) scores were 3.89 ± 0.96 and 2.46 ± 0.95 in the treatment group 1 month and 3 months after treatment , which were superior to 4.52 ± 1.21 and 4.73 ± 1.11 in the control group; and the FAAM rates in the treatment group were ( 3.89 ± 0.96) % and ( 2.46 ± 0.95) % separately 1 month and 3 months after treatment , which were better than ( 4.52 ± 1.21) % and ( 4.73 ± 1.11) % in the control group. The total curative effects of the treatment group were better than that of the control group. The modified plantar fascia stretching manipulation combined with needle Dao loosing can locate the traction point , which has a significant effect on the patients with heel spur syndrome<disease>. Compared with traditonal stretching manipulation combined with needle Dao loosing , this modified mainpulation combined with needle knife loosing has better medium to-long term effects.
