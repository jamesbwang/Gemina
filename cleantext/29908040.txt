  To investigate whether iodine density measurements from contrast-enhanced dual-energy computed tomography ( CT) data can non-invasively stage liver fibrosis<disease>. This single-center , prospective study was approved by our IRB with written informed consent. Forty-seven consecutive patients ( 26 men and 21 women; mean age , 63.1 years) with chronic liver disease underwent contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT of the liver ( non-contrast , arterial , portal venous , and equilibrium phase images) , followed by liver biopsy. Iodine density of liver and aorta were obtained by two independent observers. Iodine uptake of the liver ( Δ Liver) , representing the difference in iodine density between equilibrium phase and non-contrast images , was calculated and normalized by aorta ( Δ Liver/Aorta). We accounted for contrast agent distribution volume by using hematocrit level. Accuracy of iodine density measurements for staging liver fibrosis<disease> was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to assess the impact of independent variables ( liver fibrosis<disease> stage and patient-related confounders) on iodine uptake. The Δ Liver/Aorta significantly increased and moderately correlated with METAVIR liver fibrosis<disease> stage ( ρ = 0.645 , P < 0.001). Areas under the ROC curve ranged from 0.795 to 0.855 for discriminating each liver fibrosis<disease> score ( ≥ F1-F4). METAVIR fibrosis<disease> stage was the most significant independent factor associated with Δ Liver ( P = 0.005) and Δ Liver/Aorta ( P < 0.001). Hepatic extracellular volume fraction with contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT can non-invasively stage liver fibrosis<disease> in chronic liver diseases. This technique could prove useful for monitoring disease progression and treatment response , potentially reducing the need for liver biopsy.
