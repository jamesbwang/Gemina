  A majority of high-grade gliomas relapse despite combined surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There is no consensus on standard treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas , or defined efficacy of adjuvant re-RT after re-Op. This retrospective study evaluated the benefit and safety of re-RT after re-Op ( re-Op/RT). A total of 84 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas who underwent reoperation from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. All patients received neurosurgical intervention and adjuvant radiotherapy previously before recurrence. At recurrence and after reoperation , treatment options were discussed in multidisciplinary clinic or brain tumor joint conference. For re-RT , cumulative EQD Median progression free survival ( PFS) was 6.5 months; 3.5 months with re-Op , 9.0 months with re-Op/RT ( p = 0.025). Age < 50 , time interval to recur â‰¥ 12 months , WHO pathologic grade III , methylated MGMT promotor , and re-RT were factors enhancing PFS in the multivariate analysis. Median overall survival ( OS) was 18.3 months: 12.7 months with re-Op , and 28.1 months with re-Op/RT ( p = 0.066). Three risk factors ( age > 50 , WHO grade IV , and unmethylated promoter of MGMT) were significantly associated with poor OS in multivariate analysis. Benefit of re-RT in both OS and PFS was established in patients carrying 2 or more risk factors. During re-RT , 4 patients ( 8 %) had grade 2 or higher toxicity , and 3 patients ( 6 %) did not complete re-RT. No radionecrosis was observed. Re-RT after re-Op was tolerable with a cumulative median EQD
