  Isolated right Superior Vena Cava drainage into the left atrium in the absence of other cardiac anomalies is an extremely rare condition. The vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation is a congenital vascular malformation. It comprises 1 % of all pediatric congenital anomalies. The association vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation , with congenital heart disease has been described. We describe a 16-months old toddler presenting at 7-months of age with respiratory distress and cyanosis<symptom>. CT brain showed Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations. Echocardiography showed partial anomalous systemic venous drainage in the form of right superior vena cava drained into left atrium. Four sessions of Endovascular embolization were performed. Surgical repair of partial anomalous systemic venous drainage was done successfully. The superior vena cava in our case overrides the atrial septum promoting direct drainage of venous return into the LA , thus causing dilated left ventricle instead of dilatation of right ventricle which is the usual presentation of VAGMs.
