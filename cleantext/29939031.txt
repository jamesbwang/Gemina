  An unprecedented intermolecular nucleophilic attack of C ═ X bonds ( X = O and S) on the rhodium ( I)- carbenes has been developed. This transformation allows for the coupling-cyclization of aroylamides with α-diazoketones and provides concise access to 2,4,5-trisubstituted 1,3-oxazoles and 1,3-thiazoles with a broad tolerance of functional groups.
