  Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) was used to measure the expression of microRNA-155 in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Commercial kit and western blot analysis were used to measure gap-associated protein expression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of microRNA‑155 ( miRNA‑155) in the occurrence of epilepsy and the molecular mechanism involved. In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy , miRNA‑155 expression was evidently higher than that in patients of the normal volunteers group. Overexpression of miRNA‑155 resulted in decreased brain‑derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB) protein expression , increased caspase‑3 activity , tumor protein p53 ( p53) and apoptosis regulator BAX ( Bax) protein expression , and inhibited phosphoinositide 3‑kinase ( PI3K) , phosphorylated ( p) protein kinase B ( Akt) and p‑mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) protein expression in epilepsy cells. PI3K inhibitor accelerated the effect of miRNA‑155 on the inhibition of BDNF and TrkB protein expression , the promotion of caspase‑3 activity , p53 and Bax protein expression , and the inhibition of PI3K , p‑Akt and p‑mTOR protein expression in epilepsy cells. The present findings indicate that miRNA‑155 contributes to the occurrence of epilepsy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
