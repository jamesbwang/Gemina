  A novel technique is presented for retrospective estimation and removal of gas-phase hyperpolarized Xenon-129 ( HP Digital lung phantom and human subject experiments ( N = 8 healthy; N = 1 with idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>) were acquired with 3D radial trajectory and 1-point Dixon spectroscopic imaging to assess the correction method for mitigating barrier and RBC imaging artifacts. Dependence of performance on TE , image SNR , and gas contamination level were characterized. Inter- and intra-subject variation in the dissolved-phase ratios were quantified and compared to human subject experiments before and after correction. Gas contamination resulted in image artifacts similar to those in disease that were mitigated after correction in both simulated and human subject data; for simulation experiments performance varied with TE , but was independent of image SNR and the amount of gas contamination. Artifacts and variation of barrier and RBC components were reduced after correction in both simulation and healthy human lungs ( barrier , P = 0.01; RBC , P = 0.045). The proposed technique significantly reduced regional variations in barrier and RBC ratios , separated using a 1-point Dixon approach , with improved accuracy of dissolved-phase HP
