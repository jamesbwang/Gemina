  Atherosclerotic diseases sometimes contribute to acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF). The aim of the present study is to elucidate the prognostic impact of AHF with atherosclerosis. A total of 1226 AHF patients admitted to the intensive care unit were analyzed. AHF associated with atherosclerosis was defined by the etiology: atherosclerosis-AHF group ( n = 708) ( patients whose etiologies were ischemic heart disease or hypertensive heart disease) or AHF not associated with atherosclerosis ( non-atherosclerosis-AHF) group ( n = 518). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the survival rate of the atherosclerosis-AHF group was significantly better than that of the non-atherosclerosis-AHF group within 730 days of follow-up. Regarding pre-hospital medications , atherosclerosis-AHF patients were more likely to be administered nitroglycerin ( 20.3 vs. 13.7 % , p = 0.003) , nicorandil ( 18.8 vs. 7.5 % , p < 0.001) , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB) ( 46.5 vs. 38.6 % , p = 0.006) , β-blocker ( 33.2 vs. 26.6 % , p = 0.014) and statin ( 30.1 vs. 22.4 % , p = 0.003) because of a previous coronary event or atherosclerotic diseases. In sub-group analysis of medication including administered ≥ 3 drugs within 5 medications and ACE-I/ARB , atherosclerosis-AHF significantly decreased the rate of all-cause death within 180 days ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.215 , 95 % CI 0.078-0.593 and HR 0.395 , 95 % CI 0.244-0.641 , respectively) with a significant interaction ( p value for interaction 0.022 and 0.005 , respectively). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the 180-days survival rate of the atherosclerosis-AHF group with ACE-I/ARB and ≥ 3 drugs were significantly better than other groups. The AHF patients associated with atherosclerosis lead to be a good long-term outcome. A relationship may exist between efficient treatment including ACE-Is before admission and a good outcome in mid-term.
