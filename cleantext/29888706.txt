  Newborn screening is important for early diagnosis and effective treatment of inborn errors of metabolism ( IEM). In response to a 2008 coroners ' report of a 14-year-old boy who died of an undiagnosed IEM , the OPathPaed service model was proposed. In the present study , we investigated the feasibility of the OPathPaed model for delivering expanded newborn screening in Hong Kong. In addition , health care professionals were surveyed on their knowledge and opinions of newborn screening for IEM. The present prospective study involving three regional hospitals was conducted in phases , from 1 October 2012 to 31 August 2014. The 10 steps of the OPathPaed model were evaluated: parental education , consent , sampling , sample dispatch , dried blood spot preparation and testing , reporting , recall and counselling , confirmation test , treatment and monitoring , and cost-benefit analysis. A fully automated online extraction system for dried blood spot analysis was also evaluated. A questionnaire was distributed to 430 health care professionals by convenience sampling. In total , 2440 neonates were recruited for newborn screening; no true-positive cases were found. Completed questionnaires were received from 210 respondents. Health care professionals supported implementation of an expanded newborn screening for IEM. In addition , there is a substantial need of more education for health care professionals. The majority of respondents supported implementing the expanded newborn screening for IEM immediately or within 3 years. The feasibility of OPathPaed model has been confirmed. It is significant and timely that when this pilot study was completed , a government-led initiative to study the feasibility of newborn screening for IEM in the public health care system on a larger scale was announced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Policy Address of 2015.
