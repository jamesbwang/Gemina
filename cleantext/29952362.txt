  The aim of this study was to evaluate children with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) regarding epidemiological characteristics , clinical status with respect to the WHO functional class ( WHO-FC) , prognostic factors , and efficacy of medical treatment. A retrospective evaluation of 41 patients with PAH was made in the Pediatric Cardiology Unit , Gazi University Medical Faculty , between February 2006 and October 2015. Of the 41 patients included in this study , 51.2 % were female. The median age was 60 months at first evaluation. The median follow-up was 60 months. At the start of the treatment , 43.9 % patients were receiving combined drug therapy , and this rate increased to 60.9 % by the last evaluation. The median time of adding a new medication to the therapy was 20 months. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 94 % and 86 % , respectively. At the time of diagnosis , only pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( proBNP) levels were associated with mortality ( p = 0.004) , but at the last evaluation , 6-min walking test , proBNP and uric acid levels , and WHO-FC were also associated with survival ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.001 , p = 0.002 , and p = 0.05 , respectively). With current treatment choices in experienced centers , positive results are obtained with respect to the functional status and survival rates of patients with PAH. At the time of diagnosis , only proBNP had a prognostic value , whereas at the last evaluation , WHO-FC , 6-min walking test , proBNP , and uric acid were reported prognostic factors. For preventing rapid progression , determination of factors that have an effect on prognosis , in particular , is extremely important.
