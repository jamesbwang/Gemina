  Workplace injuries , such as musculoskeletal injuries , needlestick injuries , and emotional and physical violence , remain an issue in U.S. hospitals. To develop meaningful safety programs , it is important to identify workplace factors that contribute to injuries. This study explored factors that affect injuries in a sample of newly licensed registered nurses ( NLRNs) in Florida. Regressions were run on models in which the dependent variable was the degree to which the respondent had experienced needlesticks , work-related musculoskeletal injuries , cuts or lacerations , contusions , verbal violence , physical violence , and other occupational injuries. A higher probability of these injuries was associated with greater length of employment , working evening or night shifts , working overtime , and reporting job difficulties and pressures. A lower probability was associated with working in a teaching hospital and working more hours. Study findings suggest that work environment issues must be addressed for safety programs to be effective.
