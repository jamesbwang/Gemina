  Soft adaptable materials that change their shapes , volumes , and properties in response to changes under ambient conditions have important applications in tissue engineering , soft robotics , biosensing , and flexible displays. Upon water absorption , most existing soft materials , such as hydrogels , show a positive volume change , corresponding to a positive swelling. By contrast , the negative swelling represents a relatively unusual phenomenon that does not exist in most natural materials. The development of material systems capable of large or anisotropic negative swelling remains a challenge. We combine analytic modeling , finite element analyses , and experiments to design a type of soft mechanical metamaterials that can achieve large effective negative swelling ratios and tunable stress-strain curves , with desired isotropic/anisotropic features. This material system exploits horseshoe-shaped composite microstructures of hydrogel and passive materials as the building blocks , which extend into a periodic network , following the lattice constructions. The building block structure leverages a sandwiched configuration to convert the hydraulic swelling deformations of hydrogel into bending deformations , thereby resulting in an effective shrinkage ( up to around -47 % linear strain) of the entire network. By introducing spatially heterogeneous designs , we demonstrated a range of unusual , anisotropic swelling responses , including those with expansion in one direction and , simultaneously , shrinkage along the perpendicular direction. The design approach , as validated by experiments , allows the determination of tailored microstructure geometries to yield desired length/area changes. These design concepts expand the capabilities of existing soft materials and hold promising potential for applications in a diverse range of areas.
