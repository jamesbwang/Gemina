  Radiation exposure related to conventional tachyarrhythmia radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) carries small but definite risk for both patients and operators. Today , non-fluoroscopic mapping systems enable to perform catheter ablation with minimal or zero fluoroscopy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients who had undergone `` Zero X-ray '' ablation , since no information is available on the very long-term benefits. A total of 272 arrhythmias in 266 patients have been treated with catheter ablation by means of a zero-ray approach guided only by a nonconventional mapping system ( EnSite NavX ™ , Ensite ™ Velocity ™ mapping system; subsequently Ensite ™ Precision ™ Abbott , St. Paul , MN). Fluoroscopy was never used. Over a period of 6 years , patients were followed up for an average of 2.9 ± 1.6 years. A 100 % rate of acute success was observed in the study population , with a complication rate of 0.8 %. Chronic success was achieved in 90.8 % of the total number of procedures ( 272). Patients in whom the same arrhythmia recurred during follow-up underwent to a redo catheter ablation procedure in 60.0 % of cases , while the remaining 40.0 % underwent pharmacological treatment. A new post-ablation arrhythmia occurred in 7.7 % of the sample. The non-fluoroscopic approach is a feasible and safe alternative to fluoroscopy for arrhythmias ablation. This method ensures low complications rates , high acute procedural success rates , and comparable long-term outcomes with clinical benefits for both patients and physicians. The complete elimination of fluoroscopy during catheter ablation is advantageous and does not reduce patient safety.
