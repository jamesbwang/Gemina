  To compare prostatic artery embolisation ( PAE) with transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP) in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> in terms of patient reported and functional outcomes. Randomised , open label , non-inferiority trial. Urology and radiology departments of a Swiss tertiary care centre. 103 patients aged ≥ 40 years with refractory lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> were randomised between 11 February 2014 and 24 May 2017; 48 and 51 patients reached the primary endpoint 12 weeks after PAE and TURP , respectively. PAE performed with 250-400 μm microspheres under local anaesthesia versus monopolar TURP performed under spinal or general anaesthesia. Primary outcome was change in international prostate symptoms score ( IPSS) from baseline to 12 weeks after surgery; a difference of less than 3 points between treatments was defined as non-inferiority for PAE and tested with a one sided Mean reduction in IPSS from baseline to 12 weeks was -9.23 points after PAE and -10.77 points after TURP. Although the difference was less than 3 points ( 1.54 points in favour of TURP ( 95 % confidence interval -1.45 to 4.52)) , non-inferiority of PAE could not be shown ( P = 0.17). None of the patient reported secondary outcomes differed significantly between treatments when tested for superiority; IPSS also did not differ significantly ( P = 0.31). At 12 weeks , PAE was less effective than TURP regarding changes in maximum rate of urinary flow ( 5.19 The improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> seen 12 weeks after PAE is close to that after TURP. PAE is associated with fewer complications than TURP but has disadvantages regarding functional outcomes , which should be considered when selecting patients. Further comparative study findings , including longer follow-up , should be evaluated before PAE can be considered as a routine treatment. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02054013.
