  To determine whether three of CYP1B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms , c. 142C > G , c. 355G > T and c. 1294C > G are associated with a lung cancer risk. A total of 112 lung cancer patients and 100 controls were genotyped using the RFLP-PCR. In the c. 142C > G polymorphisms , G allele was more frequent in lung cancer patients than in controls ( p < 0.001) , while in the c. 1294C > G polymorphisms , C allele was more frequent in lung cancer patients , than in controls ( p = 0.012). In the c. 355G > T polymorphism , the distribution of alleles in both analyzed groups was similar. The GTC haplotype turned out to be correlated with the increased lung cancer risk , compared with the most common CGG haplotype ( OR: 2.38; p = 0.001). CYP1B1 gene polymorphisms appear to influence lung cancer susceptibility.
