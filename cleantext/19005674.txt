  Metastasis is the most lethal aspect of cancer , yet current therapeutic strategies do not target its key rate-limiting steps. We have previously shown that the entry of cancer cells into the blood stream , or intravasation , is highly dependent upon in vivo cancer cell motility , making it an attractive therapeutic target. To systemically identify genes required for tumor cell motility in an in vivo tumor microenvironment , we established a novel quantitative in vivo screening platform based on intravital imaging of human cancer metastasis in ex ovo avian embryos. Utilizing this platform to screen a genome-wide shRNA library , we identified a panel of novel genes whose function is required for productive cancer cell motility in vivo , and whose expression is closely associated with metastatic risk in human cancers. The RNAi-mediated inhibition of these gene targets resulted in a nearly total ( > 99.5 %) block of spontaneous cancer metastasis in vivo.
