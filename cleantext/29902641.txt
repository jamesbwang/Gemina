  There is limited information on contemporary incidence rates and trends , by race , ethnicity , and age , for major subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer in the United States. We examined the most recent nationwide incidence data for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) , gastric cardia adenocarcinoma ( GCA) , and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma ( GNCA) by race , ethnicity , and age in the United States. Average contemporary incidence rates ( 2010-2014) and annual percent changes in rates ( from 1997 through 2014) by race , ethnicity , and age were calculated for each cancer subtype using nationwide data compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. From 1997 through 2014 , overall esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence rates continuously decreased in both sexes and all racial and ethnic groups , although rates remained stable among younger non-Hispanic white women. Overall , EAC incidence rates decreased or stabilized during the most recent time period ( 2006-2007 through 2014) in men and women , after increasing from 1997 through 2006 and 2007. However , EAC incidence rates continued to increase from 1997 through 2014 in several subpopulations , including non-Hispanic white men younger than 50 years , non-Hispanic white women younger than 70 years , and Asian/Pacific Islander men ( all ages combined). Overall GCA incidence rates increased among non-Hispanic whites , but decreased among Hispanics ( men only) and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Although overall GNCA rates decreased in both sexes and all racial and ethnic groups , rates increased in younger age groups among men ( all races and ethnicities combined) and non-Hispanic white , non-Hispanic black , and Hispanic women. Using high-quality nationwide population-based data , we found increasing incidence trends for EAC , GCA , and GNCA in several subpopulations in the United States.
