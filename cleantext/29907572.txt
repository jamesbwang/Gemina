  The avian reovirus ( ARV) p17 protein is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Although we have demonstrated that p17 causes cell growth retardation via activation of p53 , the precise mechanisms remains unclear. This is the first report that ARV p17 possesses broad inhibitory effects on cell-cycle CDKs , cyclins , CDK/cyclin complexes , and CDK activating kinase ( CAK) activity in various mammalian , avian , and cancer cell lines. Suppression of CDK activity by p17 occurs by direct binding to CDKs , cyclins , and CDK/cyclin complexes , transcriptional downregulation of CDKs , cytoplasmic retention of CDKs and cyclins , and inhibition of CAK activity by promoting p53/cyclin H interaction. p17 binds to CDK/cyclin except for CDK1/cyclin B1 and CDK7/cyclin H complexes. We have determined that the negatively charged
