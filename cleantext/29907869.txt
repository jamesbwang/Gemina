  Blood vessel epicardial substance ( BVES) , or POPDC1 , is a tight junction-associated transmembrane protein that modulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) via junctional signaling pathways. There have been no in vivo studies investigating the role of BVES in colitis<disease>. We hypothesized that BVES is critical for maintaining colonic epithelial integrity. At baseline , Bves
