  To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of point of care tests ( POCTs) for diagnosing celiac disease ( CD). Recently , POCTs for CD have been developed and are commercially available. Studies have reported significant variability in their sensitivity ( 70 % to 100 %) and specificity ( 85 % to 100 %). We searched MEDLINE , EMBASE databases , and the Cochrane library through June 2017. Positive reference test was defined as villous atrophy along with positive celiac-specific serology and/or clinical improvement after gluten-free diet. Normal duodenal biopsy was defined as negative reference test. Bivariate random-effect model was used to present the summary estimates of sensitivities and specificities along with 95 % confidence regions We assessed methodologic quality using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all POCTs ( based on tTG or DGP or tTG + Anti-gliadin antibodies) for diagnosing CD were 94.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 89.9-96.5) and 94.4 % ( 95 % CI , 90.9-96.5) , respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios for POCTs were 16.7 and 0.06 , respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for IgA-tTG-based POCTs were 90.5 % ( 95 % CI , 82.3-95.1) and 94.8 % ( 95 % CI , 92.5-96.4) , respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of POCTs in diagnosing CD are high. POCTs may be used to screen for CD , especially in areas with limited access to laboratory-based testing. Further research assessing the diagnostic accuracy of individual POCTs and comparing it with other available POCTs is needed.
