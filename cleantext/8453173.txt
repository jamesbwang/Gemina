  Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin are alkaloids with analgesic effects in humans and animals. When used locally , both of them minimalise pain sensation<symptom> by defunctionalising nerve endings. According to the Federation Equestrian International Prohibited Substances List , these are substance banned in horse competitions. The aim of the study was to determine the detection time of capsaicin in both plasma and serum after long-term use of a gel recommended for commercial use and applied as intended. The objective of the study was to select the best material for the detection of capsaicin as a doping substance in horses. Nine healthy mature horses were administered 0.1 % capsaicin topically in the form of a commercial analgesic gel ( 15 g of the gel per limb) to the front limbs every 24 hours for five days with a polar fleece bandage. Blood serum and plasma were collected prior to gel application and in the 12th , 18th , 24th , 36th , 42nd , 48th , 60th , 84th , 108th , 132nd , 156th hour after the gel application. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). The concentration of capsaicin in the serum samples did not exceed the lower limit of quantification. Capsaicin was not detected in the plasma samples during the entire study period. Dihydrocapsaicin was not detected in blood serum or plasma. The presented results suggest that capsaicin is not detected in horse serum in the 24-hour-periodfollowing its last application according to the dosage regimen used by owners and veterinarians for therapy rather than doping , based on a five day gel application and a polar bandage.
