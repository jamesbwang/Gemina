  New Zealand manuka ( Leptospermum scoparium) and kanuka ( Kunzea ericoides) honeys contain a unique array of chemical markers useful for chemical fingerprinting. We investigated the presence of 13 potential marker compounds in nectars of the major honey crop species. We confirmed that leptosperin , lepteridine , 2 '- methoxyacetophenone , and 2-methoxybenzoic acid are exclusive to manuka nectar whereas lumichrome is unique to kanuka nectar. 3-Phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid are present in manuka and kanuka nectars. Leptosperin , lepteridine , 3-phenyllactic acid , and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid are chemically stable over prolonged storage , but not 2-methoxybenzoic acid and 2 '- methoxyacetophenone. Accordingly , leptosperin and lepteridine are definitive chemical markers for authentication of manuka honey. An optimal concentration cut-off was established for the floral source-specific markers: leptosperin ( 94mg/kg) , lepteridine ( 2.1 mg/kg) , 2 '- methoxyacetophenone ( 2.0 mg/kg) for manuka honey , and lumichrome ( 4.5 mg/kg) for kanuka honey. The use of leptosperin and lepteridine as fluorescence markers for manuka honey authentication is reinforced.
