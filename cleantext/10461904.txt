  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Oxidative stress is the most critical risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and Huntington 's disease ( HD). Numerous reports have demonstrated that oxidative stress aggravates cytotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons and accelerates the formation of protein inclusions<disease>. In addition , oxidative stress , such as 4-hydroxynonenal ( HNE) , oxidized protein , and dopamine quinone , are related to PD progression.
