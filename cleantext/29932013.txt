  Surfactant protein-A ( SP-A) belongs to a family of collagen-containing C-type lectins called collectins. SP-A is expressed by renal tubule epithelial cells. We investigated the distribution of SP-A in renal cell carcinomas ( RCC) using immunohistochemical techniques and western blotting. We used 35 formalin fixed , paraffin embedded ( FFPE) RCC tissue samples. We compared results with clinico-pathological parameters of RCC including age , sex , Fuhrman grade , tumor volume , tumor node metastasis ( TNM) and clinical stage. SP-A was localized in the glomerulus and renal tubule epithelium in nontumor tissue and strong SP-A immunoreactivity was observed in tumor tissue. SP-A was expressed in the RCC tumor cells ( 64 %) and nontumor cells ( 34 %) in males and RCC tumor cells ( 90 %) and nontumor cells ( 30 %) in females. There was a significant correlation between SP-A immunoreactivity in tumor cells and gender , age , tumor diameter , Fuhrman grade and tumor diameter. Western blot analysis supported the immunohistochemical findings. We present evidence for involvement of SP-A in RCC and suggest that increased SP-A expression in RCC is associated with favorable prognosis.
