  The psychological state of a person is characterised by cognitive and emotional variables which can be inferred by psychometric methods. Using the word lists from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count , designed to infer a range of psychological states from the word usage of a person , we studied temporal changes in the average expression of psychological traits in the general population. We sampled the contents of Twitter in the United Kingdom at hourly intervals for a period of four years , revealing a strong diurnal rhythm in most of the psychometric variables , and finding that two independent factors can explain 85 % of the variance across their 24-h profiles. The first has peak expression time starting at 5am/6am , it correlates with measures of analytical thinking , with the language of drive ( e.g power , and achievement) , and personal concerns. It is anticorrelated with the language of negative affect and social concerns. The second factor has peak expression time starting at 3am/4am , it correlates with the language of existential concerns , and anticorrelates with expression of positive emotions. Overall , we see strong evidence that our language changes dramatically between night and day , reflecting changes in our concerns and underlying cognitive and emotional processes. These shifts occur at times associated with major changes in neural activity and hormonal levels.
