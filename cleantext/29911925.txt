  Reticulophagy is the conserved macroautophagic/autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) in response to ER stress or general nutrient deprivation. Sequestration of the ER by phagophores plays an important role in regulating ER size and homeostasis. In their recent work , Smith et al. have discovered that the ER-localized protein CCPG1 is a novel mammalian reticulophagy receptor that interacts with core autophagy machinery components-LC3 , GABARAP and RB1CC1-and regulates reticulophagy.
