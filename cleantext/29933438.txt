  Coarctation of the aorta is known to present with hypertension in older patients; we reviewed our experience and assessed the outcome of hypertension following surgical correction. From April 2004 to date , 43 patients above the age of 12 underwent coarctation of the aorta repair. The mean age was 20.4 + 9.7 years ( maximum 56 years); 21 ( 48.8 %) were older than 18 years and 28 ( 65.1 %) were men. Thirty ( 69.8 %) patients had hypertension. Fourteen ( 32.6 %) had a bicuspid aortic valve; 11 ( 25.6 %) had patent ductus arteriosus; 6 ( 14 %) had myxomatous mitral valve; 4 ( 9.3 %) had ascending aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease>; and 2 ( 4.7 %) had descending aneurysms<disease>. Surgical correction included resection and interposition of a tube graft in 31 ( 72.1 %) , an end-to-end anastomosis in 6 ( 14 %) and patch aortoplasty in 3 ( 7 %). Three ( 7 %) patients required an extra-anatomical bypass: 1 had a long segment coarctation of the aorta , and 2 had a Bentall procedure with an ascending-to-descending aortic bypass. Staged procedures were done for concomitant disease in 4 ( 9.3 %). There was 1 death: a 56-year-old woman died of refractory ventricular fibrillation during surgery. Thirty ( 69.8 %) patients were discharged with antihypertensive medication. At a follow-up of 2.8 Â± 2.2 years ( maximum 9.2 years) , the number of hypertensive patients decreased ( 17/36; 47.2 %) ( P = 0.042). Univariable predictors for persistence of hypertension revealed the use of an interpositional tube graft for repair ( odds ratio 13.855 , confidence interval 0.000-0.001; P = 0.001) as an indicator , whereas there were no independent predictors for persistence of hypertension. Surgical intervention is warranted irrespective of age and helps correct and control hypertension better; however , significant numbers of patients still require antihypertensive medication and regular monitoring. Intervention using an interposition tube graft may affect the prevalence of hypertension.
