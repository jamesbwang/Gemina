  Incidental vascular lesions<symptom> are being discovered at an increasing frequency due to widespread noninvasive brain imaging studies. One of these lesions<symptom> has recently been termed a `` pure arterial malformation '' ( PAM) , which is defined as dilated , overlapping , and tortuous arteries forming a mass of arterial loops with a coil-like appearance in the absence of arteriovenous shunting. The pathogenesis of these lesions<symptom> is not known , but a congenital etiology is suspected. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old female who was found to have a PAM of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery with adipose tissue interspersed within the arterial loops. The authors believe that this abnormal intracranial association between blood vessel and adipose tissue lends further support to the theory that PAMs are the result of a congenital malformation and are therefore safe to manage conservatively given their presumed benign natural history. Far from offering conclusive evidence , this unique case report adds to the growing body of PAM literature and strengthens an increasingly supported congenital theory of genesis.
