  This work studies the expression differences of YKL-40 and TLR4 in nasal sinus mucosa of chronic sinusitis<disease> patients with and without nasal polyps and its clinical<disease> significances<disease>. Fifty chronic sinusitis<disease> patients with nasal polyps and 50 chronic sinusitis<disease> patients without , accepted by our hospital during February 2016-February 2017 , were included and taken as group A and group B , respectively. In addition , another 50 patients with nasal deviation were taken as group C ( control group). The ostiomeatal complex mucosa of group A and B and the inferior turbinate mucosa of group C were taken and the fluorescence quantitative PCR method was applied to detect the expression of YKL-40 , TLR4 and NF- κB of the mucosa and explore and influence of YKL-40 and TLR4 on NF-κB. There was a negative correlation between YKL-40 and TLR4 in group A , and the difference was statistically significant ( P less than 0.05) while there was no relationship between YKL-40 and TLR4 expression in group B. The level of YKL-40 protein in group A was higher than that in group B , which was statistically significant ( P less than 0.05). YKL-40 and TLR4 were positively correlated in group A while there was no correlation between YKL- 40 and TLR4 expression in group B. The expression of YKL-40 , TLR4 and NF-κB in chronic sinusitis<disease> patients with nasal polyps was high. In addition , there was a negative correlation between YKL-40 and TLR4 expression in chronic sinusitis<disease> patients with nasal polyps. YKL-40 and TLR4 interacted with each other to activate NF-κB and promote disease progression.
