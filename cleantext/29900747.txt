  We report the case of a male with no medical history with acute cholangitis secondary to a pancreatic head 's mass suggestive of neoplasm. An EUS-FNA was performed where no atypical cells were identified but a granulomatous component did. The patient was finally diagnosed of disseminated tuberculosis<disease> with pancreatic involvement. Pancreatic tuberculosis<disease> is an infrequent entity that requires a high index of suspicion due to the variability of its forms of presentation and the high morbidity and mortality without targeted therapy.
