  Do-it-yourself ( DIY) biology and medicine are based on various practices and logics: amateur and DIY practices , the ethics of hacking<symptom> and open source , the drive to domesticate molecular biology and genetics , the ideal of participation and citizen science. The article shows that this democratization is a process that is at once spatial ( construction of new spaces) , technical ( creative workarounds equipment) , social ( establishment of accessible networks/laboratories) and political. It is therefore through their practices , gestures and questions- tinkering , experimenting , working around , amaterializing , ethicizing , comparing , valuating , etc.- that we need to grasp DIY sciences.
