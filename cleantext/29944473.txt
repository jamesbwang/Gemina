  Testicular choriocarcinoma needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous metastases in young adult men because of its propensity for early hematogenous dissemination. Furthermore , the diagnosis may not be suspected in many cases in which there is clinically no testicular enlargement. This highly aggressive germ cell tumor typically metastasizes to the liver , lungs , and brain. Skin metastasis is exceedingly rare with only 22 cases previously reported in the world literature. We herein report 2 additional cases: a 25-year-old man and a 32-year-old man , both of whom were treated for mixed germ cell tumors and developed multiple cutaneous metastases to the head.
