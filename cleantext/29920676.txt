  Neuritin is a neurotrophic factor that is activated by neural activity and neurotrophins. Its major function is to promote neurite growth and branching; however , the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To address this issue , the present study investigated the effects of neuritin on neurite and spine growth and intracellular Ca
