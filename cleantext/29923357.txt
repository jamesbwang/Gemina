  A wide variety of natural products have powerful chemopreventive effects due to their antioxidant , antimutagenic , and anti-inflammatory activities that enable them to arrest cell proliferation in several cancer models. In the present study , we shed light on the protective mechanism of Nigella sativa extract against diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)- induced preneoplastic stage of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) in rats. We studied the extract effect on EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling pathway as one of the major signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation during hepatocarcinogenesis as well as the investigation of its antioxidant activity. The study also compared the effects of NSEE to those of ( thymoquinone) TQ and silymarin as hepatoprotective substances. Rats received daily doses of NSEE ( 150 , 250 , 350 mg/kg BW) , a dose per three alternative days/week of TQ ( 20 mg/kg BW) and a daily dose of silymarin ( 100 mg/kg BW). The doses were administered orally by gavage for 12 days before DENA and CCl
