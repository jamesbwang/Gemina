  Nicotine is a major toxic alkaloid in wastes generated from tobacco production and cigarette manufacturing. In the present work , a nicotine-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from tobacco powdery waste. The isolate was identified as Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. S-1 based on morphology , physiology , and 16S rRNA gene sequence. Suitable conditions of isolate S-1 for nicotine degradation were pH 7.0 and 30 Â°C. Catabolic intermediates of nicotine were isolated with preparative-HPLC and characterized with LC-HRMS and NMR. The catabolic pathways of nicotine were involved in dehydrogenation , oxidation , hydrolysis , and hydroxylation. Interestingly , nicotine catabolism in strain S-1 undergoes a new pyrrolidine pathway that differs from the other three catabolic pathways in bacterial species. This work sheds light on catabolic diversity of nicotine and heteroaromatics.
