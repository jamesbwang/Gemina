  Increasing evidence suggests that SET functions as an oncoprotein and promotes cancer survival and therapeutic resistance. However , whether SET affects radiotherapy ( RT)- mediated anti-cancer effects has not yet been explored. Here , we investigated the impact of SET on RT sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). Using colony and hepatosphere formation assay , we found that RT-induced proliferative inhibition was critically associated with SET expression. Next , we tested a novel SET antagonist , EMQA , in combination with RT.. We showed that additive use of EMQA significantly enhanced the effects of RT against HCC in vitro and in vivo. Notably , compared to mice receiving either RT or EMQA alone , the growth of PLC5 xenografted tumor in mice receiving RT plus EMQA was significantly reduced without compromising treatment tolerability. Furthermore , we proved that antagonizing SET to restore PP2A-mediated p-AKT downregulation was responsible for the synergism between EMQA and RT.. Our data demonstrate a new oncogenic property of SET , and provide preclinical evidence that combining a SET antagonist and RT may be effective for treatment of HCC. Further investigation is warranted to validate the clinical relevance of this approach.
