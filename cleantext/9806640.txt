  The marginal zone ( MZ) is largely composed of a unique subpopulation of B cells , the so-called MZ-B cells. At a molecular level , memory B cells are characterized by the presence of somatically mutated IGV genes. The earliest studies in the rat have documented the presence of hapten-specific MZ-B cells after immunization in the MZ. This work later received experimental support demonstrating that the IGHV-CÂµ transcripts expressed by phenotypically defined splenic MZ-B cells ( defined as CD90
