  Antiplatelets have been used for decades to prevent atherothrombotic disease , but there is limited ` real-life ' prescribing data. We hereby report the prescribing patterns for oral antiplatelets in Wales , UK. Retrospective analysis of anonymized data in Wales from 2005 to 2016 revealed differences in prescribing patterns of oral antiplatelets. Aspirin and dipyridamole use declined with a corresponding increase in clopidogrel prescription. Costs declined with a sharp decrease coinciding with clopidogrel coming off patent. Prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown significant cost contribution ( 29 % of total) despite only forming 1 % of total items prescribed in 2016. This first-look analysis of real-life antiplatelet data demonstrates a decrease in the overall prescribing costs with varying patterns. This may aid policy-makers in reviewing funding strategies.
