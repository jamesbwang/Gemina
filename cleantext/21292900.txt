  Climatic and weather factors become important determinants of vector-borne diseases transmission like malaria<disease> This study aimed to prove relationships between weather factors with considering human migration and previous case findings and malaria<disease> cases in endemic areas in Purworejo during 2005-2014. This study employed ecological time series analysis by using monthly data. The independent variables were the maximum temperature , minimum temperature , maximum humidity , minimum humidity , precipitation , human migration , and previous malaria<disease> cases , while the dependent variable was positive malaria<disease> cases. Three models of count data regression analysis i.e. Poisson model , quasi-Poisson model , and negative binomial model were applied to measure the relationship. The least Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC) value was also performed to find the best model. Negative binomial regression analysis was considered as the best model. The model showed that humidity ( lag 2) , precipitation ( lag 3) , precipitation ( lag 12) , migration ( lag1) and previous malaria<disease> cases ( lag 12) had a significant relationship with malaria<disease> cases. Weather , migration and previous malaria<disease> cases factors need to be considered as prominent indicators for the increase of malaria<disease> case projection.
