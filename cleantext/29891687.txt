  Adipose tissue macrophages ( ATMs) adapt their metabolic phenotype either to maintain lean tissue homeostasis or drive inflammation<symptom> and insulin resistance in obesity. However , the factors in the adipose tissue microenvironment that control ATM phenotypic polarization and bioenergetics remain unknown. We have recently shown that oxidized phospholipids ( OxPL) uniquely regulate gene expression and cellular metabolism in
