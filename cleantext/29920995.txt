  Adjustable structure , excellent physiochemical properties , and good biocompatibility render polyoxometalates ( POMs) as a suitable drug agent for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). However , previous works using POMs against AD just focus on the inhibition of amyloid-β ( Aβ) monomer aggregation. In consideration that both Aβ fibrils and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are closely associated with clinical development of AD symptoms , it would be more effective if POMs can disaggregate Aβ fibrils and eliminate ROS as well. Herein , a redox-activated near-infrared ( NIR) responsive POMs-based nanoplaform ( rPOMs@MSNs @copolymer) is developed with high photothermal effect and antioxidant activity. The rPOMs@MSNs @copolymer can generate local hyperthermia<symptom> to disaggregate Aβ fibrils under NIR laser irradiation because of POMs ( rPOMs) with strong NIR absorption. Furthermore , Aβ-induced ROS can be scavenged by the antioxidant activity of rPOMs. To the authors ' knowledge , there is no report of using rPOMs for NIR photothermal treatment of AD. This work may promote the development of multifunctional inorganic agents for biomedical applications.
