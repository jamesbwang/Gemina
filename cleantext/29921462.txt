  Adverse outcomes for hospitalized patients with sarcopenia are well documented , and identification of patients at risk remains challenging. The sarcopenia index ( SI) , previously defined as ( serum creatinine/serum cystatin C) × 100 , could be an inexpensive , readily accessible , objective tool to predict muscle mass and risk for adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the SI as a predictor of muscle mass. Retrospective study of critically ill adults admitted to Mayo Clinic from 2012 to 2015 with suspected sepsis<disease> and an available creatinine and serum cystatin C. Muscle surface area was quantified at the L3/4 vertebral level in patients with an abdominal CT scan ( CTMSA). Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess the relationship between SI and CTMSA , as well as short-term clinical outcomes. The 171 included had a mean weight and body mass index ( BMI) of 75.2 ± 16.4 kg and 26.0 ± 4.6 kg/m The SI , a simple calculation from kidney function markers , is a significant predictor of muscle mass in this validation cohort of ICU patients. A low SI was associated with longer hospital length of stay and frailty. Future studies could explore whether the use of SI assists with identifying patients likely to benefit from pharmacotherapy- , nutrition- , or physical therapy-based interventions.
