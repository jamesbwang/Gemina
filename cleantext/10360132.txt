  This manuscript summarizes the literature on mental health outcomes after cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest show high rates of mental illness with more than 40 % suffering from anxiety<symptom> , 30 % from depression<symptom> , and 25 % from posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). Mental health outcomes may differ depending on the setting in which the cardiac arrest occurred. A major problem is reduced neuropsychological functioning. Between 30 % and 50 % of survivors of cardiac arrest suffer from cognitive deficits. Deficits of attention , declarative memory , executive function , visual-spatial abilities , and verbal fluency have been observed. As a result of numerous psychopathological symptoms ( depression<symptom> in 14 % to 45 % , anxiety<symptom> in 13 % to 61 % , and PTSD in 19 % to 27 %) and reduced cognitive functioning ( about 20 % to 60 %) , relevantly reduced quality of life is observed in about 20 % of cardiac arrest survivors.
