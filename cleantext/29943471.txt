  This study aimed to investigate the miR-126 expression in lesional skin and its correlation with clinical features in psoriasis patients and to explore the effect of upregulated miR-126 on cells ' proliferation , apoptosis , and inflammation<symptom> in human keratinocytes. A total of 102 psoriasis patients were consecutively enrolled in this study. MiR-126 expressions in lesional skin and paired nonlesional skin were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR). Human keratinocytes ( HaCaT cells) were transfected with miR-126 mimic plasmids and blank mimic plasmid. Cell Counting Kit-8 and annexin V/propidium iodide assays were performed to assess the cells ' proliferation and apoptosis , and protein levels of apoptotic markers ( cleaved caspase-3 ( C-caspase-3) and B-cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2)) were detected by Western blot assay. Inflammatory cytokines mRNA and protein levels were detected by qPCR and Western blot assays , respectively. MiR-126 expression was upregulated in lesional skin tissue compared with paired nonlesional skin tissue , and its expression positively associated with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score in psoriasis patients. MiR-126 expression was increased in miR-126 mimic group compared with negative control ( NC) mimic group after plasmids transfection into HaCaT cells , and cells ' proliferation was enhanced while cells ' apoptosis rate was reduced in miR-126 mimic group than NC mimic group. Protein expressions of C-caspase and Bcl-2 also indicated miR-126 mimic decreased the cells ' apoptosis. In addition , miR-126 mimic increased TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-17A , and IL-22 expressions while decreased IL-10 expression. In conclusion , miR-126 correlates with elevated risk and increased disease severity in psoriasis patients , and upregulation of miR-126 promotes cells ' proliferation and inflammation<symptom> while inhibits cells ' apoptosis in keratinocytes.
