  One of the requirements for the implementation of Health Promoting Hospitals ( HPHs) is comprehensive integration of health promotion ( HP) activities and programs in hospital quality management system. Therefore , this systematic review was conducted utilizing a comprehensive European Foundation for Quality Managment ( EFQM) model to determine appropriate criteria for the implementation and development of HPH. This systematic review considered the published literature on factors affecting the implementation and development of HPH during 1997-2016. Twenty-three articles were finalized for further investigation. EFQM was used as guidance for the investigation and analysis of studies conducted in relation to HPH. Regarding our results , real need analysis and accurate assessment of needs , attention to infrastructure factors , HPH standardization , promotion of self-care , knowledge enhancement and patient and staff skills training , improvement of quality indicators , continuous participation of HPH committee , designing HP interventions , paying attention to clinical outcome , equity in health , promoting a healthy work environment , continuity and cooperation etc. are among the factors contributing to HPH implementation and development. In case of having high capacity for successful HPH implementation , comprehensive HPH capacity building and resource development are not possible unless they are performed based on one of the framework emphasized by World Health Organization ( WHO) such as EFQM.
