  A regulated immune system employs multiple cell types , diverse variety of cytokines and interacting signalling networks against infections. Systems biology offers a promising solution to model and simulate such large populations of interacting components of immune systems holistically. This study focuses on the distinct components of the adaptive immune system and analysis , both individually and in association with HCV infection. The effective and failed adaptive immune response models have been developed followed by interventions/perturbations of various treatment strategies to get better assessment of the treatment responses under varying stimuli. Based on the model predictions , the NK cells , T regulatory cells , IL-10 , IL-21 , IL-12 , IL-2 entities are found to be the most critical determinants of treatment response. The proposed potential immunomodulatory therapeutic interventions include IL-21 treatment , blocking of inhibitory receptors on T-cells and exogenous anti-IL-10 antibody treatment. The relative results showed that these interventions have differential effect on the expression levels of cellular and cytokines entities of the immune response. Notably , IL-21 enhances the expression of NK cells , Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4 + T cells and hence restore the host immune potential. The models presented here provide a starting point for cost-effective analysis and more comprehensive modeling of biological phenomenon.
