  Aortocaval fistulas<disease> ( ACFs) are rare with varied etiologies. Symptoms can be acute or delayed with predominant manifestations being high output cardiac failure. Acute coronary syndrome<disease> due to ACF has not been widely reported. We present a case of a 68-year-old male who presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome<disease>. This was confirmed by electrocardiogram changes and a rise in cardiac enzymes. A large abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> was diagnosed initially by imaging without evidence of leak or rupture. A coronary angiogram showed only mild diffuse disease. On further reviewing , the computerized tomography imaging revealed an ACF. This was subsequently repaired with rapid improvement in his condition. Acute coronary syndrome<disease> is an unusual presentation of ACF with inadequately understood pathophysiological mechanisms. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management of this fistula<disease> are paramount to reduce mortality and morbidity.
