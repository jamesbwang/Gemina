  To evaluate the geometric distortion of tilting of mandibular third molars with respect to second molars on panoramic reconstruction. Cone-beam CT ( CBCT) reconstructions of 160 third molars , obtained due to an indication of risk of inferior alveolar nerve damage during surgery , were used. CBCT-reconstructed panoramic images were used as bi-dimensional ( 2D) images , to avoid distortions other than geometric distortions. The angle between the second and the third molar was measured in 2D and three-dimensional ( 3D) images. Student 's t-test was used to assess the null-hypothesis of no difference between 2D and 3D measurements. A significant mean difference ( -2.3 ° ± 6.3 °) between 2D and 3D measurements was found , with an absolute error of 3.6 ° ± 5.7 ° and a relative error of 10 %. These findings comprehensively explain the geometric distortion on panoramic radiographs. Although a widely used and undoubtedly useful tool for diagnosis and surgical planning of mandibular third molar extractions , panoramic reconstruction are biased from geometric distortion that may influence surgical planning.
