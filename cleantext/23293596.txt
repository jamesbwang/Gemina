  We present an open-source Python package to compute information-theoretical quantities for electroencephalographic data. Electroencephalography ( EEG) measures the electrical potential generated by the cerebral cortex and the set of spatial patterns projected by the brain 's electrical potential on the scalp surface can be clustered into a set of representative maps called EEG microstates. Microstate time series are obtained by competitively fitting the microstate maps back into the EEG data set , i.e. , by substituting the EEG data at a given time with the label of the microstate that has the highest similarity with the actual EEG topography. As microstate sequences consist of non-metric random variables , e.g. , the letters A-D , we recently introduced information-theoretical measures to quantify these time series. In wakeful resting state EEG recordings , we found new characteristics of microstate sequences such as periodicities related to EEG frequency bands. The algorithms used are here provided as an open-source package and their use is explained in a tutorial style. The package is self-contained and the programming style is procedural , focusing on code intelligibility and easy portability. Using a sample EEG file , we demonstrate how to perform EEG microstate segmentation using the modified K-means approach , and how to compute and visualize the recently introduced information-theoretical tests and quantities. The time-lagged mutual information function is derived as a discrete symbolic alternative to the autocorrelation function for metric time series and confidence intervals are computed from Markov chain surrogate data. The software package provides an open-source extension to the existing implementations of the microstate transform and is specifically designed to analyze resting state EEG recordings.
