  A target international normalized ratio ( INR) of 2-3 has been recommended for patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and risk factors for thromboembolism. This recommendation is largely based on evidence from observational studies a decade ago. This study utilized collective data from modern trials with warfarin controls to examine the relationship of warfarin anticoagulation , as assessed by INR , on the clinical outcome events of interest. Data on warfarin-treated patients from three clinical studies supporting the approval of dabigatran ( Pradaxa) , apixaban ( Eliquis) , and edoxaban ( Savaysa) were pooled. Ischemic stroke , intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) , and all-cause death were selected as the outcome events of interest. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to examine the association between time-dependent INR and each outcome event. Benefit-risk assessment was evaluated by summing the estimated annual event rate for ischemic stroke and ICH. A total of 21,883 patients representing 322 ischemic strokes , 288 ICHs , and 657 all-cause deaths were included in the analysis. The models used suggest that the risk of ischemic stroke is greatly reduced when INR exceeds 2; in contrast , the risk of ICH increases monotonically as INR increases. When combining ischemic stroke and ICH events , the lowest estimated annual event rate was observed between INR of 2 and 2.5; the risk only slightly increased between INR of 1.8 and 3.0. Similarly , a U-shaped relationship between INR and the risk of all-cause death was found. This study using collective warfarin data from recent large prospective trials indicates that INR between 2 and 2.5 provides the best balance<symptom> between ischemic stroke and ICH , as well as optimal protection against death in patients with AF.
