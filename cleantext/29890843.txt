  Background Mouse models of human-malignant-melanoma ( MM) are important tools to study tumor dynamics. The enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP) is widely used in molecular imaging approaches , together with optical scanners , and fluorescence imaging. Purpose Currently , there are no data available as to whether other fluorescent proteins are more suitable. The goal of this preclinical study was to analyze two fluorescent proteins of the GFP superfamily under real-time in vivo conditions using fluorescence reflectance imaging ( FRI). Material and Methods The human melanoma cell line MeWo was stable transfected with one plasmid: pEGFP-C1 or pDsRed1-N1. We investigated two severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID)- mice groups: A ( solid xenografts) and B ( xenografts as metastases). After three weeks , the animals were weekly imaged by FRI.. Afterwards the mice were euthanized and metastases were imaged in situ: to quantify the cutis-dependent reduction of emitted light , we compared signal intensities obtained by metastases in vivo with signal intensities obtained by in situ liver parenchyma preparations. Results More than 90 % of cells were stable transfected. EGFP-/ DsRed-xenograft tumors had identical growth kinetics. In vivo the emitted light by DsRed tumors/metastases was much brighter than by EGFP. DsRed metastases were earlier ( 3 vs. 5 weeks) and much more sensitive detectable than EGFP metastases. Cutis-dependent reduction of emitted light was greater in EGFP than in DsRed mice ( tenfold). Autofluorescence of DsRed was lower than of EGFP. Conclusion We established an in vivo xenograft mouse model ( DsRed-MeWo) that is reliable , reproducible , and superior to the EGFP model as a preclinical tool to study innovative therapies by FRI under real-time in vivo conditions.
