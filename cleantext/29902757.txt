  Bovine serum albumin ( BSA) represents the well recognized model protein for investigations of diverse intermolecular reactions in studies on pharmacological activities of modern drugs. In the present work , the interaction between copper ibuprofenate ( ( Cu2 ( IBU) 4)) and BSA under simulative physiological conditions was investigated by the using of diverse spectral methods including fluorescence , UV-vis absorption , CD spectroscopy and also molecular docking. The obtained results showed that there was a strong fluorescence quenching of BSA by ( Cu2 ( IBU) 4) ( 2.964 E +4 M
