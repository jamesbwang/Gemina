  Tumor-induced immunosuppression is mediated through various mechanisms including engagement of immune checkpoint receptors on effector cells , function of immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells , and deployment of immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGFÎ² and IL10. IL23 is a cytokine that negatively affects antitumor immunity. In this study , we investigated whether IL23-deficient ( IL23p19
