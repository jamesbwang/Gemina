  Reading problems are common in children with ADHD and show strong covariation with these children 's underdeveloped working memory abilities. In contrast , working memory training does not appear to improve reading performance for children with ADHD or neurotypical children. The current study bridges the gap between these conflicting findings , and combines dual-task methodology with Bayesian modeling to examine the role of working memory for explaining ADHD-related reading problems. Children ages 8-13 ( M = 10.50 , SD = 1.59) with and without ADHD ( N = 78; 29 girls; 63 % Caucasian/Non-Hispanic) completed a counterbalanced series of reading tasks that systematically manipulated concurrent working memory demands. Adding working memory demands produced disproportionate decrements in reading comprehension for children with ADHD ( d = -0.67) relative to Non-ADHD children ( d = -0.18); comprehension was significantly reduced in both groups when working memory demands were increased. These effects were robust to controls for foundational reading skills ( decoding , sight word vocabulary) and comorbid reading disability. Concurrent working memory demands did not slow reading speed for either group. The ADHD group showed lower comprehension ( d = 1.02) and speed ( d = 0.69) even before adding working memory demands beyond those inherently required for reading. Exploratory conditional effects analyses indicated that underdeveloped working memory overlapped with 41 % ( comprehension) and 85 % ( speed) of these between-group differences. Reading problems in ADHD appear attributable , at least in part , to their underdeveloped working memory abilities. Combined with prior cross-sectional and longitudinal findings , the current experimental evidence positions working memory as a potential causal mechanism that is necessary but not sufficient for effectively understanding written language.
