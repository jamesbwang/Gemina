  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) is an acute inflammatory and thrombotic disease due to coronary artery atherosclerotic lesions<symptom>. Studies have established the correlation of serum sulfatides with inflammation<symptom> , thrombogenesis , and atherosclerosis. We observed that serum sulfatides level significantly increased in STEMI patients. In this study , we try to identify the relationship of serum sulfatides level on clinical outcomes of patients in STEMI. Serum sulfatides level was monitored in 370 inpatients within 24 h of STEMI onset. On the basis of the level of serum sulfatides that was below 10 µmol/L in the normal population , the patients were divided into two groups with the median value of 15.2 µmol/L; low sulfatide group ( serum sulfatides level ≤ 15.2 µmol/L ( n = 200)) and high sulfatide group ( serum sulfatides level ＞ 15.2 µmol/L ( n = 170)). Patients ' baseline characteristics , in-hospital outcomes , and late major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE) were analyzed. Independent incident for in-hospital death and late adverse events were modeled by multivariate logistic and Cox regression analysis. Between the two groups , there were no differences in the angiographic characteristics , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) results , and in-hospital recovery. However , high serum sulfatides level is positively correlated with increased rate of in-hospital death ( OR 0.971; 95 % CI 0.926-0.990 , p = 0.019). In addition , this group of patients has more cumulative incidences of target vessel revascularization ( TVR) ( 23 % vs. 8 % , p ＜ 0.05) and increased overall MACE ( 28 % vs. 10 % , p ＜ 0.05). Cox regression analysis indicated that high serum sulfatides level contributes to TVR and overall MACE. Elevated serum sulfatides level positively correlate with in-hospital death and complications ( TVR and MACE) in STEMI patients.
