  In this paper , the morphology evolution in a Bi ‚Åª Sb system under the centrifugal force at room temperature is discussed. The rotation speed was 35,000 rotations per minute and the length of the arm ( radii) was 88 mm. It is shown , that after the centrifugation the phases become oriented in the direction parallel to the direction of the centrifugal force. Moreover , the voids move in the direction opposite to the centrifugal force direction. The movements of such voids result in their coalescence and finally lead to formation of cracks at the interface between ordered and disordered part of the sample.
