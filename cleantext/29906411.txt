  Skin homeostasis relies on fine tuning of epidermis/dermis interactions and is affected by aging. While extracellular matrix ( ECM) proteins , such as integrins , are involved in aging , the molecular basis of the skin<symptom> changes<symptom> need to be further investigated. Here , we showed that integrin co-receptor , SLC3A2 , required for cell proliferation , is expressed at the surface of resting dermal fibroblasts ( DF) in young patients , and drastically reduced with aging. In vivo SLC3A2 DF deletion induced major skin phenotypes resembling premature aging. KO mice ( 3-month-old) presented strong defect in skin elasticity , due to altered ECM assembly , impairing epidermal homeostasis. SLC3A2 DF loss led to an age-associated secretome profile with 77 % of identified proteins belonging to ECM and ECM-associated proteins. Not only ECM contributes to skin mechanical properties , but it is also a reservoir of growth factors and bioactive molecules. We demonstrate that DF SLC3A2 is required for ECM to fully exert its structural and reservoir role allowing proper and efficient TGF-Î² localization and activation. Thus , we identified SLC3A2 as a protective controller of dermal ECM stiffness and quality , required to maintain the epidermis/dermis interface functional and dynamic.
