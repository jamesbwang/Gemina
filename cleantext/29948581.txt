  This study is focused on the identification of thiazole-based inhibitors for the ( Formula: see text)- glucosidase enzyme. For that purpose , ( E) -2- ( 2- ( arylmethylene) hydrazinyl) -4-arylthiazole derivatives were synthesized in two steps and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. All derivatives and intermediates were evaluated for their in vitro ( Formula: see text)- glucosidase inhibitory activity. Thiosemicarbazones 20 and 35 , and cyclized thiazole derivatives 2 , 5-11 , 13 , 15 , 21-24 , 27-31 , and 36-37 showed significant inhibitory potential in the range of ( Formula: see text)- ( Formula: see text) as compared to standard acarbose ( ( Formula: see text)). A molecular modeling study was carried out to understand the binding interactions of compounds with the active site of enzyme.
