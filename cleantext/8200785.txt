  Cluster headache<symptom> ( CH) is a clinically well-defined primary headache<symptom> disorder , approximately 20 % of cluster headache<symptom> sufferers experience recurrent attacks without periods of significant remission. For the treatment of chronic cluster headache<symptom> ( CCH) only limited therapeutic options are available. A potential refractory CCH patient group was identified according to the clinical definition of rCCH based on the consensus statement of the European Headache Federation ( EHF). Treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA ( BoNT-A; Botox ® , 150 Allergan IU) was done according to the PREEMPT study protocol. A standardized headache<symptom> diary was used for recording frequency , duration of attacks and pain intensity. To assess personal burden the HIT-6 and the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> scale was used. Primary outcome measure was a > 50 % reduction in headache<symptom> minutes. Seventeen male patients suffering from rCCH , aged 32 ± 11 ( mean ± SD) years , presenting a mean disease duration of 6.6 years completed the study of 28 weeks. The cut-off point of > 50 % reduction in headache<symptom> minutes as positive result was reached in 58.8 % , 29.4 % experienced an improvement of 30-50 %. Mean frequency of headache<symptom> days dropped from 28.2 to 11.8 days at week 24 ( p = 0.0001; 95 % CI -21.33 to- 11.61 ;-RRB-. Intensity of remaining attacks was also reduced significantly. Headache<symptom> disability scores showed a trend to improvement after BoNT-A. Encouraging results for the treatment with BoNT-A in rCCH patients were observed in our study population.
