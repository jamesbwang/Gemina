  To develop a radiomics signature based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to estimate disease-free survival ( DFS) in patients with invasive breast cancer and to establish a radiomics nomogram that incorporates the radiomics signature and MRI and clinicopathological findings. We identified 294 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI. Patients were randomly divided into training ( n = 194) and validation ( n = 100) sets. A radiomics signature ( Rad-score) was generated using an elastic net in the training set , and the cutoff point of the radiomics signature to divide the patients into high- and low-risk groups was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association of the radiomics signature , MRI findings , and clinicopathological variables with DFS. A radiomics nomogram combining the Rad-score and MRI and clinicopathological findings was constructed to validate the radiomic signatures for individualized DFS estimation. Higher Rad-scores were significantly associated with worse DFS in both the training and validation sets ( The radiomics signature is an independent biomarker for the estimation of DFS in patients with invasive breast cancer. Combining the radiomics nomogram improved individualized DFS estimation.
