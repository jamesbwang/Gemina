  Selectively exchanging metal complexes between emulsified water-poor microemulsions and concentrated solutions of mixed electrolytes is the core technology for strategic metal recycling. Nanostructuration triggered by solutes present in the organic phase is understood , but little is known about fluctuations of the microemulsion-water interface. We use here a modified version of an optoelectric device initially designed for air bubbles , in order to evidence resonant electrically induced surface waves of an oily droplet suspended in an aqueous phase. Resonant waves of nanometer amplitude of a millimeter-sized microemulsion droplet containing a common ion-specific extractant diluted by dodecane and suspended in a solution of rare earth nitrate are evidenced for the first time with low excitation fields ( 5 V/cm). From variation of the surface wave spectrum with rare earth concentration , we evidence uptake of rare-earth ions at the interface and at higher concentration the formation of a thin `` crust '' of liquid crystal forming at unusually low concentration , indicative of a surface induced phase transition. The effect of the liquid crystal structure on the resonance spectrum is backed up by a model , which is used to estimate crust thickness.
