  Photodynamic therapy is used to treat a variety of cancers and skin diseases by inducing apoptosis , necrosis<symptom> , immune system activation , and/or vascular damage. Here , we describe the effects of a single photodynamic therapy session using methylene blue on a mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma and normal skin. The photodynamic therapy protocol comprised application of a 1 % methylene blue solution , followed by irradiation with a diode laser for 15 min at 74 mW/cm In the squamous cell carcinoma group , photodynamic therapy reduced tumor size and cell proliferation and raised cytokine levels. In normal skin , it decreased cell proliferation and collagen quantity and increased apoptosis and blood vessel numbers. The effects of photodynamic therapy were greater on normal skin than squamous cell carcinoma tissues. The reduced epithelial thickness and keratinization of the former are factors that contribute to the efficacy of this treatment. Adjustments to the treatment protocol are necessary to potentiate the effects for squamous cell carcinoma therapy.
