  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is the most prevalent rheumatic disease in the world. Although its etiology is still unknown , one of the key processes in OA progression and development is oxidative stress. In this context , resveratrol , a well-known anti-oxidant from the stilbene family , could be of particular interest in future OA therapeutic strategies. However , currently , because of its low bioavailability , use of resveratrol in human health is very limited. In this study , we tested two resveratrol self-emulsifying systems previously developed in our laboratory in order to determine if they could improve cellular uptake of resveratrol in a human immortalized chondrocytic cell line ( T/C28a2) and enhance protection against oxidative stress. Our results showed that resveratrol self-emulsifying systems were able first to increase cellular tolerance towards resveratrol , and thus decrease resveratrol intrinsic cellular toxicity , allowing the use of higher concentrations , second , to increase resveratrol uptake in membrane and intracellular fractions , and finally , to improve protection against oxidative stress-mediated death in human immortalized chondrocytic cell line T/C28a2. These data suggest that new formulations of resveratrol could be considered as potential beneficial effectors in future OA treatments.
