  Global change effects on biodiversity and human wellbeing call for improved long-term environmental data as a basis for science , policy and decision making , including increased interoperability , multifunctionality , and harmonization. Based on the example of two global initiatives , the International Long-Term Ecological Research ( ILTER) network and the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network ( GEO BON) , we propose merging the frameworks behind these initiatives , namely ecosystem integrity and essential biodiversity variables , to serve as an improved guideline for future site-based long-term research and monitoring in terrestrial , freshwater and coastal ecosystems. We derive a list of specific recommendations of what and how to measure at a monitoring site and call for an integration of sites into co-located site networks across individual monitoring initiatives , and centered on ecosystems. This facilitates the generation of linked comprehensive ecosystem monitoring data , supports synergies in the use of costly infrastructures , fosters cross-initiative research and provides a template for collaboration beyond the ILTER and GEO BON communities.
