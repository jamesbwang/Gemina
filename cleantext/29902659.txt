  We aim to investigate the significance of microvascular ultrasonography in breast ductal lesions<symptom> for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions<symptom>. Sixty-two ductal lesions<symptom> were evaluated with gray-scale and three Doppler techniques before biopsy , Superb Microvascular Imaging ( SMI) , color Doppler ( CDI) , and power Doppler imaging ( PDI). We evaluated number , distribution , and morphology of vessels. The area under the ROC curve of combined use of Doppler imaging was greater than that of gray-scale only and SMI had higher value than CDI and PDI ( p < 0.05). Microvascular ultrasonography improves diagnostic performance that distinguishes benign from malignant breast ductal lesions<symptom> , and SMI is superior to CDI and PDI.
