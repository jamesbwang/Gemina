  Humans and non-human animals can approximate large visual quantities without counting. The approximate number representations underlying this ability are noisy , with the amount of noise proportional to the quantity being represented. Numerate humans also have access to a separate system for representing exact quantities using number symbols and words; it is this second , exact system that supports most of formal mathematics. Although numerical approximation abilities and symbolic number abilities are distinct in representational format and in their phylogenetic and ontogenetic histories , they appear to be linked throughout development-- individuals who can more precisely discriminate quantities without counting are better at math. The origins of this relationship are debated. On the one hand , symbolic number abilities may be directly linked to , perhaps even rooted in , numerical approximation abilities. On the other hand , the relationship between the two systems may simply reflect their independent relationships with visual abilities. To test this possibility , we asked whether approximate number and symbolic math abilities are linked in congenitally blind individuals who have never experienced visual sets or used visual strategies to learn math. Congenitally blind and blind-folded sighted participants completed an auditory numerical approximation task , as well as a symbolic arithmetic task and non-math control tasks. We found that the precision of approximate number representations was identical across congenitally blind and sighted groups , suggesting that the development of the Approximate Number System ( ANS) does not depend on visual experience. Crucially , the relationship between numerical approximation and symbolic math abilities is preserved in congenitally blind individuals. These data support the idea that the Approximate Number System and symbolic number abilities are intrinsically linked , rather than indirectly linked through visual abilities.
