  Acute kidney inschemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury is characterized by an abrupt loss of kidney function , resulting in the retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products and in the dysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolytes. Despite the advances in therapeutic techniques , the mortality and morbidity of patients remain high and have not appreciably improved. This study aims to evaluate the potential protective effect of TAK-242 on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury using an animal model. Thirty-five adult male Sprague-dawely rats ( weighing 200-300) , were assigned randomly into the following experimental groups ( n = 7 in each group) , Control ( I/R) , Sham ( negative control) , TAK-242 ( 5 mg/kg body<symptom> weight) , TAK-242 ( 10 mg/kg body<symptom> weight) and Vehicle ( DMSO). Rats were exposed to a 30 min of ischemia then 3 h of reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion phase , rats were sacrificed then plasma , serum and tissue samples were obtained to measure markers of kidney oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom>. Plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL) , and tissue levels of interleukin-18 ( IL-18) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) were significantly lower in TAK-242 pretreated groups than the vehicle group and the control group ( p < 0.05). Furthermore; serum levels of urea and creatinine were significantly lower in the TAK-242 pretreated groups as compared to the control group ( p < 0.05). We conclude that administration of TAK-242 can be useful preventive method in attenuating the degree of acute kidney injury during ischemic reperfusion process as shown by a significant reduction of urinary inflammatory markers as well as significant reduction of urea and creatinine levels.
