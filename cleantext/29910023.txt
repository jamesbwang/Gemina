  To compare the 24 month visual , refractive , topographic and aberrometric results of the accelerated and standard corneal collagen cross-linking ( CXL) in pediatric keratoconus patients. 87 eyes of 64 consecutive keratoconus patients under 18 years old with 24 month follow-up period following standard or accelerated CXL were included. 38 eyes received standard CXL ( 3 Mw/cm The difference between baseline and 24 months postoperative UCVA , BCVA , SimK ( keratometry) -1 , SimK-2 , Kmax , and the corneal aberrations were not significantly different between the two groups ( p > 0.05 for all). The mean reduction in thinnest corneal pachymetry from baseline to 24 months after CXL was higher in accelerated CXL group ( p = 0.007). The progression rate was 13.1 % in standard and 16.3 % in accelerated group ( p = 0.754). There were no differences in the grade of corneal haze between the two groups ( p = 0.249). No complications were observed in the both groups. The 24 month results of accelerated and standard CXL revealed that , the efficacy and safety of accelerated CXL were the same with standard CXL in pediatric keratoconus patients. As being a rapid procedure , accelerated CXL appears to be more benefical for pediatric patients.
