  International and national organizations responsible for healthy food production and food consumers have too often neglected farmers , who are the producers in this cycle and are directly involved in environmental issues , integrating resources with their skills and producing agricultural crops to offer to civil society. Moreover , the health of farmers has also been neglected , when attending to their health would likely ensure a healthy environment and safe foods. Thus , the Farmer First Health Paradigm is seeking to address the fact that if international community expects a healthy environment and safe foods for future generations , then basic principles for producing healthy food in different countries should be considered and applied in their strategic plans. These principles are presented and discussed in this paper.
