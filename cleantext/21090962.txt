  Early life adversity is considered a risk factor for the development of gastrointestinal diseases , including inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesized that early life colonic inflammation<symptom> causes susceptibility to aggravated overexpression of interleukin ( IL) 1β. We developed a 2-hit rat model in which neonatal inflammation<symptom> ( NI) and adult inflammation<symptom> ( AI) were induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Aggravated immune responses were observed in NI + AI rats , including a sustained up-regulation of IL1β and other cytokines. In parallel with exacerbated loss of inhibitor of kappa B alpha expression , NI + AI rats showed hyperacetylation of histone H4K12 and increased V-Rel Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A binding on the NI sensitizes the colon epithelium for exacerbated IL1β activation by increasing stress hormones that induce histone hyperacetylation , allowing greater access of nuclear factor-κB to the
