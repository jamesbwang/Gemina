  Present study aimed to systematically review and quantitatively synthesize published data about the prevalence of Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) infection among high risk groups in Iran. Determining true burden of Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) infection among high-risk groups relies on knowledge of occurrence measures such as prevalence rate. There is no conclusive and comprehensive data regarding to prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups in Iran. Relevant studies were searched in PubMed , Scopus , Web of Knowledge and local databases. In addition , reference lists of relevant studies were searched manually. Two independent authors reviewed the eligibility of retrieved studies and extracted the required data. Studies reporting HBV infection among high risk groups were included in the meta-analysis using random effects models. Meta regression and sub-group analysis were considered as additional analyses. The initial search yielded 566 citations. After the primary screen , 37 studies were selected for review. Meta-analysis results showed that pooled prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups in Iran was 4.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 3.6 % -6.1 %) , with the highest prevalence among in prisoners ( 5 %; 3 % -6 %) , and in central regions of Iran ( 7 %; 4 % -11 %). Year of study may affect the observed heterogeneity in the estimated prevalence of HBV infection among injection drug users ( IDUs) and prisoners. Our results indicate that prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups was seemingly high in Iran. Health policy decision makers should be aware of prevalence of HBV infection among different high risk groups and in different regions of Iran.
