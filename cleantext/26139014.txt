  Airway remodeling ( AR) is a progressive pathological feature of the obstructive lung diseases , including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). The pathology manifests itself in the form of significant , progressive , and ( to date) seemingly irreversible changes to distinct respiratory structural compartments. Consequently , AR correlates with disease severity and the gradual decline in pulmonary function associated with asthma and COPD. Although current asthma/COPD drugs manage airway contraction and inflammation<symptom> , none of these effectively prevent or reverse features of AR. In this review , we provide a brief overview of the features and putative mechanisms affecting AR. We further discuss recently proposed strategies with promise for deterring or treating AR.
