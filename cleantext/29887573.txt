  Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP) is a neuropeptide , and exists diverse physiological functions such as a cell protection , anti-inflammation , and neuronal proliferation and differentiation. There are many evidences that PACAP contributes to the neuronal developmental processes during embryonic periods and after the birth , and that PACAP is involved in the development in ectodermal origin including nervous system. However , few evidences have been reported that PACAP contributes to the development of the other germ layer. In here , we introduced our recent study that PACAP was involved in the hematopoiesis. Moreover , we have showed prospective functions of PACAP on the homeostatic and pathological conditions through the autonomic nerve innervation.
