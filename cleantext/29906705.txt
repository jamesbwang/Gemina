  Adenovirus<pathogen> E1B 55-kilodalton ( E1B-55K) mediated DAXX degradation represents a potential mechanism by which E1B-55K sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. Here we report the effects of E1B-55K-mediated DAXX degradation in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells on response to chemotherapy. Cells with E1B-55K expression were more sensitive to cisplatin than cells without E1B-55K expression. In vivo C13 * xenograft studies showed that the combination of cisplatin and E1B-55K was markedly more effective to slow tumor growth and to confer prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice than either cisplatin or E1B-55K alone. Our studies show that DAXX plays an important role in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer , and strategies that promote DAXX degradation such as E1B-55K expression in combination with cisplatin can overcome drug resistance and improve responses to standard chemotherapy. These results also indicate that E1B-55K might be a novel agent for enhancing treatment responses for cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.
