  A facile and eco-friendly method was developed to prepare a microporous CuO@Ag0 core-shell with high catalytic and antibacterial activities. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed a preponderance of nearly spherical 50 nm particles with slight structure compaction. Comparison of the hysteresis loops confirmed the structure compaction after AgNP incorporation , and a significant decrease of the specific surface area from 55.31 m2 g-1 for CuO to 8.03 m2 g-1 for CuO@Ag0 was noticed. A kinetic study of 4-nitrophenol ( 4-NP) reduction into 4-aminophenol ( 4-AP) with sodium borohydride revealed a first order reaction that produces total conversion in less than 18 minutes. CuO@Ag0 also exhibited appreciable antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> The antibacterial effects were found to strongly depend on the size , contact surface , morphology and chemical composition of the catalyst particles. The addition of Ag0-NPs produced more reactive oxygen species in the bacteria medium. These results open promising prospects for its potential applications as a low cost catalyst in wastewater treatment and antibacterial agent in cosmetics.
