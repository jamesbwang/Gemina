  DNA mutations occur randomly and sporadically in growth-related genes , mostly on cytosines. Demethylation of cytosines may lead to genetic instability through spontaneous deamination. Aims were whole genome methylation and targeted mutation analysis of colorectal cancer ( CRC)- related genes and mRNA expression analysis of TP53 pathway genes. Long interspersed nuclear element-1 ( LINE-1) BS-PCR followed by pyrosequencing was performed for the estimation of global DNA metlyation levels along the colorectal normal-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Methyl capture sequencing was done on 6 normal adjacent ( NAT) , 15 adenomatous ( AD) and 9 CRC tissues. Overall quantitative methylation analysis , selection of top hyper/hypomethylated genes , methylation analysis on mutation regions and TP53 pathway gene promoters were performed. Mutations of 12 CRC-related genes ( APC , BRAF , CTNNB1 , EGFR , FBXW7 , KRAS , NRAS , MSH6 , PIK3CA , SMAD2 , SMAD4 , TP53) were evaluated. mRNA expression of TP53 pathway genes was also analyzed. According to the LINE-1 methylation results , overall hypomethylation was observed along the normal-adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Within top50 differential methylated regions ( DMRs) , in AD-N comparison TP73 , NGFR , PDGFRA genes were hypermethylated , FMN1 , SLC16A7 genes were hypomethylated. In CRC-N comparison DKK2 , SDC2 , SOX1 genes showed hypermethylation , while ERBB4 , CREB5 , CNTN1 genes were hypomethylated. In certain mutation hot spot regions significant DNA methylation alterations were detected. The TP53 gene body was addressed by hypermethylation in adenomas. APC , TP53 and KRAS mutations were found in 30 , 15 , 21 % of adenomas , and in 29 , 53 , 29 % of CRCs , respectively. mRNA expression changes were observed in several TP53 pathway genes showing promoter methylation alterations. DNA methylation with consecutive phenotypic effect can be observed in a high number of promoter and gene body regions through CRC development.
