  This chapter describes the prion diseases of cattle , or bovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( BoTSEs). `` Classic '' bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( C-BSE) , the major prion protein disorder of Bovidae , was first described in 1986. We also describe the spatiotemporal correlation of C-BSE to a novel form of human prion disease , variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( vCJD) , which led to the classification of BSE as a zoonotic disease ( and the `` cause '' of vCJD) in 1996. From isolated cases first identified retrospectively in May 1985 , a major bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE) epidemic peaked within the British Isles in 1991 , and has so far led to over 195,000 confirmed cases in cattle , and several thousand more cases within Europe and a few elsewhere. By 2017 , the disease had been essentially eradicated below the level of surveillance detection in Europe , although sporadic cases are still predicted to show up for several years to come. By 2004 , other forms of BSE , H-type and L-type , had been recognized and , in the absence of information to the contrary , are also included in the classification of BSE as a zoonotic prion disease of bovine origin. This chapter aims to cover the clinical , epidemiologic , neuropathologic , biochemical , biomarker , and pathogenetic aspects of the bovine prion disease and gives a brief , but important , description of the surveillance of BSE and other animal TSEs in Europe.
