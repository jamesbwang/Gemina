  The present study aimed to review and discuss the recommended and recently suggested protocols by Iranian researchers for a long-term treatment of delayed complications of sulfur mustard ( DCSM) in veterans. As indicated clinically , patients who suffer from delayed ocular complications of sulfur mustard ( DOCS) benefit from treatments for dry eyes , therapeutic contact lenses , amniotic membrane transplantation; blepharorrhaphy , tarsorrhaphy , limbal stem cell transplantation; corneal transplantation , topical steroids , and immunosuppressive. In spite of penetrating keratoplasty , lamellar keratoplasty and keratolimbal allograft had a good long-term survival. Delayed respiratory complications ( DRCS) are the most common effects and life-threatening in Iranian veterans. The recommended treatment protocols include regular clinical evaluations , respiratory physiotherapy and rehabilitation , N-acetyl cysteine; warm humidified air , long-acting b2-agonists , and inhaled corticosteroids. Azithromycin has also been effective in improving clinical conditions , pulmonary function tests , inflammatory indexes , and life quality of the veterans. Interferon gamma ( IFN-γ) and helium: oxygen combination were also used in severe DRCS with good results. Some of the delayed cutaneous complications ( DCCS) such as itching affects the quality of life of victims. Regular but not frequent showering and bathing , applying sunscreen compounds , topical corticosteroids , and systemic antihistamines reduce the problems of DCCS patients. Several compounds such as capsaicin cream , pimecrolimus , IFN-γ , phenol-menthol; Aloe vera/olive oil cream , cetirizine , doxepine , and hydroxyzine were evaluated in DCCS patients with some benefits. The physicians in charge of veterans emphasize the importance of a healthy lifestyle , appropriate financial/social/cultural supports , and a degree of reassurance and supportive care on the clinical improvement of patients.
