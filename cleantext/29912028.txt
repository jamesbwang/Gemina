  This study was designed to examine the effect and mechanism of dexmedetomidine ( Dex) on neuropathic pain ( NP). The NP model was established by performing chronic sciatic nerve constriction injury ( CCI). Seven days after CCI surgery , the rats were injected intraperitoneally with Dex , ZD7288 ( an HCN channel inhibitor) , and saline , respectively. The paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation and the thermal withdrawal latency tests were performed. After administration , the L4 , L5 dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) neurons of rats were isolated. In addition , hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN) channels subtype plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney ( HEK) 293 cells. Whole-cell clamp recordings were used to examine the properties of HCN currents ( Ih) expressed in HEK293 cells and DRG neurons. After surgery , the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation and thermal withdrawal latency were reduced , the HCN currents ( Ih) amplitude of DRG neurons was increased , and the semiactivated voltage ( V1/2) value was decreased in CCI rats ( P < 0.05). CCI rats treated with Dex or ZD7288 had reduced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. The Ih amplitude was lower and the V1/2 value was increased in DRG neurons in CCI rats treated with Dex or ZD7288 ( P < 0.05). In addition , Dex inhibited HCN1 and HCN2 currents in HEK293 cells; caused a decrease in maximal currents , an increase in the inhibition rate of Ih , and a negative shift in V1/2 ( P < 0.05). Taken together , our finding suggested that Dex alleviates NP and the effect is likely because of the inhibition of HCN currents.
