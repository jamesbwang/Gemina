  Global warming is expected to drive increasing extreme sea levels ( ESLs) and flood risk along the world 's coastlines. In this work we present probabilistic projections of ESLs for the present century taking into consideration changes in mean sea level , tides , wind-waves , and storm surges. Between the year 2000 and 2100 we project a very likely increase of the global average 100-year ESL of 34-76 cm under a moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario and of 58-172 cm under a business as usual scenario. Rising ESLs are mostly driven by thermal expansion , followed by contributions from ice mass-loss from glaciers , and ice-sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Under these scenarios ESL rise would render a large part of the tropics exposed annually to the present-day 100-year event from 2050. By the end of this century this applies to most coastlines around the world , implying unprecedented flood risk levels unless timely adaptation measures are taken.
