  Sensing sheets based on Large Area Electronics ( LAE) and Integrated Circuits ( ICs) are novel sensors designed to enable reliable early-stage detection of local unusual structural behaviors. Such a device consists of a dense array of strain sensors , patterned onto a flexible polyimide substrate along with associated electronics. Previous tests performed on steel specimens equipped with sensing sheet prototypes and subjected to fatigue<symptom> cracking pointed to a potential issue: individual sensors that were on or near a crack would immediately be damaged by the crack , thereby rendering them useless in assessing the size of the crack opening or to monitor future crack growth. In these tests , a stiff adhesive was used to bond the sensing sheet prototype to the steel specimen. Such an adhesive provided excellent strain transfer , but it also caused premature failure of individual sensors within the sheet. Therefore , the aim of this paper is to identify an alternative adhesive that survives minor damage , yet provides strain transfer that is sufficient for reliable early-stage crack detection. A sensor sheet prototype is then calibrated for use with the selected adhesive.
