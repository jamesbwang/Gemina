  Cancer cell dependence on activated oncogenes is targeted therapeutically , but acquired resistance is virtually unavoidable. Here we show that the treatment of addicted melanoma cells with BRAF-inhibitors , and of breast cancer cells with HER2-targeted drugs , led to an adaptive rise in Neuropilin-1 ( NRP1) expression , which is crucial for the onset of acquired resistance to therapy. Moreover , NRP1 levels dictated the efficacy of MET oncogene-inhibitors in addicted stomach and lung carcinoma cells. Mechanistically , NRP1 induced a JNK-dependent signaling cascade leading to the upregulation of alternative effector kinases , EGFR or IGF1R , which in turn sustained cancer cell growth and mediated acquired resistance to BRAF , HER2 , or MET inhibitors. Notably , the combination with NRP1-interfering molecules improved the efficacy of oncogene-targeted drugs , and prevented , or even reversed , the onset of resistance in cancer cells and tumor models. Our study provides the rationale for targeting the NRP1-dependent upregulation of tyrosine kinases , responsible for loss of responsiveness to oncogene-targeted therapies.
