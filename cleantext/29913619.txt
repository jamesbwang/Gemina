  The advent of industrialization has led to the discovery of a wide range of chemicals designed for multiple uses including plant protection. However , after use , most of the chemicals and their derivatives end up in soil and water , interacting with living organisms. Plants , which are primary producers , are intentionally or unintentionally exposed to several chemicals , serving as a vehicle for the transfer of products into the food chain. Although the exposure of pesticides towards plants has been witnessed over a long time in agricultural production , other chemicals have attracted attention very recently. In this review , we carried out a comprehensive overview of the plant uptake capacity of various contaminants of emerging concern ( CEC) in soil , such as pesticides , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , perfluorinated compounds , pharmaceutical and personal care products , and engineered nanomaterials. The uptake pathways and overall impacts of these chemicals are highlighted. According to the literature , bioaccumulation of CEC in the root part is higher than in aerial parts. Furthermore , various factors such as plant species , pollutant type , and microbial interactions influence the overall uptake. Lastly , environmental factors such as soil erosion and temperature can also affect the CEC bioavailability towards plants.
