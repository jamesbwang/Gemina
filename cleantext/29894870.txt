  Wildfire has historically been an alteration factor in Mediterranean basins. Despite Mediterranean ecosystems ' high resilience , wildfire accelerates erosion and degradation processes , and also affects soil functionality by affecting nutrient cycles and soil structure. In semi-arid Mediterranean basins , check dams are usually built in gullies and channels after fire as a measure against soil erosion. Although check dams have proven efficient action to reduce erosion rates , studies about how they affect soil functionality are lacking. Our approach focuses on how soil functionality , defined as a combination of physico-chemical and biological indicators , is locally affected by check dam construction and the evolution of this effect over time. Soils were sampled in eight check dams in two semi-arid areas at SE Spain , which were affected by wildfire in 2012 and 2016. The study findings reveal that by altering sediments cycle and transport , check dams influence soil 's main physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics. Significant differences were found between check dam-affected zones and the control ones for many indicators such as organic matter content , electrical conductivity or enzymatic activity. According to the ANOVA results , interaction between check dams influence and time after fire , was a crucial factor. PCA results clearly showed check-dams influence on soil functionality.
