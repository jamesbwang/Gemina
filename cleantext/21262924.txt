  Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside ( i2b2) is an open source clinical data analytics platform used at more than 150 institutions for querying patient data. An i2b2 installation ( called hive<disease>) comprises several i2b2 cells that provide different functionalities. Given the complex architecture of i2b2 installation , creating a working installation of the platform is challenging for new users. This is despite the availability of extensive documentation for i2b2 and access to a large and active mailing list community of i2b2 users. To address this problem , we have created an automated installation package , called i2b2-quickstart , which automatically downloads the latest i2b2 source code and dependencies , and compiles and configures the i2b2 cells to create a functional i2b2 hive<disease> installation. This package will serve as a convenient starting point and reference implementation that will facilitate researchers in the installation and exploration of the i2b2 platform.
