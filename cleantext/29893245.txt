  9 years since the report of a cure for HIV<pathogen> after C-C chemokine receptor type 5 Î”32 stem cell transplantation , no other case of HIV<pathogen> cure has been reported , despite much research. However , substantial progress has been made in understanding the biology of the latent HIV<pathogen> reservoir , and in measuring the amount of virus that persists after antiretroviral therapy ( ART) with increasingly sophisticated approaches. This knowledge is being translated into a long pipeline of clinical trials seeking to reduce viral persistence in participants on suppressive treatment and ultimately to allow safe cessation of ART. In this Review , we discuss the main barriers preventing the development of an HIV<pathogen> cure , methods used to measure HIV<pathogen> persistence in individuals on ART , clinical strategies that aim to cure HIV<pathogen> , and future directions for studies in the field of HIV<pathogen> cure research.
