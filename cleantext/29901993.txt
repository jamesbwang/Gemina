  The increasing need for biocompatible materials as supports to immobilize photosensitizer molecules for photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , led us to investigate the use of chitin as a support for 4,4 ' ,4 ″ ,4 ‴- ( porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis ( benzoic acid) ( mTCPP) for singlet oxygen production. Chitin was first extracted from shrimp<disease> shells using the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ( ( C
