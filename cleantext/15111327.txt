  All cells expel a variety of nano-sized extracellular vesicles ( EVs) , including exosomes , with composition reflecting the cells ' biological state. Cancer pathology is dramatically mediated by EV trafficking via key proteins , lipids , metabolites , and microRNAs. Recent proteomics evidence suggests that tumor-associated exosomes exhibit distinct expression of certain membrane proteins , rendering those proteins as attractive targets for diagnostic or therapeutic application. Yet , it is not currently feasible to distinguish circulating EVs in complex biofluids according to their tissue of origin or state of disease. Here we demonstrate peptide binding to tumor-associated EVs via overexpressed membrane protein. We find that SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cells and their released EVs express Î±
