  Tolerance induction through simultaneous hematopoietic stem cell and renal transplantation has shown promising results , but it is hampered by the toxicity of preconditioning therapies and graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD). Moreover , renal function has never been compared to conventionally transplanted patients , thus , whether donor-specific tolerance results in improved outcomes remains unanswered. We collected follow-up data of published cases of renal transplantations after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from the same donor and compared patient and transplant kidney survival as well as function with caliper-matched living-donor renal transplantations from the Austrian dialysis and transplant registry. Overall , 22 tolerant and 20 control patients were included ( median observation period 10 years ( range 11 months to 26 years)). In the tolerant group , no renal allograft loss was reported , whereas 3 were lost in the control group. Median creatinine levels were 85 μmol/l ( interquartile range ( IQR) 72-99) in the tolerant cohort and 118 μmol/l ( IQR 99-143) in the control group. Mixed linear-model showed around 29 % lower average creatinine levels throughout follow-up in the tolerant group ( P < .01). Our data clearly show stable renal graft function without long-term immunosuppression for many years , suggesting permanent donor-specific tolerance. Thus sequential transplantation might be an alternative approach for future studies targeting tolerance induction in renal allograft recipients.
