  The Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein ( RKIP) is an important regulatory element in multiple signaling pathways , including MAPK-ERK1/ 2. We investigated whether targeted disruption of RKIP is a therapeutic option for chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). The RKIP inhibitor locostatin-induced apoptosis of CLL cells , irrespective of poor prognostic indications or treatment history. Locostatin down-regulated MAPK-ERK1/ 2 and AKT phosphorylation , decreased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 ( p = .04) and reduced the migratory capacity of CLL cells toward stroma-derived factor 1α ( SDF-1α , p = .02). Immuno-blotting and immuno-precipitation showed that RKIP is constitutively phosphorylated and highly expressed in CLL cells and that the actions of locostatin may be mediated by binding of G-protein receptor kinase-2 ( GRK2) to MEK1 and AKT. Collectively , our data suggest that inhibition of RKIP may be effective against CLL , reducing the survival and migratory capacity of the leukemic cells through down-regulation of MAPK-ERK1/ 2 and AKT-mediated signaling.
