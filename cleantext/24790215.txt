  Although there is ample evidence that the chemotherapeutic drugs trigger an immune response , the efficient tumor rejection or regression is not guaranteed probably due to the massive immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. Thus , a rational delivery platform that overcomes immunosuppression is needed to maximally achieve both cytotoxic and immune-modulatory functions of chemotherapeutics. Accumulating evidence suggests that platinum-based drugs might be suitable for this application.
