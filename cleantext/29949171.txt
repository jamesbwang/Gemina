  Osteoporosis is the most common bone metabolic disease. Exosome exerts a crucial role in the development of multiple diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of exosome derived from bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in osteoporosis and its underlying mechanism. MSCs were first isolated from rat bone<disease> marrow. After the surface antigen of MSCs was identified by flow cytometry , MSCs-derived exosomes ( MSC-Exo) was extracted. The osteogenic and lipid differentiation abilities of BMSCs were determined by alizarin red staining and oil red staining , respectively. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expressions of genes. Cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay was used to detect the viability of hFOB 1.19 cells. Western blot was used to measure expressions of the specific surface markers in exosomes and the MAPK pathway-related proteins in hFOB 1.19 cells. Moreover , cell cycle of hFOB 1.19 was detected by flow cytometry. We observed a positive identification of surface antigens in MSCs , which presented good multidirectional differentiation ability. The isolated MSC-Exo exhibited typical morphology and particle size of exosomes , and the detection of specific surface labeled protein was positive under an electron microscope. After co-culture of MSC-Exo and osteoblast cell line hFOB 1.19 , we found that MSC-Exo could promote the proliferation of hFOB 1.19 cells. Moreover , mRNA and protein expressions of GLUT3 in cells were increased , and the cell cycle was also promoted. The expressions of related proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway were found to be promoted. Rescue experiments demonstrated that MSC-Exo could promote the growth and cell cycle of hFOB 1.19 , which were reversed by p-JNK knockdown. MSC-derived exosomes improve osteoporosis by promoting the proliferation of osteoblasts via MAPK pathway.
