  Regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 ( REDD1) is an inducible gene in response to various stresses , which functions as a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase in complex 1. In the present study , we identified the role of REDD1 under the oxidative stress-mediated hepatocyte injury and its regulatory mechanism. REDD1 protein was increased in H
