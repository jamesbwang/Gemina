  Heparanase and endothelin-1/ endothelin A receptor ( ET-1/ ET Thirty patients with benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms were recruited in this study. Neoplasm subtypes were diagnosed by pathologists. RNA extraction was done in fresh frozen neoplasms while immunohistochemical ( IHC) staining was done on ETAR , heparanase , and proliferation ( Ki-67 antigen) in paraffin sections. Reverse transcriptase PCR was done to quantify the expression of preproET-1 ( ppET-1) , ETAR , and heparanase. ETAR and heparanase histoscores were done based on IHC staining. The Independent Samples Heparanase and ETAR histoscores , ppET-1 and ETAR mRNA levels , and Ki-67 were significantly higher in the group with EOC than in the benign or borderline group , regardless of the histopathological types. The heparanase histoscore correlated with the ETAR histoscore ( r = 0.484 , P = 0.007) and the ETAR mRNA level ( r = 0.551 , P = 0.003). The level of ppET-1 mRNA correlated with both ETAR mRNA level and ETAR histoscore ( r = 0.603 , P = 0.001 and r = 0.455 , P = 028 , respectively). The ovarian neoplasms with high ppET-1 mRNA levels also tended to have high heparanase mRNA levels; however , the correlation was weak ( r = 0.354 , P = 0.07). Ki-67 correlated with the heparanase and ETAR histoscores ( r = 0.381 , P = 0.038 and r = 0.477 , P = 0.008 , respectively). Heparanase and ETAR were upregulated in EOC , and the correlation between heparanase and ETAR expressions was also elucidated in the current study.
