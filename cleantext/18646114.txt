  Deformities and neuropathic chronic ulcers<disease> are the common features associated with leprosy-cured individuals that impact their quality of life and impair rehabilitation efforts. The challenging aspects for treatment of chronic<disease> wounds<disease> are the factors that inhibit healing. We reasoned that limited success of various therapeutic interventions could be due to the fact that leprosy-cured individual 's physiology gets acclimatized to having a chronic<disease> wound<disease> that any therapeutic intervention is counterbalanced to maintain Developing the human amnion ( Amn)- derived biomaterial scaffolds and evaluating its use to heal chronic<disease> wounds<disease> in leprosy-cured but deformed persons ( LCDPs). Using an enzymatic protocol , we have developed a rapid method to generate biomaterial scaffolds from discarded human Amn. A clinical trial on 26 LCDPs was performed with the biomaterial , and its wound-healing potential was then compared with LCDPs undergoing standard treatment procedure. Biomaterial-based treatment of chronic<disease> wounds<disease> on LCDP displayed a higher efficiency in healing when compared to standard treatment. This study exemplifies that biomaterial-based treatment of leprosy-wounds offers an excellent affordable alternative for wound<disease> management. This study underlines the importance of involving both local wound<disease> environment and systemic effects for healing. In addition , we highlight wound<disease> healing as a necessity for successful rehabilitation and reintegration of leprosy-cured person into the society.
