  Cuboid fractures are rare injuries. A number of different treatment methods have been proposed including plaster immobilization , open reduction , and internal fixation or external fixation. Bone grafting is commonly used to restore bony length. The majority of the current literature suggests that the loss of length of the lateral column and articular congruency are the two criteria opting for the surgical management of these fractures. Nevertheless , the exact indications and ideal management of these fractures are not established mainly due to the rarity of these injuries and the paucity of literature.
