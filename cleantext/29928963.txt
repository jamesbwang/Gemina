  One of the most common inflammatory markers examined in depression<symptom> is C-reactive protein ( CRP). However , the magnitude of the association between CRP and depression<symptom> when controlling for potentially confounding factors such as age , sex , socio-economic status , body mass index , medication and other substance use , and medical illness , is unclear. Inconsistencies in other methodological practices , such as sample collection , assaying , and data cleaning and transformation , may contribute to variations in results. We aggregate studies that examined the association between CRP and depression<symptom> in two ways. First , a systematic review summarizes how studies of CRP and depression<symptom> have reported on methodological issues. Second , a tiered meta-analysis aggregates studies that have adhered to various levels of methodological rigor. Findings from the systematic review indicate a lack of protocol detail provided. The effect between depression<symptom> and CRP was small , but highly significant across all stages of the meta-analysis ( p < 0.01). The effect size in the most methodologically rigorous stage of the meta-analysis , which included studies controlling for age , sex , obesity , medical conditions and substance , medication , or psychosocial factors , was small ( r = 0.05). There were also only 26 articles in this stage ( 13 % of studies from the systematic review) , suggesting that more studies that consistently account for these confounding factors are needed. Additionally , an a priori quality score of methodological rigor was a significant moderator in this stage of the meta-analysis. The effect size was strikingly attenuated ( r = .005) and non-significant in studies with higher quality scores. We describe a set of recommended guidelines for future research to consider , including sample collection and assaying procedures , data cleaning and statistical methods , and control variables to assess.
