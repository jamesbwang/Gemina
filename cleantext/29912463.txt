  In recognition of the incidence of traumatic brain injuries ( TBIs) in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) has , since 2007 , examined returning U.S. service members for symptoms of TBI , a pre-condition for VA treatment of TBI. This study characterizes `` Traumatic Brain Injury screen '' service delivery , according to the barrier and facilitator viewpoints of those experiencing the delivery. The purposeful sample comprised both Veteran patient and VA staff participants in the TBI screen program ( n = 64) , including patients ( n = 14) , health care providers ( n = 38) , and key informants ( n = 12). Telephone interviews were conducted per standardized , semi-structured interview scripts; respondent narratives recorded and transcribed verbatim; natural emergence of key themes of discourse fostered through conventional content analysis; themes coded by meaning and meaning units organized by nature of influence on service delivery. A wide variety of structural , administrative , and communications barriers impede TBI screen service delivery , and certain case management and other functions promote delivery. The value of VA TBI screen service delivery is appreciated by its participants , but delivery is perceived as vulnerable to failure; the extent of such failure and short- and long-term effects on patient health and well-being outcomes is incompletely understood and merits investigation. Evaluating VA TBI screen service delivery under alternate modes of delivery , e.g. , one-stop visits , expanded hours of delivery , shared appointment sessions , telehealth , and intensified case management is suggested.
