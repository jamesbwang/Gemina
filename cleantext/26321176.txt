  Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder ( CKD-MBD) is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism caused by CKD. Impaired bone mineralization together with increased bony secretion of fibroblast growth factor-23 ( FGF23) are hallmarks of CKD-MBD. We recently showed that FGF23 suppresses the expression of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( TNAP) in bone cells by a Klotho-independent , FGF receptor-3-mediated signaling axis , leading to the accumulation of the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. Therefore , we hypothesized that excessive FGF23 secretion may locally impair bone mineralization in CKD-MBD. To test this hypothesis , we induced CKD by 5/6 nephrectomy in 3-month-old wild-type ( WT) mice and
