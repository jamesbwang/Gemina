  Evidence exists that oxidative stress and oxidative damage play a pivotal role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Oligomeric proanthocyanidins ( OPCs) extracted from grape seeds have been shown to exhibit antioxidant capabilities greater than those of vitamin C and E. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of OPCs on antioxidant status and lung function in patients with COPD. Patients were supplemented with 150 mg/day OPC ( n = 13) orally or with a placebo ( n = 14) for 8 weeks in a randomized double-blind clinical design. Changes in anthropometric values , lung function , oxidative state , and lipid profiles were assessed after OPC or placebo treatment for 8 weeks. The results showed that OPC supplementation significantly reduced the concentration of malondialdehyde , superoxide dismutase , and total cholesterol ( TC)/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) ratio. The concentration of HDL-C significantly increased in the OPC-treated group. The plasma triglyceride , TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values and the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase also decreased , but did not significantly differ between the OPC- and placebo-treated groups. Lung function was not significantly different between the two groups after 8 weeks. OPC supplementation was effective in increasing the antioxidant capacity , in addition to improving the lipid profiles in patients with COPD.
