  Calcifying odontogenic cyst<symptom> ( COC) is a rare odontogenic cyst<symptom> with ameloblastic epithelial lining containing clusters of ghost cells. COCs have been described in association with several odontogenic tumors , more commonly odontomas and rarely with dentigerous cyst<symptom> ( DC). In this article , we describe a case of COC associated with DC in a 15-year-old girl , who presented with a swelling on the right middle third of the face , producing facial asymmetry. Panoramic radiography showed a well-circumscribed , corticated , and unilocular radiolucency at the level of the right maxillary sinus , involving 2 unerupted premolars. The lesion<symptom> was enucleated and histologically revealed a COC associated with DC , which presented mucous metaplasia. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed to better illustrate this rare synchronous occurrence of COC and DC , showing positivity for CK5 , CK14 , CK19 , and p63 in both lesions<symptom>. CK18 was negative in COC , and Bcl-2 was negative in DC. Periodic acid Schiff highlighted the mucous cells in the DC lining.
