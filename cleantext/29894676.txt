  The aim of our study was to analyze long-term outcomes , to identify their predictors and to develop a model for determining the risk of long-term adverse сardiovascular events after elective percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI). A retrospective study included 151 patients 6 years after the elective PCI. Outcomes were assessed by analyzing medical records and telephone interviews. The primary composite end point of the study was a major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACCE) , including death from cardiovascular causes , acute coronary syndrome<disease> , acute cerebrovascular accident. Death from cardiovascular events was reported in 10.6 % of patients , acute coronary syndrome<disease> occurred in 34.4 % , stroke- in 6.6 %. Thus MAСCE occurred in 40.4 % of patients. MACCE predictors in the long-term period were chronic kidney disease , contrast-induced acute kidney injury , baseline C-reactive protein more than 5.5 mg/l. Restenosis of previously installed stents increases the risk of MACCE at 8.09 times , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- 3.4 times PT- 2.84 times , family history for cardiovascular disease ( CVD)- in 2.94 times , a very high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN) ( ≥ 11 points on the R. Mehran scale)- 2.15 times. The most significant MACCE 's predictors identified using stepwise logistic regression and included in the developed model are: family history for СVD , statins reception during the procedure of PCI , the initial level of postprandial blood glucose , high risk of CIN ( 11-15 points on a scale of R. Mehran). AUC values for the found model was 0.852 ( 95 % CI 0.749-0.956). The use of our model of risk stratification in patients after elective PCI allows , on the basis of simple clinical characteristics , to distinguish groups of patients with a high residual risk of adverse cardiovascular events that require the timely application of more active follow-up strategies.
