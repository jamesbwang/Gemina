  Microgels are commonly synthesized in batch experiments , yielding quantities sufficient to perform characterization experiments for physical property studies. With increasing attention on the application potential of microgels , little attention is yet paid to the questions ( a) whether they can be produced continuously on a larger scale , ( b) whether synthesis routes can be easily transferred from batch to continuous synthesis , and ( c) whether their properties can be precisely controlled as a function of synthesis parameters under continuous flow reaction conditions. We present a new continuous synthesis process of two typical but different microgel systems. Their size , size distribution , and temperature-responsive behavior are compared in depth to those of microgels synthesized using batch processes , and the influence of premixing and surfactant is also investigated. For the surfactant-free poly ( N-vinylcaprolactam) and poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) systems , microgels are systematically smaller , while the actual size is depending on the premixing of the reaction solutions. However , by the use of a surfactant , the size difference between batch and continuous preparation diminishes , resulting in equal-sized microgels. Temperature-induced swelling-deswelling of microgels synthesized under continuous flow conditions was similar to that of their analogues synthesized using the batch polymerization process. Additionally , investigation of the internal microgel structure using static light scattering showed no significant changes between microgels prepared under batch and continuous conditions. The work encourages synthesis concepts of sequential chemical conditions in continuous flow reactors to prepare precisely tuned new microgel systems.
