  The alarming and rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria represents a high risk for global health. Targeting factors involved in resistance to restore the activity of failing antibiotics is a promising strategy to overcome this urgent medical need. Efflux pump inhibitors are able to increase antibiotic concentrations in bacteria , thus they can be considered true antimicrobial resistance breakers. In this work , continuing our studies on inhibitors of the Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> NorA pump , we designed , synthesized and biologically evaluated novel 2-phenylquinoline derivatives starting from our hits 1 and 2. Two of the synthesized compounds ( 6 and 7) bearing a C-6 benzyloxy group showed the best NorA inhibition activity , thereby providing an excellent starting point to direct future chemical optimizations.
