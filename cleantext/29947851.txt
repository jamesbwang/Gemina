  Within the field of the history of technology , much has been written about the so-called `` prosthesis boom '' of the First World War. Most of these studies claim that the main motive of the mass supply of artificial limbs<symptom> to amputee soldiers was primarily aimed at restoring the work force. However , because these studies often lack a gender perspective , it stays unmentioned to what extent this also served to reconstruct a hegemonic masculinity that had become fragile , if not destroyed by the consequences of the war. Especially genital injuries-prevalent during World War I and II as well as today-and their treatment and rehabilitation were ( and still are) often largely taboo. Because of this silence , there have been no comprehensive studies or artifact collections on the cultural and technical history of male genital prosthetics. By presenting different examples of potential artifacts for such a history , the article suggests an object-based approach to fill this academic void. These thoughts are based on the assumption of a `` doing gender through technology '' , hence that gender and sex are constantly constructed and modeled through ( medical) technological practices.
