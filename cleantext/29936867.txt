  The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ( NCLs) are a subset of lysosomal storage diseases ( LSDs) that cause myoclonic epilepsy , loss of cognitive and motor function , degeneration of the retina leading to blindness<symptom> , and early death. Most are caused by loss-of-function mutations in either lysosomal proteins or transmembrane proteins. Current therapies are supportive in nature. NCLs involving lysosomal enzymes are amenable to therapies that provide an exogenous source of protein , as has been used for other LSDs. Those that involve transmembrane proteins , however , require new approaches. Areas covered: This review will discuss potential gene and cell therapy approaches that have been , are , or may be in development for these disorders and those that have entered clinical trials. Expert opinion: In animal models , gene therapy approaches have produced remarkable improvements in neurological function and lifespan. However , a complete cure has not been reached for any NCL , and a better understanding of the limits of the current crop of vectors is needed to more fully address these diseases. The prospects for gene therapy , particularly those that can be delivered systemically and treat both the brain and peripheral tissue , are high. The future is beginning to look bright for NCL patients and their families.
