  Epigenetic modifications contribute to the determination of cell fate and differentiation. The molecular mechanisms underlying histone variants and post-translational modifications ( PTMs) have been studied in the contexts of development , differentiation , and disease. Antibody-based assays have classically been used to target PTMs , but these approaches fail to reveal combinatorial patterns of modifications. In addition , some histone variants are so similar to canonical histones that antibodies have difficulty distinguishing between these isoforms. Mass spectrometry ( MS) has progressively developed as a powerful technology for the study of histone variants and their PTMs. Indeed , MS analyses highlighted exquisitely complex combinations of PTMs , suggesting & ldquo; crosstalk & rdquo; between them , and also revealed that PTM patterns are often variant-specific. Even though the sensitivity and acquisition speed of MS instruments have considerably increased alongside the development of computational tools for the study of multiple PTMs , it remains challenging to correctly describe the landscape of histone PTMs , and in particular to confidently assign modifications to specific amino acids. Here , we provide an inventory of MS-based strategies and of the pitfalls inherent to histone PTM and variant characterization , while stressing the complex interplay between PTMs and histone sequence variations. We will particularly illustrate the roles played by MS-based analyses in identifying and quantifying histone variants and modifications.
