  Autophagy is a conserved catabolic pathway that involves the engulfment of cytoplasmic components such as large protein aggregates and organelles that are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. This process is important in maintaining neuronal function and raises the possibility of a role for autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is the most prevalent form of these diseases and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain which arise due to the misfolding and aggregation of toxic peptides , including amyloid beta ( A
