  A new method is presented for calculating a building-specific subslab to indoor air attenuation factor for use in assessing subsurface vapor intrusion to indoor air. The technique includes ( 1) subslab gas extraction with flow and vacuum measurements and mathematical modeling to characterize the bulk average vertical gas conductivity of the floor slab , ( 2) monitoring of the ambient pressure gradient across the floor slab with a micromanometer , ( 3) calculating the volumetric flow of soil gas into the building ( Q
