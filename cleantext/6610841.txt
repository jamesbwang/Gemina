  Accurate detection of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is of considerable clinical importance. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 ( QUADAS-2) is the current research standard for evaluating the quality of studies that validate diagnostic tests; however , its own construct validity has not yet been evaluated empirically. Our aim was to evaluate how well the proposed QUADAS-2 items and its domains converge to indicate the study quality criteria. This study applies confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether a measurement model would be consistent with meta-analytic data. Cochrane meta-analyses assessing the accuracy of AD diagnostic tests were identified. The seven ordinal QUADAS-2 items , intended to inform study quality based on risk of bias and applicability concerns , were extracted for each of the included studies. The QUADAS-2 pre-specified factor structure ( i.e. , four domains assessed in terms of risk of bias and applicability concerns) was not testable. An alternative model based on two correlated factors ( i.e. , risk of bias and applicability concerns) returned a poor fit model. Poor<symptom> factor loadings were obtained , indicating that we can not provide evidence that the indicators convergent validity markers in the context of AD diagnostic accuracy metanalyses , where normally the sample size is low ( around 60 primary included studies). A Monte Carlo simulation suggested that such a model would require at least 90 primary studies to estimate these parameters with 80 % power. The reliability of the QUADAS-2 items to inform a measurement model for study quality remains unconfirmed. Considerations for conceptualizing such a tool are discussed.
