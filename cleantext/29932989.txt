  The role of mitochondria is emerging in regulation of innate immunity , inflammation<symptom> and cell death beyond its primary role in energy metabolism. Mitochondria act as molecular platform for immune adaptor protein complexes , which participate in innate immune signaling. The mitochondrial localized immune adaptors are widely expressed in non-immune cells , however their role in regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolic adaption is not well understood. NLRX1 , a member of NOD family receptor proteins , localizes to mitochondria and is a negative regulator of anti-viral signaling. However , the submitochondrial localization of NLRX1 and its implication in regulation of mitochondrial functions remains elusive. Here , we confirm that NLRX1 translocates to mitochondrial matrix and associates with mitochondrial FASTKD5 ( Fas-activated serine-threonine kinase family protein-5) , a bonafide component of mitochondrial RNA granules ( MRGs). The association of NLRX1 with FASTKD5 negatively regulates the processing of mitochondrial genome encoded transcripts for key components of complex-I and complex-IV , to modulate its activity and supercomplexes formation. The evidences , here , suggest an important role of NLRX1 in regulating the post-transcriptional processing of mitochondrial RNA , which may have an important implication in bioenergetic adaptation during metabolic stress , oncogenic transformation and innate immunity.
