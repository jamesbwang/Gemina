  The aim of this study was to evaluate the carotid intima-media thickness together with the thickness of the epicardial adipose tissue in patients receiving antiepileptic drug therapy and to investigate the presence of increased cardiovascular risk in these patients. The study included a total of 52 patients comprising 32 males and 20 females who were diagnosed as having epilepsy and who were using one or more antiepileptic drugs. The control group consisted of 34 healthy individuals comprising 16 males and 18 females. The individuals selected for the study group were requested to go to the hospital after overnight fasting. After blood sampling for serum lipid value , the carotid intima-media thickness was measured with high resolution B-mode ultrasonography and epicardial adipose tissue thickness with echocardiography in the patients and the control group subjects. The carotid intima-media thickness was determined as 0.47 ± 0.05 mm in the patient group and 0.44 ± 0.04 mm in the control group ( p = 0.028). The carotid intima-media thickness was measured as 0.45 ± 0.05 mm in patients with epilepsy taking monotherapy and 0.49 ± 0.04 mm in those taking polytherapy ( p = 0.003). The epicardial adipose tissue thickness was determined as 3.42 ± 0.09 mm in the patient group and 1.72 ± 0.90 mm in the control group ( p = 0.000). The epicardial adipose tissue thickness was measured as 3.16 ± 0.87 mm in patients with epilepsy taking monotherapy and 3.77 ± 0.83 mm in those taking polytherapy ( p = 0.041). It was determined that carotid intima-media thickness and epicardial adipose tissue thickness were significantly high in children with epilepsy taking long-term antiepileptic drugs. These results demonstrate that these patients could be at increased risk of the development of cardiovascular complications. There is a need for more extensive studies on this subject.
