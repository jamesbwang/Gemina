  Polarized epithelial morphogenesis is an essential process in animal development. While this process is mostly attributed to directional cell intercalation , it can also be induced by other mechanisms. Using live-imaging analysis and a three-dimensional vertex model , we identified ` cell sliding , ' a novel mechanism driving epithelial morphogenesis , in which cells directionally change their position relative to their subjacent ( posterior) neighbors by sliding in one direction. In
