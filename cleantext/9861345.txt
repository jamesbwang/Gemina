  BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma are malignant tumors with poor prognosis. Peroxiredoxin 1 ( PRDX1) is considered to prevent tumors in many malignances. However , few studies have focused on the functions of PRDX1 in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS PRDX1 mRNA in tumors and adjacent tissues of 32 osteosarcoma patients and 16 fibrosarcoma patients was extracted and measured. Proliferation and invasion of MG63 and HT1080 cell lines after silencing or overexpressing PRDX1 were used to detect the role of PRDX1 in metastasis of osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. RESULTS PRDX1 mRNA level was lower in tumor tissues than in adjacent tissues of osteosarcoma ( F = 50.105) and fibrosarcoma ( F = 28.472) patients , both significantly ( P < 0.05). Silencing PRDX1 promoted proliferation of MG63 and HT1080 cells , while overexpressing PRDX1 suppressed proliferation after 24 h , 48 h , and 72 h , compared to the control group , both significantly ( P < 0.05). Silencing PRDX1 increased invasive cells of MG63 ( F = 246.218) and HT1080 ( F = 245.602) , while overexpressing PRDX1 decreased invasive cells of both , compared to the control , and the difference was significant ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS PRDX1 expression is low in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma tumors. PRDX1 suppressed the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cells.
