  Geographic clines offer insights about putative targets and agents of natural selection as well as tempo and mode of adaptation. However , demographic processes can lead to clines that are indistinguishable from adaptive divergence. Using the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria ( Diptera: Scathophagidae) , we examine quantitative genetic differentiation ( Q
