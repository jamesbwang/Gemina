  The association between migraine and allergy has remained a subject of debate for more than a century. To systemically investigate the interaction between children with antecedent allergic diseases and their future risks of migraine on reaching school age , we recruited 16,130 children aged 7-18 with migraine diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 , and 64,520 matched controls without a history of migraine. The ORs of migraine were calculated for the association with allergic diseases diagnosed before migraine diagnosis. The allergic diseases included atopic dermatitis<disease> , allergic conjunctivitis<disease> , allergic rhinitis ( AR) , and asthma. Children with preceding allergic diseases had a greater subsequent risk of migraine than the controls. Among the four evaluated diseases , AR had the highest adjusted OR ( aOR) of 2.17 ( 95 % CI 2.09 to 2.26). Children with all four allergic diseases had the highest aOR of 3.59 ( 95 % CI 2.91 to 4.44). Further , an increasing trend of aORs was observed with more allergic disease-associated medical consulting. Our study indicates that children with allergic diseases are at increased subsequent risk of migraine when they reach school age , and the risk shows a cumulative effect of more allergic diseases and more allergy-related healthcare.
