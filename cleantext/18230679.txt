  The empirical dietary inflammatory pattern ( EDIP) score has been associated with concentrations of circulating inflammatory biomarkers in European Americans. We used the EDIP score , a weighted sum of 18 food groups that characterizes dietary inflammatory potential based on circulating concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers , to test the hypothesis that a pro-inflammatory dietary pattern is associated with inflammatory biomarker concentrations in a US multi-ethnic population. In this cross-sectional study , we calculated EDIP scores using baseline food frequency questionnaire data from 31,472 women , aged 50-79 y , in the Women 's Health Initiative observational study and clinical trials. Circulating biomarkers outcomes at baseline were: C-reactive protein ( CRP) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , TNF receptor ( TNFR) 1 and 2 , and adiponectin. We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses to estimate absolute concentrations and relative differences in biomarker concentrations , overall and in subgroups of race/ethnicity and BMI ( body mass index) categories. Independent of energy intake , BMI , physical activity , and other potential confounding variables , higher EDIP scores were significantly associated with higher ( lower for adiponectin) absolute concentrations of all 6 biomarkers. On the relative scale , the percentage of difference in the concentration of biomarkers , among women in the highest compared to the lowest EDIP quintile , was: CRP , +13 % ( P-trend < 0.0001); IL-6 , +15 % ( P-trend < 0.0001); TNF-α , +7 % ( P-trend = 0.0007); TNFR1 , +4 % ( P-trend = 0.0009); TNFR2 , +5 % ( P-trend < 0.0001); and adiponectin , -13 % ( P-trend < 0.0001). These associations differed by racial/ethnic groups and by BMI categories. Whereas the absolute biomarker concentrations were lower among European-American women and among normal-weight women , the associations with diet were stronger than among women of African-American or Hispanic/Latino origin and among overweight and obese women. Findings demonstrate the successful replication of an empirical hypothesis-oriented a posteriori dietary pattern score in a multi-ethnic population of postmenopausal women , with subgroup differences by race/ethnicity and body<symptom> weight. Future research needs to apply the score in non-US populations.
