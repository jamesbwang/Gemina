  Drug-induced rhabdomyolysis ( DIR) is an idiosyncratic and fatal adverse drug reaction ( ADR) characterized in severe muscle injuries accompanied by multiple-organ failure. Limited knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis is the main obstacle to developing early biomarkers and prevention strategies. Given the lack of a centralized data resource to curate , organize , and standardize widespread DIR information , here we present a Drug-Induced Rhabdomyolysis Atlas ( DIRA) that provides DIR-related information , including: a classification scheme for DIR based on drug labeling information; postmarketing surveillance data of DIR; and DIR drug property information. To elucidate the utility of DIRA , we used precision dosing , concomitant use of DIR drugs , and predictive modeling development to exemplify strategies for idiosyncratic ADR ( IADR) management.
