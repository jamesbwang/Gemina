  To explore the potential role of qiliqiangxin ( QLQX) A traditional Chinese medicine and the involvement of angiotensin II receptor type 1 ( AGTR1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1) in diabetic mouse cardiac function. Intragastric QLQX was administered for 5 weeks after streptozotocin ( STZ) treatment. Additionally , Intraperitoneal injections of angiotensin II ( Ang II) or intragastric losartan ( Los) were administered to assess the activities of AGTR1 and TRPV1. Two-dimensional echocardiography and tissue histopathology were used to assess cardiac function Western blot was used to detect the autophagic biomarkers Such as light chain 3 P62 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 And transmission electron microscopy was used to count the number of autophagosomes. Decreased expression of TRPV1 and autophagic hallmarks and reduced numbers of autophagolysosomes as well as increased expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 1 and AGTR1 were observed in diabetic hearts. Blocking AGTR1 with Los mimicked the QLQX-mediated improvements in cardiac function Alleviated myocardial fibrosis<disease> and enabled autophagy Whereas Ang II abolished the beneficial effects of QLQX in wild type diabetic mice but not in TRPV1-/- diabetic mice. QLQX may improve diabetic cardiac function by regulating AGTR1/ TRPV1-mediated autophagy in STZ-induced diabetic mice.
