  Vitamin B-12 ( B-12) deficiency is still relatively common in low- , medium- , and high-income countries , mainly because of dietary inadequacy and , to a lesser extent , malabsorption. This narrative review is based on a systematic search of evidence on methods to assess B-12 bioavailability and technologies to enhance its absorption. A total of 2523 scientific articles identified in PubMed and 1572 patents identified in Orbit Intelligence were prescreened. Among the reviewed methods , Schilling 's test and/or its food-based version ( using cobalamin-labeled egg yolk) were used for decades but have been discontinued , largely because they required radioactive cobalt. The qualitative CobaSorb test , based on changes in circulating holo-transcobalamin before and after B-12 administration , and the 14C-labeled B-12 test for quantitative measurement of absorption of a low-dose radioactive tracer are currently the best available methods. Various forms of B-12 co-formulated with chemical enhancers ( ie , salcaprozate sodium , 8-amino caprylate) or supplied via biotechnological methods ( ie , microbiological techniques , plant cells expressing cobalamin binding proteins) , encapsulation techniques ( ie , emulsions , use of chitosan particles) , and alternative routes of administration ( ie , intranasal , transdermal administration) were identified as potential technologies to enhance B-12 absorption in humans. However , in most cases the evidence of absorption enhancement is limited.
