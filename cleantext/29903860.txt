  Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) is a deadly disease with no cure. Alternate conversion of angiotensin II ( AngII) to angiotensin- ( 1-7) ( Ang- ( 1-7)) by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2) resulting in Mas receptor ( Mas1) activation improves rodent models of PAH. Effects of recombinant human ( rh) ACE2 in human PAH are unknown. Our objective was to determine the effects of rhACE2 in PAH.We defined the molecular effects of Mas1 activation using porcine pulmonary arteries , measured AngII/Ang- ( 1-7) levels in human PAH and conducted a phase IIa , open-label pilot study of a single infusion of rhACE2 ( GSK2586881 , 0.2 or 0.4 mg Â· kg
