  Previous studies have shown that risk of cesarean section increases among multiparous women as interbirth interval increases. One possibility is that progress of labor may vary with interbirth interval , such that with longer intervals , labor curves of multiparas more closely resemble those of nulliparas. We sought to define labor curves among a cohort of multiparas with varying interbirth intervals. This was a retrospective cohort study of term multiparas with known interval from last delivery and only vaginal deliveries. Subjects were grouped by interval between the studied pregnancy and the most recent birth: 0 to 59 , 60 to 119 , and â‰¥ 120 months. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed effects model. Group slopes and intercepts were compared using model Groups did not differ significantly in demographic or obstetrical characteristics. Rate of dilation was similar between the 0 to 59 and 60 to 119 month groups ( Prolonged interbirth interval is not associated with slower active phase of labor.
