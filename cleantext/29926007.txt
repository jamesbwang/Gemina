  We compared 11C-choline and FDG PET/CT scan findings for the staging and restaging of prostate cancer. Twenty Japanese prostate cancer patients underwent 11C-choline and FDG PET/CT before ( n = 5) or after ( n = 15) treatment. Using a five-point scale , we compared these scanning modalities regarding patient- and lesion-based diagnostic performance for local recurrence , untreated primary tumor , and lymph node and bony metastases. Of the 20 patients , documented local lesions<symptom> , and node and bony metastases were present in 11 ( 55.0 %) , 9 ( 45.0 %) , and 13 ( 65.0 %) , respectively. The patient-based sensitivity/specificity/accuracy/ area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve ( AUC) values for 11C-choline-PET/CT for diagnosing local lesions<symptom> were 90.9 %/ 100 %/ 95.0 %/ 1.0 , whereas those for FDG-PET/CT were 45.5 %/ 100 %/ 75.0 %/ 0.773. Those for 11C-choline-PET/CT for node metastasis were 88.9 %/ 100 %/ 95.0 %/ 0.944 , and those for FDG-PET/CT were 44.4 %/ 100 %/ 75.0 %/ 0.722. Those for 11C-choline-PET/CT for bone metastasis were 84.6 %/ 100 %/ 90.0 %/ 0.951 , and those for FDG-PET/CT were 76.9 %/ 100 %/ 85.0 %/ 0.962. The AUCs for local lesion<symptom> and node metastasis differed significantly ( p = 0.0039 , p = 0.011 , respectively). The lesion-based detection rates of 11C-choline compared to FDG PET/CT for local lesion<symptom> , and node and bone metastases were 91.7 % vs. 41.7 % , 92.0 % vs. 32.0 % , and 94.8 % vs. 83.0 % ( p = 0.041 , p = 0.0030 , p < 0.0001) , respectively. 11C-choline-PET/CT is more useful for the staging and restaging of prostate cancer than FDG-PET/CT in Japanese men.
