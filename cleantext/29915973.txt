  To determine the effect of an orogastric tube for calibration of the gastric pouch on percentage excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( % EWL) and percentage total weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( % TWL) after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB). A retrospective case-matched control study in 132 patients. Group A ( a 40 French orogastric tube was used to calibrate the gastric pouch) was compared to group B ( no orogastric tube was used). All other surgical steps were identical in both groups. Postoperative % EWL and % TWL were recorded at 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , and 24 months postoperatively. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were similar for both groups; a mean age of 43.6 years , 84 % of the patients were female and mean initial BMI was 44 kg/m The use of a calibration tube for creating the gastric pouch may lead to a higher % EWL and % TWL at 2-year follow-up. The standardization of the technique for LRYGB is desirable to achieve the maximum success rate in the surgical therapy of morbid obesity.
