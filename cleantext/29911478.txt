  Research indicates women who perpetrate intimate partner violence ( IPV) experience both more frequent and more severe IPV victimization. However , the IPV field needs additional research to understand the complex relationship between various forms of IPV victimization ( e.g. , psychological , physical , sexual) and IPV perpetration by women. In particular , the field needs a better understanding of the unique interplay of various forms of IPV victimization and perpetration among female system-involved survivors ( i.e. , female survivors involved with child protective services and/or the court system and mandated to services). Such understanding would aid extant efforts to ensure that mandated services address the experiences and meet the needs of these system-involved women. To address this knowledge gap , we conducted an exploratory , secondary data analysis using cross-sectional baseline data collected as part of a larger evaluation study of a psychoeducational therapeutic IPV and parenting program for system-involved IPV survivors mandated to services ( N = 73). Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that both psychological and physical IPV victimization were uniquely associated with the perpetration of psychological and physical abuse by system-involved female IPV survivors. Furthermore , our examination of the interaction between physical and psychological victimization and its impact on perpetration revealed that higher levels of both physical and psychological IPV victimization were associated with significantly higher levels of psychological perpetration ( p < .01) and increased likelihood of physical perpetration ( p < .05). Results are discussed in the context of service provision within systems , agencies , and programs targeting system-involved women mandated to services for IPV.
