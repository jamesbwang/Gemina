  Leptomeningeal metastasis ( LM) can occur as a late manifestation of breast cancer and has traditionally been diagnosed by CSF cytology; however , cytology suffers from low sensitivity and it is believed that many cases of LM go undiagnosed. Some studies have suggested the use of CA 15-3 in CSF ( CA 15-3 CSF) to aid in the detection of LM. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of CA 15-3 CSF to cytology for the detection and treatment monitoring of breast cancer LM. CA 15-3 CSF requests between 2014 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-two measurements from nine patients were from our health system and had corresponding CSF cytology measurements. Concordance between CA 15-3 CSF and CSF cytology was calculated. For patients with quantifiable CA 15-3 CSF , sequential determinations of CA 15-3 and cytology were compared over time to assess correlation of CA 15-3 CSF concentration and cytology with disease status. At the time of initial testing , seven of the nine patients ( 78 %) had positive cytology. Two samples ( 22 %) had quantifiable CA 15-3 , both of which were also positive by cytology. The positive concordance between all cytology and CA 15-3 measurements was 9 % ( 2/22) , while negative concordance was 100 % ( 30/30). Sequential CA 15-3 and cytology measurements showed a decrease in CA 15-3 that paralleled changes observed with cytology. In this cohort of patients , CA 15-3 CSF performance was neither superior nor complementary to cytology for the detection of LM , nor did the combination of CA 15-3 CSF and cytology improve performance over cytology alone.
