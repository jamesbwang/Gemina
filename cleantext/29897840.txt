  The learning curve is an important method of assessment of progression in the use of a new technique or device and , in the field of robotic surgery , is most commonly described for individual procedures , often concentrating on console time and outcomes. We contemplated whether a learning curve of the similar nature and duration was exhibited in the procedure-independent variable of docking time. The time from first incision to end of robot docking was found for a single surgeon 's first 55 robotic cases , which encompassed a range of pediatric urological procedures. Raw and cumulative summation ( CUSUM) data were found and plotted , with learning- and maintenance-phase times compared statistically. A classical learning curve of âˆ¼ 30 cases was found with a statistically significant reduction in time between learning and maintenance phases. A learning curve of similar nature and duration to procedure-specific analyses was found for docking time. The variability of port placement and robot positioning for multiple procedures further increases the significance of this result.
