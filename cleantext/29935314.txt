  In the last decades endoscopic techniques have been increasingly used in neurosurgery as they may offer a valuable close-up view of the working area through a minimally invasive surgical corridor. Herein , we present an inexpensive and efficient endoscopic surgical model using a borescope , which was used for a `` modified pure endoscopic approach '' to the pineal region. A borescope video camera was connected to a 16 inches personal computer monitor. A standard midline suboccipital craniotomy was performed on 2 cadaveric heads in the Concorde position. Then , a `` borescopic '' supracerebellar infratentorial approach was executed , thus reaching the pineal region which was exposed through an extensive arachnoid dissection. Using the above described model , we were able to provide excellent exposure of the main neurovascular structures of the pineal region , as showed by the intraoperative videos. In one of the specimen we identified an incidental pineal cyst<symptom> that was meticulously dissected and removed. Our proposed `` borescopic '' surgical model may represent an inexpensive and efficient alternative to conventional endoscopic techniques , and could be used for training purposes as well as even for clinical procedures , after a proper validation , particularly in economically challenging environments.
