  To investigate the effect and regulatory mechanism of puerarin on pulmonary arterial hypertension due to hypoxia and the possible accompanying pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , The rat model of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and the rat model of hypoxia were established. Totally 18 clean-grade SD rats were fed and randomly divided into normal control group , model group and hypoxia + medicine group. Each group received intraperitoneal injection 30 min before modeling every day; hypoxia + medicine group was injected with 20 mg · kg ⁻¹ puerarin. Normal control group and model group were injected with the equal volume of 0.9 % NaCl solution. Normal control group was cultured under normal conditions in the laboratory , while model group and hypoxia + medicine group were cultured in ahypoxia environment for 21 days to observe rat hypoxic characteristics and make the preliminary judgment about modeling. Afterwards , small animal echocardiography , right cardiac catheterization , HE dyeing and other experiments were used to verify the successful modeling , and puerarin has a therapeutic effect in pulmonary hypertension caused by hypoxia in SD rats. Fluorescence quantitative PCR , Western blot and immunofluorescence method were used to detect the changes caused by hypoxia pulmonary fibrosis-associated protein. It was found that puerarin could be given in anoxia to promote the expressions of CD31 , VE-cadherin , inhibit the expressions of α-SMA , vimentin and fibronection , namely the inhibition of vascular wall thickening. Puerarin has the therapeutic effect on the pulmonary hypertension and accompanying pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> in rats induced by hypoxia.
