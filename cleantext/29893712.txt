  The capture and translocation of biomolecules through nanometer-scale pores are processes with a potentially large number of applications , and hence they have been intensively studied in recent years. The aim of this paper is to review existing models of the capture process by a nanopore , together with some recent experimental data of short single- and double-stranded DNA captured by the Cytolysin A ( ClyA) nanopore. ClyA is a transmembrane protein of bacterial origin which has been recently engineered through site-specific mutations , to allow the translocation of double- and single-stranded DNA. A comparison between theoretical estimations and experiments suggests that for both cases the capture is a reaction-limited process. This is corroborated by the observed salt dependence of the capture rate , which we find to be in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.
