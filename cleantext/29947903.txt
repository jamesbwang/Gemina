  An analytical method based on ultrasound-assisted extraction and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction ( DLLME) clean-up has been developed and validated for the determination of 31 emerging pollutants in root vegetables. The target compounds were four preservatives , six perfluoroalkyl compounds , six UV filters , two biocides , eight anionic surfactants , three nonionic surfactants , and two plasticizers. The type and volume of the extraction solvent , those of the disperser solvent , the pH and NaCl content of the DLLME aqueous phase , the amount of sample , and the sonication time were optimized. Box-Behnken experimental design was applied to select the best extraction conditions. Matrix-matched calibration curves were used for quantification. Four internal standards were used to compensate for residual matrix effects. Good linearity ( R
