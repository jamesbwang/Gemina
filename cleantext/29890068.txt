  The photoinduced electron transfer ( ET) reaction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD) photolyase plays an essential role in its DNA repair reaction , and the molecular mechanism of the ET reaction has attracted a large number of experimental and theoretical studies. We investigated the quantum mechanical nature of their ET reactions , characterized by multiple ET pathways of the CPD photolyase derived from Anacystis nidulans<pathogen>. Using the generalized Mulliken-Hush ( GMH) method and the bridge green function ( GF) methods , we estimated the electronic coupling matrix element , T
