  To assess the differences between anthropometric indices in predicting dyslipidemia in Chinese urban adult population and find optimal cut-off points. A total of 1615 subjects with information on key variables were enrolled by multistage stratified sampling process from March to July in 2016. Information on sociodemographic characteristics ( age , gender , nationality , education and income) , and health and disease history of subjects was collected. Height , weight , waist circumference ( WC) , hip circumference , body fat percentage ( % Fat) , and fasting lipid profiles were measured for each participant. The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve was used to compare the efficacy of the various anthropometric indices to discriminate those with and without dyslipidemia. Waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) had the largest area under the ROC curve ( AUC) for dyslipidemia in women ( 0. 744). There weresignificant differences between AUC of WHtR and that of WC ( P = 0. 008) , body mass index ( BMI , P = 0. 004) , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR , P = 0. 005) , and % Fat ( P < 0. 001) in pairwise comparisons. Cut-off point for WHtR was 0. 50 for dyslipidemia in urban adult women. Although the AUC for BMI was the highest for dyslipidemia in men , it did not differ significantly from other indices ( P all > 0. 05). Cut-off point for BMI was24. 1 kg/m ~ 2 for dyslipidemia in urban adult men. WHtR and BMI might be optimal indices for dyslipidemia for Chinese urban adult women and men , respectively. Regional and sexual differences should be considered when choosing proper indices.
