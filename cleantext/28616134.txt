  Co-sensitization of molecular dyes and catalysts on semiconductor surfaces is a promising strategy to build photoelectrodes for solar fuel production. In such a photoelectrode , understanding the charge transfer reactions between the molecular dye , catalyst and semiconductor material is key to guide further improvement of their photocatalytic performance. Herein , femtosecond mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy is used , for the first time , to probe charge transfer reactions leading to catalyst reduction on co-sensitized nickel oxide ( NiO) photocathodes. The NiO films were co-sensitized with a molecular dye and a proton reducing catalyst from the family of ( FeFe) ( bdt) ( CO)
