  Proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( PVR) is a challenging pathological condition , often causing failure of retinal detachment surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a delivery system of bioactive proteins using anionic and cationic gelatin microspheres and to establish a new PVR model in rabbits by intraocular sustained delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) and interferon-beta ( IFNβ). Anionic and cationic gelatin microspheres were prepared and immersed in bFGF and IFNβ solution , respectively , to yield a polyion complex between gelatin matrix and a bioactive protein. The bFGF-impregnated microspheres were injected into the subretinal space in rabbit eyes. At week 2 , the IFNβ-impregnated microspheres also were injected into the same space. Control eyes received gelatin microspheres without bFGF or IFNß , or both. The eyes then were observed for 8 weeks by ophthalmoscopy , fundus photography , and fluorescein angiography. The eyes also were evaluated histologically. In the group with both bFGF and IFNβ , the number of eyes with more severe PVR increased over time. Histologic examination showed retinal folds. In contrast , no proliferative changes were seen in any control groups. Subretinal implantation of bFGF and IFNβ-impregnated gelatin microspheres induced reproducible PVR in rabbit eyes. This study guaranteed delivery of bioactive proteins with gelatin microspheres.
