  Previous research has demonstrated an effect of consonantal direction on preference , showing that words following inward articulation dynamics ( e.g. , EMOK or OPIK) are generally liked more than words following outward dynamics ( e.g. , EKOM or OKIP). The present studies extended this line of research by hypothesizing an effect of consonantal direction on recognition memory , specifically familiarity. In a total of 7 experimental studies ( N = 1043) , we tested and confirmed this hypothesis , consistently finding increased hits and false alarms for inward compared to outward pseudo-words. This difference was found to be based on a higher perceived familiarity for inward compared to outward pseudo-words. Alternative explanations of an affirmation tendency or a recollection advantage were ruled out in Experiments 4 and 5. Experiments 6a and 6b examined the role of articulation fluency and liking as potential mediators of the effect , but found that neither mediated the influence of consonantal direction on familiarity. Thus , the in-out familiarity effect documented here seems to be a phenomenon that is distinct from the previously described in-out preference effect.
