  To assess the economic burden of epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) in incident patients and the burden by disease stage in Spain. We developed a Markov model from a social perspective simulating the natural history of EOC and its four stages , with a 10-year time horizon , 3-week cycles , 3 % discount rate , and 2016 euros. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were estimated by disease stage. Direct healthcare costs ( DHC) included early screening , genetic counselling , medical visits , diagnostic tests , surgery , chemotherapy , hospitalizations , emergency services , and palliative care. Direct non-healthcare costs ( DNHC) included formal and informal care. Indirect costs ( IC) included labour productivity losses due to temporary and permanent leaves , and premature death. Epidemiology data and resource use were taken from the literature and validated for Spain by the OvarCost group using a Delphi method. The total burden of EOC over 10 years was 3102 mill euros: 15.1 % in stage I , 3.9 % in stage II , 41.0 % in stage III , and 40.2 % in stage IV. Annual average cost/patient was $ 24,111 and it was $ 8,641; $ 14,184; $ 33,858 , and $ 42,547 in stages I-IV , respectively. Of total costs , 71.2 % were due to DHC , 24.7 % to DNHC , and 4.1 % to IC. EOC imposes a significant economic burden on the national healthcare system and society in Spain. Investment in better early diagnosis techniques might increase survival and patients ' quality of life. This would likely reduce costs derived from late stages , consequently leading to a substantial reduction of the economic burden associated with EOC.
