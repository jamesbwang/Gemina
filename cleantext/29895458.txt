  Recent advances in nanotechnology applied in forensic sciences have contributed to consider new approaches including chemical evaluation of latent fingermarks. Significant improvement to the detection of small organic molecules has been reached with matrix-free methods associated to laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The present study investigated the application of mesocellular siliceous foam ( MCF) as an ionizing agent for laser desorption/ionization ( LDI-MS) analysis of fingermarks as a proof of concept research. Fingermarks from three different donors were deposited directly onto a MALDI target plate and Î±-CHCA matrix solution , MCF ethanolic suspension or MCF/magnetic powder mixture were used for treatment. Microscopy characterization of MCF support showed particles with irregular morphology and variable sizes , and a unordered porous surface with pores diameter ranging from about 10 to 20 nm. Results showed less intense peaks in the spectra produced by the MCF support ( control). Analysis of fingermarks showed ions related to endogenous and exogenous molecular components , including possible lipids from human sebum and quaternary ammonium cations commonly present in cosmetics. Promising and reproducible results were obtained for the fingermarks dusted with the MCF/magnetic powder mixture. Considering the forensic applications of nanomaterials for the analysis of small molecules in biological samples by matrix-free LDI techniques , the advantages of silica based materials should be further investigated.
