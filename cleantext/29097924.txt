  This study investigated the spatial relationship of 2-deoxy-2- ( Seventeen patients with PET/MR scans were identified. There was a significant inverse correlation between SUV In this hypothesis-generating study , a consistent inverse correlation between voxel SUV and ADC values was seen in SCCAs and poorly differentiated tumors. On univariate statistical analysis , correlation between voxel SUV and ADC values was prognostic for DFS.
