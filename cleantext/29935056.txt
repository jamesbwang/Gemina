  l-Kynurenine is an endogenous metabolite generated by the catabolic pathway of l-tryptophan and it could be a potential biomarker to test the efficacy of several checkpoint inhibitors that have already reached the clinical trials in the antitumor therapy. Thus , a molecularly imprinted polymer specific for the recognition of this metabolite was synthesized and used as innovative system in solid-phase extraction technique for the specific extraction and quantification of l-kynurenine in human urine. The off-line system was firstly tested on l-kynurenine standard solutions , allowing recoveries up to 97.7 % ( relative standard deviation = 2.2 %) and then applied to fortified and deproteinated human urine samples , where a recovery of 84.1 % ( relative standard deviation = 3.1 %) was obtained. The method was validated and it revealed a good linearity in the range of 0.157-20 Î¼g/mL ( r
