  To investigate the association between periodontal<disease> disease<disease> severity and metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) in a group of Vietnamese patients. A total of 412 participants ( 114 males , 298 females , average age 57.8 ± 5.7 years) including 206 patients with MetS and 206 participants without MetS were selected for this study. Information on sociodemographic characteristics , dental behaviours and smoking status was collected from a self-administrated questionnaire. Periodontal status including plaque index ( PI) , gingival index ( GI) pocket depth ( PD) and clinical attachment level ( CAL) was recorded. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between severity of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and MetS with adjustments for related confounders. The prevalence of moderate and severe periodontitis<disease> assessed by GI , PD and CAL was all significantly higher in the MetS group than in the control group and was significantly increased by a number of MetS components. Logistic regression , adjusted for confounders , showed that people with mean PI ≥ 2.51 or GI ≥ 1.01 or number of teeth with bleeding on probing of ≥ 20 teeth or PD ≥ 3.66 or CAL ≥ 3.66 showed a significant association with greater OR for MetS compared to counterparts ( P < .05). The OR for MetS was 4.06 ( 95 % CI 2.11-7.84) in severe periodontitis<disease> patients compared to non-periodontitis participants ( P < .001). Much severe and extensive periodontal<disease> disease<disease> was found in MetS participants and increased with number of MetS components. Participants with higher periodontal parameters had a higher risk of MetS.
