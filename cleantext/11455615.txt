  In multiple sclerosis ( MS) , demyelinated CNS lesions<symptom> fail to sufficiently remyelinate , despite the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs) capable of differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes. MS lesions<symptom> contain damaged myelin debris that can inhibit OPC maturation and hinder repair. rHIgM22 is an experimental human recombinant IgM antibody that promotes remyelination in animal models and is being examined in patients with MS. rHIgM22 binds to CNS myelin and partially rescues OPC process outgrowth on myelin. Since rHIgM22 does not affect OPC process outgrowth in vitro on permissive substrate , we examined the possibility that it acts by enhancing phagocytic clearance of myelin debris by microglia. In this study , we tested if rHIgM22 binding could tag myelin for microglial phagocytosis. A mouse microglial cell line and primary rat microglia were treated with myelin and rHIgM22 and assayed for myelin phagocytosis. We found that: 1) rHIgM22 stimulates myelin phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner; 2) rHIgM22-mediated myelin phagocytosis requires actin polymerization; and 3) rHIgM22-stimulation of myelin phagocytosis requires activity of rHIgM22 Fc domain and activation of Complement Receptor 3. Since myelin inhibits OPC differentiation , stimulation of phagocytic clearance of damaged myelin may be an important means by which rHIgM22 promotes remyelination.
