  Low C-C chemokine receptor 1 ( CCR1) and interleukin ( IL) -10 expression is associated with risk of Behçet 's disease ( BD). The objective of the present study was to clarify the pathological roles of CCR1 and IL10 loci identified by previous BD genome-wide association studies ( GWASs). M1 and M2 macrophages ( Mφ) were differentiated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF) from peripheral monocytes of healthy control subjects ( HC) and patients with BD. Expression of CD68 and CD163 was evaluated to test for Mφ polarization. CCR1 and IL-10 messenger RNA ( mRNA) and protein expression was compared according to CCR1 and IL10 single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) genotypes. The migratory ability of M1 and M2 Mφ toward CCR1 ligand macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP) -1 α was compared. The ratio of M1 and M2 Mφ in skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> of BD and systemic sclerosis ( SSc) , which was reported to be M2 Mφ-dominant , was compared. To examine the plasticity of polarized Mφ , the differentiated cells were cultured with either the same or the other culture condition. Preferential expression of CD163 , CCR1 , and IL-10 was found in M2 Mφ compared with M1 Mφ. M2 Mφ migrated more sensitively to low concentrations of MIP-1α than M1 Mφ did. BD-derived M1 Mφ showed higher CCR1 surface expression than HC-derived M1 Mφ did. IL10 and CCR1 mRNA expression differences were observed by GWAS-identified SNP genotypes in polarized Mφ. BD skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> showed M1 Mφ predominance compared with SSc skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. A plasticity assay revealed that M-CSF restored IL-10 synthesis and reduced IL-6 production by M1 Mφ. The present study reveals that GWAS-identified SNPs contribute to M1 Mφ-predominant inflammation<symptom> in BD. Our data also suggest that the skewed Mφ polarization is correctable by immunological intervention.
