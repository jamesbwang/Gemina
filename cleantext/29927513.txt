  Leigh and colleagues ( Leigh et al , BJOG 2018) have performed a cost-consequence analysis using data from a randomized trial of 602 hypertensive and mostly nulliparous women in India. The trial compared oral misoprostol 25-50 mcg every two hours ( for a maximum of 24 h) to cervical ripening with a Foley catheter followed by oxytocin. For this analysis they focused on the trial 's clinical outcomes , in particular the significantly higher rates of vaginal delivery within 24 h ( 57 % vs 47 %) and lower mean per-patient costs in the misoprostol group ( $ 117.5 vs $ 138.1).
