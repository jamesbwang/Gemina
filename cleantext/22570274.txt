  In MRI , subject motion results in image artifacts. High-resolution 3D scans , like MPRAGE , are particularly susceptible to motion because of long scan times and acquisition of data over multiple-shots. Such motion related artifacts have been shown to cause a bias in cortical measures extracted from segmentation of high-resolution MPRAGE images. Prospective motion correction ( PMC) techniques have been developed to help mitigate artifacts due to subject motion. In this work , high-resolution MPRAGE images are acquired during intentional head motion to evaluate the effectiveness of navigator-based PMC techniques to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical morphometry measures obtained from image segmentation. The contribution of reacquiring segments of k-space affected by motion to the overall performance of PMC is assessed. Additionally , the effect of subject motion on subcortical structure volumes is investigated. In the presence of head motion , navigator-based PMC is shown to improve both the accuracy and reproducibility of cortical and subcortical measures. It is shown that reacquiring segments of k-space data that are corrupted by motion is an essential part of navigator-based PMC performance. Subcortical structure volumes are not affected by motion in the same way as cortical measures; there is not a consistent underestimation.
