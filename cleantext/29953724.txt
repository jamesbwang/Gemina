  The chiral , triangular-shape hexaimine macrocycles ( trianglimines) , bearing bulky alkynyl or aryl substituents were synthesized and studied by means of experimental and theoretical methods. The macrocyclization reactions are driven by the extraordinary stability of the trianglimine ring and provided products with high yields. Electrostatic repulsion between imine nitrogen atoms and the substituents forced anti conformation of the aromatic linkers. While the DFT-optimized structure of 7 is D â‚ƒ- symmetrical , in the crystal , the macrocycle adopts a bowl-like molecular shape. The macrocycle self-assembles into tail-to-tail dimers by mutual interdigitation of aromatic moieties. Contrary , macrocycle 8 adopts a rigid pillararene-like conformation. The nature of substituent significantly affects the electronic properties of the linker. As a result , unexpectedly high exiton Cotton effects are observed in ECD spectra. The origin of these effects was a subject of in-depth study.
