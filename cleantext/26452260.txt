  The disorder of lipid metabolism is pathologically linked to hyperlipidemia , lipid storage disease , obesity and other related diseases. Intriguingly , recent studies have revealed that lipid metabolism disorders play an important role in carcinogenesis and development as well , since they cause abnormal expression of various genes , proteins , and dysregulation of cytokines and signaling pathways. More importantly , lipid-lowering drugs and anti-lipid per-oxidation treatment have been showing their advantages in clinic , in comparison with other anti-cancer drugs with high toxicity. Thus , further elucidation of molecular mechanism between lipid metabolism and cancer is essential in developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of human cancers.
