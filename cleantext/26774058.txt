  Defining units that can be afforded legal protection is a crucial , albeit challenging , step in conservation planning. As we illustrate with a case study of the red wolf ( Canis<pathogen> rufus) from the southeastern United States , this step is especially complex when the evolutionary history of the focal taxon is uncertain. The US Endangered Species Act ( ESA) allows listing of species , subspecies , or Distinct Population Segments ( DPSs) of vertebrates. Red wolves were listed as an endangered species in 1973 , and their status remains precarious. However , some recent genetic studies suggest that red wolves are part of a small wolf species ( C. lycaon) specialized for heavily forested habitats of eastern North<pathogen> America , whereas other authors suggest that red wolves arose , perhaps within the last ~ 400 years , through hybridization between gray wolves ( C. lupus) and coyotes ( C. latrans). Using published genetic , morphological , behavioral , and ecological data , we evaluated whether each evolutionary hypothesis would lead to a listable unit for red wolves. Although the potential hybrid origin of red wolves , combined with abundant evidence for recent hybridization with coyotes , raises questions about status as a separate species or subspecies , we conclude that under any proposed evolutionary scenario red wolves meet both criteria to be considered a DPS: they are Discrete compared with other conspecific populations , and they are Significant to the taxon to which they belong. As population-level units can qualify for legal protection under endangered-species legislation in many countries throughout the world , this general approach could potentially be applied more broadly.
