  To evaluate participant-related variables associated with missing assessment ( s) at follow-up visits during a longitudinal research study. This is a prospective , longitudinal , multi-site study of 196 acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) survivors. More than 30 relevant sociodemographic , physical status , and mental health variables ( representing participant characteristics prior to ARDS , at hospital discharge , and at the immediately preceding follow-up visit) were evaluated for association with missed assessments at 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24-month follow-up visits ( 89-95 % retention rates) , using binomial logistic regression. Most participants were male ( 56 %) , white ( 58 %) , and â‰¤ high school education ( 64 %). Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with missed assessments at the initial 3-month visit or subsequent visits. The number of dependencies in Activities of Daily Living ( ADLs) at hospital discharge was associated with higher odds of missed assessments at the initial visit ( OR: 1.26 , 95 % CI: 1.12 , 1.43). At subsequent 6- , 12- , and 24 months visits , post-hospital discharge physical and psychological status were not associated with subsequent missed assessments. Instead , the following were associated with lower odds of missed assessments: indicators of poorer health prior to hospital admission ( inability to walk 5 min ( OR: 0.46; 0.23 , 0.91) , unemployment due to health ( OR: 0.47; 0.23 , 0.96) , and alcohol abuse ( OR: 0.53; 0.28 , 0.97)) and having the preceding visit at the research clinic rather than at home/facility , or by phone/mail ( OR: 0.54; 0.31 , 0.96). Inversely , variables associated with higher odds of missed assessments at subsequent visits include: functional dependency prior to hospital admission ( i.e. dependency with > = 2 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADLs) ( OR: 1.96; 1.08 , 3.52) , and missing assessments at preceding visit ( OR: 2.26; 1.35 , 3.79). During the recovery process after hospital discharge , dependencies in physical functioning ( e.g. ADLs , IADLs) prior to hospitalization and at hospital discharge were associated with higher odds of missed assessments. Conversely , other indicators of poorer health at baseline were associated with lower odds of missed assessments after the initial post-discharge visit. To reduce missing assessments , longitudinal clinical research studies may benefit from focusing additional resources on participants with dependencies in physical functioning prior to hospitalization and at hospital discharge.
