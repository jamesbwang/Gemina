  The current study is focusing on the role of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) , a substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) enzyme , and its signaling survival pathway in the cardioprotective mechanism of sitagliptin , a DPP-4 inhibitor. Male Wistar rats were randomized into 7 groups , sham , I/R , KT-5823 ( selective protein kinase ( PK) G inhibitor) , 5-HD ( selective mito-K Pretreatment with sitagliptin provided significant protection against I/R injury as manifested by decreasing , percentage of infarct size , suppressing the elevated ST segment , reducing the increased cardiac enzymes , as well as DPP-4 activity and elevating both heart rate ( HR) and left ventricular developed pressure ( LVDP). However , the addition of either blocker to sitagliptin regimen reversed partly its cardioprotective effects. Although I/R increased BNP content , it unexpectedly decreased that of cGMP; nevertheless , sitagliptin elevated both parameters , an effect that was not affected by the use of the two blockers. On the molecular level , sitagliptin decreased caspase-3 activity and downregulated the mRNA levels of BNP , Bax , and Cyp D , while upregulated that of Bcl2. The use of either KT-5823 or 5-HD with sitagliptin hindered its effect on the molecular markers tested. The results of the present study suggest that the cardioprotective effect of sitagliptin is mediated partly , but not solely , through the BNP/cGMP/PKG survival signaling pathway.
