  The oral bioaccessibility of several essential and toxic elements was investigated in raw and cooked commercially available seafood species from European markets. Bioaccessibility varied between seafood species and elements. Methylmercury bioaccessibility varied between 10 ( octopus) and 60 % ( monkfish). Arsenic ( > 64 %) was the toxic element showing the highest bioaccessibility. Concerning essential elements bioaccessibility in raw seafood , selenium ( 73 %) and iodine ( 71 %) revealed the highest percentages. The bioaccessibility of elements in steamed products increased or decreased according to species. For example , methylmercury bioaccessibility decreased significantly after steaming in all species , while zinc bioaccessibility increased in fish ( tuna and plaice) but decreased in molluscs<disease> ( mussel and octopus). Together with human exposure assessment and risk characterization , this study could contribute to the establishment of new maximum permissible concentrations for toxic elements in seafood by the European food safety authorities , as well as recommended intakes for essential elements.
