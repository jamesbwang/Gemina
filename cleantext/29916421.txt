  The aim of the present paper is to describe the development of a Brief Psychoanalytic Group therapy for contaminated sites and its application in the National Priority Contaminated Site of Casale Monferrato. Before presenting the core of the clinical intervention , a brief examination of some clinical features encountered working with malignant mesothelioma patients and their caregivers is offered. These aspects have been pivotal elements in the construction of a psychoanalytically oriented time-limited ( i.e. , 12 sessions) group therapy. This model of intervention was designed by one of the Authors ( AG) and is aimed at reducing the impact of living in a threatening place where both physical well-being and health are put to the test. At a psychological level , in fact , living in contaminated sites arouses death anxieties , which can deeply compromise the quality of time remaining to live together with loved ones after a fatal cancer diagnosis.
