  Voltage-gated ion channels are critical for neuronal integration. Some of these channels , however , are misregulated in several neurological disorders , causing both gain- and loss-of-function channelopathies in neurons. Using several transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , we find that sub-threshold voltage signals strongly influenced by hyperpolarization-activated , cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN) channels progressively deteriorate over chronological aging in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The degraded signaling via HCN channels in the transgenic mice is accompanied by an age-related global loss of their non-uniform dendritic expression. Both the aberrant signaling via HCN channels and their mislocalization could be restored using a variety of pharmacological agents that target the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER). Our rescue of the HCN channelopathy helps provide molecular details into the favorable outcomes of ER-targeting drugs on the pathogenesis and synaptic/cognitive deficits in AD mouse models , and implies that they might have beneficial effects on neurological disorders linked to HCN channelopathies.
