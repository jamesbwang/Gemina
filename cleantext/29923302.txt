  Corticosteroids have been a mainstay of immunosuppression following liver transplantation. However , evolution in the field of transplant immunology has produced steroid-free options , resulting in most transplant centers weaning steroids post-transplant within days to months- an evidence-based management decision. Patients with autoimmune hepatitis<disease> , however , receive corticosteroids prior to transplant. This raises the question of whether these patients should also be weaned from corticosteroids. In this review , we discuss the benefits of avoiding steroid use in this population of patients- an approach that not only avoids the adverse effects of corticosteroids , but does so without risking graft failure from recurrent autoimmune hepatitis<disease> or from acute cellular rejection.
