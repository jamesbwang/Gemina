  While the nutritional and physical health benefits of breastfeeding are well established , accumulating research demonstrates the far-reaching psychological effects of breastfeeding on children and their mothers. Here , we provide a non-exhaustive review of the empirical evidence , showing that breastfeeding impacts children 's brain , cognitive , and socio-emotional development. In mothers , research is presented indicating that breastfeeding influences mood , affect , stress , and maternal care. The current review aims to provide a broad overview of existing findings on the psychological effects of breastfeeding , highlighting the important role that breastfeeding plays across several dimensions of psychological functioning. We also discuss the potential mechanisms that may underpin the observed effects , provide a constructive commentary on the limitations of the existing work , and put forth some considerations when evaluating this line of research.
