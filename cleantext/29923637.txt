  Opioid use disorder ( OUD) is a substantial public health problem. Buprenorphine is an effective medication-assisted treatment ( MAT) for OUD , but access is difficult for patients , especially in rural locations. To improve access , the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 extended the ability to get a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat OUD to nurse practitioners ( NPs) and physician assistants ( PAs). This study summarizes the geographic distribution of waivered physicians , NPs , and PAs at the end of 2017 and compares it to the distribution of waivered physicians 5 years earlier. Using the DEA list of providers with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat OUD and the Area Health Resources File , we assigned waivered providers to counties in 1 of 4 geographic categories. We calculated the number of counties in each category that did not have a waivered provider and county provider to population ratios and then compared our results to the waivered workforce in 2012. The availability of a physician with a DEA waiver to provide office-based MAT has increased across all geographic categories since 2012. More than half of all rural counties ( 56.3 %) still lack a provider , down from 67.1 % in 2012. Almost one-third ( 29.8 %) of rural Americans compared to 2.2 % of urban Americans live in a county without a buprenorphine provider. NPs and PAs add otherwise lacking treatment availability in 56 counties ( 43 rural). Overall , MAT access has improved , but rural communities still experience treatment disparities.
