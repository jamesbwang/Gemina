  This study aimed to identify risk indicators associated with periodontitis<disease> and the contribution of each of the indicators towards the prevalence , extent and severity of periodontitis<disease> in a rural Indian population. A cross-sectional study design was used to collect data according to National Survey of Adult Oral Health Australia guidelines. A multistage stratified random sampling was followed to select 1401 participants , who were in the age group of 35-54 years.

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.3. The univariate , bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the risk indicators of prevalence , extent and severity of periodontitis<disease> Population attributable fraction was estimated for each of the significant risk indicators of prevalence and extent. In this study , factors such as age , education , tobacco chewing and plaque accumulation were significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis<disease> Age , socioeconomic status , method of tooth cleaning , alcohol consumption and plaque accumulation were significant risk indicators for generalized periodontitis<disease> Age , tobacco chewing and plaque were associated with severity of periodontitis<disease> in the population. The rural population had a high prevalence of periodontitis<disease> Sociodemographic factors , poor oral hygiene , tobacco and alcohol were the main risk indicators attributable to
