  To study the effect of 6-week intensive training on renal function in rats and the mechanism of exercise-induced proteinuria<symptom>. Thirty-six male SD rats , aged 6 weeks , were divided into two groups , including a control group ( C , Compared with group C , the serum testosterone/cortisone ( T/C) of group M was decreased significantly ( The effects of 6-week intensive training on renal function in rats and the mechanism of exercise-induced proteinuria<symptom> may be that overtraining can induce the continuous excitation of Reninrenin activity in renal and circulating blood , down-regulated the expression of Nephrin , lead to abnormality of renal structure and function , and
