  Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS) is a prevalent illness in the United States that accounts for 18-22 million physician visits annually. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery ( AAO-HNS) has defined diagnostic criteria , but a recent study demonstrated that nearly all patients diagnosed by nonspecialists did not meet these criteria. In this study we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic rate of CRS by primary care physicians and otolaryngologists. We retrospectively reviewed a random sample of adult patients diagnosed with CRS in 2016 , based on ICD-10 codes from primary care and otolaryngology departments. Patients with previous CRS diagnosis , previous sinus surgery , and related comorbidities were excluded. A total of 502 patients with a new CRS diagnosis were analyzed ( 308 from primary care , 194 from otolaryngology). The percentage of diagnoses meeting the criteria was significantly higher from otolaryngology ( 28.9 % vs 0.97 % , p < 0.0001) , but was low in both cohorts. Symptom duration < 12 weeks was higher in primary care ( 81.6 % vs 53.6 % , p < 0.0001) , as was lack of evidence of inflammation<symptom> ( 97.4 % vs 50.0 % , p < 0.0001). Having < 2 of the required symptoms was significantly higher in otolaryngology ( 63.8 % vs 50.8 % , p = 0.013). The most commonly unevaluated symptom was decreased sense of smell ( 97.7 % in primary care , 69.1 % in otolaryngology encounters). CRS diagnoses commonly do not meet the diagnostic criteria outlined by the AAO-HNS in both primary care and otolaryngology. As a specialty , we should aim to improve our adherence to the guidelines and educate our primary care colleagues to better identify patients with CRS and initiate appropriate treatment.
