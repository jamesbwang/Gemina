  Dilute acid polymerizes degassed , aqueous acrylamide with concomitant gelation , without the need for added free radical initiator or cross-linking agent. This reaction is accelerated by sonication or UV irradiation , but inhibited by adventitious oxygen or the addition of a free radical inhibitor , suggesting an acid-accelerated free radical process. The resulting hydrogels are thixotropic in nature and partially disrupted by the addition of chaotropic agents , indicating the importance of hydrogen bonding to the 3D network. This discovery was made while trying to prepare pectin-polyacrylamide hydrogels. We observed that pectin initiated the gelation of acrylamide , but only if the aqueous pectin samples had a pH lower than ca. 5.
