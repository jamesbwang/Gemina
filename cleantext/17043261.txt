  Chronic suppurative otitis<disease> media<disease> ( CSOM) is a common public health problem worldwide and a major cause of hearing impairment especially in developing countries. The role of Mannose-Binding Lectin ( MBL) , a component of innate immunity , in CSOM has not been studied. The aim of the study was to examine whether MBL deficiency was more frequently present in cases group of tubotympanic CSOM patients rather than healthy subjects. This was an analytic observational study. Subjects were enrolled in the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic at Margono Soekarjo Hospital , Purwokerto , Indonesia. An independent From 36 tubotympanic CSOM patients , there were 8 ( 22.22 %) patients with MBL deficiency ( MBL level < 100 ng/ml) , while no deficiency was found in the control group. The mean of MBL level in cases group was 354.88 ng/ml , with the lowest level being 0.001 ng/ml and the highest level 690.24 ng/ml , while in the control group MBL level mean was 376.27 with the lowest level being 188.71 and the highest level 794.54 ng/ml. There was no significant difference of MBL serum level between tubotympanic CSOM and control group. However , the presence of subjects with MBL deficiency in the tubotympanic CSOM group might be considered as playing a role in the tubotympanic CSOM.
