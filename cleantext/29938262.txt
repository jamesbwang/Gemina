  A donor ( D)/ acceptor ( A) assembly reaction using the paddlewheel-type diruthenium ( ii , ii) complex<pathogen> ( Ru2 ( 3,5-F2PhCO2) 4 ( THF) 2) ( 3,5-F2PhCO2- = 3,5-difluorobenzoate; abbreviated hereafter as ( Ru2)) as D and 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane derivatives ( TCNQRx; 2,5-R-substituted TCNQ) as A in a DCM/TCE or DCE solvent system ( DCM = dichloromethane , TCE = 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane , DCE = 1,2-dichloroethane) led to the formation of D2A-type two-dimensional layered compounds ( ( Ru2 ( 3,5-F2PhCO2) 4) 2 ( TCNQRx)) · nsolv ( Rx = H2 ( 1) , Rx = Me2 , ( 2) , and Rx = ( OEt) 2 ( 3)). All the compounds had similar two-dimensional fishnet-type structures , where the two ( Ru2) units were fully coordinated with the four cyano groups of TCNQRx. The compounds 1-3 were categorized as a one-electron transferred ionic state ( 1e-I) with D +- A-- D formulation ( D + ( triple bond , length as m-dash) ( RuII , III2) +; A- ( triple bond , length as m-dash) TCNQRx˙-). This subunit state formally derived a ferrimagnetically ordered state composed of up-spins with S = 1 for ( RuII , II2) and S = 3/2 for ( RuII , III2) + and a down-spin of S = 1/2 for TCNQRx˙- , with antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions in each layer. Eventually , 1-3 became three-dimensional ferrimagnets with Curie temperatures TC = 93 , 93 , and 92 K , respectively , owing to the presence of interlayer ferromagnetic interactions. The interlayer translational distances ( l2) for the three compounds were 10.56 , 10.54 , and 10.84 Å , respectively , which agreed with the empirical prediction based on the threshold value of l2 > 10.3 Å for a valid ferromagnetic interaction.
