  Aflatoxin B1 ( AFB1) , deoxynivalenol ( DON) , HT-2 , ochratoxin A ( OTA) , zearalenone ( ZEA) are the most common mycotoxins that are found in corn-based animal feed which have multiple toxic effects on animals and humans. Previous studies reported that these mycotoxins impaired mammalian oocyte quality. However , the effective concentrations of mycotoxins to animal oocytes were different. In this study we aimed to compare the sensitivity of mouse and porcine oocytes to AFB1 , DON , HT-2 , OTA , and ZEA for mycotoxin research. We adopted the polar body extrusion rate of mouse and porcine oocyte as the standard for the effects of mycotoxins on oocyte maturation. Our results showed that 10 μM AFB1 and 1 μM DON significantly affected porcine oocyte maturation compared with 50 μM AFB1 and 2 μM DON on mouse oocytes. However , 10 nM HT-2 significantly affected mouse oocyte maturation compared with 50 nM HT-2 on porcine oocytes. Moreover , 5 μM OTA and 10 μM ZEA significantly affected porcine oocyte maturation compared with 300 μM OTA and 50 μM ZEA on mouse oocytes. In summary , our results showed that porcine oocytes were more sensitive to AFB1 , DON , OTA , and ZEA than mouse oocytes except HT-2 toxin.
