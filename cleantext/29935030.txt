  Age and gender-related variability of main lymphocyte<symptom> subsets ( T , B and NK cell absolute counts and percentages from Ly; T4 , T8 and DN cell absolute counts and percentages from lymphocytes and from T cells; T4: T8 and T: B ratios) was studied in a large cohort of pediatric patients ( 2 days- 17 years) at yearly intervals. 4128 6-color TBNK tests performed on BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer were assessed; patients with immune deficiencies and tumors were not included. The study revealed significant age and gender-related changes in all subsets. Absolute counts of T , B , T4 cells dropped from neonates to adolescents , decrease of T8 and NK cells was milder; relative count of T cells increased with age and that of B cells decreased; T4: T8 ratio went down and T: B ratio grew. Total T , T4 cells and T4: T8 ratio were significantly higher in girls , while T8 , NK and DN cells- in boys; significantly higher relative and absolute B cell counts in boys appeared in adolescence. We compared our results with reference values for healthy children ( Tosato et al. , 2015) , there was a good concordance , except for DN cells. Advantages of using patient cohort instead of healthy children as reference , possibilities for adjusting age and gender-specific reference ranges and potential international data pooling are discussed.
