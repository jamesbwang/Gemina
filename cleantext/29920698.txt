  Long-term oral nucleos ( t) ide analogue ( NUC) therapy in hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>)- related compensated cirrhotics prevents clinical decompensation but not hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) development. To define the clinical features and outcomes of HCC in long-term NUC-treated HBV patients. All HCCs developing between 2005 and 2016 in NUC-treated HBV<pathogen> patients under surveillance were studied , excluding those that occurred within the first 6 months of therapy. Clinical features of HCC , alpha faetoprotein ( AFP) patterns and patients ' outcome were studied. Seventy-six HCC patients were included. Median age was 67 ( 40-83) years , 84 % males , 96 % Caucasian , 95 % HBeAg-negative , 96 % with undetectable HBV<pathogen> DNA , 83 % with normal ALT levels , and 92 % with compensated cirrhosis. Median serum AFP levels were 4 ( 1-3615) ng/mL ( > 7 ng/mL in 36 %). HCC was monofocal in 78 % , had a median diameter of 20 ( 6-57) mm and was in its early stage in 92 % which allowed potentially curative treatments in 78 % ( 39 % ablation , 28 % surgical resection , 11 % liver transplantation). Overall , a complete response was obtained in 61 ( 80 %) patients: in 40 after a first-line treatment , in 3 after the second-line treatment , in 2 after the third-line treatment , while 16 underwent liver transplantation ( 8 as second line). During 45 ( 7-144) months after HCC diagnosis , 19 patients died , 84 % from HCC progression. The median time to recurrence was 20.2 ( 3-53) months , and the cumulative 5-year liver-related survival was 74 %. HCCs developing in patients under long-term NUC treatment were single , small tumours , amenable to curative therapies able to confer excellent 5-year survival rates.
