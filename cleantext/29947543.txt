  Diabetes increases the risk and worsens the progression of cognitive impairment. The hippocampus is an important domain for learning and memory. We previously showed that endothelin-1 ( ET-1) reduced diabetes-induced inflammation<symptom> in hippocampal neurons , suggesting a neuroprotective effect. Given that neurons and endothelial cells within the neurovascular unit depend on each other for proper function , we investigated the effect of ET-1 on brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) synthesis , a key neurotrophin and prosurvival factor , in neuronal ( HT22 hippocampal neurons) and brain microvascular endothelial ( BMEC-5i) cells under normal and diabetes-mimicking ( high glucose plus palmitate) conditions. Cells were treated with exogenous ET-1 or ET receptor antagonists including ET ( B) receptor selective antagonist BQ788 ( 1 microM) or dual-receptor antagonist bosentan ( 10 microM). Mature ( m) BDNF , proBDNF and caspase-3 levels were measured by Western blotting. Diabetic conditions reduced the prosurvival mBDNF/proBDNF ratio in both HT22 and BMEC-5i cells. Addition of exogenous ET-1 had no effect on the BDNF system in HT22 cells in diabetic conditions. Both HT22 and BMEC-5i cells had an increase in the mBDNF/proBDNF ratio when grown in diabetes-simulating conditions in the presence of endothelin receptor inhibition. These data suggest that blockade of ET-1 may provide neuroprotection to hippocampal cells through the modulation of the BDNF system.
