  The Pacman flap is a novel modality for repairing round soft-tissue defects after tumor resection. This modality provides a robust blood supply without microsurgical tissue rearrangement. This article reviews the authors ' experience with Pacman flap for reconstruction of round soft-tissue defects. The safety and effectiveness of the Pacman flap are investigated. Here , we describe a method for oncologic reconstruction of round soft-tissue defects with a Pacman flap after tumor resection. Fourteen consecutive patients ( 6 males and 8 females , median age of 60 years , range , 18-87 years) who received Pacman flaps for oncologic reconstruction during the period from April 2015 to April 2017 were included in the present study. In total , 15 Pacman flaps ( including 1 bilateral Pacman flap) were created to provide coverage after resection of a tumor from the face ( n = 11) , chest ( n = 1) , or extremities ( n = 2). One patient had twice previously undergone tumor resection. Median defect size was 25.5 × 25 mm ( range , 9 × 9-100 × 90 mm). Median flap size was 35 × 27 mm ( range , 12 × 10-120 × 110 mm). Median duration of follow-up was 10 months ( range , 6-22 months). No local or distal tumor was observed during the follow-up period. All flaps survived without partial or complete necrosis<symptom> , infection , or other complications. All patients were satisfied with their aesthetic outcomes. A hematoma formed in 1 patient and was successfully treated with debridement. The Pacman flap enables the surgeon to achieve tension-free round defect closure after tumor resection , with good functional and aesthetic outcomes. This modality is a reliable and effective reconstructive surgical technique for oncologic reconstruction of round soft-tissue defects.
