  Fever<disease> phobia is still a major issue in paediatrics. We report knowledge of a sample of Italian paediatricians performed six years after the release of the Italian guidelines for the management of fever<disease> in children ( IFG). A questionnaire , developed following the IFG recommendations and previously administered to 300 paediatricians in 2012 , was proposed to all the paediatricians attending the 2015 National Congress of Practice Paediatrics , held in Florence , Italy. Changes in answers over time were analyzed. 70.2 % ( 562/800) paediatricians returned the questionnaire. The recommended site and device for body temperature measurement in children > 1 year was correctly chosen by 89.3 % of participants ( vs. 80.7 % of 2012 participants; P < 0.001) , but with children aged less than 1 year the correct answer was selected only by the 50.3 % ( vs. 39.3 % of 2012 participants: P < 0.001). Use of physical methods was still incorrectly recommended by 51.6 % of paediatricians ( vs. 63.6 % in 2012; P < 0.001). Use of antipyretics according to discomfort was adopted only by 38.2 % of participants , while 12.2 % of them recommended alternate use of antipyretics. These proportions were substantially stable since 2012 ( 45 and 11 % respectively) , rectal administration of antipyretics only in case of vomiting was correctly recommended by 86.8 % of paediatricians vs. 74.7 % in 2012 ( P < 0.001). Improvements in some pediatricians ' misconceptions were observed over time. However , some incorrect habits persist. Further studies are needed to better understand the `` weak points '' of the communication between Scientific Societies and paediatricians in order to impact everyday clinical practice.
