  Persistent pulmonary hypertension ( PPHN) remains a severe complication of the transition to extra-uterine life with significant morbidity and mortality in the newborns. Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) represents a new pharmacological agent with vascular effects , including improvement of PPHN in several animal models. We hypothesized that DHEA could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR) in the pulmonary circulation of fetal sheep. We studied the effect of intravenous infusion of DHEA in fetal lambs using chronically instrumented sheep at 128 days of gestation. PVR was computed before and after intravenous infusion of increasing doses of DHEA. We assessed pre-treatment by L-nitroarginine , an inhibitor of NO production. Blood gases and doses of DHEA were measured in both sheep and fetus before/after DHEA infusion. Intravenous infusion of DHEA had a vasodilator effect with a significant decrease in PVR ( respectively -11 % , -14 % and -36 % after infusion of 6 , 12 and 24 mg DHEA , p < 0.01) without damaging effects on systemic circulation or on blood gases. The inhibitory effect of pre-treatment with L-nitroarginine resulted in a significant increase in PVR. We demonstrated a potent vasodilator effect of DHEA on fetal pulmonary circulation without deleterious effects. DHEA might represent a new treatment for PPHN.
