  Acute traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI) entered the arena of prospective randomized clinical trials almost 40 years ago , with the undertaking of the National Acute Spinal Cord Study ( NASCIS) I trial. Since then , a number of clinical trials have been conducted in the field , spurred by the devastating physical , social , and economic consequences of acute SCI for patients , families , and society at large. Many of these have been controversial and attracted criticism. The current review provides a critical summary of select past and current clinical trials in SCI , focusing in particular on the findings of prospective randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) , the challenges and barriers encountered , and the valuable lessons learned that can be applied to future trials.
