  We have shown that fresh frozen plasma 's ( FFP) protection of pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity following hemorrhage<symptom> shock<symptom> is due in part to restoration of endothelial syndecan-1. In the present study , we investigated the role of fibrinogen , a major component of FFP , as an endothelial protector and hypothesize that fibrinogen stabilizes cell surface syndecan-1 to restore endothelial barrier integrity. Pulmonary endothelial cells were incubated in FFP , fibrinogen , or lactated Ringers ( LR) then immunostained with anti-syndecan-1 or fibrinogen and barrier integrity assessed. In some experiments , cells were exposed to fibrinogen depleted plasma. Cell surface syndecan-1 was increased by FFP and fibrinogen compared with LR-treated cells while barrier integrity was augmented by FFP and fibrinogen compared to LR. The physiological concentration of 2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen was sufficient to increase cell surface syndecan-1. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that fibrinogen associates with syndecan-1. Fibrinogen deficient plasma was unable to augment sydnecan-1 immunostaining and lost its endothelial protective effect on barrier integrity. These data suggest that in-vitro , fibrinogen associated with cell surface syndecan-1 and enhanced endothelial barrier integrity.
