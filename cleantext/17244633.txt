  While current research is largely consistent as to the harms of heavy drinking in terms of both cancer incidence and mortality , there are disparate messages regarding the safety of light-moderate alcohol consumption , which may confuse public health messages. We aimed to evaluate the association between average lifetime alcohol intakes and risk of both cancer incidence and mortality. We report a population-based cohort study using data from 99,654 adults ( 68.7 % female) , aged 55-74 years , participating in the U.S. Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the risk of overall and cause-specific mortality , cancer incidence ( excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) , and combined risk of cancer and death across categories of self-reported average lifetime alcohol intakes , with adjustment for potential confounders. During 836,740 person-years of follow-up ( median 8.9 years) , 9,599 deaths and 12,763 primary cancers occurred. Positive linear associations were observed between lifetime alcohol consumption and cancer-related mortality and total cancer incidence. J-shaped associations were observed between average lifetime alcohol consumption and overall mortality , cardiovascular-related mortality , and combined risk of death or cancer. In comparison to lifetime light alcohol drinkers ( 1-3 drinks per week) , lifetime never or infrequent drinkers ( < 1 drink/week) , as well as heavy ( 2- < 3 drinks/day) and very heavy drinkers ( 3 + drinks/day) had increased overall mortality and combined risk of cancer or death. Corresponding hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for combined risk of cancer or death , respectively , were 1.09 ( 1.01-1.13) for never drinkers , 1.08 ( 1.03-1.13) for infrequent drinkers , 1.10 ( 1.02-1.18) for heavy drinkers , and 1.21 ( 1.13-1.30) for very heavy drinkers. This analysis is limited to older adults , and residual confounding by socioeconomic factors is possible. The study supports a J-shaped association between alcohol and mortality in older adults , which remains after adjustment for cancer risk. The results indicate that intakes below 1 drink per day were associated with the lowest risk of death. NCT00339495 ( ClinicalTrials.gov).
