  HYD-PEP06 is a novel RGD-modified Endostar mimetic peptide with 30 amino acids that is intended to suppress the formation of neoplasm vessels. This assay was developed and validated to monitor the level of the peptide HYD-PEP06 in rat blood , using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS). HYD-PEP10 , another peptide similar to the analyte , was used as an internal standard ( IS). A triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in Multiple Reaction Monitoring ( MRM) mode and an electrospray interface ( ESI) in the positive mode were used for MS analysis. The analysis was optimized with addition of 0.3 % formic acid ( FA) into the mobile phase as well as with a needle washing solution to overcome the carryover effect. In addition , the carryover was reduced by optimizing the mobile phase gradient. Methanol was used as a diluent of working solutions to avoid any adsorption. Methanol: acetonitrile ( 1:1 , v: v) containing 0.3 % FA was employed to precipitate the blood samples. Unknown blood samples must be placed in ice bath immediately , and precipitating agents should be added within 30 min to ensure the stability of blood samples. The assay was established and validated. This method showed a good linear relationship for the HYD-PEP06 in the range of 10 ng Â· mL
