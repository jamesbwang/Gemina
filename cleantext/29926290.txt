  The main object of the present paper is to examine and compare the improvement of flow and heat transfer characteristics between a rotating nanofluid and a newly discovered hybrid nanofluid in the presence of velocity slip and thermal slip. The influence of thermal radiation is also included in the present study. The system after applying the similarity transformations is solved numerically by using the bvp-4c scheme. Additionally , numerical calculations for the coefficient of skin friction and local Nusselt number are introduced and perused for germane parameters. The comparison between water , nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid on velocity and temperature is also visualized. It is observed that the velocity and temperature distributions are decreasing functions of the slip parameter. Temperature is boosted by thermal radiation and rotation. It is found that the heat transfer rate of the hybrid nanofluid is higher as compared to the traditional nanofluid.
