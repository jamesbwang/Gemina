  Descending aorta interruption is an extremely rare congenital defect. Conventional repair with end-to-end anastomoses is often a surgical challenge in view of the extensive collateral vessels that develop on the chest wall and inside the chest cavity. Extra-anatomic bypass is the preferred technique for the surgical repair of this entity , which avoids the network of collateral vessels , enables simultaneous treatment of associated lesions<symptom> , and in all likelihood reduces morbidity and mortality. Here we describe an extra-anatomic bypass from the ascending aorta to the bilateral iliac arteries in a 24-year-old woman using vascular grafts ( MAQUET Holding B.V. & Co.. KG , Rastatt , Germany) without cardiopulmonary bypass.
