  Middle ear surgery is usually performed using a surgical microscope. Initially , in otorhinolaryngology practice , endoscopes were used for paranasal sinus surgeries. It was only later that they were applied in the area of otology. In otologic surgeries , endoscopes were first used to visualize the middle ear , before being used to assist with visualization of instruments during cholesteatoma surgeries , although they are still not used alone in various otologic surgeries. As in other surgical fields , there is also a trend towards minimally invasive intervention in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Smaller incisions performed under the guidance of endoscopes are preferred over conventional large incisions. Using this approach , improved outcomes can be achieved and postoperative morbidities can be reduced. In addition , the outcomes of grafts performed using the endoscopic approach are similar to that achieved by the microscopic approach. Therefore , endoscopic ear surgery implementations are becoming increasingly popular.
