  We describe an exploratory study of orofacial function in children with congenital myotonic dystrophy ( CDM) versus healthy controls. We evaluated 41 children with CDM and 29 healthy controls for speech and swallow function and for lingual and labial strength. The Iowa Oral Performance Instrument ( IOPI) , measuring tongue strength , and a lip force meter ( LFM) , measuring lip strength , had excellent inter-rater reliability with ICCs of 0.75 ( N = 19 , p < .001) and 0.96 ( N = 20 , p < .001) , respectively. Mean overall lingual strength was 3.5-fold less and labial strength was about 7-fold less in CDM than in healthy controls. Eighteen of 24 children with CDM demonstrated dysarthria<symptom> and an additional 11 participants were non-verbal. Dysarthria<symptom> correlated moderately with lingual strength , age , and dysphagia<symptom>. Strength measures correlated moderately with dysphagia<symptom>. Children with CDM demonstrate impaired orofacial functioning that affects communication and swallowing. Reliability of strength measures may be useful for future therapeutic trials.
