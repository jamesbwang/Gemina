  Criminal behavior occurs in previously law-abiding neurological patients , including patients with traumatic brain injury , focal brain lesions<symptom> , and dementia. Neuroimaging abnormalities in these patients allow one to explore the potential neuroanatomical correlates of criminal behavior. However , this process has been challenging because ( 1) It is difficult to determine the temporal relationship between criminal behavior and neurological disease onset; ( 2) Abnormalities in several different brain regions have been associated with criminal behavior; and ( 3) It is difficult to quantify neuroimaging abnormalities in individual subjects. Recent studies have begun to address these concerns , showing that neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with criminal behavior localize to a common brain network , rather than a single specific brain region. New methods have been developed to identify atrophy patterns in individual patients , but have not yet been used in neurological patients with criminal behavior. Future advances will be important for making sure that neuroimaging data is used in a responsible manner in legal cases involving criminal behavior.
