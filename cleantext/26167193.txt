  Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a contributor to age-related muscle<symptom> loss<symptom> and functional impairment. Therefore , we developed a high throughput screening strategy that enabled the identification of compounds boosting mitochondrial energy production in a human skeletal muscle cell model. Screening of 7949 pure natural products revealed 22 molecules that significantly increased oxygen consumption and ATP levels in myotubes. One of the most potent compounds was the flavanone hesperetin. Hesperetin ( 10 ÂµM) increased intracellular ATP by 33 % and mitochondrial spare capacity by 25 %. Furthermore , the compound reduced oxidative stress in primary myotubes as well as muscle tissue in vivo. In aged mice administration of hesperetin ( 50 mg/kg/d) completely reverted the age-related decrease of muscle fiber size and improved running performance of treated animals. These results provide a novel screening platform for the discovery of drugs that can improve skeletal muscle function in patients suffering from sarcopenia or other disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
