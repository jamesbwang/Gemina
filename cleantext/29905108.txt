  International conferences on avian medicine and surgery aim to disseminate scientific and evidence-based information in the form of oral presentations and posters. Most manuscripts presented are printed in the conference proceedings as abstracts. Subsequent publication in a scientific peer-reviewed journal is the natural outcome of the research cycle , although studies have shown that the vast majority of conference abstracts are not published. The purpose of this study was to explore 1) the fate of abstracts presented in avian conferences ( Association of Avian Veterinarians , European Association of Avian Veterinarians , International Conference on Avian Herpetological and Exotic Mammal Medicine) in the years 2011-2015 , 2) assess the publication rate in peer-reviewed journals , 3) describe the time course of subsequent publication , and 4) identify factors associated with increased likelihood of publication. The results showed that 24 % of conference abstracts were published within the next 2 years. Depending on the statistical model used , several factors were identified as associated with increased publication rate. North American papers seem to publish with more frequency ( univariate model) , while European papers had the opposite trend ( multivariable model). Likewise , experimental studies were more prone to being published overall ( univariate model) , whereas retrospective observational studies had a lower rate of publication ( multivariable model). Increasing the number of authors was also associated with increased publication rate. Most publications were published in the Journal of Avian Medicine and Surgery , which tends to suggest that this journal is the main journal of the specialty. Some parameters highlighted in this study may assist conference attendees to assess the likelihood of later publication.
