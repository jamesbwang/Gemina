  Short-term peripheral venous catheters are a significant source of health-care acquired bloodstream infections and a preventable cause of death. To assess the effectiveness of interventions applied to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with short peripheral venous catheter-related bloodstream infections ( PVCR-BSI). The intervention included continuous PVCR-BSI surveillance , implementation of preventive measures related to catheter insertion and maintenance in accordance with evidence-based recommendations and the hospital 's own data , front-line staff educational campaigns , and assessment of adherence to hospital guidelines by ward rounds. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the trend of rate per year. From January 2003 to December 2016 , 227 episodes of PVCR-BSI were identified among hospitalized patients at a university hospital. Mean age: 67y ( SD: +14 y) , 69 % males and median Charlson Score: 3 ( interquartile range: 2-5). Among all , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> caused 115 ( 50.7 %) episodes. Thirty-day mortality was 13.2 %. After the implementation of the intervention , incidence decreased significantly from 30 episodes ( 1.17 episodes/10 ,000 patient-days) in 2003 to eight ( 0.36/ 10,000 patient-days) in 2016. Episodes caused by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> fell from 18 in 2003 ( 0.70/ 10,000 patient-days) to three in 2016 ( 0.14/ 10,000 patient-day) and mortality fell from seven cases in 2003 ( 0.27/ 10,000 patient-days) to zero in 2016 ( 0.00/ 10,000 patient-days). Surveillance , implementation of a multimodal strategy and periodical assessment of healthcare personnel adherence to hospital guidelines led to a sustained reduction in PVCR-BSIs. This reduction had a major impact on S. aureus-BSI rates and associated mortality.
