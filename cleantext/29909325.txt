  Antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs) in environment have become a growing public concern , due to their potential to be obtained by pathogens and their duplication along cell division. Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) was reported to be responsible for ARGs dissemination in microbes , but the HGT feature in environmental biofilm was still unclear due to insufficient assay tools. To address this challenge , we applied a novel microfluidic system to cultivate thin biofilm by continuous supply of nutrients and close contact between cells. Resembling the living state of biofilm in open environment , this chip visualized the transfer of ARG-encoded plasmids RP4 and pKJK5 to the receptors , e.g. , activated sludge bacteria. The average plasmid transfer frequency per receptor ( T/R) from RP4-hosted Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> KT2440 to activated sludge bacteria was quantified to be 2.5 Ã— 10
