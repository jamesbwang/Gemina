  Cerebral ischemia has a harmful effect on the synapse associated with neurological impairment. The `` tripartite synapse '' is assembled by the pre- and postsynaptic terminals , embraced by astrocytic elongations known as peripheral astrocytic processes ( PAPs). Ischemic stroke induces the detachment of PAPs from the synapse , leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Ezrin is a membrane-associated protein , required for the formation of PAPs , that links the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( uPA) is a serine proteinase that upon binding to its receptor ( uPAR) promotes neurite growth during development. In the adult brain , neurons release uPA and astrocytes recruit uPAR to the plasma membrane during the recovery phase from an ischemic stroke , and uPA/uPAR binding promotes functional improvement following an ischemic injury. We found that uPA induces the synthesis of ezrin in astrocytes , with the subsequent formation of PAPs that enter in direct contact with the synapse. Furthermore , either the release of neuronal uPA or intravenous treatment with recombinant uPA ( ruPA) induces the formation of PAPs in the ischemic brain , and the interaction of these PAPs with the pre- and postsynaptic terminals protects the integrity of the `` tripartite synapse '' from the harmful effects of the ischemic injury.
