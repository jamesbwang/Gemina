  The inferior vena cava ( IVC) has a complex three-dimensional ( 3D) shape , but measurements used to estimate central venous pressure ( CVP) remain based on two-dimensional ( 2D) echocardiographic imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of IVC size and collapsibility index obtained by 3D echocardiography for assessing CVP in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom>. Eighty consecutive echocardiographic examinations performed in 33 patients ( mean age , 72 ± 15 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction , 19 ± 10 %) admitted for cardiogenic shock<symptom> were prospectively included. Two-dimensional and 3D images of the IVC were acquired simultaneously with invasive measurement of CVP , both at rest and during a sniff test. IVC diameters , 3D IVC area , and IVC collapsibility index ( IVCCI) were assessed. The eccentricity index was computed from 3D data as the ratio of maximum to minimum IVC diameter. A cutoff value of 10 mm Hg for CVP defined patients with euvolemic hemodynamic status. At rest , IVC diameter averaged 23 ± 7 mm by 2D imaging and 25 ± 8 × 19 ± 7 mm by 3D imaging. The IVC had an eccentric shape ( eccentricity index = 1.3) that increased when CVP was ≤ 10 mm Hg and during the sniff test ( P < .001). IVC measurements by 2D and 3D imaging were correlated with CVP. The best correlation was obtained with IVCCI derived from 2D diameters ( R = -0.69) and 3D areas ( R = -0.82). Using a cutoff value of 50 % for IVCCI , 11 examinations were misclassified by 2D imaging and only one by 3D imaging. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility for IVC area was 7 ± 6 % and 5 ± 3 % , respectively. In patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> , IVCCI from area by 3D echocardiography is reproducible and accurate to evaluate CVP.
