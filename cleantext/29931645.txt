  Ecotoxicological tests with earthworms are widely used and are mandatory for the risk assessment of pesticides prior to registration and commercial use. The current model species for standardized tests is Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei. However , these species are absent from agricultural soils and often less sensitive to pesticides than other earthworm species found in mineral soils. To move towards a better assessment of pesticide effects on non-target organisms , there is a need to perform a posteriori tests using relevant species. The endogeic species Aporrectodea caliginosa ( Savigny , 1826) is representative of cultivated fields in temperate regions and is suggested as a relevant model test species. After providing information on its taxonomy , biology , and ecology , we reviewed current knowledge concerning its sensitivity towards pesticides. Moreover , we highlighted research gaps and promising perspectives. Finally , advice and recommendations are given for the establishment of laboratory cultures and experiments using this soil-dwelling earthworm species.
