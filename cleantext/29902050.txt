  Anxiety<symptom> disorders are among the most prevalent mental health disorders experienced by children and are associated with significant negative outcomes. Only a minority of affected children , however , access professional help , and a failure to identify children with anxiety<symptom> disorders presents a key barrier to treatment access. Existing child anxiety<symptom> questionnaire measures are long and time consuming to complete , limiting their potential for widespread use as identification tools in community settings. We developed a brief questionnaire for parents , children , and teachers using items from the Spence Children 's Anxiety Scale ( SCAS) and evaluated the new measure 's psychometric properties , capacity to discriminate between a community ( n = 361) and clinic-referred sample ( n = 338) of children aged 7-11 , and identified optimal cut-off scores for accurate identification of preadolescent children experiencing clinically significant levels of anxiety<symptom>. The findings provided support for the reliability and validity of 8-item versions of the SCAS , with the brief questionnaire scores displaying comparable internal consistency , agreement among reporters , and convergent/divergent validity to the full-length SCAS scores. The brief SCAS scores also discriminated between the community and clinic-referred samples and identified children in the clinic-referred sample with a moderate-to-good level of accuracy and acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Combining reporters improved sensitivity , but at the expense of specificity , and findings suggested parent report should be prioritized. This new brief questionnaire has potential for use in community settings as a tool to improve identification of children who are experiencing clinically significant levels of anxiety<symptom> and warrant further assessment and potential support.
