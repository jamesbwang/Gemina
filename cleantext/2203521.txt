  To assess the role of serum vitamin D and other nutritional factors in women with breast cancer in Saudi. A total of 500 women ( 250 patients with breast cancer and 250 controls) aged 30-60 years were recruited from King Saud Medical City and King Fahad Medical City , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , between May 2015 and June 2016. In this cross-sectional study , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , plasma concentrations of vitamin D , and calcium levels were evaluated. A 3-day dietary record was used to assess dietary intake. The mean body mass index was 31.2 ± 7.0 kg/m2 for the breast cancer group and 30.7 ± 7.6 kg/m2 for the control group. More than 80 % of the participants had insufficient vitamin D levels ( less than 75.0 nmol/L). The mean cholesterol intake was significantly ( p = 0.001) lower in the control group ( 233.1 ± 75.1 mg) than in the breast cancer group ( 257.2 ± 84.8 mg). Breast density was found to be significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency-symptoms. Severe paresthesia was also significantly associated with breast cancer. The incidence of other vitamin D deficiency-symptoms was significantly higher in the control group. Due to prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Arabia , it is difficult to determine the relationship to breast cancer. The incidence of it is associated with old age and high cholesterol intake , and paresthesia may be a symptom of breast cancer.
