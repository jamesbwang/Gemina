  Fragment reattachment is a procedure that offers advantages , such as preservation of dental structure and maintenance of color , shape and translucency of the original tooth. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment techniques used to restore anterior teeth fractured by trauma. The PubMed , LILACS , Web of Science , Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched in October 2016 , and the search was updated in February 2017. A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion , and extracted the data. In vitro studies that evaluated permanent human teeth fractured by trauma were included. Twenty-one studies remained after screening. The bond strength between the fragment and the crown was evaluated in 119 experimental groups. Ten different techniques were evaluated: no preparation , chamfer , bevel , anchors , overcontour , internal groove , no preparation associated with chamfer after reattachment , fragment dentin removal associated with chamfer after reattachment , bevel associated with overcontour , and groove associated with shoulder. Five different materials were used to reattach the fragment: bonding system , luting composite resin , flowable composite , microhybrid composite and nanocomposite. Fragment reattachment using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth.
