  Speech requires programming the sequence of vocal gestures that produce the sounds<symptom> of words. Here we explored the timing of this program by asking our participants to pronounce , as quickly as possible , a sequence of consonant-consonant-vowel ( CCV) structures appearing on screen. We measured the delay between visual presentation and voice onset. In the case of plosive consonants , produced by sharp and well defined movements of the vocal tract , we found that delays are positively correlated with the duration of the transition between consonants. We then used a battery of statistical tests and mathematical vocal models to show that delays reflect the motor planning of CCVs and transitions are proxy indicators of the vocal effort needed to produce them. These results support that the effort required to produce the sequence of movements of a vocal gesture modulates the onset of the motor plan.
