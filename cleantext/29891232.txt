  Polymeric drug carriers can alter the pharmacokinetics of their drug cargoes , thereby improving drug therapeutic index and reducing side effects. Understanding and controlling polymer properties that drive tissue-specific accumulation is critical in engineering targeted drug delivery systems. For kidney disease applications , targeted drug delivery to renal cells that reside beyond the charge- and size-selective glomerular filtration barrier could have clinical potential. However , there are limited reports on polymer properties that might enhance kidney accumulation. Here , we studied the effects of molecular weight and charge on the in vivo kidney accumulation of polymers in health and disease. We synthesized a panel of well-defined polymers by atom transfer radical polymerization to answer several questions. First , the biodistribution of low molecular weight ( 23-27 kDa) polymers composed of various ratios of neutral: anionic monomers ( 1:0 , 1:1 , 1:4) in normal mice was determined. Then , highly anionic ( 1:4 monomer ratio) low molecular and high molecular weight ( 47 kDa) polymers were tested in both normal and experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS) mice , a model that results in loss of glomerular filtration selectivity. Through these studies , we observed that kidney-specific polymer accumulation increases with anionic monomer content , but not molecular weight; experimental FSGS increases kidney accumulation of anionic polymers; and anionic polymers accumulate predominantly in proximal tubule cells , with some distribution in kidney glomeruli. These findings can be applied to the design of polymeric drug carriers to enhance or mitigate kidney accumulation.
