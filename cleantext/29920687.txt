  For successful growth and development , plants constantly have to gauge their environment. Plants are capable to monitor their current environmental conditions , and they are also able to integrate environmental conditions over time and store the information induced by the cues. In a developmental context , such an environmental memory is used to align developmental transitions with favourable environmental conditions. One temperature-related example of this is the transition to flowering after experiencing winter conditions , that is , vernalization. In the context of adaptation to stress , such an environmental memory is used to improve stress adaptation even when the stress cues are intermittent. A somatic stress memory has now been described for various stresses , including extreme temperatures , drought , and pathogen infection. At the molecular level , such a memory of the environment is often mediated by epigenetic and chromatin modifications. Histone modifications in particular play an important role. In this review , we will discuss and compare different types of temperature memory and the histone modifications , as well as the reader , writer , and eraser proteins involved.
