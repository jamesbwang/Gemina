  Currently , analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are classified as one of the most emerging group of xenobiotics and have been detected in various natural matrices. Among them , monocyclic paracetamol and ibuprofen , widely used to treat mild and moderate<symptom> pain<symptom> are the most popular. Since long-term adverse effects of these xenobiotics and their biological and pharmacokinetic activity especially at environmentally relevant concentrations are better understood , degradation of such contaminants has become a major concern. Moreover , to date , conventional wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) are not fully adapted to remove that kind of micropollutants. Bioremediation processes , which utilize bacterial strains with increased degradation abilities , seem to be a promising alternative to the chemical methods used so far. Nevertheless , despite the wide prevalence of paracetamol and ibuprofen in the environment , toxicity and mechanism of their microbial degradation as well as genetic background of these processes remain not fully characterized. In this review , we described the current state of knowledge about toxicity and biodegradation mechanisms of paracetamol and ibuprofen and provided bioinformatics analysis concerning the genetic bases of these xenobiotics decomposition.
