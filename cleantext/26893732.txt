  BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer is the second most common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system and is the leading cause of death of gynecological malignancies , but at present there is no effective and safe therapy. There is no previously published report on the anti-cancer effect of prucalopride , which is a high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor. The aim of the present study was to determine whether prucalopride can inhibit proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cell viability was detected by use of the Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay. The invasion and migration of SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells was detected by Transwell assay. The cell apoptosis was detected by apoptosis flow detection and Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Systems. The apoptosis-related proteins , autophagy marker proteins , and the related-factors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K) were detected by Western blot. RESULTS The CCK-8 proliferation test showed that prucalopride inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3. In the Transwell assay , prucalopride inhibited cell invasion and migration. Furthermore , we found the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased , whereas the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Caspase3 and Bax increased in the SKOV3 cell line treated with prucalopride , as well as cleaved PARP. In addition , the expression of p-AKT , p-mTOR , and p70S6K decreased in the prucalopride-treated group , and the expression of autophagy marker protein LC3-II/I and Beclin1 significantly increased , whereas the expression of p62 protein decreased. CONCLUSIONS The present study reveals that in ovarian cancer cells , prucalopride inhibits proliferation , migration , and invasion , and induces apoptosis and autophagy , which may be regulated by the PI3K signaling pathway. These results suggest prucalopride has potential as a new drug for clinical ovarian cancer treatment.
