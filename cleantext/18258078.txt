  Rural , remote , and Indigenous communities often contend with free-roaming dog populations , increasing the risk of aggressive dog encounters , particularly dog bites and fatal dog attacks. This qualitative survey gathered a range of perspectives to ascertain the current veterinary services available in rural , remote , and Indigenous communities of northern Manitoba , as well as needs , barriers to , and considerations for future veterinary care provision. Survey results indicated terminology such as `` overpopulation '' and `` rescue '' need to be carefully considered as they may have negative connotations for communities. While veterinary services such as vaccination and deworming are important for public health , most programs were focused on sterilization. There was consensus that conversations must begin with individual communities to determine what services are needed and how to fulfil those needs. Perceived barriers include the remoteness of communities , finances , and culturally different views of veterinary medicine. Recommendations for future delivery of services include increased frequency and funding of current models , while others focused on different methods of delivery; all of which will require further discussions within the veterinary community and with other stakeholders.
