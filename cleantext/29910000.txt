  Primary familial brain calcification ( PFBC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The genetic basis of this disorder remains unknown in a significant portion of familial cases. Here , we reported a recessive causal gene , MYORG , for PFBC. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations of MYORG co-segregated completely with PFBC in six families , with logarithm of odds ( LOD) score of 4.91 at the zero recombination fraction. In mice , Myorg mRNA was expressed specifically in S100Î²-positive astrocytes , and knockout of Myorg induced the formation of brain calcification at 9 months of age. Our findings provide strong evidence that loss-of-function mutations of MYORG cause brain calcification in humans and mice.
