  The purpose of this open-label study was to investigate the effect of a curcumin-phospholipid lecithin formulation ( Meriva ®) on visual acuity and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) retinal thickness in patients with chronic diabetic macular edema<symptom>. Curcumin-phospholipid lecithin formulation ( Meriva ® , Indena S.p.A , Milan , Italy) was administered as tablets ( Norflo ® , Eye Pharma , Genoa , Italy) twice a day. Visual acuity and macular edema<symptom> as measured by OCT before and after curcumin-phospholipid formulation treatment were assessed. The study included 12 eyes from 11 patients who completed at least a 3-month follow-up period. After 3 months of therapy , no eyes showed reduction in visual acuity , 16 % showed stabilization , and 84 % showed improvement. The improvement was statistically significant ( p = 0.0072). After 3 months of therapy , 92 % of eyes showed reduction of macula edema<symptom> , 8 % showed stabilization , and 0 % showed an increase ( p = 0.009). Our results , albeit preliminary , suggest that a curcumin-phospholipid formulation ( Meriva ®) , administered as Norflo ® tablets , may be feasible in the improvement of visual acuity and reduction of macular edema<symptom> in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
