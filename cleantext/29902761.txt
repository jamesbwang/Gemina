  While the detection and quantification of nano-sized plastic in the environment remains a challenge , the growing number of polymer applications mean that we can expect an increase in the release of nanoplastics into the environment by indirect outputs. Today , very little is known about the impact of nano-sized plastics on marine organisms. Thus , the objective of this study was to investigate the toxicity of polystyrene nanoplastics ( NPs) on oyster ( Crassostrea gigas) gametes. Spermatozoa and oocytes were exposed to four NPs concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 mg L
