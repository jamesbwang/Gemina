  Personalized medicine is an aspect of the P4 medicine ( predictive , preventive , personalized and participatory) based precisely on the customization of all medical characters of each subject. In personalized medicine , the development of medical treatments and drugs is tailored to the individual characteristics and needs of each subject , according to the study of diseases at different scales from genotype to phenotype scale. To make concrete the goal of personalized medicine , it is necessary to employ high-throughput methodologies such as Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS) , Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS) , Mass Spectrometry or Microarrays , that are able to investigate a single disease from a broader perspective. A side effect of high-throughput methodologies is the massive amount of data produced for each single experiment , that poses several challenges ( e.g. , high execution time and required memory) to bioinformatic software. Thus a main requirement of modern bioinformatic softwares , is the use of good software engineering methods and efficient programming techniques , able to face those challenges , that include the use of parallel programming and efficient and compact data structures. This paper presents the design and the experimentation of a comprehensive software pipeline , named microPipe , for the preprocessing , annotation and analysis of microarray-based Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNP) genotyping data. A use case in pharmacogenomics is presented. The main advantages of using microPipe are: the reduction of errors that may happen when trying to make data compatible among different tools; the possibility to analyze in parallel huge datasets; the easy annotation and integration of data. microPipe is available under Creative Commons license , and is freely downloadable for academic and not-for-profit institutions.
