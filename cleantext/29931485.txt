  The WHO2016 CNS update requires a combined histological and molecular assessment. To assess the major aberrations such as co-deletion of complete chromosome arms 1p and 19q ( Co-del) , isocitrate dehydrogenase and histone H3 mutations , direct sequencing , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and/or FISH are methods considered to be `` golden standard '' in the community. However , these methods are expensive and complicated. The aim of this study is verification of the sensitivity of the simple PCR-based techniques for assessment of molecular information in daily diagnosis. We analyzed a total number of 80 patients with gliomas. FISH and PCR-based microsatellite analysis were compared for Co-del assessment. Direct sequencing and qPCR using hig-resolution melting ( HRM) were compared for IDH and histone H3 mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of FISH were 0.71 and 0.79 , respectively. FISH using a commercially available Vysis probe had a risk of high false-positive rate ( 0.25). For assessment of IDH1 mutations , the sensitivity and specificity of HRM were 1.0 and 0.96 , respectively. For assessment of IDH2 and H3 mutations by HRM , both sensitivity and specificity were 1.0. We consider PCR-based molecular analysis to be a simple and accurate technique in daily diagnosis that is readily available for a small scientific facility.
