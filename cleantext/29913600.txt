  In this study , cow dung biochar ( CDB) and ferric chloride-modified CDB ( Fe@CDB) were synthesized to remove low concentration perchlorate from water. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model was used and satisfactorily described perchlorate removal onto CDB and Fe@CDB. The Langmuir model fit the experimental isotherm data better than the Freundlich model. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained using the Langmuir model was 1787 μg/g for Fe@CDB and 304 μg/g for CDB. The detrimental effects of coexisting anions decreased as: NO
