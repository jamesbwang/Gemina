  Platelet accumulation under high shear rates at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture leads to myocardial infarction and stroke. Current antiplatelet therapies remain ineffective within a large percentage of the population , while presenting significant risks for bleeding. We explore a novel way to inhibit arterial thrombus formation by biophysical means without the use of platelet inactivating drugs. Our computational multi-scale dynamics model has predicted that charged particles of a specific size may entangle von Willebrand Factor ( vWF) polymers and reduce the amount of elongation at high shear rates. We tested this hypothesis experimentally for negatively charged nanoparticles ( CNP) to inhibit arterial thrombus formation. CNP of a particular size and charge inhibited thrombus formation , with a 10-fold peak inhibition over control conditions of thrombotic occlusion. Particles of differing material composition , size , and charge had little effect as predicted by computational studies. Surprisingly , the dose response curve was not sigmoidal , but exhibited a peak at 1.5 CNP: vWF proteins , which was not predicted by the model. This study describes a new antithrombotic agent that may have a different mechanism of action than current pharmaceutical therapies.
