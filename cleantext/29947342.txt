  Ribonucleoproteins particles that form the spliceosomes are among the most frequently targeted molecules of the autoimmune response. In the last few years , autoantibodies against all A/B hnRNP proteins have been found in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) , mixed connective tissue disease ( MCTD) , and serve as diagnostic markers for several rheumatic diseases. However , the functional role of hnRNP C1/C2 in autoimmune diseases is still not clearly understood. To identify hnRNP C1/C2 as an autoantigen in patients with Behcet 's Disease ( BD). First , HaCaT and EA.hy926 cells were cultured and RNA was extracted. Second , amplification of the corresponding gene by RT-PCR , cloning , and purification techniques was applied to acquire the recombinant protein hnRNP C1/C2. Third , the target protein band was excised from gel electrophoresis , digested with trypsin , and analyzed by ( MALDI-TOF/). Finally , Western blotting and ELISA were performed to verify the immunoreactivity of BD serum with recombinant hnRNPC1/C2. Results demonstrated that the reactivity of BD serum against recombinant hnRNP C1/C2 protein was significantly higher as compared to healthy control ( P < 0.001). hnRNP C1/C2 can be considered as a self antigen which might be involved in BD pathology in Hans Chinese population.
