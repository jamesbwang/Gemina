  High inorganic salts inevitably impose a toxic impact on biological treatment processes. In this study , the effect of salinity on the performance and microbial community structures of partial-denitrification ( PD) was firstly investigated. Results showed the denitrifying activities of non-domesticated PD sludge were completely inhibited under a temporary high salinity ( â‰¥ 1.5 wt %). However , after domestication , denitrifying activities maintained above 50 % of the maximum with salinity build-up step-by-step from 0.0 wt % to 3.0 wt %. High nitrite production was stably achieved during 120 days with nitrate-to-nitrite transformation ratio around 90 %. Further investigation showed extracellular polymeric substances content of PD sludge increased from 184.59 mg gVSS
