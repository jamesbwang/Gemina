  Infection occurs in 2-4 % of arthroplasty cases , identifying potential sources of infection can help to reduce infection rates. The aim of this study was to identify the impact and potential for contamination of our hands and gowns whilst scrubbing using sterile surgical helmet systems ( SSHS). A colony-forming unit ( CFU) is a pathogenic particle of 0.5 to 5 micrometres. A standard arthroplasty hood and a SSHS with and without the fan on for a 3-minute exposure to represent scrubbing time , were tested on 3 subjects and a mannequin with concurrent particle counts and culture plates. All SSHS were positive for Gram-positive cocci , with a mean colony count of 410 cfu/m Sterile gloves and gowns can be contaminated when scrubbing with the SSHS fan on. We recommend the fan remains switched off when scrubbing until the hood and gown are in place , ideally in a laminar flow environment.
