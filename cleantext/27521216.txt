  Cutaneous melanoma ( CM) is a common skin cancer. Surgery is still the primary treatment for CM , as melanoma is resistant to chemotherapy. In the recent years , it has been found that cancer stem-like cells ( CSCs) are responsible for this drug resistance. CD24 is a widely used marker to isolate CSCs. In this study , we aimed to analyze the properties of CD24 We isolated CD24 We demonstrated that the CD24 This study provides new knowledge on the role of CD24 in the tumorigenic ability of melanoma.
