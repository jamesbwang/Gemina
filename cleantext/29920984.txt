  An athlete contested an adverse analytical finding involving hydrochlorothiazide , and requested our laboratory for testing his hair. As there is no reference in the literature about identification of hydrochlorothiazide in hair , several volunteers were first enrolled ( 4 after a single 25 mg administration and 10 with daily therapeutic treatment). A specific method was developed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( UPLC-MS/MS. Hair samples were decontaminated with dichloromethane and 30 mg were incubated in buffer at pH 7.0 for 15 hours at 50 Â°C. Then , 5 mL ethyl acetate was added for extraction. Linearity was observed for hydrochlorothiazide concentrations ranging from 5 to 2000 pg/mg. The limit of quantification was 5 pg/mg. The coefficients of variation ( CVs) of repeatability and matrix effect were lower than 20 %. Analysis of the 0-2-cm segment of the 4 volunteers having received a single dose , collected 1 month after administration , was negative at the limit of quantification. The hair of the 10 patients ( proximal 2 cm) on daily treatment was positive with concentrations ranging from 12 to 1845 pg/mg , with no correlation between daily dose and concentration. The athlete 's hair tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide at 36 pg/mg in the segment corresponding to the period of the urinary control. Since a single exposure to hydrochlorothiazide is not detectable in hair and based on the results of the patients on daily treatment , the concentration found in the athlete has been interpreted as corresponding to repeated exposures , where it was not possible to establish the dosage and the frequency.
