  Because heterogeneity affects many functional aspects of a tumor , a way to overcome it is to arm nanosized drug delivery systems ( nanoDDS) with diverse functions required to shatter heterogeneity. However , it remains technically challenging to fabricate a nanocarrier possessing all required functions. Here , we propose a modular strategy for generating a supramolecular , multifunctional , and stimuli-responsive nanoDDS through docking a parental core nanoDDS with various daughter function-prebuilt modules. Doxorubicin ( DOX)- loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs) as the parental nanocore are wrapped by poly ( Î²-cyclodextrin) ( PCD) as a gatekeeper through host-guest interactions between cyclodextrin units and pyridine groups of pyridine-disulfide bonds that confers pH/redox dual responsiveness , thus constructing stimuli-responsive nanoDDS ( DOX@PRMSNs). Meanwhile , PCD 's free cyclodextrin is tightly caged by adamantyl ( Ad)- terminated daughter modules via host-guest interactions , achieving convenient multifunctionalization of this nanoDDS. DOX@PRMSNs rapidly released DOX in lysosomal pH/redox microenvironment , potently killing drug-resistant cancer cells. Further , three different types of Ad-terminated daughter modules , including two targeting ligands ( Ad-PEG-FA and Ad-PEG-LA) , a cationic polymer ( Ad-PEI) , and a fluorescence agent ( Ad-FITC) , are utilized to functionalize PRMSNs via cyclodextrin-Ad self-assembly , endowing the nanoDDS with cell-targeting capability , gene codelivery property , and imaging function. Thus , this work develops a supramolecular modular self-assembly approach for constructing and multifunctionalizing stimuli-responsive `` smart '' nanoDDSs.
