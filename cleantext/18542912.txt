  To address the lack of a truly portable , universal reference mapping population for perennial ryegrass , we have been developing a recombinant inbred line ( RIL) mapping population of perennial ryegrass derived via single seed descent from a well-characterized F2 mapping population based on genetically distinct inbred parents in which the natural self-incompatibility ( SI) system of perennial ryegrass has been overcome. We examined whether it is possible to create a genotyping by sequencing ( GBS) based genetic linkage map in a small population of the F6 generation of this population. We used 41 F6 genotypes for GBS with
