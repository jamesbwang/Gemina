  The effects of four kinds of different plant populations on the morphology , the dry matter accumulation , active ingredient content and antioxidant activty in vitro of Salvia miltiorrhiza were analyzed by setting up four kinds of mixed planting groups , such as S. miltiorrhiza and Cassia obtusifolia , Capsicum annuum , Perilla frutescens and Zea mays. And through the root isolation treatment , we preliminarily explored the formation mechanism of the four kinds of matching plants of the yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza , and chose the matching plants suitable for the establishment of the compound population with S. miltiorrhiza , and provided the basis for constructing high efficiency compound planting pattern of S. miltiorrhiza. The results showed that there were significant differences in plant morphology , dry matter accumulation of root , active ingredient content and antioxidant activty in vitro of S. miltiorrhiza in different compound population mixed. The growth and yield of S. miltiorrhiza were unfavorable to the combination planting of Cassia obtusifolia , Z. mays and Salvia miltiorrhiza.The compound planting of P. frutescens and S. miltiorrhiza significantly promoted the growth of S. miltiorrhiza , but significantly reduced the quality of S. miltiorrhiza.The yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza were significantly improved by the combination of C. annuum and S. miltiorrhiza. Therefore , among the four plants of C. obtusifolia , C. annuum , P. frutescens , and Z. mays , the P. frutescens of Solanaceae is the best matching species for the construction of compound planting group with S. miltiorrhiza.
