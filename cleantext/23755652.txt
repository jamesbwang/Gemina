  The integrity of image content is essential , although most watermarking algorithms can achieve image authentication but not automatically repair damaged areas or restore the original image. In this paper , a self-recovery reversible image watermarking algorithm is proposed to recover the tampered areas effectively. First of all , the original image is divided into homogeneous blocks and non-homogeneous blocks through multi-scale decomposition , and the feature information of each block is calculated as the recovery watermark. Then , the original image is divided into 4 Ã— 4 non-overlapping blocks classified into smooth blocks and texture blocks according to image textures. Finally , the recovery watermark generated by homogeneous blocks and error-correcting codes is embedded into the corresponding smooth block by mapping; watermark information generated by non-homogeneous blocks and error-correcting codes is embedded into the corresponding non-embedded smooth block and the texture block via mapping. The correlation attack is detected by invariant moments when the watermarked image is attacked. To determine whether a sub-block has been tampered with , its feature is calculated and the recovery watermark is extracted from the corresponding block. If the image has been tampered with , it can be recovered. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively recover the tampered areas with high accuracy and high quality. The algorithm is characterized by sound visual quality and excellent image restoration.
