  Globus is a non-painful sensation of a lump or a foreign body in the throat<symptom> , and it frequently improves with eating. Although globus is a common symptom , only little is known about the etiology , and the causes have remained controversial. Previously , globus was labelled as a hysterical symptom. However , nowadays , the research has been mainly focused on somatic causes and it is suspected that the etiology is complex. Because of the unclear etiology , the diagnostics and treatment are varying , predisposing patients to possible unnecessary investigations. This review presents the current literature of globus: its etiology , diagnostics , and treatment. In addition , a special aim is to discuss the rational investigation methods in globus diagnostics and present a diagnostic algorithm based on recent researches.
