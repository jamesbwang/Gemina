  Body mass index ( BMI) is not routinely taken into consideration for risk stratification prior to esophagectomy. Extremes of BMI are associated with adverse surgical outcomes in a variety of surgical specialties. We assessed the relationship of BMI to outcomes after esophagectomy for cancer. Patients in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database ( 2009- 2016) who underwent elective esophagectomy for cancer were selected for analysis. Open and minimally invasive approaches were included. Complications were categorized based on the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. We evaluated 9,389 patients grouped by BMI: Underweight ( < 18.5 kg/m BMI is associated with postoperative complications after esophagectomy. Postoperative risk assessment and prehabilitation regimens should be adjusted accordingly when planning an esophagectomy for a patient with very low or very high BMI.
