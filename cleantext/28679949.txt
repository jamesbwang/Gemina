  The bone<disease> marrow microenvironment harbors and protects leukemic cells from apoptosis-inducing agents via mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We previously showed SDF-1 ( CXCL-12) , a chemokine readily abundant within the bone<disease> marrow microenvironment , induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) cells that express high levels of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4. However , differentiating osteoblasts found within this niche protect cocultured AML cells from apoptosis. Additionally , this protection was abrogated upon treatment of the differentiating osteoblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi). In this study , we begin to characterize and target the molecular mechanisms that mediate this osteoblast protection. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that HDACi treatment of differentiating osteoblasts ( mouse MC3T3 osteoblast cell line) reduced expression of multiple genes required for osteoblast differentiation , including genes important for producing mineralized bone matrix. Interestingly , pretreating differentiating osteoblasts with cyclosporine A , a drug known to inhibit osteoblast differentiation , similarly impaired osteoblast-mediated protection of cocultured AML cells ( KG1a and U937 human AML cell lines). Both HDACi and cyclosporine A reduced osteoblast expression of the key mineralization enzyme tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( TNAP; encoded by
