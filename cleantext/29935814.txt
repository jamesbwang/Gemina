  Plasma proteome profiling by LC-MS based proteomics has drawn great attention recently for biomarker discovery from blood liquid biopsy. Due to standard multi-step sample preparation could potentially cause plasma protein degradation and analysis variation , integrated proteomics sample preparation technologies became promising solution towards this end. Here , we developed a fully integrated proteomics sample preparation technology for both fast and deep plasma proteome profiling under its native pH. All the sample preparation steps , including protein digestion and two-dimensional fractionation by both mixed-mode ion exchange and high-pH reversed phase mechanism were integrated into one spintip device for the first time. The mixed-mode ion exchange beads design achieved the sample loading at neutral pH and protein digestion within 30 min. Potential sample loss and protein degradation by pH changing could be voided. 1 Î¼L of plasma sample with depletion of high abundant proteins was processed by the developed technology with 12 equally distributed fractions and analyzed with 12 h of LC-MS gradient time , resulting in the identification of 862 proteins. The combination of the Mixed-mode-SISPROT and data-independent MS method achieved fast plasma proteome profiling in 2 h with high identification overlap and quantification precision for a proof-of-concept study of plasma samples from 5 healthy donors. We expect that the Mixed-mode-SISPROT become a generally applicable sample preparation technology for clinical oriented plasma proteome profiling.
