  Lower extremity exoskeletons are mainly used to provide stepping support , while balancing is left to the user. Designing balance<symptom> controllers is one of the biggest challenges in the development of exoskeletons. The goal of this study was to design and evaluate a balance<symptom> controller for a powered ankle-foot orthosis and assess its effect on the standing balance<symptom> of healthy subjects. We designed and implemented a balance<symptom> controller based on the subject 's body sway. This controller was compared to a simple virtual-ankle stiffness and a zero impedance controller. Ten healthy subjects wearing a powered ankle-foot orthosis had to maintain standing balance<symptom> without stepping while receiving anteroposterior pushes. Center of mass kinematics , ankle torques and muscle activity of the lower legs were analyzed to assess the balance<symptom> performance of the user and exoskeleton. The different controllers did not significantly affect the center of mass responses. However , the body sway based controller resulted in a decrease of 29 % in the biological ankle torque compared to the zero impedance controller and a decrease of 32 % compared to the virtual-ankle stiffness. Furthermore , the soleus muscle activity of the left and right leg<symptom> decreased on average with 8 % , while the tibialis anterior muscle activity increased with 47 % compared to zero impedance. The body sway based controller generated human-like torque profiles , whereas the virtual-ankle stiffness did not. As a result , the powered ankle-foot orthosis with the body sway based controller was effective in assisting the healthy subjects in maintaining balance<symptom> , although the improvements were not seen in the body sway response , but in the subjects ' decreased biological ankle torques to counteract the perturbations. This decrease was a combined effect of decreased soleus muscle activity and increased tibialis anterior muscle activity.
