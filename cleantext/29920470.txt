  Greenhouse vegetable production ( GVP) is the major type of vegetable production in China. However , dietary exposure of heavy metals through vegetable consumption has been identified as a potential risk to human health. To ensure safety of vegetables , soil threshold values ( STVs) of cadmium ( Cd) in GVP systems were assessed based on analysis of soil-vegetable Cd contents in relation to human health risk. Contents of Cd were determined in 324 sampled soil-vegetable pairs from five GVP systems in three Chinese provinces. Soil Cd contents ranged from 0.07 to 1.32 mg kg
