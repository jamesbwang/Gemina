  Systemic sclerosis ( SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterised by vascular abnormalities , immune system activation and fibrosis<disease>. Lymphatic involvement in SSc was described more recently and starts in early stages. This report describes a 46-year-old patient who developed over the last 2 years asymmetric lymphedema in lower extremities. Compromise in lymphatic drainage was confirmed by lymphoscintigraphy. She also presented Raynaud 's phenomenon , a scleroderma pattern in nailfold capillaroscopy , cutaneous thickening and anticentromere antibodies , which together resulted in a new diagnosis of limited cutaneous SSc. Treatment with methotrexate , prednisolone and lymphatic drainage resulted in lymphedema improvement. To our knowledge , this is the first case of grade 2 lymphedema in the setting of anticentromere-positive limited cutaneous SSc. We highlight the importance of considering rheumatic diseases in the differential diagnosis of lymphedema.
