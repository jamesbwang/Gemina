  Animal studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs) have antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory properties. Results from epidemiologic studies on specific types of PUFAs for lung cancer risk , however , are inconclusive. We prospectively evaluated the association of specific types of dietary PUFA intakes and lung cancer risk in two population-based cohort studies , the Shanghai Women 's Health Study ( SWHS) and Shanghai Men 's Health Study ( SMHS) with a total of 121,970 study participants ( i.e. , 65,076 women and 56,894 men). Dietary fatty acid intakes were derived from data collected at the baseline using validated food frequency questionnaires ( FFQs). Cox proportional hazards model was performed to assess the association between PUFAs and lung cancer risk. Total , saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intakes were not significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Total PUFAs intake was inversely associated with lung cancer risk ( HRs and respective 95 % CIs for quintiles 2 to 5 versus quintile 1: 0.84 ( 0.71-0.98) , 0.97 ( 0.83-1.13) , 0.86 ( 0.74-1.01) and 0.85 ( 0.73-1.00) , P
