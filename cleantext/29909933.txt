  The emphasis that United States employers are placing on employee wellness continues to grow; however , most attention has been paid to larger firms to gauge return-on-investment from a larger pool of enrollees. With fewer resources available to fund expansive wellness programs , smaller businesses need a cost-effective mechanism to provide such benefits. As the most accessible healthcare provider , community pharmacists are in an ideal position to support certain wellness programs for smaller businesses. This research piloted a community pharmacist-led , employer-sponsored wellness program for a self-insured financial services company in Tennessee. Employees with diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , asthma , or COPD were recruited from the partnering firm to receive live , one-on-one counseling from a community pharmacist over a calendar year. Each session was tailored to individual employee 's needs and goals but generally focused on medication adherence , diet , exercise , and health maintenance strategies. Fifteen employees participated in the program , and improvements in clinical measures were not realized over the course of a year. Some , albeit not statistically significant , improvements were seen in self-reported medication adherence and quality of life; however , a trend toward some weight gain was observed. Results suggest that , similar to Medicare beneficiaries , working-age adults with certain chronic conditions may benefit from pharmacist-led MTM programs but deeper investigation is needed.
