  To compare the effectiveness of single balloon catheter with double balloon catheter and dinoprostone insert for cervical ripening and labor induction on unfavourable cervix. this is a comparative , retrospective , one-center trial. Were included singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation. Were excluded cicatricial uterus. The outcomes were vaginal delivery rate , caesarean section rate , modification in Bishop score , time from induction to delivery , second time prostaglandin E2 resort , oxytocin administration resort , maternal or neonatal adverse events. Were included 108 patients: 45 in single balloon catheter group , 32 in double balloon catheter group , 31 in dinoprostone insert group. Vaginal delivery rate was similar in single balloon catheter group ( 78 %) compared with others groups ( 75 % in double balloon catheter and 71 % in dinoprostone insert group respectively). Oxytocin administration resort was superior in single balloon catheter group. There was no significant difference on others outcomes. Labor induction costs were 9euros in single balloon catheter group , versus 55 and 81 euros in double balloon catheter group and dinoprostone insert group respectively. Single balloon catheter seems just as effective as double balloon catheter and dinoprostone insert with its major asset the low cost for labor induction.
