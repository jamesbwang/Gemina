  This research describes vowel letter dyslexia , a new type of dyslexia characterized by impaired reading of vowel letters. We report a multiple case study of 23 Hebrew readers with vowel letter dyslexia ( 1 acquired , 22 developmental). They made vowel-letter migrations , omissions , and additions in reading , with significantly fewer errors on consonants , and without vowel errors in speech production. Based on 24 tests that examined various components and the analysis of errors in reading 33,483 words , we ruled out deficits in the orthographic-visual analysis and phonological-output stages , as well as visual , morphological , and auditory deficits. We concluded that vowel letter dyslexia results from a selective deficit in a vowel-letter tier in the sublexical route. Indeed , vowel errors occurred predominantly when the participants read via the sublexical route. Thus , vowel letter dyslexia provides cognitive neuropsychological evidence for the separate processing of vowels and consonants in the sublexical reading route.
