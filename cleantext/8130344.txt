  A color mapping of fiber tract orientation using diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) can be prominent in clinical practice. The goal of this paper is to perform a comparative study of visualized diffusion anisotropy in the human brain anatomical entities using three different color-mapping techniques based on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) and DTI. The first technique is based on calculating a color map from DWIs measured in three perpendicular directions. The second technique is based on eigenvalues derived from the diffusion tensor. The last technique is based on three eigenvectors corresponding to sorted eigenvalues derived from the diffusion tensor. All magnetic resonance imaging measurements were achieved using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Vision whole body imaging system. A single-shot DW echoplanar imaging sequence used a Stejskal-Tanner approach. Trapezoidal diffusion gradients are used. The slice orientation was transverse. The basic measurement yielded a set of 13 images. Each series consists of a single image without diffusion weighting , besides two DWIs for each of the next six noncollinear magnetic field gradient directions. The three types of color maps were calculated consequently using the DWI obtained and the DTI. Indeed , we established an excellent similarity between the image data in the color maps and the fiber directions of known anatomical structures ( e.g. , corpus callosum and gray matter). In the meantime , rotationally invariant quantities such as the eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor reflected better , the real orientation found in the studied tissue.
