  The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of male familial caregivers of persons with Alzheimer 's disease from low socio-economic status using the ecological systems theory perspective. The data were obtained from 11 semi-structured interviews that were conducted with the familial caregivers of persons with Alzheimer 's disease. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis , where four main themes emerged , namely , relationship difficulties , understanding Alzheimer 's disease , support networks , and finding meaning and satisfaction in the caregiving role. Behavioral problems , erosion of the relationship with the significant other , familial conflict , experience of diagnosis , lack of information , lack of free time , and financial concerns were identified challenges facing caregivers. Provision of information , support groups , social support , community-based support , and finding meaning and satisfaction in the caregiving role were reported as resources that assist in caregiver coping. Men seem to be capable of providing effective care and are able to successfully manage in their caregiving role. Culture seems to play a significant role in help-seeking behavior and the approach to caregiving. The findings provide the basis for the specific needs of male caregivers that should be focused on in order to provide culturally appropriate services to enhance caregiver coping amongst male caregivers in similar settings.
