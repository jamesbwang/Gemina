  Paraquat is a common and effective herbicide; although its poisoning<disease> could lead to severe oxidative organ damages and its main target organs are the lungs , kidneys , heart , and liver. Thymoquinone is the active ingredient of Nigella sativa which is traditionally used in herbal medicine; recent studies have shown that thymoquinone could inhibit oxidative stress. This study explores protective effects of thymoquinone on paraquat-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Accordingly , adult male mice were randomly divided into nine groups for three continuous days intraperitoneal injection treatment: ( 1) control; ( 2) solvent; ( 3) 20 mg/kg vitamin E; ( 4) 20 mg/kg thymoquinone; ( 5) 20 mg/kg paraquat and Groups 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 received 20 mg/kg of vitamin E and 5 , 10 , and 20 mg/kg of thymoquinone , respectively. The last four groups , received 20 mg/kg paraquat just 24 h after pretreatments. We assessed serum liver enzymes activities , liver histopathology changes , oxidative ( lipid peroxidation) and antioxidative ( ferric reducing antioxidant power) potential , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase activity , and total thiol groups content after administration of the poison and treatments. Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg thymoquinone inhibited , safely , the elevations in levels of liver function tests ( LFTs) and lipid peroxidation , restored the activity of SOD , and ameliorated the histopathological alterations induced by paraquat. Eventually , our results indicate that thymoquinone performs its hepatoprotective role in mice by prevention of SOD suppression mediated by paraquat.
