  Over activation of the endothelin-1 ( ET-1) system in disease states contributes to endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand , ET-1 promotes proliferation and survival of endothelial cells. Regulation of programmed cell death ( PCD) pathways is critical for cell survival. Recently discovered necroptosis ( regulated necrosis<symptom>) is a pathological PCD mechanism mediated by the activation of toll like receptor 4 ( TLR4) , which also happens to stimulate ET-1 production in dendritic cells. To establish the effect of ET-1 on PCD and survival of human brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMVECs) under control and inflammatory conditions , BMVECs were treated with ET-1 ( 10 nM , 100 nM and 1 microM) or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , 100 ng/ml). ET receptors were blocked with bosentan ( 10 microM). Under normal growth conditions , exogenous ET-1 reduced BMVEC viability and migration at a relatively high concentration ( 1 microM). This was accompanied with activation of necroptosis and apoptosis marker genes. LPS decreased endogenous ET-1 secretion , increased ET ( B) receptor expression and activated necroptosis. Even though ET-1 levels were low ( less than 10 nM levels used under normal growth conditions) , blocking of ET receptors with bosentan inhibited the necroptosis pathway and improved the cell migration ability of BMVECs , suggesting that under inflammatory conditions , ET-1 activates PCD pathways in BMVECs even at physiological levels.
