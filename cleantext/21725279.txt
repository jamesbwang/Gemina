  Several chemoenzymatic routes have been explored for the preparation of cinacalcet , a calcimimetic agent. Transaminases ( TAs) and ketoreductases ( KREDs) turned out to be useful biocatalysts for the preparation of key optically active precursors. Thus , the asymmetric amination of 1-acetonaphthone yielded an enantiopure (
