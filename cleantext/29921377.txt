  We explored the role of APC-mediated MDR-1/ CLCX-1 signaling pathway in ovarian tumors. In this study , ovarian tumor cell lines SKOV-3 , ES-2 and MCV-152 were used to conduct the research. Fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western-blotting were used to investigate the effects of MDR-1/ CLCX-1 signaling pathway in ovarian tumors. The effects of the APC gene silencing and overexpression on proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian tumor cells were detected by flow cytometry. Compared to normal cells , the expression of APC gene mRNA in ovarian tumor cells was significantly decreased ( p less than 0.05). Western-blotting results showed that the level of APC protein in ovarian tumor cells was significantly lower than that in normal tissue , while MDR-1/ CLCX-1 related proteins levels were significantly increased ( p less than 0.05). In the APC gene silenced ovarian tumor cell lines , the expression of MDR-1/ CLCX-1 was significantly higher than that of the untreated group ( p less than 0.05) , and apoptosis of ovarian tumor cells decreased. However , in ovarian tumor cell lines that over-expressed APC gene , the expression of MDR-1/ CLCX-1 was significantly lower than that of the untreated group ( p less than 0.05) , and apoptosis of ovarian tumor cells was increased. There is a certain correlation between the APC gene and ovarian tumors , and the APC gene mediates the apoptosis of tumor cells through the MDR-1/ CLCX-1 signaling pathway.
