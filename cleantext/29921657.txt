  The μ-opioid receptor ( MOR) agonist morphine is commonly used for pain management , but it has severe adverse effects and produces analgesic tolerance. Thus , alternative ways of stimulating MOR activity are needed. We found that MrgC11 , a sensory neuron-specific G protein-coupled receptor , may form heteromeric complexes with MOR. Peptide-mediated activation of MrgC11 enhanced MOR recycling by inducing coendocytosis and sorting of MOR for membrane reinsertion. MrgC11 activation also inhibited the coupling of MOR to β-arrestin-2 and enhanced the morphine-dependent inhibition of cAMP production. Intrathecal coadministration of a low dose of an MrgC agonist potentiated acute morphine analgesia and reduced chronic morphine tolerance in wild-type mice but not in
