  Recently , D,L-methadone has been put forward as adjuvant treatment in glioblastoma ( GBM). We analyzed the μ-opioid receptor expression in a set of GBM cell lines and investigated the efficacy of D,L-methadone alone and in combination with temozolomide ( TMZ). Results & conclusion: Expression of the μ-opioid receptor was similar in the tested cell lines. High concentrations of D,L-methadone induced apoptosis in all cell lines and showed treatment interaction with TMZ. However , in lower dosages , reflecting clinically attainable concentrations , D,L-methadone alone showed no efficacy , and induced even higher proliferation in one specific cell line. Also , no interaction with TMZ was observed. These results suggest caution to the premature use of D,L-methadone in the treatment of GBM patients.
