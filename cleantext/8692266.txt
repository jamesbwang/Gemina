  While the demand for a strong STEM workforce continues to grow , there are challenges that threaten our ability to recruit , train , and retain such a workforce in a way that is effective and sustainable and fosters innovation. One way in which we are meeting this challenge is through the use of the arts in the training of scientists. In this Perspectives article , we review the use of the arts in science education and its benefits in both K-12 and postsecondary education. We also review the use of STEAM ( science , technology , engineering , arts , and mathematics) programs in science outreach and the development of professional scientists.
