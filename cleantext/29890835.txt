  Cell adhesion on conducting polymers is important in organic bioelectronics , including applications such as electronically switchable surfaces and electrochemical transistors. There is a fundamental interest in understanding the conducting polymer-cellular interface though as yet no direct measurements to quantify the cell adhesion forces and energies , particularly at the molecular level , have been undertaken. Here , the authors apply electrochemical-single cell force spectroscopy ( EC-SCFS) to directly quantify the de-adhesion forces between single L929 fibroblast cells and polypyrrole doped with dodecylbenzene sulfonate ( PPy-DBSA) under electrical stimulation. The EC-SCFS reveals single cell de-adhesion forces of 0.65 nN on PPy-DBSA films with adsorbed fibronectin ( FN) protein. Blocking experiments by introducing antibodies show that cell de-adhesion is largely due to the binding ( ∼ 60 % of interactions) of cell-surface α5β1 integrin receptors. Electrochemical oxidation and reduction of PPy-DBSA during initial adsorption of fibronectin cause a significant decrease in the single cell de-adhesion forces to ∼ 0.4 nN , which is suggested to relate to electrical stimulation effects on reducing FN adsorption on the polymer. In contrast , when electrical stimulation is applied after protein adsorption is established and during the EC-SCFS measurements , the single cell de-adhesion is significantly enhanced on the oxidized polymer compared to the reduced and nonbiased polymer. The study highlights the use of EC-SCFS to directly quantify cell adhesion on electrode surfaces , as well as the ability to probe molecular-level interactions such as integrin receptor-FN complexes with forces of ∼ 50-100 pN.
