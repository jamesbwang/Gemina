  Adolescents are the most vulnerable group for alcohol-related diseases , as starting to drink at a young age is associated with an increased risk of alcohol dependence in adulthood. Young people tend to drink large amounts of alcohol to seek out strong emotions and for reaching fun at all costs through the psychotropic properties of alcohol. The behavioural motivations of this kind of drinking ( binge drinking) depend on the lack of awareness of the harmful effects of alcohol , in the rite of social conviviality ( a condition for which alcohol is attributed to the function of facilitating the aggregation among young people) , in the absence of personal interests , lack of controls and family habits. Actions to be taken to limit or stop harmful alcohol consumption in young people should be based on interventions aimed at delaying the age of first contact with alcoholic beverages through the implementation of educational campaigns aimed at young people , their families and the whole society.
