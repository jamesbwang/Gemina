  With further advances in medical genetics , genetic tests to determine predisposition to disease are becoming viable for a growing number of diseases. Accordingly , it has also become important to identify various viewpoints on genetic testing. The aims of this study were to examine awareness of and attitudes toward genetic testing among the general public ( public) , cancer patients ( patients) , and health-care professionals ( clinicians and researchers) in Korea. The present survey was conducted from November 2016 to February 2017. The public and patients were surveyed via face-to-face interviews conducted by trained interviewers. Health-care professionals were surveyed via self-administered questionnaires. In total , 1500 individuals from the general public , 1500 cancer patients , 113 clinicians , and 413 researchers were surveyed. Most respondents from the public and patients had previously heard about genetic testing ( public , 89.4 %; patients , 92.7 % , p < 0.01). Differences in attitudes toward genetic testing among the public , patients , and professionals were noted , although most respondents in the present study were aware of genetic testing. Most of the cancer patients tended to overestimate the potential benefit of genetic testing , whereas clinicians expressed concerns for genetic testing. Providing correct information to people who are scheduled to undergo or order genetic testing could help in making an informed decision thereon.
