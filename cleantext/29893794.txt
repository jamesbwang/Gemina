  Mounting evidence has linked postnatal antibiotic use with body mass index ( BMI) in children , but the influence of prenatal antibiotic use on offspring obesity risk remains unclear. We aimed to assess the association between fetal exposure to antibiotics and obesity at ages 4 and 7 years among 43,332 children using a multi-center prospective cohort of the U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project ( 1959-1976). Antibiotic use was ascertained for mothers during pregnancy. Modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate risk ratios ( RRs) of obesity ( BMI > 95th percentile) and linear mixed models were applied to assess the association with BMI Z-score. Prenatal exposure to antibiotics repeatedly was associated with childhood obesity at age 7 years , and risk of obesity tended to increase with an increasing number of antibiotic exposures ( 2-3 times: RR = 1.22 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.04 , 1.44; â‰¥ 4 times: RR = 1.34 , 95 % CI: 1.03 , 1.73). The magnitude of association was strongest for repeated exposures in second trimester ( RR = 1.40 , 95 % CI = 1.16 , 1.71). Prenatal antibiotic use was not associated with obesity or BMI z-score at age 4 years. These findings support an increased risk of mid-childhood obesity with repeated use of antibiotics during pregnancy.
