  Feed efficiency ( FE) is a measure of the rate between feed intake and body<symptom> weight gain and is subject to constant progress in pigs , based on extensive performance tests and analyses of physiological parameters. However , endocrine regulatory circuits which comprise the sensation and perception of intrinsic requirements and appropriate systemic responses have not yet been fully elucidated. It is hypothesized that the gut-brain-axis , which is a network of hierarchical anterior regulatory tissues , contributes largely to variations in FE. Therefore , full-sib pigs with extreme residual feed intake values were assigned to experimental groups of high and low FE. Relevant hormones , minerals and metabolites including fatty acid profiles were analysed in serum to assess postprandial conditions. Transcriptome profiles were deduced from intestinal ( duodenum , jejunum<symptom> , ileum) and neuroendocrine tissues ( hypothalamus). Serum analyses of feed-efficient animals showed an increased content of the incretin GIP , calcium , magnesium , Î²-hydroxybutyric acid and fat compared to low FE pigs. Complementary expression profiles in intestinal tissues indicate a modulated permeability and host-microbe interaction in FE-divergent pigs. Transcriptomic analyses of the hypothalamus showed that differences between the FE groups in appetite<symptom> and satiety regulation are less pronounced. However , hypothalamic abundance of transcripts like ADCY7 , LHCGR , and SLC2A7 and molecular signatures in local and systemic tissue sites indicate that increased allocation and circulation of energy equivalents , minerals and hormones is promoted in feed-efficient animals. Overall , patterns of gastrointestinal hormones and gene expression profiles identified host-microbiota interaction , intestinal permeability , feed intake regulation and energy expenditure as potential mechanisms affecting FE in pigs.
