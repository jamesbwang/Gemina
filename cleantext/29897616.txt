  The biosynthesis of phytotoxin thaxtomin A ( TXT) constitutes the major pathogenicity determinant in Streptomyces scabies , the most widely studied phytopathogen causing scab disease in potato and other root crops. It is recognized that S. scabies regulates its pathogenicity via Î³-butyrolactone ( GBL)- dependent quorum sensing ( QS) signalling. AttM , from Agrobacterium<pathogen> tumefaciens<pathogen> C58 strain , has recently been proposed to have GBL-assimilative capacity. Here , we presented the introduction of A. tumefaciens-derived attM gene into S. scabies using the Escherichia<pathogen> coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pIJ8600 via intergeneric conjugation , followed by the investigation of secondary metabolism ( mycelium growth , TXT production and pathogenicity) in S. scabies attM exconjugants ( S.s/ attM) in comparison with their wild-type parent strain ( S.s/ WT). Among the resultant S.s/ attM exconjugants , attM was found to be integrated into S. scabies chromosome as analysed by Southern blotting. Moreover , S.s/ attM failed to evoke the disease symptoms in planta and displayed altered morphological differentiation in contrast to S.s/ WT. The abolishment of TXT production in S.s/ attM substantiated the loss of pathogenicity and also implied that attM , when constitutively expressed in S. scabies , could paralyse its GBL signalling pathway. Altogether , lactonase-coding gene attM would be useful in a quorum quenching strategy for plant protection via suppressing TXT production and pathogenicity of S. scabies.
