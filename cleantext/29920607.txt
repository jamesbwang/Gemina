  Leaf photosynthetic and post-photosynthetic processes modulate the isotope ratios of tree-ring cellulose. Post-photosynthetic processes , such as the remobilization of stored starch in early spring , are important to understanding the mechanisms of xylem formation in tree stems; however , untangling the isotope ratio signals of photosynthetic and post-photosynthetic processes imprinted on tree rings is difficult. Portions of carbon-bound hydrogen and oxygen atoms are exchanged with medium water during post-photosynthetic processes. We investigated the δD and δ18O values of tree-ring cellulose using Quercus crispula Blume trees in two different habitats to evaluate seasonal changes in the exchange rate ( f-value) of hydrogen or oxygen with medium water , and examined the associations of the post-photosynthetic processes. Theoretically , if the f-value is constant , δD and δ18O would be positively correlated due to meteorological factors , while variation in the f-value will create a discrepancy and weak correlation between δD and δ18O due to the exchange of carbon-bound hydrogen and oxygen with medium water. The values of δD decreased drastically from earlywood to latewood , while those of δ18O increased to a peak and then decreased toward the latewood. The estimated seasonal f-value was high at the beginning of earlywood and decreased toward the latewood. The post-photosynthetic processes associated with changes in the f-value were the remobilization of stored starch and triose cycling during cellulose synthesis because of the shortage of photo-assimilates in early spring. Although we did not evaluate relevant physiological parameters , the seasonal pattern of δD and δ18O in tree-ring cellulose of Q. crispula was clear , suggesting that the dual isotope ( δD and δ18O) approach can be used to reveal the resource allocation mechanisms underlying seasonal xylem formation.
