  A large proportion of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( heFH) do not reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c) levels advocated by international guidelines ( < 70 mg/dL or < 100 mg/dL). We set out to model which proportion of patients reach targets using conventional and novel therapies. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in a large cohort of genetically identified heFH patients and calculated the proportion reaching treatment targets in four scenarios: ( 1) after 50 % LDL-c reduction ( representing maximal dose statin); ( 2) after 70 % LDL-c reduction ( maximal dose statin + ezetimibe); ( 3) additional 40 % LDL-c reduction representing cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor ( CETPi); and ( 4) 60 % LDL-c reduction ( proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors ( PCSK9i)) , on top of scenario 2. We applied 100 % adherence rates and literature-based adherence rates from 62 % to 80 %. We included 1,059 heFH patients with and 9,420 heFH patients without coronary heart disease ( CHD). With maximal dose statin , 8.3 % and 48.1 % of patients with and without CHD would reach their recommended LDL-c targets , respectively. This increases to 54.3 % and 93.2 % when ezetimibe is added. Addition of CETPi increases these numbers to 95.7 % and 99.7 % , whereas adding PCSK9i would result in 99.8 % and 100 % goal attainment. Using literature-based adherence rates , these numbers decrease to 3.8 % and 27.3 % for maximal dose statin , 5.8 % and 38.9 % combined with ezetimibe , 31.4 % and 81.2 % when adding CETPi , and 40.3 % and 87.1 % for addition of PCSK9i. Less than 10 % with and 50 % of heFH patients without CHD would reach treatment targets with maximal dose statin , but this substantially increases on addition of ezetimibe , CETPi , or PCSK9i. However , considering recently published adherence data , this might be lower in real life , especially in heFH patients with CHD.
