  Actin-binding LIM protein 1 ( ABLIM1) , a member of the LIM-domain protein family , mediates interactions between actin filaments and cytoplasmic targets. However , the role of ABLIM1 in osteoclast and bone metabolism has not been reported. In the present study , we investigated the role of ABLIM1 in the receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand ( RANKL)- mediated osteoclastogenesis. ABLIM1 expression was induced by RANKL treatment and knockdown of ABLIM1 by retrovirus infection containing Ablim1-specific short hairpin RNA ( shAblim1) decreased mature osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity in a RANKL-dose dependent manner. Coincident with the downregulated expression of osteoclast differentiation marker genes , the expression levels of c-Fos and the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 ( NFATc1) , critical transcription factors of osteoclastogenesis , were also decreased in shAblim1-infected osteoclasts during RANKLmediated osteoclast differentiation. In addition , the motility of preosteoclast was reduced by ABLIM1 knockdown via modulation of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ Akt/Rac1 signaling pathway , suggesting another regulatory mechanism of ABLIM1 in osteoclast formation. These data demonstrated that ABLIM1 is a positive regulator of RANKLmediated osteoclast formation via the modulation of the differentiation and PI3K/Akt/Rac1-dependent motility.
