  The fungus Penicillium<pathogen> purpurogenum grows on a variety of natural carbon sources and secretes a large number of enzymes which degrade the polysaccharides present in lignocellulose. In this work , the gene coding for a novel endoxylanase has been identified in the genome of the fungus. This gene ( xynd) possesses four introns. The cDNA has been expressed in Pichia pastoris and characterized. The enzyme , XynD , belongs to family 10 of the glycoside hydrolases. Mature XynD has a calculated molecular weight of 40,997. It consists of 387 amino acid residues with an N-terminal catalytic module , a linker rich in ser and thr residues , and a C-terminal family 1 carbohydrate-binding module. XynD shows the highest identity ( 97 %) to a putative endoxylanase from Penicillium subrubescens but its highest identity to a biochemically characterized xylanase ( XYND from Penicillium funiculosum) is only 68 %. The enzyme has a temperature optimum of 60 Â°C , and it is highly stable in its pH optimum range of 6.5-8.5. XynD is the fourth biochemically characterized endoxylanase from P. purpurogenum , confirming the rich potential of this fungus for lignocellulose biodegradation. XynD , due to its wide pH optimum and stability , may be a useful enzyme in biotechnological procedures related to this biodegradation process.
