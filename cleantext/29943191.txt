  Besides the established spot sign in computed tomography angiography ( CTA) , recently investigated imaging predictors of hematoma growth in noncontrast computed tomography ( NCCT) suggest great potential for outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). Secondary hematoma growth is an appealing target for therapeutic interventions because in contrast to other determined factors , it is potentially modifiable. Even more initial therapy studies failed to demonstrate clear therapeutic benefits , there is a need for an effective patient selection using imaging markers to identify patients at risk for poor outcome and thereby tailor individual treatments for every patient. Hence , this review gives an overview about the current literature on NCCT imaging markers for neurological outcome prediction and aims to clarify the association with the established spot sign. Moreover , it demonstrates the clinical impact of these parameters and gives a roadmap for future imaging research in patients with intracerebral
