  To determine the temporal occurrence of fluid signal changes on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( T2MRI) that occur in the cochlear lumen after translabyrinthine surgery. Retrospective case control study. Tertiary referral neurotology center. Seventy-one patients were identified who underwent translabyrinthine removal of a vestibular schwannoma between 2010 and 2014; of these 49 were included as they had postoperative T2 MRI at 6 , 18 , and 48 months available postsurgery. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were scored base on fluid signal changes within the cochlea. In total , 147 magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed on 49 patients. In the cohort analysis 86 % of patients showed evidence of fluid signal changes 48 months postoperatively. Ninety-five percent of patients who went on to demonstrate loss of fluid signal at 48 months had already shown changes at 6 months postsurgery. The majority of cochlea signal changes identified at 6 months were minor ( 72 % Grade 1) while at 48 months this had progressed to severe ( 71 % Grade 2 or 3). Of the patients with a normal cochlea at 6 months 78 % maintained a normal cochlea to the 48-month scan. Cochlear signal changes suggestive of fibrosis<disease> occurred in most patients following translabyrinthine removal of vestibular schwannoma. Given the early onset of cochlear fluid signal changes on T2MRI , and the progression of these changes on subsequence imaging , cochlear implantation would ideally need to be performed either simultaneous to translabyrinthine surgery or as an early second-stage procedure to maximize the chance of a successful electrode insertion , or one can consider a placeholder as well.
