  Non-suicidal self-injury ( NSSI) behaviors are self-injurious behaviors inflicted without intending death. Literature has shown the relationship between stressful life events ( SLE) and NSSI behaviors. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Dysregulation Profile ( SDQ-DP) is defined as an index of self-regulatory problems , related to higher risk for suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents. In this study the relationship between SDQ-DP and NSSI behaviors , mediated by SLE in a clinical sample of children and adolescents is analyzed. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 239 subjects ( aged from 11 to 17) to test the mediation model. SDQ-DP significantly correlates with NSSI behaviors ( Wald = 6.5477 , p = .0105); SDQ-DP significantly correlates with SLE ( T = 5.7229 , p < .001); SLE significantly correlates NSSI behaviors , and the relation remains significant whilst controlling for SDQ-DP ( Wald = 4.1715 , p = .041); the relation between SDQ-DP and NSSI behaviors stops being significant whilst controlling for the potential mediator ( SLE) ( Wald = 2.9951 , p = .0835). Study of indirect effect supports the mediation model ( .0585 CI ( .0016 , .1266)). Findings are compatible with the complete mediation scenario. These results point out the importance of self-regulatory problems in coping strategies with regards to SLE and the development of NSSI behaviors.
