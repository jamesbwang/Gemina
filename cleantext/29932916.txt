  Vascular calcification is extremely common and associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) 21 has been identified as a potent metabolic regulator and a protector of the cardiovascular system. In this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of FGF21 on calcification of vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC) and its mechanism. FGF21 inhibited beta-glycerophosphate ( BGP) induced mineralization in VSMCs as determined by calcium concentration and Alizarin Red S. FGF21 suppressed BGP-induced BMP2/Smad signaling pathway components as well as osteoblast differentiation markers. FGF21 and Noggin could synergistically inhibit BGP-induced BMP2/Smad pathway expressions and calcification. Taken together , FGF21 inhibits vascular calcification in vitro by modulating BMP2/Smad signaling pathway.
