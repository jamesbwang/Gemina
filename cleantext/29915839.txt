  Group-III metal monochalcogenides have emerged as a new class of two-dimensional ( 2D) semiconductor materials. For the integration of 2D materials for various potential device applications , there is an inevitable need to reduce their dimensionality into specific sized nanostructures with edges. Owing to the properties of finite-sized 2D nanostructures strongly related to the edge configurations , the precise understanding of the edge geometric structures at an atomic level is of particular importance. By means of first-principles calculations , the geometric structures and electronic properties of stable zigzag and armchair edges in a prototype example GaSe<disease> monolayer have been identified. Our results demonstrate that both Ga- and Se-terminated zigzag edges prefer to the ( 3 Ã— 1) reconstructions , and the armchair edges with the perfect flat configuration are energetically favorable. It is unexpectedly found that both zigzag and armchair GaSe<disease> nanoribbons with reconstructed edges are semiconductors , which is different from previous recognition where the zigzag edges are metallic. Moreover , the edge-dependent flake shape in GaSe has been plotted using the Wulff construction theory , and the shape evolution with chemical potentials can be applied to explain broad experimental observations on the morphologies of GaSe<disease> flakes. Importantly , similar reconstructions and electronic properties also appeared at InSe edges , suggesting that the reconstruction induced semiconducting edges are a fundamental phenomenon for 2D group-III metal monochalcogenides.
