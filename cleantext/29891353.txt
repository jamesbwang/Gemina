  To identify the preconception risk factors in parents of children suffering from congenital cardiopathy. A cross-sectional descriptive study , which included parents of children suffering from cardiopathy , attended at consultations in a not-for-profit organization , in order to be diagnosed and referred for heart surgery or to be assessed in postoperative cardiac monitoring. The sample population included 500 people who responded to a survey for the identification of socio-demographic and preconception risk factors. Couples were found with up to 3 cardiac children. Parents with 2 or more children suffering from cardiopathy were classified in the majority as belonging to the middle socioeconomic level and not owning their own house. An association with the number of children with cardiopathy , the educational level of their parents ( P = .013) , their home area ( P = .041) and type of accommodation ( P = .045) was found. Regarding the preconception risk factors , there was evidence of statistically significant associations among the number of children with cardiopathy and their exposure to fertilizers ( P = .024) , their exposure to fuels ( P = .025) , the use of antihypertensive medication ( P = .37) , and alcohol consumption ( P = .042) and cocaine use ( P = .039) by their parents. The population of parents with a greater number of children suffering from cardiopathy were characterized as having socioeconomic and educational constraints. The preconception risk factors which show an association with the number of children suffering from cardiopathy were characterized as physical and/or chemical environmental risk factors and the consumption of certain psychoactive substances and medication by their parents. It is necessary to analyze each risk factor separately , taking into account the different types of cardiopathy.
