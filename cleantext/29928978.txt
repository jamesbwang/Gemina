  Methotrexate ( MTX) , as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD) , was first line drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. However , the severe side effect during long term and high dosage usage limit its application. The aim of this study was to develop dual-functional lipid polymeric hybrid pH-responsive nanoparticles to deliver MTX to inflamed joints selectively. The designed MTX loaded stearic acid-octa-arginine and folic acid decorated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid ( PLGA)- PK3-based lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles ( Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/ MTX) were composed of PK3 , Folate-PEG-PLGA , egg PC , and Sta-R8. The nanoparticles exhibited smooth spherical morphology and particle size of 100-150 nm. The in vitro release study indicated that MTX was released faster in phosphate buffered solution ( PBS) of pH 5.0 than that in PBS of pH 7.4 from Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/ MTX. The cellular uptake study revealed that Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/ MTX were internalized through folate receptor mediated endocytosis into activated macrophages. Therapeutic effects on adjuvant-induced arthritis<disease> ( AIA) rats further confirm that Sta-R8-FA-PPLPNs/ MTX could be promising against rheumatoid
