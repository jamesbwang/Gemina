  Neonicotinoid insecticides used in agriculture can enter freshwater environments in pulses; that is , a short-term period of a higher concentration , followed by a period of a comparatively lower concentration. Non-target aquatic arthropods are exposed to these fluctuating concentrations of neonicotinoids. The present study investigated the potential latent effects of a single environmentally-relevant 24-h pulse of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam , in separate experiments , on the early life-stages of four aquatic arthropods ( Hyalella azteca , Chironomus dilutus , Hexagenia spp. , and Neocloeon triangulifer). At least three nominal pulse concentrations were tested for each neonicotinoid-species combination: 2.5 , 5 , and 10 Î¼g L
