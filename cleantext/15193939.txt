  Sustained attention is a fundamental prerequisite for all cognitive functions and its impairment is a common aftermath of both developmental and acquired neurological disorders. To date , all the sustained attention tasks rely heavily on selective attention to external stimuli. The interaction between selective and sustained attention represents a limit in the field of assessment and may mislead researchers or distort conclusions. The aim of the present perspective study was to propose a sustained version of the Paced Finger Tapping ( S-PFT) test as a novel approach to measure sustained attention that does not leverage external stimuli. Here , we administered S-PFT and other attentional tasks ( visual sustained attention , visuospatial attention capacity , selective attention , and divided attention tasks) to 85 adolescents. Thus , we provide evidence suggesting that S-PFT is effective in causing performance decrement over time , an important trademark of sustained attention tasks. We also present descriptive statistics showing the relationship between S-PFT and the other attentional tasks. These analyses show that , unlike visual sustained attention tests , performances to our task of internal sustained attention were not correlated to measures of selective attention and visuospatial attention capacity. Our results suggest that S-PFT could represent a promising and alternative tool both for empirical research and clinical assessment of sustained attention.
