  Due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio ( SNR) and unavoidable head motions , the pairwise subtraction perfusion signal extraction process in arterial spin labeling ( ASL) perfusion MRI can produce extreme outliers. We previously proposed an adaptive outlier cleaning ( AOC) algorithm for ASL MRI. While it performed well even for clinical ASL data , two issues still exist. One is that if the reference is already dominated by noise , outlier cleaning using low correlation with the mean as a rejection criterion will actually reject the less noisy samples but keep the more noisy ones. The other is that it is sub-optimal to reject the entire outlier volumes without considering the quality of each constituent slices. To address both problems , a prior-guided and slice-wise AOC algorithm was proposed in this study. The reference of AOC was initiated to be a pseudo cerebral blood flow ( CBF) map based on prior knowledge and outlier rejection was performed at each slice. ASL data from the ADNI database ( www.adni-info.org) were used to validate the method. Image preprocessing was performed using ASLtbx. The proposed method outperformed the original AOC and SCORE in terms of higher SNR and test-retest stability of the resultant CBF maps. ASL CBF can be substantially improved using prior-guided and slice-wise outlier rejection. The proposed method will benefit the ever since increasing ASL user community for both clinical and scientific brain research.
