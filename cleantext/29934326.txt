  Both epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET) are linked to metastasis via their ability to increase invasiveness and enhance tumor-initiating capacity. Growth factors , cytokines and chemotherapies present in the tumor microenvironment ( TME) are capable of inducing EMT , but the role of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) in this process remains poorly understood. Here , a novel tessellated three-dimensional ( 3D) polymer scaffolding is used to produce a fibrillar fibronectin matrix that induces a EMT-like event that includes phosphorylation of STAT3 and requires expression of Î²1 integrin. Consistent with these findings , analysis of the METABRIC dataset strongly links high-level fibronectin ( FN) expression to decreased patient survival. In contrast , in vitro analysis of the MCF-10A progression series indicated that intracellular FN expression was associated with non-metastatic cells. Therefore , differential bioluminescent imaging was used to track the metastasis of isogenic epithelial and mesenchymal cells within heterogeneous tumors. Interestingly , mesenchymal tumor cells do not produce a FN matrix and can not complete the metastatic process , even when grown within a tumor containing epithelial cells. However , mesenchymal tumor cells form FN containing cellular fibrils capable of supporting the growth and migration of metastatic-competent tumor cells. Importantly , depletion of FN allows mesenchymal tumor cells to regain epithelial characteristics and initiate in vivo tumor growth within a metastatic microenvironment. In contrast to the tumor promoting functions of fibronectin within the ECM , these data suggest that autocrine fibronectin production inhibits the metastatic potential of mesenchymal tumor cells.
