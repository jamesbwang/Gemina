  To determine the prevalence of monochorionic monoamniotic ( MCMA) twin pregnancies and to describe perinatal outcomes and clinical management of these pregnancies. This multicentre cohort study used population-based data on MCMA twin pregnancies from 11 Northern Survey of Twin and Multiple Pregnancy ( NorSTAMP) maternity units for the prevalence estimation of MCMA twinning. Pregnancy outcomes at < 24 weeks ' gestation , antenatal parameters and perinatal outcomes ( from ≥ 24 weeks to the first 28 days of life) were analysed using combined data on pregnancies with confirmed MCMA chorionicity from the NorSTAMP and the Southwest Thames Region of London Obstetric Research Collaborative ( STORK) multiple pregnancy cohort for 2000-2013. The estimated total prevalence of MCMA twin pregnancies in the North of England was 8.2 per 1000 total twin pregnancies ( 59/7170) , the birth prevalence was 0.08 per 1000 all ( singleton and multiple) pregnancies. The rate of a spontaneous or iatrogenic fetal death at < 24 weeks ' gestation was 31.8 % ( 54/170); the overall perinatal mortality was 14.7 % ( 17/116) , ranging from 69.2 % at < 30 weeks to 4.5 % at ≥ 33 weeks ' gestation. MCMA twins who survived in utero beyond 24 weeks were delivered , usually by caesarean section , at a median of 33 weeks of gestation ( interquartile range = 32-34). In MCMA twins surviving beyond 24 weeks of gestation , there was a higher survival rate compared to previous decades presumably due to early diagnosis , close surveillance and elective birth around 32-34 weeks of gestation. High perinatal mortality at early gestations was mainly attributed to extreme prematurity due to preterm spontaneous labour. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
