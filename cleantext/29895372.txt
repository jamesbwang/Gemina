  Zinc is integral for the normal function of pancreatic β-cells in glycaemic control. Large amounts of zinc are secreted from β-cells following insulin exocytosis and regulated replenishment is required , which is thought to be mediated by the ZIP family of zinc importer proteins. Within Type 2 Diabetic patients , β-cells are stressed through prolonged stimulation by hyperglycaemia and this is thought to be a major factor contributing to loss of β-cell identity and mass. However , the consequences for the β-cell zinc status remain largely unexplored. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS) to show that 24 h treatment of MIN6 cells with potassium chloride , mimicking hyperglycaemic stimulation , reduces the total cellular zinc content 2.8-fold , and qPCR to show an increase in mRNA expression for metallothioneins ( Mt1 and Mt2) following 4 and 24 h of stimulation , suggestive of an early rise in cytosolic zinc. To determine which ZIP paralogues may be responsible for zinc replenishment , we used immunocytochemistry , Western blot and qPCR to demonstrate initial ZIP1 protein upregulation proceeded by downregulation of mRNA coding for ZIP1 , ZIP6 , ZIP7 and ZIP14. To assign a biological significance to the decreased total cellular zinc content , we assessed expression of key β-cell markers to show downregulation of mRNA for MafA , Mnx-1 , Nkx2 .2 and Pax6. Our data suggest hyperglycaemia-induced zinc depletion may contribute to loss of β-cell markers and promote β-cell dedifferentiation through disrupting expression of key transcription factors.
