  Protein bacteriocins are potent narrow spectrum antibiotics that exploit outer membrane porins to kill bacteria by poorly understood mechanisms. Here , we determine how colicins , bacteriocins specific for Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , engage the trimeric porin OmpF to initiate toxin entry. The N-terminal ∼ 80 residues of the nuclease colicin ColE9 are intrinsically unstructured and house two OmpF binding sites ( OBS1 and OBS2) that reside within the pores of OmpF and which flank an epitope that binds periplasmic TolB. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations , chemical trimerization , isothermal titration calorimetry , fluorescence microscopy , and single channel recording planar lipid bilayer measurements , we show that this arrangement is achieved by OBS2 binding from the extracellular face of OmpF , while the interaction of OBS1 occurs from the periplasmic face of OmpF. Our study shows how the narrow pores of oligomeric porins are exploited by colicin disordered regions for direction-specific binding , which ensures the constrained presentation of an activating signal within the bacterial periplasm.
