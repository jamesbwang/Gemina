  To compare daptomycin exposures and predicted safety outcomes with a simulated weight-based and fixed dose in morbidly obese and nonobese subjects. We performed a nonparametric population pharmacokinetic analysis of daptomycin concentration-time data from a prior obese and nonobese kidney function-matched cohort of healthy adult volunteers. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare the maximum concentrations ( C No significant differences were observed in clearance , volume of distribution at steady state , or terminal half-life between the morbidly obese and nonobese PK models. Daptomycin 6 mg/kg/day resulted in AUC , C Weight-based maintenance dosing of daptomycin is less likely to yield bioequivalent exposures in morbidly obese subjects and provides credence for the evaluation of fixed maintenance doses across adult body size to improve safety.
