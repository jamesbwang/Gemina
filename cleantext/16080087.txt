  The ( 1,3)- Î²-D-glucan assay ( BDG) is recommended for the early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis ( IC). Records of 154 critically ill adults with suspected IC , on whom BDG was done , were analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups: Group A ( confirmed IC) , Group B ( alternative diagnosis or cause of severe sepsis<disease>) , and Group C ( high candidal score and positive BDG ( > 80 pg/mL) but without a confirmed diagnosis of IC). Mean BDG levels were significantly higher in Group A ( A BDG value of < 80 pg/ml facilitates early discontinuation of empirical antifungal therapy , with considerable cost savings.
