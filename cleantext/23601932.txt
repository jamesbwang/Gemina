  Transition metals are required cofactors for many proteins that are critical for life , and their concentration within cells is carefully maintained to avoid both deficiency and toxicity. To defend against bacterial pathogens , vertebrate immune proteins sequester metals , in particular zinc , iron , and manganese , as a strategy to limit bacterial acquisition of these necessary nutrients in a process termed `` nutritional immunity. '' In response , bacteria have evolved elegant strategies to access metals and counteract this host defense. In mammals , metal abundance can drastically shift due to changes in dietary intake or absorption from the intestinal tract , disrupting the balance<symptom> between host and pathogen in the fight for metals and altering susceptibility to disease. This review describes the current understanding of how dietary metals modulate host-microbe interactions and the subsequent impact on the outcome of disease.
