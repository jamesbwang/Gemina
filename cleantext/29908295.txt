  Hyperglycaemia is a major contributor to diabetic cardiovascular disease with hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction recognized as the initiating cause. Coagulation pathway-regulated proteinase-activated receptors ( PARs) that can regulate vascular tone in vivo cause eNOS-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation; but , the impact of hyperglycaemia on this vasodilatory action of PAR stimulation and the signalling pathways involved are unknown. We hypothesized that vascular sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 activity and hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress involving Src-kinase , EGF receptor-kinase , Rho-kinase and protein-kinase-C biochemical signalling pathways would compromise PAR2-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Using an organ culture approach , wherein murine aorta rings were maintained for 24 h at hyperglycaemic 25 mM versus euglycaemic 10 mM glucose , we observed severely blunted acetylcholine/muscarinic and PAR2-mediated endothelial eNOS/NO-dependent vasodilation. PEG-catalase , superoxide-dismutase , and NADPH-oxidase inhibition ( VAS2870) and either SGLT2-inhibition ( canagliflozin/dapagliflozin/empagliflozin) or antioxidant gene induction ( sulforaphane) , prevented the hyperglycaemia-induced impairment of PAR2-mediated vasodilation. Similarly , inhibition of Src-kinase , EGF receptor-kinase , protein kinase-C and Rho-kinase also preserved PAR2-mediated vasodilation in tissues cultured under hyperglycaemic conditions. Thus , intracellular hyperglycaemia , that can be prevented with an inhibitor of the SGLT2 cotransporter that was identified in the vascular tissue and tissue-derived cultured endothelial cells by qPCR , western blot and immunohistochemistry , leads to oxidative stress that compromises PAR2-mediated NOS-dependent vasodilation by an NAPDH oxidase/reactive-oxygen-species- triggered signalling pathway involving EGFR/Src/Rho-kinase and PKC. The data point to novel antioxidant therapeutic strategies including use of an SGLT2 inhibitor and sulforaphane to mitigate hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction.
