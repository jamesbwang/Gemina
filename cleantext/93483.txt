  Pediatric palliative care is a field which focuses on caring for and treating the symptoms and distress typically associated with life-limiting illness. Integrative medicine is supported by evidence and aims to heal the whole person , including all aspects of one & rsquo; s lifestyle. Therapies offered by integrative medicine often empower patients and families , allowing for a sense of control.

We review an introduction to integrative medicine , trends in its incorporation in the healthcare setting , application to patients receiving palliative care and the management of specific symptoms. A case study is offered to illustrate these principles.
