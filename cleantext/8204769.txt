  Neural granulomas<disease> are hallmark of leprosy<disease> Challenges faced in diagnosing paucibacillary leprosy<disease> include: ( i) Difficult visualization of nerve twigs on hematoxylin and eosin ( H and E) sections due to their small size and ( ii) Paucity of organisms on acid-fast bacilli stain. ( 1) This study aimed to test the role of S100 immunostain in demonstrating neural granulomas<disease> in skin biopsies of paucibacillary leprosy<disease> , ( 2) to compare morphology of S100 staining of nerves inside granulomas<disease> among clinicohistologically defined different types of leprosy<disease> , and ( 3) to test whether the pattern of S100 immunostaining can distinguish nerve fragmentation/destruction from a normal intact nerve in skin biopsy. Sixty four diagnosed cases of leprosy<disease> were included in this study. Five skin biopsies with no significant pathology ( for studying intact nerve) and nine nonleprosy cutaneous granulomas<disease> were also studied. ( i) In demonstrating neural granuloma<disease> , sensitivity of H and E was 48.27 % and that of S100 was 100 % , ( ii) Morphology of nerve fragments on S100 stain for cases of leprosy<disease> was fragmented and infiltrated in 37 , intact and infiltrated in 19 , reduced , fragmented , and infiltrated in seven , and absent in one , ( iii) There was a significant difference ( S100 immunostaining showed to be an effective adjuvant to histopathology in diagnosing paucibacillary leprosy<disease> and differentiating it from nonleprosy cutaneous
