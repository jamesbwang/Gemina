  To inform lumretuzumab and pertuzumab dose modifications in order to decrease the incidence , severity , and duration of the diarrhea<disease> events in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with a combination therapy of lumretuzumab ( anti-HER3) in combination with pertuzumab ( anti-HER2) and paclitaxel using quantitative clinical pharmacology modeling approaches. The safety and pharmacokinetic ( PK) data from three clinical trials ( lumretuzumab monotherapy n = 47 , pertuzumab monotherapy n = 78 , and the combination therapy of lumretuzumab , pertuzumab and paclitaxel n = 35) were pooled together to develop a continuous-time discrete states Markov model describing the dynamics of the diarrhea<disease> events. The model was able to capture the time course of different severities of diarrhea<disease> reasonably well. The effect of lumretuzumab and pertuzumab was well described by an E This work shows that PK-toxicity modeling provides insight into how the severity of key adverse events evolves over time and highlights the potential use to support decision making in drug development.
