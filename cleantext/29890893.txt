  Anatomic repair of the anterior talofibular ligament ( ATFL) is challenging when the local ligamentous tissue is severely attenuated. Anatomic reconstruction of the ATFL with tibial tuberosity-patellar tendon ( TT-PT) autograft is a feasible choice that can avoid the complicated tendon-bone healing and restore ankle stability. From 2009 to 2015 , 31 chronic lateral ankle instability ( CLAI) patients ( 31 ankles) , who had a serious injury on the ATFL only , were treated with anatomic reconstruction of ATFL with TT-PT. American orthopedic foot and ankle society ankle-hindfoot score ( AHS) , visual analog scale for pain score ( VAS) , Karlsson-Peterson score , Tegner activity level , and objective examination comprehending range of motion were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes before and after operation. Radiographically , talar tilt angles and anterior drawer were assessed in pre- and postoperative ankle stress views. Among the 31 ankles , 17 ankles with single-bundle ATFL and 14 ankles with double-bundle ATFL were found at operation. At a mean follow-up of 42 months ( 24-82 months) , all patients were satisfied with the procedure. Mean AHS significantly increased from 60.5 ± 8.2 to 93.5 ± 4.8. Mean Karlsson-Peterson score significantly increased from 55.2 ± 11.0 preoperatively to 91.2 ± 6.9 at final follow-up. Average VAS significantly decreased from 5.9 ± 1.6 preoperatively to 1.4 ± 1.0 at the latest follow-up. Mean Tegner activity level was 3.7 ± 0.9 before operation , compared with 7.0 ± 0.8 after operation. On stress radiographs , mean talar tilt angle was 17.0 ± 3.4 ° before operation and 3.8 ± 2.1 ° at the latest follow-up. In addition , mean anterior tibiotalar translation was 7.5 ± 2.2 mm before operation and 1.8 ± 1.1 mm at the latest follow-up. Anatomic reconstruction of the ATFL using a TT-PT autograft allows bone-bone healing in talus and tendon-tendon/periosteum healing in fibula rather than requiring tendon-bone healing , which is an alternative choice for treating CLAI caused by single ATFL insufficiency.
