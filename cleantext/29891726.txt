  Despite lower cancer screening rates and survival rates in the Medicaid population compared to those with private insurance , there is a dearth of population-based evidence-based interventions targeting Medicaid clients to address this problem. This study reports results of a population-based randomized controlled trial ( RCT) among all individuals enrolled in Minnesota 's Medicaid program who were overdue for breast cancer ( BC; n = 22,113) and/or colorectal cancer ( CRC; n = 94,294) screening. Individuals were randomized to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received persuasive direct and innovative mail materials coupled with a $ 20 incentive for using their Medicaid benefit to get screened. Direct mail materials provided a phone number to a call center staffed by patient navigators who addressed barriers and scheduled appointments via three-way calls. The control group received the intervention 15 months later. Primary outcomes were completion of mammography or colonoscopy within 12 weeks of the intervention. Billing claims served as evidence of screening. Multivariate logistic regression showed significant differences for both BC ( p < .001) and CRC ( p < .01). The odds of receiving a mammogram for the treatment group were significantly higher than the control group ( OR = 1.30; CI = 1.16-1.46) , and the treatment group was more likely to receive a colonoscopy than the control group ( OR = 1.12; CI = 1.04-1.21). This population-based intervention increased BC and CRC screening in a Medicaid population overdue for screening Impact: These findings may have broad application for reaching individuals who generally remain outside the health care system despite having public health insurance.
