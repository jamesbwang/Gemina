  Many older adults experience chronic age-related stressors ( e.g. , life regrets or health problems) that are difficult to control and can disturb cortisol regulation. Self-compassion may buffer adverse effects of these stressful experiences on diurnal cortisol secretion in older adulthood. To examine whether self-compassion could benefit older adults ' cortisol secretion in the context of chronic and largely uncontrollable age-related stressors , 233 community-dwelling older adults reported their levels of self-compassion , age-related stressors ( regret intensity , physical health problems , and functional disability) , and relevant covariates. Diurnal cortisol was measured over 3 days and the average area-under-the-curve and slope were calculated. Higher levels of self-compassion were associated with lower daily cortisol levels among older adults who reported higher levels of regret intensity , physical health problems , or functional disability ( βs <- .53 , ps < .01) , but not among their counterparts who reported lower levels of these age-related stressors ( βs < .24 , ps > .28). These results suggest that self-compassion may represent an important personal resource that could protect older adults from stress-related biological disturbances resulting from chronic and uncontrollable stressors.
