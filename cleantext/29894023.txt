  Primary cilia are antenna-like sensory organelles that regulate a substantial number of cellular signalling pathways in vertebrates , both during embryonic development as well as in adulthood , and mutations in genes coding for ciliary proteins are causative of an expanding group of pleiotropic diseases known as ciliopathies. Cilia consist of a microtubule-based axoneme core , which is subtended by a basal body and covered by a bilayer lipid membrane of unique protein and lipid composition. Cilia are dynamic organelles , and the ability of cells to regulate ciliary protein and lipid content in response to specific cellular and environmental cues is crucial for balancing ciliary signalling output. Here we discuss mechanisms involved in regulation of ciliary membrane protein trafficking and signalling , with main focus on kinesin-2 and kinesin-3 family members.
