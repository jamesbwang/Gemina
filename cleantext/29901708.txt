  To examine associations of diastolic and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) at age 50 , 60 , and 70 years with incidence of dementia , and whether cardiovascular disease ( CVD) over the follow-up mediates this association. Systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were measured on 8639 persons ( 32.5 % women) from the Whitehall II cohort study in 1985 , 1991 , 1997 , and 2003. Incidence of dementia ( n dementia/n total = 385/8639) was ascertained from electronic health records followed-up until 2017. Cubic splines using continuous blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measures suggested SBP ≥ 130 mmHg at age 50 but not at age 60 or 70 was associated with increased risk of dementia , confirmed in Cox regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors , health behaviours , and time varying chronic conditions ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.38; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 1.11 , 1.70). Diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was not associated with dementia. Participants with longer exposure to hypertension ( SBP ≥ 130 mmHg) between mean ages of 45 and 61 years had an increased risk of dementia compared to those with no or low exposure to hypertension ( HR 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.00 , 1.66). In multi-state models , SBP ≥ 130 mmHg at 50 years of age was associated with greater risk of dementia in those free of CVD over the follow-up ( HR 1.47 , 95 % CI 1.15 , 1.87). Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 130 mmHg at age 50 , below the conventional ≥ 140 mmHg threshold used to define hypertension , is associated with increased risk of dementia; in these persons this excess risk is independent of CVD.
