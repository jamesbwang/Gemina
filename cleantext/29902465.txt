  To determine national benchmarks and assess variability across centers , the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database ( CHSD) was analyzed to document proportions of patients receiving intraoperative blood transfusion during open heart surgery. Index CPB operations reported in the STS CHSD ( 2014-2015) were potentially eligible for inclusion. Data from centers with > 15 % missing data for packed red blood cell ( PRBC) transfusion were excluded , as were individual records missing information about PRBC transfusion. The distribution of center-level PRBC transfusion rates in various clinically relevant groups was estimated by fitting a two-level logistic mixed model. The study population included 22,874 index CPB operations ( 81 centers). Center-level intraoperative PRBC transfusion rates stratified by age group and STAT Mortality Category were documented. For younger patients , and patients undergoing higher complexity operations , median center PRBC transfusion rates consistently approached 100 % , with narrow interquartile ranges ( IQR) indicating little center variability. Center PRBC transfusion rates declined with increasing patient age , but with greater variability ( wider IQRs) across centers. Intraoperative PRBC transfusion was uncommon ( median center transfusion rates < 30 %) in older patients ( teenagers and adults) undergoing lower complexity ( STAT < 3) operations CONCLUSIONS: Most centers transfuse PRBCs routinely in higher risk , younger and smaller patients , with little variability across centers. For lower risk operations in older and larger patients , centers are more likely to forgo intraoperative transfusions. This analysis provides national benchmarks for center-level PRBC transfusion rates during pediatric and congenital heart surgery.
