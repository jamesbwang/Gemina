  As one of the most water-soluble members in the macrocyclic cucurbit ( n) uril ( CB ( n)) family , CB ( 7) has attracted increasing attention in pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. Despite extensive studies regarding the potential use of CB ( 7) for biomedical applications , its full safety and toxicity profile in a clinically relevant model is still lacking. Herein we report the full biocompatibility profile of CB ( 7) , administered orally , peritoneally or intravenously in mice , respectively. Body-weight changes showed no significant differences among various groups of mice after they were administered with CB ( 7) at a single dose of 5 g/kg orally , 500 mg/kg peritoneally and 150 mg/kg intravenously , respectively. Hematology tests , as well as hepatic and renal function biochemical markers tests , of the blood collected from these mice sacrificed 21 days after CB ( 7) administration all exhibited normal ranges of values that were comparable with those of the control group. Moreover , histopathological analysis on the sections of major organs ( including the heart , liver , spleen , lungs and kidneys) and gastrointestinal tissues revealed no detectable injuries and inflammatory cells infiltration. Taken together , these results suggest an excellent biocompatibility profile of CB ( 7) in mice , which provide important foundations for further investigations and even clinical applications of CB ( 7) in biomedical areas.
