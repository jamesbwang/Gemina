  Mentally demanding tasks feel effortful and are usually avoided. Furthermore , prolonged cognitive engagement leads to mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , consisting of subjective feeling of exhaustion<symptom> and decline in performance. Despite the intuitive characterization of fatigue<symptom> as an increase in subjective effort perception , the effect of fatigue<symptom> on effort cost has never been tested experimentally. To this end , sixty participants in 2 separate experiments underwent a forced-choice working memory task following either a fatigue-inducing ( i.e. cognitive task involving working memory , conflict and switch costs) or a control manipulation. We measured fatigue<symptom> in terms of subjective feeling and performance decrement and assessed effort in terms of subjective perception and task avoidance. Subjects exhibited only weak avoidance of the working memory task , with stronger influence of reward than task difficulty on their decisions. In addition , we found that task avoidance did not systematically change following the fatigue<symptom> manipulation but that variations in task avoidance correlated with fatigue-induced performance decline. The other measures of fatigue<symptom> and effort were unrelated to each other. Our findings suggest that subjective fatigue<symptom> may develop independently of task avoidance and suggest an `` anticipatory regulation '' model in which fatigue<symptom> urges subjects to stop in anticipation of possible , future adverse consequences.
