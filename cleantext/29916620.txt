  This paper addresses the moderating role of locomotion- a functional and fundamental dimension of self-regulation- in the relationship between job insecurity and subjective well-being. A group of 205 adult Italian workers took part in the research by filling out an anonymous questionnaire that included measures of job insecurity , locomotion , satisfaction with life , positive and negative affect. Results showed that job insecurity was positively related to negative affect and negatively related to life satisfaction and positive affect. Locomotion was positively related to life satisfaction and positive affect and acted as a moderator only in the case of the link between job insecurity and negative affect. This means that when perceived insecurity is high , negative affect is lower for respondents scoring high versus low on locomotion. Results and suggestions for future studies are presented and discussed.
