  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play critical roles in multiple cellular processes in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC); however , the involvement of lncRNAs in the transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFβ) signaling pathway , the critical tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and metastasis pathway , remains poorly understood. To address this issue , we compared the lncRNAs expression patterns of NSCLC cells treated with and without TGFβ1 treatment. We observed that one of the most prominent hits , TGFβ-induced lncRNA ( TBILA) , promoted NSCLC progression and was upregulated in tumor tissues. Upregulated TBILA promotes human germinal center-associated lymphoma ( HGAL) expression by binding to the Smad transcription factor complex , thereby enhancing RhoA activation. In addition , TBILA induces the S100A7-c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 ( JAB1) pathway by binding to nuclear S100A7 and enhances pro-survival pathways in NSCLC. These findings have provided us with a new perspective regarding the regulation of the TGFβ signaling pathway in NSCLC and suggest that the lncRNA TBILA can serve as a target for anticancer therapies.
