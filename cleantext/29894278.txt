  Migration of adult European eels ( Anguilla anguilla) from freshwater feeding grounds to oceanic spawning grounds is an energetically demanding process and is accompanied by dramatic physiological and behavioral changes. Humans have altered the aquatic environment ( e.g. , dams) and made an inherently challenging migration even more difficult; human activity is regarded as the primary driver of the collapse in eel populations. The neuroendocrine stress response is central in coping with these challenging conditions , yet little is known about how various biotic factors such as sex , parasites , and ontogeny influence ( singly and via interactions) the stress response of eels. In this study , mixed-effects and linear models were used to quantify the influence of sex , parasitism ( Anguillicola crassus) , life stage ( yellow and silver eels) , and silvering stage on the stress response of eels when exposed to a standardized handling stressor. The physiological<symptom> response<symptom> of eels to a standardized abiotic stressor ( netting confinement in air) was quantified through measurements of blood glucose and plasma cortisol.
