  Infective endocarditis<disease> is a rare disease that can lead to some diagnostic wandering because of its often nonspecific and polymorphic clinical manifestations. This latency is at the origin of severe cardiac and extra-cardiac complications , yet highly fatal. The clinician should always bear in mind the differential diagnosis of a patient with fever<disease> of undetermined origin , with risk factors for valve<disease> infection<disease> such as foreign material , and history recent invasive procedures ( including dental procedures) or recent hospitalization. The current medical tools make it possible to highlight the infection and its complications in a fast and complete manner , so as not to delay the patient 's management , particularly with the introduction of urgent empirical antibiotherapy.
