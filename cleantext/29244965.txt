  The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of epidermal growth factor ( EGF) and acidic fibroblast growth factor ( aFGF) on the healing of diabetic foot wounds<disease> A total of 199 patients with diabetic foot ulcers<disease> were recruited and randomly divided into four groups: A recombinant human EGF group ( n = 50) , an aFGF group ( n = 50) , a combined EGF and aFGF group ( n = 50) and a normal saline control group ( n = 49). Patients in all groups received a daily dressing change and growth factor reagents were applied topically when dressing. To observe the time required for each stage of wound<disease> healing , the epidermal healing rate and granulation tissue growth were recorded. Following 3-4 days of treatment , the wound<disease> healing stage was similar in all groups. Later stages ( following 4 days) of wound<disease> healing were achieved significantly faster in the combined group compared with the control group ( P < 0.05). The rate of wound<disease> healing in the EGF group was similar to that observed in the combination group. No significant difference was observed between the EGF and aFGF groups during the initial period of wound<disease> healing. However , in the later stage ( following 4 days) , the combined use of recombinant human EGF and aFGF had a marked positive effect on wound<disease> healing when compared with the control group. Growth factors have extensive biological activities with functions including promoting cell proliferation as well as rehabilitating and regenerating tissues , which serve important roles in wound<disease> healing.
