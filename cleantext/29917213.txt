  The first report concerning methotrexate ( MTX) in the treatment of Mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF) was published in 1964 by Wright. The mechanism of MTX action in the treatment of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL) has been not explained in detail yet ( the anti-inflammatory , immunomodulating , immunosuppressive , and cytostatic actions have been under discussion). This is a retrospective analysis of 79 MF patients in 4 dermatology clinical centers in Poland. Data are presented in terms of the duration , use of MTX , the effectiveness of treatment with MTX in terms of time required to achieve remission , the disease stage , route of administration , age at diagnosis and the dosage. Moreover , the occurrence of side effects depending on the route of administration and duration of therapy with MTX was analyzed. The analysis has revealed that 56 patients ( 70,9 %) had achieved remission on the MTX. The remission began in the 1st month of therapy in 20 % of patients , lasted 4 to 6 months in 50 % of cases. At least 12 months ' remission was confirmed in 25 % of patients ( 2-year-long only in 10 % and 3-year-long in 5 % of patients). The time to remission was related to the stage of disease at diagnosis as well as to minimal and maximal dose of MTX. The total therapeutic dose of MTX was found important for the course of the disease: higher total dose had prolonged the remission. Despite the common use of MTX in MF patients , relatively few clinical studies have been published. The response of MF subjects to MTX seems to depend on the stage and , more importantly , the dose of MTX treatment. Methotrexate appears to be an effective treatment at every stage of MF; however , it is not devoided of side effects such as infections and elevated level of aminotransferases , which are most common.
