  Given a set of t n-length DNA sequences , q satisfying 0 < q ≤ 1 , and l and d satisfying 0 ≤ d < l < n , the quorum planted motif search ( qPMS) finds l-length strings that occur in at least qt input sequences with up to d mismatches and is mainly used to locate transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences. Existing qPMS algorithms have been able to efficiently process small standard datasets ( e.g. , t = 20 and n = 600) , but they are too time consuming to process large DNA datasets , such as ChIP-seq datasets that contain thousands of sequences or more. We analyze the effects of t and q on the time performance of qPMS algorithms and find that a large t or a small q causes a longer computation time. Based on this information , we improve the time performance of existing qPMS algorithms by selecting a sample sequence set D' with a small t and a large q from the large input dataset D and then executing qPMS algorithms on D'. A sample sequence selection algorithm named SamSelect is proposed. The experimental results on both simulated and real data show ( 1) that SamSelect can select D' efficiently and ( 2) that the qPMS algorithms executed on D' can find implanted or real motifs in a significantly shorter time than when executed on D. We improve the ability of existing qPMS algorithms to process large DNA datasets from the perspective of selecting high-quality sample sequence sets so that the qPMS algorithms can find motifs in a short time in the selected sample sequence set D' , rather than take an unfeasibly long time to search the original sequence set D. Our motif discovery method is an approximate algorithm.
