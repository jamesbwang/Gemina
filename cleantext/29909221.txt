  Widespread microplastic pollution is raising growing concerns as to its detrimental effects upon living organisms. A realistic risk assessment must stand on representative data on the abundance , size distribution and chemical composition of microplastics. Raman microscopy is an indispensable tool for the analysis of very small microplastics ( < 20 Î¼m). Still , its use is far from widespread , in part due to drawbacks such as long measurement time and proneness to spectral distortion induced by fluorescence. This review discusses each drawback followed by a showcase of interesting and easily available solutions that contribute to faster and better identification of microplastics using Raman spectroscopy. Among discussed topics are: enhanced signal quality with better detectors and spectrum processing; automated particle selection for faster Raman mapping; comprehensive reference libraries for successful spectral matching. A last section introduces non-conventional Raman techniques ( non-linear Raman , hyperspectral imaging , standoff Raman) which permit more advanced applications such as real-time Raman detection and imaging of microplastics.
