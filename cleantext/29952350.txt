  Noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT) is increasingly recognized and utilized in the antenatal care field. In the current study , we aimed to evaluate the clinical application and compare test outcomes of two generations of currently used NIPT techniques for detecting fetal chromosome abnormalities in a high-risk prenatal population. A total of 7,252 pregnant women were included from twenty-one hospitals from January 2015 to September 2017. A maternal blood sample of each participant was collected for fetal DNA sequencing. Group I received a first generation NIPT sequencing technique to detect chromosome aneuploidies , and Group II received a second generation NIPT sequencing technique to detect subchromosome abnormalities. An abnormal NIPT result was reported in 0.90 % ( 44/4 ,868) of the women in Group I and 2.68 % ( 64/2 ,384) in Group II. In Group I , seventeen ( 17/37 , 45.95 %) women with suspected fetal aneuploidy received amniocentesis , which confirmed 100 % ( 10/10) of positive trisomy 21 samples , 100 % ( 1/1) of trisomy 18 , 100 % ( 1/1) of sex chromosome abnormality , 0 % ( 0/2) of trisomy 16 , 0 % ( 0/2) of trisomy 13 , and 0 % ( 0/1) of trisomy 20 and 13. In Group II , aneuploidy accounted for 46.88 % ( 30/64) of the abnormal results. Five underwent amniocentesis and three had an abnormal result , including two cases of trisomy 21 and one case of chromosome 5p deletion syndrome<disease>. Whereas one case of 46 , XN , del ( 16q11.2-q22.3) and another case of 46 , XN , dup ( Xp22 .31) were considered as normal. NIPT is a quick and reliable screening method for detecting fetal chromosome aneuploidies and subchromosome deletions/duplications. Challenges remain for the comprehensive clinical application of NIPT.
