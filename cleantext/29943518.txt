  This study examined the short-term effects of a brief crisis intervention on optimism of acutely suicidal soldiers. U.S. Soldiers ( N = 97) presenting for an emergency mental health appointment in a military emergency department or behavioural health clinic were randomly assigned to treatment as usual standard crisis response plan , or enhanced crisis response plan ( E-CRP). This study is used a subsample of the original clinical trial ( n = 64) for those who completed self-report measures of optimism ( Life Orientation Test-Revised) prior to receiving any intervention and a secondary self-report assessment one-month following the intervention. Results indicate that individuals with low baseline optimism who received the E-CRP had significant increases in optimism 1 month post-intervention. This provides evidence that discussing a patient 's reasons for living during a CRP increases optimism in those high-risk patients with the lowest baseline optimism.
