  The Social Anxiety<symptom> Questionnaire ( SAQ) was designed to assess five dimensions of social anxiety<symptom> as posited by the Clark and Wells ' ( 1995; Clark , 2001) cognitive model. The development of the SAQ involved generation of an item pool , followed by a verification of content validity and the theorized factor structure ( Study 1). The final version of the SAQ was then assessed for reliability , temporal stability ( test re-test reliability) , and construct , criterion-related , and contrasted-group validity ( Study 2 , 3 , and 4). Following a systematic process , the results provide support for the SAQ as reliable , and both theoretically and empirically valid measure. A five-factor structure of the SAQ verified and replicated through confirmatory factor analyses reflect five dimensions of social anxiety<symptom>: negative self-processing; self-focused attention and self-monitoring; safety behaviours; somatic and cognitive symptoms; and anticipatory and post-event rumination. Results suggest that the SAQ possesses good psychometric properties , while recognizing that additional validation is a required future research direction. It is important to replicate these findings in diverse populations , including a large clinical sample. The SAQ is a promising measure that supports social anxiety<symptom> as a multidimensional construct , and the foundational role of self-focused cognitive processes in generation and maintenance of social anxiety<symptom> symptoms. The findings make a significant contribution to the literature , moreover , the SAQ is a first instrument that offers to assess all , proposed by the Clark-Wells model , specific cognitive-affective , physiological , attitudinal , and attention processes related to social
