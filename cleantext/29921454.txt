  To assess risk factors for ophthalmic vascular events after intra-arterial chemotherapy ( IAC) for retinoblastoma. Retrospective cohort study. Patients who received unilateral IAC as primary treatment for retinoblastoma from January 1 , 2009 , to November 30 , 2017 , at a single center. Records were reviewed for patient demographics , tumor features , IAC parameters , and treatment-related vascular events in the early IAC era ( 2009-2011) compared with the recent era ( 2012-2017) using the t test and Fisher exact test. Change in event rates over time was assessed using Poisson regression analysis , with Spearman 's rho used to test correlation. Rate of IAC-induced ophthalmic vascular events. There were 243 chemotherapy infusions in 76 eyes of 76 patients , divided into early ( 22 eyes , 57 infusions) and recent ( 54 eyes , 186 infusions) eras. Intra-arterial chemotherapy consisted of melphalan ( 243 infusions) , topotecan ( 124 infusions) , and carboplatin ( 9 infusions). A comparison ( early vs. recent era) revealed fewer mean number of infusions ( 2.6 vs. 3.4 , P = 0.02) with similar mean patient age and presenting tumor features. Event rates decreased over time ( P < 0.01) , with fewer ophthalmic vascular events ( early era vs. recent era) in the recent era ( 59 % vs. 9 % per eye , 23 % vs. 3 % per infusion , P < 0.01) , including peripheral retinal nonperfusion ( 5 % vs. 2 % per eye , P = 0.50) , vitreous hemorrhage<symptom> ( 9 % vs. 2 % , P = 0.20) , subretinal hemorrhage<symptom> ( 0 % vs. 2 % , P = 0.99) , branch retinal vein occlusion ( 5 % vs. 0 % , P = 0.29) , choroidal ischemia ( 14 % vs. 4 % , P = 0.14) , and ophthalmic artery spasm/occlusion ( 27 % vs. 0 % , P < 0.01). Events did not correlate to patient age ( P = 0.75) , tumor diameter ( P = 0.32) , tumor thickness ( P = 0.59) , or cumulative dosage of melphalan ( P = 0.13) or topotecan ( P = 0.59). There were no IAC-induced vascular events in 72 infusions of 21 consecutively treated eyes in 2016 to 2017. Ophthalmic vascular events after IAC have decreased from the early era ( 2009-2011) through the current era ( 2012-2017) at this center. Experience performing this highly specialized procedure could be an important factor predicting IAC-related vascular events.
