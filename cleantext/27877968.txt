  The widespread application of hydrocarbon polymer materials has spurred an increasing interest in the study of their dissociation mechanism , which is related to key issues such as environmental protection. In this work , the last-step dissociation characteristics of carbon chain polymers were investigated. By using density functional theory , we considered all possible structures , including three typical normal linkage polymers and four typical abnormal linkage ones. In these structures , it can be found that the energy barrier required for the complete degradation of chain-end saturated and unsaturated polymers are in the range of 3.42 to 4.78 eV and 0.35 to 1.31 eV , respectively. It shows that the unsaturated polymer is easier to degrade. Interestingly , as for three linkages of the polymer , the calculated results further suggest that the energy barrier of head-to-head , head-to-tail , and tail-to-tail linkages of the polymer dissociating to produce the monomer increase , no matter if the chain-end is saturated or not. Therefore , we form a regular understanding of how to achieve the complete degradation of the polymer. In addition , analyses of the bond characteristics and electronic structures agree with the results of the energy barrier measurements. Meanwhile , the spin population analysis presents an obvious net spin transfer process in depolymerization reactions. We hope that the current results can provide a basic insight into polymer degradation.
