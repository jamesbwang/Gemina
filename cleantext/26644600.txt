  The roles of low-voltage-activated ( T-type) calcium channels in brain diseases have been studied extensively. Less is known regarding the involvement of T-type channels in cognition and behavior. Sensory integration ( SI) is a cognitive process whereby the brain uses unimodal or multimodal sensory features to create a comprehensive representation of the environment. The multisensory object oddity ( MSO) task assesses SI using combinations of sensory features of objects , either in the same or different sensory modalities. The regulation of SI involves the orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC) , an area which shows high levels of T-type calcium channel expression. We tested the effects of blocking T-type calcium channels on the MSO task with the selective T-type antagonist , Z944 ( 5 mg/kg; i.p. systemic; 100 or 500 µM OFC infusion) , in male Long Evans rats. With systemic treatment , Z944 impaired the visual and visual-olfactory versions of the task. Infusion of 100 and 500 µM Z944 produced deficits in the olfactory version of the task. In addition , only vehicle-infused , but not Z944-infused , rats showed significant performance above chance for all task variants. Thus , the present results suggest that T-type calcium channels in OFC are involved in SI of features in an oddity task. Given that unimodal SI was disrupted by OFC infusions of Z944 , the deficits in the multimodal task must be interpreted with caution. As SI is disrupted in psychiatric disorders , further investigations elucidating the brain regions implicated in SI regulation by T-type calcium channels may help inform therapeutic development for those suffering from SI impairments.
