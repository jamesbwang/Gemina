  Aversion to light is common among migraineurs undergoing acute attacks. Using psychophysical assessments in episodic migraine patients , we reported that white , blue , amber and red lights exacerbate migraine headache<symptom> in a significantly larger percentage of patients and to a greater extent compared to green light. This study aimed at determining whether these findings are phase-dependent- namely , manifested exclusively during migraine ( ictally) but not in its absence ( interictally) , or condition-dependent- i.e. , expressed uniquely in migraineurs but not in healthy controls. To determine whether the color-preference of migraine-type photophobia<symptom> is phase- or condition-dependent , we compared the effects of each color of light in each intensity between migraineurs during and in-between attacks and healthy controls. During the ictal and interictal phases , the proportion of migraineurs reporting changes in headache<symptom> severity when exposed to the different colors of light increased in accordance with elevated light intensities. During the ictal phase , white , blue , amber and red lights exacerbated headaches<symptom> in âˆ¼ 80 % of the patients; however , during the interictal phase light initiated headache<symptom> in only 16-19 %. Notably , green light exacerbated headaches<symptom> in 40 % and triggered headaches<symptom> in 3 % of the patients studied during the ictal and interictal phases , respectively. With one exception ( highest red light intensity) , no control subject reported headache<symptom> in response to the light stimuli. These findings suggest that color preference is unique to migraineurs- as it was not found in control subjects- and that it is independent of whether or not the patients are in their ictal or interictal phase.
