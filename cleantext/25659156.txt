  The DNA Damage Response ( DDR) is a complex signaling network that comes into play when cells experience genotoxic stress. Upon DNA damage , cellular signaling pathways are rewired to slow down cell cycle progression and allow recovery. However , when the damage is beyond repair , cells activate complex and still not fully understood mechanisms , leading to a complete proliferative arrest or cell death. Several conventional and novel anti-neoplastic treatments rely on causing DNA damage or on the inhibition of the DDR in cancer cells. However , the identification of molecular determinants directing cancer cells toward recovery or death upon DNA damage is still far from complete , and it is object of intense investigation.
