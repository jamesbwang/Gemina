  The objective was to assess the predictive performance of different intravascular contrast extravasation ( ICE) characteristics for need for pelvic transarterial embolization ( TAE) to determine the risk factors of false-positives. A retrospective study was performed in our trauma center between 2010 and 2015. All severe trauma patients with pelvic fracture were included. Pelvic ICE characteristics on computed tomography ( CT) scan were studied: arterial ( aSICE) , portal surface ( pSICE) , and extension ( exSICE) anatomic relationships. The overall predictive performance of ICE surfaces for pelvic TAE was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. The analysis focused on risk factors for false-positives. Among 311 severe trauma patients with pelvic ring fracture ( mean age , 42 ± 19 years , mean Injury Severity Score , 27 ± 19) , 94 ( 30 %) had at least one pelvic ICE on the initial CT scan. Patients requiring pelvic TAE had significantly larger aSICE and pSICE than others ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.035 , respectively). The overall ability of ICE surfaces to predict pelvic TAE was modest ( aSICE AUC , 0.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.64-0.90); P = 0.011) or non-significant ( pSICE and exSICE). The high-sensitivity threshold was defined as aSICE ≥ 20 mm. Using this threshold , 76 % of patients were false-positives. Risk factors for false-positives were: admission systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 90 mmHg ( 63 % versus 20 %; P = 0.03) and low transfusion needs ( 63 % versus 10 %; P = 0.009) , extravasation in contact with complex bone fracture ( 78 % versus 30 %; P = 0.008) or the absence of a direct relationship between extravasation and a large retroperitoneal hematoma ( 100 % versus 38 %; P < 0.001). A significant pelvic ICE during the arterial phase does not guarantee the need for pelvic TAE. Three-quarter of patients with aSICE ≥ 20 mm did not need pelvic TAE. Several complementary CT scan criteria will help to identify this risk of false-positives to determine adequate hemostatic pelvic procedures.This work is an original article , retrospective study Level II of evidence , Therapeutic/Critical Care management.
