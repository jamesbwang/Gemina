  HnRNPK is a multifunctional protein that participates in chromatin remodeling , transcription , RNA splicing , mRNA stability and translation. Here , we uncovered the function of hnRNPK in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. hnRNPK was mutated in the C2C12 myoblast cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A decreased proliferation rate was observed in hnRNPK-mutated cells , suggesting an impaired proliferation phenotype. Furthermore , increased G2/M phase , decreased S phase and increased sub-G1 phase cells were detected in the hnRNPK-mutated cell lines. The expression analysis of key cell cycle regulators indicated mRNA of Cyclin A2 was significantly increased in the mutant myoblasts compared to the control cells , while Cyclin B1 , Cdc25b and Cdc25c were decreased sharply. In addition to the myoblast proliferation defect , the mutant cells exhibited defect in myotube formation. The myotube formation marker , myosin heavy chain ( MHC) , was decreased sharply in hnRNPK-mutated cells compared to control myoblasts during differentiation. The deficiency in hnRNPK also resulted in the repression of Myog expression , a key myogenic regulator during differentiation. Together , our data demonstrate that hnRNPK is required for myoblast proliferation and differentiation and may be an essential regulator of myoblast function. ( BMB Reports 2018; 51 ( 7): 350-355).
