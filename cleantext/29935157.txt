  The role of spinal cord neurons in renal sympathoexcitation remains unclear in renovascular hypertension , represented by the 2-kidney , 1-clip ( 2K1C) model. Thus , we aimed to assess the influence of spinal glutamatergic and AT1 angiotensin II receptors on renal sympathetic nerve activity ( rSNA) in 2K1C Wistar rats. Hypertension was induced by clipping the renal artery with a silver clip. After six weeks , a catheter ( PE-10) was inserted into the subarachnoid space and advanced to the T10-11 vertebral level in urethane-anaesthetized rats. The effects of intrathecally ( i.t.) injected kynurenic acid ( KYN) or losartan ( Los) on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and rSNA were analysed over 2 consecutive hours. KYN induced a significantly larger drop in rSNA among 2K1C rats than among control ( CTL) rats ( CTL vs. 2K1C: -8 ± 3 vs. -52 ± 9 spikes/s after 120 '). Los also evoked a significantly larger drop in rSNA among 2K1C rats than among CTL rats starting at 80 ' after administration ( CTL vs. 2K1C- 80 min: -10 ± 2 vs. -32 ± 6 ∗; 100 min: -15 ± 4 vs. -37 ± 9 ∗; 120 min: -12 ± 5 vs. -37 ± 8 ∗ spikes/s). KYN decreased BP similarly in the CTL and 2K1C groups; however , Los significantly decreased BP in the 2K1C group only. We found upregulation of AT1 gene expression in the T11-12 spinal segments in the 2K1C group but no change in gene expression for AT2 or ionotropic glutamate ( NMDA , kainate and AMPA) receptors. Thus , our data show that spinal ionotropic glutamatergic and AT1 receptors contribute to increased rSNA in the 2K1C model , leading to the maintenance of hypertension; however , the participation of spinal AT1 receptors seems to be especially important in the establishment of sympathoexcitation in this model. The origins of those projections , i.e. , the brain areas involved in establishing the activity of spinal glutamatergic and angiotensinergic pathways , remain unclear.
