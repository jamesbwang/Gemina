  Non-invasive measurement of cardiac output ( CO) and cardiac index ( CI) may become an important modality of moni- toring in pediatrics. Among the several methods proposed , impedance cardiography ( ICG) has gained attention among the scientists. There are 2 basic technologies of ICG: thoracic body bioimpedance ( TEB) and whole body electrical bioimpedance ( WBEB). The present study is aimed to test in infants and children the effectiveness of the Non-Invasive Cardiac System ( NICaS ®) , a new ICG device working with a wrist-to-ankle configuration vs Car- dioQ ® transesophageal doppler , a minimally invasive cardiac output monitor. Whole-body bioimpedance measurements were obtained before and during the surgery with NICaS ® and simultaneously with CardioQ ® , demographic data were sampled , basement life monitoring were performed. Total of 42 patients aged from new born to 16 years old , were included in this study to evaluate heart rate ( HR) , stroke volume ( SV) , cardiac output ( CO) , cardiac index ( CI) , total peripheral resi- stance index ( TPRI) , total body water ( TBW) and cardiac power index ( CPI). 81 measurements were taken simultaneously by both devices from forty-two patients , with CardioQ ® serving as the gold-standard for this evaluation and with NICaS ®. The average values of CI in the study subjects for CardioQ ® cardiac index ( Q-CI) and NICaS ® cardiac index ( NI-CI) were 2.9 ± 0.9 L/min/m ² and 2.8 ± 1.0 L/min/m2 respecti- vely ( P < 0.01). Overall , 2-tailed Pearson 's correlation between NI-CI and Q-CI was r = 0.85. The Bland-Altman 1.96-standard deviation limit of agreement was -0.77 L/min and 0.87 L/min/m ² with a small bias of 0.05 L/min/m ². Good correlation was observed in pediatric patients for CI measured with NICaS ® in comparison with CardioQ ® device. Continuous non-invasive monitoring of NI-CI can be particularly in- teresting for the pediatric population.
