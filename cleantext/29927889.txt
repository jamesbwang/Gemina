Accentuated eccentric loading and cluster set configurations in the back squat: a kinetic and kinematic analysis. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study examined the kinetic and kinematic differences between accentuated eccentric loading ( AEL) and cluster sets in trained male subjects ( age = 26.1 ± 4.1 years , height = 183.5 ± 4.3 cm , body mass = 92.5 ± 10.5 kg , and back squat to body mass ratio = 1.8 ± 0.3). Four load condition sessions consisted of traditionally loaded ( TL) `` straight sets , '' TL cluster ( TLC) sets , AEL cluster ( AEC) sets , and AEL `` straight sets '' where only the first repetition had eccentric overload ( AEL1). An interrepetition rest interval of 30 seconds was prescribed for both TLC and AEC. Concentric intensity for all load conditions was 80 % 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM). Accentuated eccentric loading was applied to repetitions using weight releasers with total eccentric load equivalent to 105 % of concentric 1RM. Traditionally loaded cluster had statistically greater concentric outputs than TL. Furthermore , statistically greater eccentric and concentric outputs were observed during AEC compared with TL with the exception of peak power. Statistically greater concentric characteristics were observed in TLC compared with AEL1 , but statistically greater eccentric outputs were observed in AEL1. In the 2 cluster set conditions , statistically greater concentric rate of force development ( RFDCON) ( d = 0.470 , p < 0.001) and average velocity ( vavg) ( d = 0.560 , p < 0.001) in TLC compared with AEC were observed. However , statistically greater eccentric work ( WECC) ( d = 2.096 , p < 0.001) and eccentric RFD ( RFDECC) ( d = 0.424 , p < 0.001) were observed in AEC compared with TLC. Overall , eccentric overload demonstrated efficacy as a means of increasing eccentric work and RFD , but not as a means of potentiating concentric output. Finally , interrepetition rest seems to have the largest influence on concentric power output and RFD.
