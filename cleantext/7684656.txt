  We aimed to explore the mechanism of pramipexole ( PPX) actions in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Genes related to PD and PPX were screened through bioinformatics retrieval. The PD model was constructed by applying 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( MMP +). The RNA expression levels of circSNCA ,
