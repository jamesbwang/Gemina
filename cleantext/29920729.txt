  To assess the clinical outcome of a strategy of conservative monitoring of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas ( NFPA) after pituitary surgery and in patients without surgery. Retrospective study of outcomes , using a clinical information system. An unselected , clinical series of patients seen in a single centre between 1989 and 2015. Review of clinical information system data to obtain details and dates of surgery , radiotherapy , pituitary imaging and outcomes. We identified 190 cases of NFPA. Trans-sphenoidal surgery ( TSS) had been performed as primary therapy in 132 cases ( all macro-adenomas). At a mean 7.6-years follow-up after TSS without immediate pituitary radiotherapy , recurrence occurred in 10.7 % of cases with no visible postoperative residual adenoma , 38.8 % with intrasellar and 66.7 % with extrasellar residuum. Recurrence was defined as growth of residual tumour requiring intervention. On survival analysis , at 10 years , recurrence-free survival was 75 % in patients with no residual tumour and 40 % with intrasellar residuum. Recurrence occurred in 12.5 % of 24 patients who had received postop radiotherapy. Patients were monitored conservatively without initial surgery in 65 patients. After a mean of 5-year monitoring , only 20 % required intervention during follow-up ( 18.5 % TSS) and 30.8 % died of nonpituitary causes during follow-up. This study suggests that a conservative approach may be safe and appropriate in patients with NFPA if followed up with appropriate imaging surveillance , whether postoperative or without primary surgery.
