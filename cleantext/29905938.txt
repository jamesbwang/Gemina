  Prompted by a recent report on declining incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( SUDEP) following implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator ( VNS) , we analyzed SUDEP risk over 6 years in a population-based cohort of 60 952 epilepsy patients in Sweden. All deaths from July 1 , 2006 through December 31 , 2011 , were identified. Those with epilepsy mentioned on the death certificate were adjudicated for SUDEP using medical records and autopsy reports. In all , 292 SUDEP cases were identified. Comparing the first years ( 2006-2007) with the subsequent 4 years ( 2008-2011) , the crude and standardized ( to the US 2000 population) incidence of SUDEP ( whether or not possible SUDEP was included) was significantly lower during the second time period; Incidence rate ratios based on standardized rates was estimated at 0.76 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.60-0.97 , P = .027) for SUDEP. The incidence of SUDEP decreased by 7 % per year during the 6-year follow-up. Our data thus suggest that , for unknown reasons , incidence of SUDEP decreases with duration of follow-up. This has implications for patient counseling as well as for the design of studies attempting to assess the effectiveness of an intervention against SUDEP , which clearly needs to include a control group.
