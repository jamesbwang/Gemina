  Hypertrophic , keloidal and contracted scars can be cosmetically and functionally debilitating , and by patients this is often perceived as traumatising. Psychological and social impairments are common in these types of scars. Currently , autologous lipofilling , with or without enrichment with stem cells , is performed to improve scar quality. In this review , we evaluate the evidence on lipofilling as a treatment of scars. The literature mainly consists of studies of low-level evidence , i.e. they lack controls and randomisation. Nevertheless , all studies indicate , that lipofilling may improve the quality of scars.
