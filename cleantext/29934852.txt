  DNA methylation catalyzed by DNA methyl transferase ( MTase) is a significant epigenetic process for modulating gene expression. Abnormal levels of DNA MTase enzyme have been regarded as a cancer biomarker or a sign of bacterial<disease> diseases<disease>. We developed a novel colorimetric method to assay M.SssI MTase activity employing peroxidase-like activity of DNA template Ag/Pt NCs without using restriction enzymes. Based on inhibiting the peroxidase reaction that occurred in the TMB-H
