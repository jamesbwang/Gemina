  The Constitution of South Africa stipulates that all children have the right to basic nutrition; however , a great number of South African children are underweight for age. It is important to address malnutrition as it is associated with more than 50 % of all child deathsin developing countries and also increases the risk for infective diseases. To determine the prevalence of underweight in children aged 5 years and younger attending primary health care clinics in the Mangaung area , Free State , and determine the possible underlying causes thereof. Six preselected primary health care clinics in the Mangaung area. This was a cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical information and anthropometric measurements were collected from the children 's Road-to-Health clinic cards , obtained from the children 's caregivers. In total , 240 children were included , of which 51.7 % were girls. The median age was 7.5 months. The weight-for-age graph revealed that 7.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 4.8 %; 11.9 %) of children were underweight or severely underweight for age. Length-for-age and weight-for-height graphs were mostly incomplete. Underweight children differed from normal weight children regarding birth weight ( low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight 70.6 % vs. 12.4 %) and history of malnutrition ( 60.0 % vs. 7.1 %). The prevalence of underweight in children aged 0-5 years attending primary health care clinics in Mangaung is 7.7 % based on information available from Road-to-Healthcards. This figure could be higher if these cards were filled in more accurately. A low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight and history of malnutrition are associated with underweight.
