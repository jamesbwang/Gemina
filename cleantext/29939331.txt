  Pain pressure<symptom> thresholds ( PPT) are used to study peripheral and central pain processing. In the tendon , pathological changes may exist without pain. This pilot study aimed to compare PPT between individuals with normal tendons and asymptomatic tendon pathology , and between individuals with and without a history of tendon<symptom> pain<symptom>. The patellar , Achilles , and supraspinatus tendons of 128 asymptomatic participants were examined with ultrasound. Global PPT average was determined using a digital algometer at the patellar tendon , quadriceps muscle , L3 spinous process , and deltoid<symptom> muscle insertion. Participants were separated into three groups: ( 1) healthy control group ( no pathology , no history of pain) , ( 2) tendon pathology at any site without a history of pain , ( 3) history of tendon<symptom> pain<symptom> anywhere. There were 92 controls , seven with asymptomatic pathology and 29 with a history of tendon<symptom> pain<symptom>. Asymptomatic tendon pathology at any site ( without a history of pain) was associated with globally increased PPTs compared with controls ( P < 0.001 , pathology N = 7 , N = 92 controls). Matched pair analysis remained significant ( P < 0.004). A history of tendon<symptom> pain<symptom> was associated with globally increased PPTs compared with the control group ( P = 0.026). Matched pair analysis was not significant ( P = 0.122). Asymptomatic tendon pathology is associated with higher PPTs. These findings point toward central nervous system adaptations but in a novel way-central desensitization. This challenges the validity of conclusions drawn from PPT studies that do not verify normal structure in the control group; artificial inflation of control group data may incorrectly indicate decreased PPTs in the comparison group.
