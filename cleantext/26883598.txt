  Screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms , due to their scales of economy and high reproducibility , can provide a useful approach to translate laboratory-based electrochemistry into the field. An important factor when utilising screen-printed electrodes ( SPEs) is the determination of their real electrochemical surface area , which allows for the benchmarking of these SPEs and is an important parameter in quality control. In this paper , we consider the use of cyclic voltammetry and chronocoulometry to allow for the determination of the real electrochemical area of screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms , highlighting to experimentalists the various parameters that need to be diligently considered and controlled in order to obtain useful measurements of the real electroactive area.
