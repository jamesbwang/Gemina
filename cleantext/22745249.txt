  The CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/ Cas9 adaptive immunity system has been harnessed for genome editing applications across eukaryotic species , but major drawbacks , such as the inefficiency of precise base editing and off-target activities , remain. A catalytically inactive Cas9 variant ( dead Cas9 , dCas9) has been fused to diverse functional domains for targeting genetic and epigenetic modifications , including base editing , to specific DNA sequences. As base editing does not require the generation of double-strand breaks , dCas9 and Cas9 nickase have been used to target deaminase domains to edit specific loci. Adenine and cytidine deaminases convert their respective nucleotides into other DNA bases , thereby offering many possibilities for DNA editing. Such base-editing enzymes hold great promise for applications in basic biology , trait development in crops , and treatment of genetic diseases. Here , we discuss recent advances in precise gene editing using different platforms as well as their potential applications in basic biology and biotechnology.
