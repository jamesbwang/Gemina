  Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( mAchRs) , which are expressed in various embryonic cells , may regulate neuronal differentiation. In the present study , we examined the effects of mAchR stimulation on the differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem ( iPS) cells into neural progenitor cells ( NPCs). Mouse iPS cells were cultured on ultra-low attachment dishes to induce embryoid body ( EB) formation. All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA , 3 μmol/L) and/or pilocarpine ( 10 or 100 μmol/L) , a mAchR agonist , were added to EB cultures for 4 days , following which the EBs were cultured on gelatin-coated plates for 7 days. Subtype-specific antibody staining revealed that mouse iPS cells predominantly express m
