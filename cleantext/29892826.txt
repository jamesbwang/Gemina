  Thyroid hormone is a principal regulator of essential processes in vertebrate physiology and homeostasis. Synthetic derivatives of thyroid hormone , known as thyromimetics , display desirable therapeutic properties. Thoroughly understanding how thyromimetics distribute throughout the body is crucial for their development and this requires appropriate bioanalytical techniques to quantify drug levels in different tissues. Here , we describe a detailed protocol for the quantification of the thyromimetic sobetirome using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS).
