  Sarcopenia and obesity both negatively impact health including cognitive function. Their coexistence , however , can pose an even higher threat likely surpassing their individual effects. We assessed the relationship of sarcopenic obesity with performance on global- and subdomain-specific tests of cognition. The study was a cross-sectional analysis of data from a series of community-based aging and memory studies. The sample consisted of a total of 353 participants with an average age of 69 years with a clinic visit and valid cognitive ( eg , Montreal Cognitive Assessment , animal naming) , functional ( eg , grip strength , chair stands) , and body composition ( eg , muscle mass , body mass index , percent body fat) measurements. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with the lowest performance on global cognition ( Est.. Sarcopenia alone and in combination with sarcopenic obesity can be used in clinical practice as indicators of probable cognitive impairment. At-risk older adults may benefit from programs addressing loss of cognitive function by maintaining/improving strength and preventing obesity.
