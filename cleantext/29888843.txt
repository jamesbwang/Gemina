  The highly enantioselective enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase A was combined with an oxaziridine-type oxidant in a biphasic setup for the deracemization of chiral sulfoxides. Remarkably , high ee values were observed with a wide range of substrates , thus providing a practical route for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure sulfoxides.
