  Bacteria produce a variety of surface-exposed polysaccharides important for cell integrity , biofilm formation , and evasion of the host immune response. Synthesis of these polymers often involves the assembly of monomer oligosaccharide units on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. For many polymers , including cell wall peptidoglycan , the lipid-linked precursors must be transported across the membrane by flippases to facilitate polymerization at the membrane surface. Flippase activity for this class of polysaccharides is most often attributed to MOP ( Multidrug/Oligosaccharidyl-lipid/Polysaccharide) family proteins. Little is known about how this ubiquitous class of transporters identifies and translocates its cognate precursor over the many different types of lipid-linked oligosaccharides produced by a given bacterial cell. To investigate the specificity determinants of MOP proteins , we selected for variants of the WzxC flippase involved in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> capsule ( colanic acid) synthesis that can substitute for the essential MurJ MOP-family protein and promote transport of cell wall peptidoglycan precursors. Variants with substitutions predicted to destabilize the inward-open conformation of WzxC lost substrate specificity and supported both capsule and peptidoglycan synthesis. Our results thus suggest that specific substrate recognition by a MOP transporter normally destabilizes the inward-open state , promoting transition to the outward-open conformation and concomitant substrate translocation. Furthermore , the ability of WzxC variants to suppress MurJ inactivation provides strong support for the designation of MurJ as the flippase for peptidoglycan precursors , the identity of which has been controversial.
