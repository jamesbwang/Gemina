  Immunosuppressive therapy is considered as one of the factors inducing to the onset of osteoporosis after organ transplantation. Chronic immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation is required for organ transplant patients , and it is important to prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures to maintain the quality of life in patients. In this study , we examined the effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on bone metabolism in rats. Five-week-old male Wistar rats were treated orally with 15 mg/kg cyclosporine or 1.5 mg/kg tacrolimus daily for 4 weeks. Each of cyclosporine and tacrolimus significantly reduced the bone strength of the femoral mid-diaphysis and bone mineral density of the tibia and femur. Bone histomorphometry showed that the administration of both drugs resulted in a decrease in bone volume , number and thickness of trabeculae , and an increase in trabecular separation. Bone formation parameters such as osteoid volume , osteoblast surface , mineralizing surface , mineral apposition rate , and bone formation rate significantly increased in the cyclosporine-treated group. Bone resorption parameters such as eroded surface , osteoclast surface , and osteoclast number significantly increased in both the cyclosporine- and the tacrolimus- treated groups. These results showed that cyclosporine increases both bone formation and bone resorption , leading to a high-turnover bone loss , and that tacrolimus increases bone resorption without affecting bone formation , leading to bone loss.
