  The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic role of MRI and EEG in posterior cortex epilepsies ( PCES) and to characterize their clinical features. We retrospectively studied 54 consecutive patients ( 18 females , 36 males) from April 2011 to November 2015 , who had undergone PCES surgery. Electro-clinical , pathological and surgical data were evaluated. Of the patients , 18 ( 33.3 %) patients underwent a cortical resection ( corticectomy) , 10 ( 18.5 %) lobectomy , 6 ( 11.1 %) multilobar resection , 20 ( 30.1 %) disconnection. The postoperative follow-up duration was â‰¥ 1 year in all patients ( 12-44 months , mean = 25). Thirty-two patients ( 59.3 %) became seizure<symptom> free ( ILAE 1) and 40 ( 74.1 %) had a good ( ILAE 1 , 2 , 3) outcome. The most common pathological finding was focal cortical dysplasia ( in 34 patients). Univariate analysis showed that regional scalp interictal epilepsy discharges ( IEDs) ( P = 0.031) , Regional EEG onset ( P = 0.027) , a MRI lesion<symptom> ( P = 0.001) and the number of seizures<symptom> that were recorded by the epilepsy monitor unit ( P = 0.016) were significantly associated with freedom from seizures<symptom>. Multivariate analysis confirmed that MRI positive was statistically significant ( HR = 4.284 , CI = 1.198-15.315). Surgical treatment is effective for PCES , and MRI and EEG analyses are important in presurgical evaluation of PCES.
