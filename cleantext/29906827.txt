  A theoretical analysis of active motion on curved surfaces is presented in terms of a generalization of the telegrapher equation. Such a generalized equation is explicitly derived as the polar approximation of the hierarchy of equations obtained from the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation of active particles diffusing on curved surfaces. The general solution to the generalized telegrapher equation is given for a pulse with vanishing current as initial data. Expressions for the probability density and the mean squared geodesic displacement are given in the limit of weak curvature. As an explicit example of the formulated theory , the case of active motion on the sphere is presented , where oscillations observed in the mean squared geodesic displacement are explained.
