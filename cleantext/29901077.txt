  Apelin‑13 , a neuropeptide that acts as a ligand for a putative receptor related to the angiotensin II type receptor , elicits neuroprotective effects in numerous neurological conditions , such as Huntington 's disease and cerebral ischemia. Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases , is caused by damage to neurons in the brain; however , the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study explored the effects of apelin‑13 on SH‑SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with 1‑methyl‑4‑phenylpyridine ( MPP +). Cell growth , cell viability , and apoptosis were measured by real‑time cell analysis , the Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay , and flow cytometry , respectively. In addition , the expression levels of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase ( ERK) 1/2 , p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase ( MAPK) , glucose‑regulated protein 78 ( GRP78) , C/EBP homologous protein ( CHOP) , and cleaved caspase‑12 were assessed by western blotting. MPP + treatment decreased the viability of SH‑SY5Y cells and increased their apoptosis; however , these changes were attenuated by pretreatment with apelin‑13. Treatment with MPP + for 24 h significantly increased the expression levels of phospho‑ERK1/ 2 , phospho‑p38 , GRP78 , CHOP , and cleaved caspase‑12 in SH‑SY5Y cells. Pretreatment with apelin‑13 significantly attenuated the upregulation of GRP78 , CHOP and cleaved caspase‑12 in MPP + treated SH‑SY5Y cells , and significantly enhanced the expression levels of phospho‑ERK1/ 2. Taken together , the present results support a model in which apelin‑13 inhibits MPP + induced apoptosis of SH‑SY5Y cells by decreasing the expression of GRP78 , CHOP , and cleaved caspase‑12 , and by increasing the expression of phospho‑ERK1/ 2. The present findings suggest that apelin‑13 may be useful for the treatment of PD.
