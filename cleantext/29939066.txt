  Eyewitnesses to crimes sometimes report inaccurate fine-grain details but fail to report accessible and potentially accurate coarse-grain details. We asked college students and community members ( aged 17 to 62 years) who viewed a video of a simulated crime to answer interviewers ' questions at coarse- and fine-grained levels of detail and measured the quantity and accuracy of their responses. Three experiments ( overall N = 219) also ( a) provided comparative data for participants who were interviewed using the open-ended Self-Administered Interview ( Gabbert , Hope , & Fisher , 2009) or one of two `` report everything '' open-ended procedures , ( b) tested the efficacy of the procedure using both written and verbal interviews , and ( c) examined the generality of the findings across different encoding stimuli which required variations in the types of cued recall questions asked. Coarse-grain reporting seldom occurred under the free recall interview conditions. Witnesses provided abundant coarse-grain details when required to respond to probes about specific details ( i.e. , cued recall forced report conditions)- without obvious cost to overall accuracy relative to accuracy of similar detail reported under free recall conditions-regardless of whether they responded on a written questionnaire or in a face-to-face individual interview. These experiments suggest that a procedure that requires cued recall forced reporting of coarse-grain detail may offer potential in certain investigative situations as an adjunct to the widely recommended open-ended forensic interviewing techniques.
