  Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid ( VPA) improve survival in lethal models of hemorrhagic shock<symptom> and polytrauma. Although VPA is known to modulate transcription , its ability to reduce mortality within minutes of administration suggests involvement of a rapid , posttranslational mechanism. We hypothesized that VPA treatment would cause proteomic changes within minutes of treatment including quantitative and/or posttranslational differences in structural and/or effector proteins. We used a porcine model of traumatic brain injury ( computer-controlled cortical impact , 12 mm depth) and hemorrhagic shock<symptom> ( 40 % hemorrhage<symptom>). Animals were kept in shock<symptom> for 2 h and randomized to two groups ( n = 3): normal saline ( volume = 3:1 hemorrhage<symptom> volume) or normal saline + VPA ( 150 mg/kg , single dose). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at baseline , postshock , and postresuscitation. Intracellular protein profiles were assessed using 1 dimensional gel electrophoresis , liquid chromatography , mass spectrometry , and analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Animals treated with VPA demonstrated significant proteomic changes. Quantitative differences were found in over 200 proteins including effector , regulatory , and structural proteins in critical cell signaling pathways. Posttranslational modification analysis demonstrated differential VPA-induced acetylation of lysine residues in histone and nonhistone proteins. Pathway analysis correlated these changes with significant increases in numerous prosurvival and cytoskeletal intracellular pathways , including Rho GTPase signaling ( P = 1.66E-11) , integrin signaling ( P = 4.19E-21) , and a decrease in Rho guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor signaling ( P = 4.83E-12). In a porcine model of severe injuries , a single dose of VPA is associated with protective changes in the proteome that are measurable within minutes of treatment.
