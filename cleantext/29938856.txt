  Due to continuous rise in antibiotic resistance , there is a need for alternative treatment options to reduce the levels of oral pathogens for the maintenance of oral as well as overall health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial potential of tinctures of Spilanthes oleracea and propolis , Nigella seed oil , and an ethanolic extract of black garlic on microorganisms involved in oral diseases. Both the minimum inhibitory concentration assay and the minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration assay were used in this study. Inhibition effects against total human salivary bacteria were also determined. Our results show that all of the preparations tested had potent antimicrobial activities. When measured 10 min after exposure , even low concentrations of the propolis tincture were found to have killed more than 99 % of salivary bacteria , whereas Spilanthes tincture and black garlic extract killed more than 90 % and Nigella seed oil more than 60 % of the pathogens. This suggests that all preparations are promising candidates for the use in oral health care products and that all have the potential to control biofilm associated infections.
