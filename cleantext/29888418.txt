  Sun sensitivity , a confounder between sun exposure and sun protection , is often overlooked. We examined how sun exposure and sun protection behaviors among indoor workers varied by sun sensitivity. Sun exposure and sun protection diaries over a 45-day period from Midwestern United States indoor workers were examined. We categorized sun sensitivity ( fair and non-fair complexion) using tanning inability and sunburn tendency. Total exposure ( sunrise to sunset) and peak exposure ( 10 am and 4 pm) lasting at least 60 minutes were examined. Percentages of time using sun protection were reported. We determined associations between fair complexion , mean sun exposure , and mean sun protection times with logistic regression. Fair individuals spent less time in the sun than non-fair individuals , but a greater proportion of time using sun protection behaviors , including sunscreen with SPF 30 + ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.36; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) = 0.98 , 1.87)) , or wearing long-sleeved shirts ( OR = 2.89; 95 % CI = 1.24 , 6.73). Fair individuals spent less time in the sun and practiced more sun protective behaviors than non-fair individuals. This complex association between sun sensitivity , sun protection and sun exposure has not consistently been addressed in studies of skin cancer.
