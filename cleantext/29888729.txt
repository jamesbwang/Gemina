 : Preoperative anxiety<symptom> is a critical issue in children , and associated with postoperative behavioral changes.: The purpose of the current study is to evaluate how audiovisual and auditory presentations about the perioperative period impact preoperative anxiety<symptom> and postoperative behavioral disturbances of children undergoing elective ambulatory surgery.: A total of 99 patients between the ages of 5-12 , scheduled to undergo outpatient surgery , participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups; audiovisual group ( Group V , n = 33) , auditory group ( Group A , n = 33) , and control group ( Group C , n = 33). During the evaluation , the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale ( M-YPAS) and the posthospitalization behavioral questionnaire ( PHBQ) were used.: There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. M-YPAS scores were significantly lower in Group V than in Groups C and A ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 , respectively). PHBQ scores in Group C were statistically higher than in Groups A and V , but , no statistical difference was found between Groups A and V. Compared to auditory presentations , audiovisual presentations , in terms of being memorable and interesting , may be more effective in reducing children 's anxiety<symptom>. In addition , we can suggest that both methods can be equally effective for postoperative behavioral changes.
