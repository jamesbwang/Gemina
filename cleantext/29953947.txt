  Online educational materials are largely disseminated through videos , and yet there is little understanding of how these videos engage students and fuel academic success. We hypothesized that components of the electroencephalogram ( EEG) , previously shown to reflect video engagement , would be predictive of academic performance in the context of educational videos. Two groups of subjects watched educational videos in either an intentional learning paradigm , in which they were aware of an upcoming test , or in an incidental learning paradigm , in which they were unaware that they would be tested. `` Neural engagement '' was quantified by the inter-subject correlation ( ISC) of the EEG that was evoked by the videos. In both groups , students with higher neural engagement retained more information. Neural engagement also discriminated between attentive and inattentive video viewing. These results suggest that this EEG metric is a marker of the stimulus-related attentional mechanisms necessary to retain information. In the future , EEG may be used as a tool to design and assess online educational content.
