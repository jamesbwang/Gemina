  Mitochondria are well known for their important roles in oxidative phosphorylation , amino acid metabolism , fatty acid oxidation and ion homeostasis. Although the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on tumorigenesis in various cancer cells have been reported , the correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in lung cancer development and metastasis has not been well elucidated. In the present study , the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on EMT and migration in lung cancer cells were investigated using inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration<symptom> , oligomycin A and antimycin A. Oligomycin A and antimycin A induced distinct mesenchymal‑like morphological features in H23 , H1793 and A549 lung cancer cells. In addition , they decreased the expression levels of the epithelial marker protein E‑cadherin , but increased the expression levels of the mesenchymal marker proteins Vimentin , Snail and Slug. The results of immunofluorescence staining indicated that oligomycin A and antimycin A downregulated cortical E‑cadherin expression and upregulated the expression of Vimentin. In addition , oligomycin A and antimycin A increased the migration and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells , and promoted the expression levels of phosphorylated ( p) protein kinase B ( AKT) and p‑AMP‑activated protein kinase ( AMPK). Notably , the production of reactive oxygen species by oligomycin A and antimycin A did not affect the expression of EMT protein markers. Conversely , treatment with the AKT inhibitor wortmannin and the AMPK inhibitor Compound C upregulated E‑cadherin and downregulated Vimentin expression. These results suggested that oligomycin A and antimycin A may induce migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by inducing EMT via the upregulation of p‑AKT and p‑AMPK expression.
