  In 2017 , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved two medications for sickle cell anemia<symptom> ( SCA): hydroxyurea for children ( ≥ 2 years of age) and L-glutamine for children and adults ( ≥ 5 years). The approval of hydroxyurea for children was long overdue , having been authorized by the FDA for adults in 1998 and by the European Medicines Agency for adults and children in 2007 , but the approval of L-glutamine was a surprise to many in the field. There are few published studies of L-glutamine as a treatment for SCA , so all can be reviewed in this brief manuscript. Accordingly , there are many unanswered questions about L-glutamine and its role in current therapy for SCA.
