  The demand to discover new materials is scientifically as well as industrially a continuously present topic , covering all different fields of application. The recent scientific work on thin film materials has shown , that especially for nitride-based protective coatings , computationally-driven understanding and modelling serves as a reliable trend-giver and can be used for target-oriented experiments. In this study , semi-automated density functional theory ( DFT) calculations were used , to sweep across transition metal diborides in order to characterize their structure , phase stability and mechanical properties. We show that early transition metal diborides ( TiB
