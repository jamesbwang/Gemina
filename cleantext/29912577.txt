  We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoid ( GC) exposure in female rats would lead to glucose dysregulation and elevated cardiac inflammatory biomarkers , which are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4)- and glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK-3)- dependent. Female Wistar rats received vehicle ( control; n = 6) or GC ( dexamethasone; n = 6; 0.2 mg/kg; p.o.) for six days. Insulin resistance was determined by HOMA-IR. DPP-4 activity was determined by fluorescence method , whereas vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1) , uric acid , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) and nitric oxide ( NO) from plasma and cardiac homogenate were estimated as cardiac pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Results showed that GC exposure resulted in glucose dysregulation and increased plasma and cardiac pro-inflammatory markers which are associated with elevated DPP-4 activity but reduced GSK-3. The present results demonstrate that GC exposure would cause glucose dysregulation , increased DPP-4 activity and cardiac inflammation<symptom> that is independent of GSK-3.
