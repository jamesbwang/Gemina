  The first catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted cyclohexadiene carbaldehydes through an inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction is described. A variety of arylacetaldehydes and α,β,γ,δ-unsaturated aldehydes are tested under the mild reaction conditions catalyzed by l-proline to obtain the trans diastereomeric products with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The scope of this methodology is further extended to the asymmetric synthesis 3,4-disubstituted cyclohexane carbaldehydes and their derivatives. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by the gram-scale synthesis. This methodology is successfully applied for the formal total synthesis of cyclobakuchiol A , an antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agent , and cyclobakuchiol C.
