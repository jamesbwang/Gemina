  Seroma formation is a common complication after lipoabdominoplasty. Conventionally , drains have been placed to prevent seroma; however , there are problems with drains , namely , pain , compromised mobilisation , breakage , tissue irritation and infection. Strategies to prevent seroma , such as the use of glue or quilting sutures have all been attempted with variable and unpredictable benefit. The author extrapolated the experience with own liposuction protocols to lipoabdominoplasty and began doing away with drains from the year 2006 onwards unless absolutely indicated. Incidence of complications is evaluated here. This retrospective study is the report of our experience with 204 lipoabdominoplasties performed since 2006 upto December 2016. Consecutive abdominoplasty patients were evaluated for seroma formation , wound<disease> dehiscence till suture removal. Nuances of operative details that helped avoid drains were contemplated. Only one patient who had drainless abdominoplasty had seroma formation and wound<disease> dehiscence. We found that ( a) ` toilet liposuction ' , ( a term the author would like to introduce) ( b) multilayer wound<disease> closure without tension , ( c) avoidance of gliding surfaces d) continuous use of pressure garment for 4 days post-operative and ( e) reducing the amount of infiltration are the key factors in avoidance of collections and thus seroma formation. If such a technique is diligently followed , desired results are obtained; yet there is no need to insert drains in most patients. Reducing the need of drains permits early ambulation and better patient comfort without seroma and other complications.
