  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most common malignant gastrointestinal cancers. Metastasis is a major leading of death in patients with CRC and many patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis. However , the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here , we showed that JMJD1C was overexpressed in colon cancer tissues compared to normal samples and was positively associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. Silencing JMJD1C strongly inhibits CRC migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Further , we found that knockdown of JMJD1C decreased the protein and mRNA levels of ATF2 , mechanistically , and JMJD1C regulated the expression of ATF2 by modulating the H3K9me2 but not H3K9me1 activity. In addition , we further performed some `` rescues experiments ''. We found that overexpression of ATF2 could reverse the abrogated migration and invasion ability by knockdown of JMJD1C in CRC. Our results demonstrated that an increase of JMJD1C was observed in colon cancer and knockdown of JMJD1C regulated CRC metastasis by inactivation of the ATF2 pathway. This novel JMJD1C/ATF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.
