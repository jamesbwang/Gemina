  Teriparatide is clinically used for the treatment of osteoporosis; however , nausea<symptom> is often observed in patients. Its insufficient control affects the ability to continue teriparatide therapy. Rikkunshi-To ( RKT) , a traditional Japanese herbal medicine , improves the gastrointestinal function via activation of the ghrelin-signaling system. We investigated the therapeutic effects of RKT on teriparatide-induced nausea<symptom> in rats and the involvement of ghrelin in these effects. We previously reported that ovariectomized rats showed pica ( kaolin ingestion) , a behavior that can be used to assess nausea<symptom> in rats , after the subcutaneous administration of teriparatide; thus , the behavior was used as an index of nausea<symptom> Ovariectomized rats were fed diets with or without RKT ( 1 %) for 2 weeks , and then they received the subcutaneous injection of teriparatide ( 400 Î¼g/kg). Teriparatide significantly increased the incidence of pica , while suppressing intestinal motility and plasma ghrelin levels in rats fed normal diets; however , rats fed diets with RKT showed improvements in all of the teriparatide-induced adverse reactions. These therapeutic effects were antagonized by a ghrelin receptor antagonist ( ( D-Lys
