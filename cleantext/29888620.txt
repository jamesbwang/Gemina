  Tourniquets are widely used to make the vein more visible prior to blood collection. Venepuncture tourniquets are however a non-sterile and potentially reusable equipment. Several studies have shown that they are colonised by a variety of pathogenic bacteria and consecutively use of the same tourniquet on multiple patients will increase the risk of a nosocomial infection. This matter is however only scarcely studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the nationwide use of disposable and non-disposable venepuncture tourniquets and the standardised procedures for cleaning the tourniquets. A questionnaire concerning use and cleaning of tourniquets was therefore sent to all major Danish clinical biochemistry laboratories ( n = 12). All but one laboratory had a local procedure for usage and handling of tourniquets , including structured procedures for cleaning. Despite this , only 75 % of laboratories had a guideline for cleaning the tourniquets and only 50 % had a specified cleaning program. At the hospitals using non-disposable tourniquets the handling differed considerably and at two hospitals the tourniquets were only cleaned once a week , while one laboratory did not clean the tourniquet before it was visibly stained. Of note , five of the eight hospitals using disposable tourniquets only disposed the tourniquets on a daily basis. In conclusion , there is a lack of guidelines for handling tourniquets in 25-33 % of the hospitals and a number of hospitals used both types ( disposable and non-disposable) , which could confuse the handling of the tourniquets. A national guideline for usage and cleaning of venepuncture tourniquets is therefore strongly recommended.
