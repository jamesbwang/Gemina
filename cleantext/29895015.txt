  A genomic HABP2 variant was proposed to be responsible for familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma ( FNMTC). However , its involvement has been questioned in subsequent studies. We aimed to identify genetic HABP2 mutations in a series of FNMTC patients and investigate their involvement in the disease. HABP2 was sequenced from 6 index patients. Presence of the variants was investigated in all members of one family. Somatic BRAF and RAS `` hotspot '' mutations were investigated by the IdyllaTM BRAF Mutation Test and/or Sanger sequencing. Two HABP2 variants ( p.E393Q and p.G534E) were identified in the index patient from one family with papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) ( follicular variant). The prevalence of p.E393Q in Spanish control alleles was 0.5 % and that of p.G534E was 5.1 %. However , neither change cosegregated with the phenotype in 3 affected members and 5 healthy members of the kindred. Interestingly , all 3 members affected by PTC harbored the p.V600E somatic mutation in BRAF. The variant G534E is prevalent in the Spanish population ( 5.1 %); however , p.E393Q is rare ( < 1 %) and none cosegregated with the FNMTC phenotype. The presence of the noninheritable V600E BRAF mutation in this family supports Knudson 's `` double-hit '' hypothesis for cancer development and suggests the involvement of more than 1 gene in the clinical expression of FNMTC.
