  Hundreds of oral and injectable generic drugs have seen dramatic price increases during the 2010s. Several reasons for the astronomic price increases have been postulated , ranging from reduced competition , shortages in the manufacturing supply chain , very small markets , market consolidation , the Unapproved Drugs Initiative of 2006 , and unanticipated manufacturing safety issues. In one survey , over 90 % of hospital administrators reported that higher drug prices had a moderate or severe impact on their budgets. Whereas compounding pharmacies may present an effective solution to high drug prices , it is a potentially dangerous one , as the case of New England Compounding Center makes clear. The risks make a meticulous vetting process necessary.
