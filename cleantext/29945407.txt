  To investigate the outcome predictive factors of ruptured lumbar disc herniation after conservative treatment. From June 2009 to June 2016 , 147 patients with ruptured lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were treated with conservative treatment in the orthopedics department of Suzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for clinical efficacy and MRI follow-up. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis ( Stepwise regression method) was used to analyze the relationship between the 11 categorical variables and absorptivity of protrusions: sex ( X1) , age ( X2) , course of disease ( X3) , the rate of protrusion ( X4) , the Komori type ( X5) , the MSU type ( X6) , the Iwabuchi type ( X7) , the Pfirrmann grade ( X8) , the Modic change on adjacent vertebrae ( X9) , spinal canal morphology ( X10) , the Schizas types of cauda equina<pathogen> sedimentation sign ( X11). A total of 64 cases of prominent reabsorption among all cases followed-up ( absorption rate > = 30 %) , accounting for 43.5 %. The reabsorption of protrusions is more likely to occur in patients with a duration of less than 1 year ( Ruptured lumbar disc herniation can be reabsorbed after nonoperative treatment. And the reabsorption of protrusions is more likely to occur in patients with a duration of less than 1 year , MSU type 3 , Iwabuchi type 1 or 5 , the Schizas type of cauda equina<pathogen> sedimentation sign A or B , which can be used as the key reference factors for predicting the outcome of the projections.
