  Expressed by cancer stem cells of various epithelial cell origins , CD133 is an attractive therapeutic target for cancers. Autologous chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell directed CD133 ( CART-133) was first tested in this trial. The anti-tumor specificity and the postulated toxicities of CART-133 were first assessed. Then , we conducted a phase I clinical study in which patients with advanced and CD133-positive tumors received CART-133 cell-infusion. We enrolled 23 patients ( 14 with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , 7 with pancreatic carcinomas , and 2 with colorectal carcinomas). The 8 initially enrolled patients with HCC were treated by a CART-133 cell dose escalation scheme ( 0.05-2 Ã— 10
