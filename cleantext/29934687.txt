  Despite some populations show a wide spectrum of different BRCA pathogenic variants ( PVs) , particular ethnic groups carry at high frequency a single or a few recurrent PVs , usually due to a founder effect. The identification of these founder PVs , with simple molecular methods , improves BRCA1/2 testing and cancer risk assessment. In this study , we developed a rapid and reliable PCR method , coupled with capillary electrophoresis ( CE) for genotyping the Italian founder BRCA1 c. 4964_4982del19 ( rs80359876) variant. In addition , we compared the performance of two CE platforms: ( Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the Experion Automated Electrophoresis system) to identify this variant. Our findings suggest that CE represents a simple and standardized diagnostic strategy for the unambiguously identification of the BRCA1 c. 4964_4982del19 variant , on both germline and somatic DNA samples. The results and performance obtained by two platforms are absolutely superimposable in terms of specificity and sensitivity , as well as for their feasibility , time of analysis and costs.
