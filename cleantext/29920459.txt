  Haloacetamides ( HAMs) , a group of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts ( N-DBPs) , can decompose to form corresponding intermediate products and other DBPs. The stability of ten different HAMs , including two chlorinated , five brominated , and three iodinated species was investigated with and without the presence of chlorine , chloramines , and reactive solutes such as quenching agents. The HAM basic hydrolysis and chlorination kinetics were well described by a second-order kinetics model , including first-order in HAM and hydroxide and first-order in HAM and hypochlorite , respectively , whereas the HAM neutral hydrolysis kinetic was first-order in HAM. Furthermore , HAMs decompose instantaneously when exposed to hypochlorite , which was almost two and nine orders of magnitude faster than HAM basic and neutral hydrolysis , respectively. In general , HAM hydrolysis and chlorination rates both increased with increasing pH and the number of halogens substituted on the methyl group. Moreover , chlorinated HAMs are more unstable than their brominated analogs , followed by the iodinated ones , due to the decrease in the electron-withdrawing inductive effect from chlorine to iodine atom. During hydrolysis , HAMs mainly directly decompose into the corresponding haloacetic acids ( HAAs) via a nucleophilic reaction between the carbonyl carbon and hydroxide. For HAM chlorination reactions , hypochlorite reacts with HAMs to form the N-chloro-HAMs ( N-Cl-HAMs) via Cl
