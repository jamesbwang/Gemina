  Communication about risk factors for diabetes between nurse practitioners and college students may not be occurring as the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to evaluate if college students are being told of their risk for diabetes based on known risk factors of weight , sleep , and depressive symptoms. Descriptive , cross-sectional study was completed using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. Using listwise deletion for all variables in the analyses , the sample ( N = 313) included college participants aged 18-25 years. Logistic regression model found that body mass index ( BMI) , sleep quantity , and gender were significant predictors of not being told one was at risk for diabetes. In those with a BMI > 25 kg/m ( n = 159) , only 22 % were told about their risk for diabetes by a health care provider. Nurse practitioners may not be recognizing the factors that affect on the development of prediabetes in college-age students or not providing guidance for measures to prevent the morbidity related to diabetes. Nurse practitioners are in a prime position to identify individuals with overweight/obesity , poor sleep , and depressive symptoms and recommend lifestyle changes to prevent the onset of disease.
