  The current transfusion policy recommended for individuals with serologic weak-D phenotype is based on data derived from European-descent populations. Data referring to the distribution of RH alleles underlying weak-D phenotype among people of mixed origin are yet incomplete , and the applicability of European-based transfusion guidelines to this specific population is questionable. To evaluate the distribution of RHD variant genotype among individuals with serologic weak-D phenotype of both African and European descent. Donors and patients of mixed origin and with serologic weak-D phenotype were selected for the study. They were investigated using conventional RHD-PCR assays and RHD whole-coding region direct sequencing. One hundred and six donors and 58 patients were included. There were 47 donors and 29 patients with partial-D genotype ( 47/106 , 44.3 % , and 29/58 , 50 % , respectively). RHD * DAR and RHD * weak D type 38 represented the most common altered RHD alleles among donors ( joint frequency of 39.6 %) , while weak D types 1-3 accounted for 10.4 % of the total D variant samples. RHD * DAR was the most common allele identified in the patient group ( frequency of 31 %) , and weak D types 1-3 represented 29.3 % of the total. The frequency of partial D among mixed individuals with serologic weak-D phenotype is high. They should be managed as D-negative patients until molecular tests are complete.
