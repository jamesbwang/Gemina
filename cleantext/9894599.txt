  Thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products are rare and their biosynthesis and biological significance remain unknown. Thioplatensimycin ( thioPTM) and thioplatencin ( thioPTN) , thiocarboxylic acid congeners of the antibacterial natural products platensimycin ( PTM) and platencin ( PTN) , were recently discovered. Here we report the biosynthetic origin of the thiocarboxylic acid moiety in thioPTM and thioPTN. We identify a thioacid cassette encoding two proteins , PtmA3 and PtmU4 , responsible for carboxylate activation by coenzyme A and sulfur transfer , respectively. ThioPTM and thioPTN bind tightly to Î²-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II ( FabF) and retain strong antibacterial activities. Density functional theory calculations of binding and solvation free energies suggest thioPTM and thioPTN bind to FabF more favorably than PTM and PTN. Additionally , thioacid cassettes are prevalent in the genomes of bacteria , implicating that thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products are underappreciated. These results suggest that thiocarboxylic acid , as an alternative pharmacophore , and thiocarboxylic acid-containing natural products may be considered for future drug discovery.
