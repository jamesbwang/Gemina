  The influence of inorganic filler content of resin-based luting agents ( RBLAs) on color<symptom> change<symptom> ( ΔE00) , CIEL * a * b * ( individual color coordinates) , and translucency parameters ( TP) of simulated ceramic laminate veneer ( CLV) was investigated. RBLAs with low , intermediate , and high inorganic filler content ( 55 % , 65 % , and 75 % mass fractions , respectively) were prepared. Feldspar ceramic ( Vitablocs Mark II) specimens ( 1.2 mm × 0.8 mm , A1C shade) were bonded to simulated composite resin substrates ( 1.6 mm × 1.2 mm , A2D shade) using three experimental and a commercial ( RelyX Veneer) RBLA ( translucent shade). The ΔE00 was calculated by CIEDE2000 color difference metric under three conditions ( before , immediately after , and 24 h after luting). The TP was calculated using CIEL * a * b * color coordinates measured over white and black backgrounds. Surface morphology of the RBLAs was analyzed. One-way and two-way analyses of variance with a post-hoc Tukey 's test were used respectively to calculate TP , CIEL * a * b * coordinates , and ΔE00 ( α = 0.05). Overall , the tested RBLAs presented clinically visible ∆ E00 values under the three conditions evaluated. For all RBLAs , higher ∆ E00 values were observed between measurements obtained before and immediately after luting. Different inorganic filler content did not significantly increase the opacity<symptom> of the ceramic-luting agents-resin composite set. The variation in inorganic filler content did not influence significantly the TP of simulated CLV; although all of the experimental RBLAs tested yielded ∆ E00 above the perceptibility threshold. The L * , a * , and b * individual color coordinates were cementation-dependent.
