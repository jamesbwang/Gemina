  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) are class of non-coding RNAs formed by back-splicing events as loops , and could be found in all types of organisms. They play important and diverse roles in cell development , growth , and tumorigenesis , but functions of the majority of circRNAs remain enigmatic. Particularly functional phenotypes of great majority of circRNAs are not obvious. Here we randomly selected a circRNA circ-UBR5 , which has no obvious functional phenotype in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) cells from our previous research findings , to explore its potential function in cells. Differential expression of circ-UBR5 was detected in paired samples of tumorous tissues and adjacent nontumorous tissues from 59 patients with NSCLC by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions ( qRT-PCRs). Results showed circ-UBR5 expression was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues ( p < 0.001) and was correlated with tumor differentiation ( p = 0.00126) , suggesting circ-UBR5 might serve as an index of NSCLC differentiation. Our findings indicated circ-UBR5 could bind splicing regulatory factor QKI , KH domain containing RNA binding ( QKI) and NOVA<pathogen> alternative splicing regulator 1 ( NOVA1) and U1 small nuclear RNA ( snRNA) in the nucleus , revealing circ-UBR5 might be a novel snRNA involved in RNA splicing regulatory process. Moreover , we first presented a highly efficient strategy for finding specific circRNA binding proteins using Human Protein Microarray ( Huprot â„¢ Protoarray).
