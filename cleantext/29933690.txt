  Owing to their capability of forming extensive hydrogen bondings and the facile introduction of chirality , cyclic dipeptides ( CDPs) have gained great attention as scaffolds for functional supramolecules. Surprisingly , introduction of a photopolymerizable diacetylene ( DA) moiety to the CDP afforded nanotubular structures with enhanced stability and reversible thermochromism. A series of CDP-containing DAs ( CDP-DAs) are prepared by coupling 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid with CDPs , cyclo (- Gly-Ser) and cis/trans cyclo (- Ser-Ser). Fabrication of CDP-DA self-assemblies in a polar chloroform and methanol solvent mixture affords nanotubes comprising single-wall and multiwall structures. The self-assembly behavior and morphology characteristic are examined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Next , X-ray diffraction analysis confirms well-ordered lamellar structures with a perfect agreement with the bilayer formation leading to the tubular structure via lamellar scrolling behavior. Upon UV irradiation , monomeric CDP-DA tubular assemblies result in the blue-colored CDP/polydiacetylene ( PDA) nanotubes. Interestingly , CDP/PDA nanotubes exhibit a reversible blue-to-red color<symptom> change<symptom> for over 10 consecutive thermal cycles. The CDP-DA/PDA supramolecular system demonstrates potential applications in developing stimulus-responsive functional materials.
