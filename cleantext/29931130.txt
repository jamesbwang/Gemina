  Intervention studies suggest that incorporating walnuts into the diet may improve blood lipids without promoting weight gain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials evaluating the effects of walnut consumption on blood lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE databases ( from database inception to January 2018) of clinical trials comparing walnut-enriched diets with control diets. We performed random-effects meta-analyses comparing walnut-enriched and control diets for changes in pre-post intervention in blood lipids ( mmol/L) , apolipoproteins ( mg/dL) , body<symptom> weight ( kg) , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mm Hg). Twenty-six clinical trials with a total of 1059 participants were included. The following weighted mean differences ( WMDs) in reductions were obtained for walnut-enriched diets compared with control groups: -6.99 mg/dL ( 95 % CI: -9.39 , -4.58 mg/dL; P < 0.001) ( 3.25 % greater reduction) for total blood cholesterol ( TC) and -5.51 mg/dL ( 95 % CI: -7.72 , -3.29 mg/dL; P < 0.001) ( 3.73 % greater reduction) for low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol. Triglyceride concentrations were also reduced in walnut-enriched diets compared with control ( WMD = -4.69 ( 95 % CI: -8.93 , -0.45); P = 0.03; 5.52 % greater reduction). More pronounced reductions in blood lipids were observed when walnut interventions were compared with American and Western diets ( WMD for TC = -12.30 ( 95 % CI: -23.17 , -1.43) and for LDL = -8.28 ( 95 % CI: -13.04 , -3.51); P < 0.001). Apolipoprotein B ( mg/dL) was also reduced significantly more on walnut-enriched diets compared with control groups ( WMD = -3.74 ( 95 % CI: -6.51 , -0.97); P = 0.008) and a trend towards a reduction was observed for apolipoprotein A ( WMD = -2.91 ( 95 % CI: -5.98 , 0.08); P = 0.057). Walnut-enriched diets did not lead to significant differences in weight change ( kg) compared with control diets ( WMD = -0.12 ( 95 % CI: -2.12 , 1.88); P = 0.90) , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mm Hg) ( WMD = -0.72 ( 95 % CI: -2.75 , 1.30); P = 0.48) , or diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( mm Hg) ( WMD = -0.10 ( 95 % CI: -1.49 , 1.30); P = 0.88). Incorporating walnuts into the diet improved blood lipid profile without adversely affecting body<symptom> weight or
