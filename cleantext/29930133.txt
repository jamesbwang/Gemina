  The marine portion of the West<disease> Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS) in the Amundsen Sea Embayment ( ASE) accounts for one-fourth of the cryospheric contribution to global sea-level rise and is vulnerable to catastrophic collapse. The bedrock response to ice mass loss , glacial isostatic adjustment ( GIA) , was thought to occur on a time scale of 10,000 years. We used new GPS measurements , which show a rapid ( 41 millimeters per year) uplift of the ASE , to estimate the viscosity of the mantle underneath. We found a much lower viscosity ( 4 Ã— 10
