  As health care costs rise , medical education must focus on high-value clinical decision making. To teach and assess efficient resource use in rheumatology , online virtual interactive cases ( VICs) were developed to simulate real patient encounters to increase price transparency and reinforce cost consciousness<symptom>. To teach and assess efficient resource use in rheumatology , online virtual interactive cases ( VICs) were developed METHODS: The VIC modules were distributed to a sample of medical students and internal medicine residents , who were required to assess patients , order appropriate investigations , develop differential diagnoses and formulate management plans. Each action was associated with a time and price , with the totals compared against ideals. Trainees were evaluated not only on their diagnosis and patient management , but also on the total time , cost and value of their selected workup. Trainee responses were tracked anonymously , with opportunity to provide feedback at the end of each case. Seventeen medical trainees completed a total of 48 VIC modules. On average , trainees spent CAN $ 227.52 and 68 virtual minutes on each case , which was lower than expected. This may have been the result of a low management score of 52.4 % , although on average 92.0 % of participants in each case achieved the correct diagnosis. In addition , 85.7 % felt more comfortable working up similar cases , and 57.1 % believed that the modules increased their ability to appropriately order cost-conscious rheumatology investigations. Our initial assessment of the VIC rheumatology modules was positive , supporting their role as an effective tool in teaching an approach to rheumatology patients , with an emphasis on resource stewardship. Future directions include the expansion of cases , based on feedback , wider dissemination and an evaluation of learning retention.
