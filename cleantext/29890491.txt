  This study was carried out by applying the direct contact membrane distillation ( DCMD) into the treatment of effluent from anaerobic membrane bioreactor. The treatment efficiency of DCMD was highly emphasized , which was expected to be improved through the optimization of operating conditions. Three operating conditions , including temperature difference , cross-flow velocity and membrane pore size , were considered. The relative flux ( the ratio of actual flux to initial flux) increased from 0.50 to 0.98 as the operating conditions changed and that was enhanced by the increment of temperature difference and cross-flow velocity. Regarding the wastewater treatment efficiency , except for ammonia<pathogen> nitrogen , the interception ratio was greater than 90.0 % , which even reached 99.0 % for COD
