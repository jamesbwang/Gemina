  The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of nurses working in two university hospitals located in the west<disease> and east of Turkey toward care of dying individual as well as religious and cultural factors that influence their attitudes. The descriptive and comparative study was conducted with a total of 189 nurses who were working in adult inpatient clinics of two university hospitals in western ( 101 nurses) and eastern ( 88 nurses) Turkey between July and November 2016. The data were obtained by using the questionnaire and Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale. As a result of this study , it was determined that in terms of the status of receiving training the end-of-life care the majority of nurses received this training; however , this rate was higher ( 51.0 %) in nurses working in the eastern hospital ( p = 0.025). The nurses working in the east ( 51.6 %) were determined to have more problems during caregiving due to their religious and cultural beliefs , the most frequent problem they experienced was `` being uncomfortable due to privacy when giving care to patients from opposite gender '' ( 57.1 %). The emotions felt mostly by nurses during the care of dying patient were grief ( nurses in the east = 48.5 % , nurses in the west<disease> = 51.5 %) and despair ( nurses in the east = 40.4 % , nurses in the west<disease> = 59.6 %). Nurses working both in the east ( 98.27 ± 7.71) and in the west<disease> ( 97.19 ± 8.99) were determined to have positive attitude toward death , and there was no statistically significant difference between both groups in terms of the mean scores of the Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale ( p = 0.373). In accordance with these results , it is recommended to focus on death issues in end-of-life care during the nursing education and to support nurses with in-service trainings regularly after the graduation.
