  Elective total hip arthroplasty ( THA) is a routine procedure. Intraoperative harvesting of excised femoral heads for the purpose of donation during this procedure has become standard practice , in response to increasing bone allograft demand. Robust patient screening and femoral head analysis typically occurs , to minimize the risk of disease transmission to any potential recipient. Screening for human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) , a virus normally first diagnosed through serological testing , makes up part of this process. This case describes a 43-year-old male who underwent elective THA , with subsequent analysis of the excised femoral head at time of screening revealing a diagnosis of HIV<pathogen> , a condition previously never detected in the donor. First diagnosis of HIV<pathogen> from bone is exceedingly rare , with this case illustrating an unusual diagnostic pathway of a well-understood condition , as well as representing an unfamiliar outcome following a common surgical intervention.
