  NAD ( P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1) , a phase II flavoenzyme that catalyzes reduction reactions to protect cells against electrophiles and oxidants , is involved in tumorigenesis. Altered methylation of the NQO1 gene has been observed and is speculated to result in aberrant NQO1 expression in rat cells undergoing chemical carcinogenesis , although this has not been proven experimentally. In this study , we first investigated the potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of NQO1 differential expression in individual subclones of rat arsenic-transformed lung epithelial cells ( TLECs). NQO1 expression of TLEC subclones with or without 5-aza-2 '- deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR) treatment was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) , western blot analysis , and real-time PCR. Methylation status of the NQO1 promoter in TLEC subclones was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. Transcriptional activity of NQO1 promoter in vitro methylated was determined by luciferase assay using a CpG-free luciferase reporter driven by the NQO1 promoter region ( -435 to +229). We found that non-CpG island<disease> ( non-CpGI) within the NQO1 promoter was hyper- or hypo-methylated in TLEC subclones and corresponded to low and high gene expressions , respectively. Following the treatment with 5-Aza-CdR , transcription of the NQO1 gene in the hypermethylated subclones was restored , accompanied by demethylation of the NQO1 promoter. In vitro promoter methylation almost completely silenced reporter activity in TLECs. These results indicate that DNA methylation of the non-CpGI promoter contributes to epigenetic silencing of NQO1 in rat TLECs.
