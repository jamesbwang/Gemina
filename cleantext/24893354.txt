  To investigate refractive outcomes and optical quality after implantation of posterior chamber phakic implantable collamer lens with a central hole ( ICL V4c) to correct high myopia. Sixty seven eyes of 38 patients who underwent ICL V4c implantation were enrolled. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent ( SE) was- 12.44 ± 3.15 D ( range:- 6.63 to- 20.50 D). The refractive outcomes and optical quality of the eyes at postoperative 1 and 3 months were evaluated and compared. At 3 months postoperatively , the mean safety and efficacy indexes were 1.33 ± 0.22 and 1.14 ± 0.23 , respectively. The mean SE was- 0.32 ± 0.52 D; no patient lost 1 or more lines of corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA) , 13 % remained unchanged , 45 % gained 1 line and 42 % gained 2 or more lines. The mean modulation transfer function cutoff frequency ( MTF ICL V4c implantation is a safe , effective , and stable solution for high myopia. Patients will acquire high and stable postoperative optical quality. ICL V4c implantation has little influence on IOP.
