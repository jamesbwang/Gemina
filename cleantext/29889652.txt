  This study examined the associations of subjective social status ( SSS) with physical activity ( PA) and sedentary time ( ST) among adolescents. The study population consisted of 420 Finnish adolescents aged 13 to 14 years. The adolescents reported their own SSS within their school ( school SSS) and their family 's social position within society ( society SSS) based on the youth version of the Subjective Social Status Scale. Adolescents ' moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity ( MVPA) and ST were measured objectively by accelerometers and analyzed separately for the whole day and the school day. The associations between SSS and MVPA and ST outcomes were analyzed using multilevel modeling. School SSS was positively associated with whole-day MVPA and negatively associated with school-time ST. Society SSS was not significantly associated with objectively measured MVPA or ST. Both MVPA and ST are important behavioral determinants of health. As an important correlate of MVPA and ST , school SSS should be addressed by providers when discussing obesity risk and healthy behaviors with adolescents.
