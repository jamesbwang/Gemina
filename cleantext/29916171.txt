  RNA interference ( RNAi) is one of the simplest and easiest methods for specifically perturbing gene function in an organism. In planarian research , RNAi is one of the essential methods for defining gene functions not only during regeneration , but also during other life history stages. Since the first report of the efficacy of RNAi in planarians in 1999 , several RNAi protocols have been reported. Here , we describe protocols to synthesize and deliver synthetic double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA) to planarians , either by injection or by feeding. Both are easy , effective , and economical means of investigating gene functions in planarians.
