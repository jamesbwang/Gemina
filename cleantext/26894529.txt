  Recent developments in serial crystallography at X-ray free electron lasers ( XFELs) and synchrotrons have been driven by two scientific goals in structural biology- first , static structure determination from nano or microcrystals of membrane proteins and large complexes that are difficult for conventional cryocrystallography , and second , direct observations of transient structural species in biochemical reactions at near atomic resolution. Since room-temperature diffraction experiments naturally demand a large quantity of purified protein , sample economy is critically important for all steps of serial crystallography from crystallization , crystal delivery to data collection. Here we report the development and applications of `` crystal-on-crystal '' devices to facilitate large-scale in situ serial diffraction experiments on protein crystals of all sizes- large , small , or microscopic. We show that the monocrystalline quartz as a substrate material prevents vapor loss during crystallization and significantly reduces background X-ray scattering. These devices can be readily adopted at XFEL and synchrotron beamlines , which enable efficient delivery of hundreds to millions of crystals to the X-ray beam , with an overall protein consumption per dataset comparable to that of cryocrystallography.
