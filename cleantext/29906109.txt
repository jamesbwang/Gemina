  Palladium/norbornene ( Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis has emerged as a useful tool for preparing poly substituted arenes; however , its substrate scope has been largely restricted to aryl iodides. While aryl bromides are considered as standard substrates for Pd-catalyzed cross coupling reactions , their use in Pd/NBE catalysis remains elusive. Here we describe the development of general approaches for aryl bromide-mediated Pd/NBE cooperative catalysis. Through careful tuning the phosphine ligands and quenching nucleophiles , ortho amination , acylation and alkylation of aryl bromides have been realized in good efficiency. Importantly , various heteroarene substrates also work well and a wide range of functional groups are tolerated. In addition , the utility of these methods has been demonstrated in sequential cross coupling/ ortho functionalization reactions , consecutive Pd/NBE-catalyzed difunctionalization to construct penta-substituted aromatics and two-step meta functionalization reactions. Moreover , the origin of the ligand effect in ortho amination reactions has been explored through DFT studies. It is expected that this effort would significantly expand the reaction scope and enhance the synthetic potential for Pd/NBE catalysis in preparing complex aromatic compounds.
