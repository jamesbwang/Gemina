  The vascular plant pathogen Verticillium nonalfalfae causes Verticillium wilt in several important crops. VnaSSP4 .2 was recently discovered as a V. nonalfalfae virulence effector protein in the xylem sap of infected hop. Here , we expanded our search for candidate secreted effector proteins ( CSEPs) in the V. nonalfalfae predicted secretome using a bioinformatic pipeline built on V. nonalfalfae genome data , RNA-Seq and proteomic studies of the interaction with hop. The secretome , rich in carbohydrate active enzymes , proteases , redox proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism , cellular processing and signaling , includes 263 CSEPs. Several homologs of known fungal effectors ( LysM , NLPs , Hce2 , Cerato-platanins , Cyanovirin-N lectins , hydrophobins and CFEM domain containing proteins) and avirulence determinants in the PHI database ( Avr-Pita1 and MgSM1) were found. The majority of CSEPs were non-annotated and were narrowed down to 44 top priority candidates based on their likelihood of being effectors. These were examined by spatio-temporal gene expression profiling of infected hop. Among the highest in planta expressed CSEPs , five deletion mutants were tested in pathogenicity assays. A deletion mutant of VnaUn .279 , a lethal pathotype specific gene with sequence similarity to SAM-dependent methyltransferase ( LaeA) , had lower infectivity and showed highly reduced virulence , but no changes in morphology , fungal growth or conidiation were observed. Several putative secreted effector proteins that probably contribute to V. nonalfalfae colonization of hop were identified in this study. Among them , LaeA gene homolog was found to act as a potential novel virulence effector of V. nonalfalfae. The combined results will serve for future characterization of V. nonalfalfae effectors , which will advance our understanding of Verticillium wilt disease.
