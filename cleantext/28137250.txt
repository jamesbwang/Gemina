  Malaria<disease> is a serious disease and still remains a public health problem in many parts of Nigeria. The aim of this study was to describe malaria<disease> transmission trends and analyzed the impact of climatic factors on malaria<disease> transmission in the highlands of Plateau State , Central Nigeria. The study was a retrospective survey which used archival data of climate parameters and medical case records on malaria<disease> Rainfall , relative humidity , and temperature data were obtained from the nearest weather stations to the study locations from 1980 to 2015. Data on reported malaria<disease> cases were collected from general hospitals in the selected local government areas ( LGAs) from 2003 to 2015. Generalized Additive Models were used to model trends in malaria<disease> incidences over time , and it is lagged association with climatic factors. The results show a significant cyclical trend in malaria<disease> incidence in all the study areas ( Our findings suggest that climatic factors are among the major determinants of malaria<disease> transmission in the highlands of Plateau state except in Jos-North LGA where the low model deviance explained ( 35.4 %) could mean that there are other important factors driving malaria<disease> transmission in the area other than climatic factors.
