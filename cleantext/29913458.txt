  The advanced snakes ( Caenophidia) , the important amniote lineage encompassing more than 3,000 living species , possess highly conserved female heterogamety across all families. However , we still lack any knowledge on the gene ( s) and the molecular mechanism controlling sex determination. Triploid individuals spontaneously appear in populations of diploid species and can provide an important insight into the evolution of sex determination. Here , we report a case of spontaneous triploidy in a male of the twin-spotted ratsnake ( Elaphe bimaculata) with ZZW sex chromosomes. We speculate that as both ZZ and ZZW individuals develop male gonads , the ratio between the number of Z chromosomes and autosomes , and not the presence of the W chromosome in the genome , drives sex determination in the advanced snakes.
