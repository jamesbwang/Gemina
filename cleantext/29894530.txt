  Meningiomas generally present as slow-growing , expanding intracranial lesions<symptom> and are the most common benign intracranial tumor in adults. Rarely , meningiomas can exhibit malignant potential and present as extracranial soft-tissue masses through extension or as primary extracranial cutaneous neoplasms. Although they are uncommonly encountered by dermatologists , it is important to include meningioma in the differential diagnosis for scalp neoplasms. We present a rare case of a 68-year-old woman with scalp metastasis of meningioma 11 years after initial resection of the primary tumor.
