  Our goal was to compare the observed and the expected rates of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents ( CVA) in a large cohort of consecutive patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) using the ∏- circuit as a no-touch technique. From January 2001 to May 2016 , 3081 patients were consecutively submitted to an off-pump CABG operation using the ∏- circuit. A CVA was defined as a neurological deficit , lasting less ( transient ischaemic attack) or more ( stroke) than 24 h , diagnosed by a neurologist and confirmed by a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain. The primary end point was to compare the observed and the expected rates of CVAs; the latter was obtained using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons ' calculator. The secondary end point was to compare the observed and the expected mortality rates using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons ' calculator and the prevalence of postoperative complications. Moreover , we identified some subgroups at higher risk. The postoperative rate of CVAs was 0.5 % ( 14 cases): 2 ( 0.1 %) were transient ischaemic attacks and 12 ( 0.4 %) were strokes. The mean expected CVA rate ( 1.6 %) was significantly higher than the observed rate ( P < 0.001). None of patients who experienced postoperative CVAs died. The observed mortality was 1.3 % ( 40 patients) vs the expected mortality ( 2.6 %) , which was significantly higher ( P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified age > 70 years old , diabetes , extracardiac vasculopathy and chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> as risk factors for postoperative CVAs. However , in all the subgroups of risk , except for those with chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , the use of the ∏- circuit was associated with a low rate of CVAs. The ∏- circuit should be included as a possible choice among no-touch techniques. The observed rate of CVAs of 75 % is lower than the expected rate.
