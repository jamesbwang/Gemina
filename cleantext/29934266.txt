  Liver disease caused by hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) is one of the most serious health issues worldwide. The prevalence of HCV<pathogen> among health care workers ( HCWs) is higher than normal population. Our aim is to determine the seroprevalence of HCV<pathogen> among this high-risk group in Damascus Hospital , Syria in 2016. During March 2016 , anonymous testing for HCV<pathogen> was offered to 150 residents and physicians from different departments ( Surgery , otolaryngology , gastroenterology , anaesthesiology and laboratory) in Damascus Hospital using fourth-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). In addition , each participant was interviewed and answered a comprehensive questionnaire which includes questions on potential hazards , risk factors and the level of awareness about the disease and its ways of transmission. Surprisingly , all samples tested negative for anti-HCV antibodies , though many participants were already exposed to many risk factors especially as HCWs. HCV<pathogen> is not a main issue regarding its prevalence among HCWs in Damascus Hospital. Nevertheless , it is still necessary to develop a mandatory well-organized program to increase the awareness among HCWs and develop stricter prevention policies especially about bloodborne diseases transmitted occupationally.
