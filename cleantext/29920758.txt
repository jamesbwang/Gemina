  Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty ( PBMV) is the treatment of choice in patients with isolated mitral stenosis. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of PBMV under echocardiography guidance only of isolated mitral stenosis ( MS). From October 2016 to Dec 2017 , 20 consecutive patients with severe MS underwent PBMV with echocardiography as the only imaging modality at a single center. Outpatient follow-up including chest radiography , electrocardiography , and transthoracic echocardiography was conducted at 1 , 3,6 , and 12 months after the procedure. All 20 patients successfully underwent PBMV under echocardiography guidance without radiation and contrast agent. Among them , 2 patients were pregnant , 5 had chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , and 1 had history of allergy to contrast. Mitral transvalvular pressure gradient measured at catheterization dropped from 13.35 ± 2.85 mm Hg to 5.10 ± 1.17 mm Hg ( P < .01). Mitral valve area increased from 0.82 ± 0.10 cm In this small experience , PBMV could be successfully performed under only echocardiography guidance and appeared safe and effective while avoiding radiation and contrast agent use.
