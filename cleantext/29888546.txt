  Nowadays , the efficiency of buffalo oocytes cryopreservation is still low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of two combinations of cryoprotectant agents ( CPAs) and two vitrification devices for vitrification of swamp buffalo oocytes on their survival after vitrification warming , and subsequent developmental ability after in vitro fertilization. In vitro matured ( IVM) oocytes were vitrified by either Cryotop ( CT) or solid surface vitrification ( SSV) interacting with vitrification solution A ( VA) or B ( VB). In the VA or VB solution exposed test , the oocytes showed similar survival rates , but decreased blastocyst rates after in vitro fertilization compared with that of untreated oocytes. After vitrification , the CT method combined with VA solution yielded a higher survival rate ( 91.3 ± 5.84 %) of vitrified oocytes than that combined with VB solution ( 69.8 ± 4.19 % -75.8 ± 4.55 %); however , all the vitrification treatments showed lower blastocyst rates ( 1.1 ± 0.07 % -5.2 ± 0.24 %) compared with that of untreated oocytes ( 18.0 ± 1.09 %). Our results indicated that combined vitrification treatments in this study did not improve the decreased ability of vitrified oocytes developing to the blastocyst stage.
