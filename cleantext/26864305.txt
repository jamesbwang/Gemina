  The head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) represents one of the most common cancers in humans. Close to 600,000 new diagnoses are made every year worldwide and over half of diagnosed patients will not survive. In view of this low survival rate , the development of novel cell-based assays for HNSCC will allow more mechanistic approaches for specific diagnostics for each individual patient. The cell-based assays will provide more informative data predicting cellular processes in treated patient , which in effect would improve patient follow up. More importantly , it will increase the specificity and effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. In this study , we investigated the role of serum from HNSCC patients on the regulation of microRNA ( miRNA) expression in exposed cells
