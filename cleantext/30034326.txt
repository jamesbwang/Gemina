  One third of the epilepsies are refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) and , therefore , identification of new therapies is highly needed. Here , we briefly describe two approaches , direct cell grafting and gene therapy , that may represent alternatives to conventional drugs for the treatment of focal epilepsies. In addition , we discuss more in detail some new tools , cell based-biodelivery systems ( encapsulated cell biodelivery ( ECB) devices) and new generation gene therapy vectors , which may help in the progress toward clinical translation. The field is advancing rapidly , and there is optimism that cell and/or gene therapy strategies will soon be ready for testing in drug-resistant epileptic patients.
