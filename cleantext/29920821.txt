  What is the central question of the study? Does neonatal stress , in the form of neonatal maternal separation , influence the maturation of microglial density , morphology and neuronal signalling in medullary regions regulating cardiorespiratory function in rat pups? What is the main finding and its importance? Using Iba-1 immunohistochemistry , we show that neonatal maternal separation augments microglial density and the proportion of cells with an amoeboid morphology in the medulla. Although the current understanding of the effect of early life stress on medullary development is relatively limited , these data show that within this area , microglia are affected by neonatal stress. Microglia could therefore be important effectors in cardiorespiratory disorders resulting from maternal separation. Neonatal stress has wide-ranging consequences for the developing brain , including the medullary cardiorespiratory network. In rat pups , the reflexive cardiorespiratory inhibition triggered by the presence of liquids near the larynx is augmented by neonatal maternal separation ( NMS) , especially in males. Sex-specific enhancement of synaptic connectivity by NMS might explain this cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Microglia influence the formation , maturation , activity and elimination of developing synapses , but their role in the wiring of medullary networks is unknown. Owing to their sensitivity to sex hormones and stress hormones , microglial dysfunction could contribute to the abnormal cardiorespiratory phenotype observed in NMS pups. Here , we first used ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 ( Iba-1) immunolabelling to compare the density and morphology of microglia in the medulla of male versus female rat pups ( 14-15 days old) that were either undisturbed or subjected to NMS ( 3 h day
