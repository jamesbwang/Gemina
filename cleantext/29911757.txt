  Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease in which genetic susceptibility and environmental factors induce pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Additional factors such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia have roles in β-cell dysfunction and disease progression. The phenomenon of lipid-induced pancreatic β-dysfunction , designated as lipotoxicity , has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo experiments; however , there is still no solid evidence for the occurrence of this event in humans. The toxic effect of high lipid levels on β-cell function consists of impaired insulin gene expression , apoptosis , and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To demonstrate the importance of treating hypertriglyceridemia in reducing glucose intolerance and the need for insulin therapy in hospitalized diabetic patients. We evaluated five clinical case reports and conducted a detailed literature review via the PubMed search engine. Reduction in elevated blood triglyceride and glucose levels in hospitalized diabetic patients resulted in a rapid decline in glucose levels and in the need for insulin therapy. A decrease in high triglyceride levels in `` lipotoxic '' diabetic patients may improve insulin intolerance and glucose homeostasis and reduce the need for insulin therapy.
