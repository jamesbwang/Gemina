  Previous studies have found extensive geographic and demographic differences in tobacco use. These differences have been found to be reduced by effective public policies , including banning smoking in public spaces. Smokefree outdoor spaces reduce secondhand smoke exposure and de-normalize smoking. After previously publishing a study of smokefree indoor and outdoor space policies , it was brought to the authors ' attention that the dataset used in analyses was incomplete ( Lowrie et al. , BMC Public Health 17:456 , 2017). The current manuscript is a corrected version. Here , we include analyses for outdoor space policies. We evaluated regional and demographic differences in the proportion of the population ( both adult and child) covered by smokefree outdoor space policies for school grounds and playgrounds enacted in the United States prior to 2014. Children had a low level of protection in playgrounds and schools ( 8 % covered nationwide in both settings). Significant differences in coverage were found by ethnicity , region , income , and education ( p < 0.001). The odds of having a smokefree playgrounds policy was lower for jurisdictions with higher proportions of poor households , households with no high school diploma , whites and the Alaska/Hawaii region. Increased ethnic heterogeneity was found to be a significant predictor of increased odds of having a smokefree playgrounds policy , meaning that diversity is protective , with differential effect by region ( p < 0.001)- which may relate to urbanicity. Disparities in smokefree outdoor space policies have potential to exacerbate existing health inequities. A national increase in smokefree outdoor space policies to protect children in playgrounds and schools is a crucial intervention to reduce such inequities.
