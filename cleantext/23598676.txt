  To report a case in which an early , massive silicone oil migration into the subconjunctival space occurred in a patient after sutureless vitrectomy with the presence of a previously implanted pars plana glaucoma drainage device. An 80-year-old man presented with neovascular glaucoma secondary to a proliferative diabetic retinopathy in his left eye. After an intracamerular bevacizumab injection and panretinal photocoagulation , a 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV) combined with a superotemporal Ahmed pars plana glaucoma valve implantation was performed. Afterwards , the patient underwent a new 23-gauge PPV for a dense vitreous hemorrhage<symptom>. Intravitreal 1,000 centistokes silicone oil was placed to prevent recurrent intraocular bleeding. No sutures were performed. In the first postoperative month , a massive migration of silicone oil into the 360 Â° subconjunctival space was noted until no intraocular silicone oil was observed. We discuss the possible leakage mechanisms in this particular case.
