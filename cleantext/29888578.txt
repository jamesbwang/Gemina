  To observe the effect of electroacupuncture ( EA) on the expression of scavenger receptor A I ( SR-A I) protein and mRNA in peritoneal macrophages of atherosclerosis ( AS) rabbits. A total of 26 New Zealand rabbits were used in the present study , among them , 7 were randomly selected to constitute a blank control group , and the rest 19 rabbits were fed with high-fat diet combined with carotid artery balloon injury for establishing AS model. Eight weeks after high-fat forage feeding , one high-fat fed rabbit and one normal rabbit were randomly selected for verifying the success of modeling. HE staining was employed to examine pathological changes of the common carotid artery after paraffin section. Then the rest 18 rabbits were randomly divided into model , EA and medication groups ( HE staining displayed an injury of the inner membrane of the carotid artery marked by observable atherosclerotic plaques , interruption , thickening and uplift , inflammatory cell infiltration , etc. in the AS model rabbits which were relatively milder in both EA and medication groups. The expression levels of SR-A I protein and mRNA were significantly up-regulated in the model group relevant to the blank control group ( EA intervention may improve the severity of atherosclerosis to a certain degree in AS rabbits , which is possibly associated with its effect in inhibiting the expression of SR-A I protein and mRNA in the peritoneal macrophages.
