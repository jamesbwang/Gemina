  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARB) represent the cornerstones of hypertension and congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> treatment. Risk factors for hyperkalaemia associated with ACEI and ARB are chronic kidney disease and concomitant medications which increase serum potassium level. Body mass index ( BMI) also affects pharmacokinetics of ACEI and ARB and potassium disposition. We evaluated the relationship between BMI and hyperkalaemia associated with ACEI and ARB treatments. Study design is a retrospective case-control analysis. Patients who had been prescribed ACEI or ARB between June 2015 and June 2017 at Tokyo Women 's Medical University , Medical Center East , were included. Patient clinical background was collected from medical records. Hyperkalaemia was defined as serum potassium above 5.5 meq/L. The concomitant use of ACEI and ARB , aldosterone antagonists , direct renin inhibitor , sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) was regarded as hyperkalaemia-inducing medications. The relationship between BMI and hyperkalaemia associated with ACEI and ARB treatments was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The study included 2987 patients aged 70.1 ± 12.9 years , 61.0 % were men , and BMI was 23.8 ± 4.4 kg/m This study demonstrated that BMI provides useful information for the identification of potential risk for hyperkalaemia associated with ACEI and ARB treatments.
