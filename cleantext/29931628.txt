  The major salivary glands of rats release into the saliva and blood a wide spectrum of bioactive substances , essential for many organs , including the testes. Sialoadenectomy leads to the development of degenerative changes in the cells of the twisted testicular tubules. However , the effects of bioactive factors released by the major salivary glands on the morphology and function of Leydig cells remain little studied. Sialoadenectomy in adult rats led ( in 1-4 weeks) to a decrease in the nuclear and cytoplasmatic areas of Leydig cells , violation of the plasmalemma integrity , dilatation of perinuclear space and agranular endoplasmatic reticulum vesicles , and to destruction of the mitochondria. Ultrastructural changes caused by sialoadenectomy completely resolved by week 6 of the experiment at the expense of compensatory activation of the synthesis of the major salivary gland factors by other sources in the organism of rats.
