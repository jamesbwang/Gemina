  To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology ( AAN) guideline for treating new-onset focal or generalized epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs). The 2004 AAN criteria were used to systematically review literature ( January 2003-November 2015) , classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme , and link recommendations to evidence strength. Several second-generation AEDs are effective for new-onset focal epilepsy. Data are lacking on efficacy in new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> , juvenile myoclonic epilepsy , or juvenile absence epilepsy , and on efficacy of third-generation AEDs in new-onset epilepsy. Lamotrigine ( LTG) should ( Level B) and levetiracetam ( LEV) and zonisamide ( ZNS) may ( Level C) be considered in decreasing seizure<symptom> frequency in adults with new-onset focal epilepsy. LTG should ( Level B) and gabapentin ( GBP) may ( Level C) be considered in decreasing seizure<symptom> frequency in patients ≥ 60 years of age with new-onset focal epilepsy. Unless there are compelling adverse effect-related concerns , ethosuximide or valproic acid should be considered before LTG to decrease seizure<symptom> frequency in treating absence seizures<symptom> in childhood absence epilepsy ( level B). No high-quality studies suggest clobazam , eslicarbazepine , ezogabine , felbamate , GBP , lacosamide , LEV , LTG , oxcarbazepine , perampanel , pregabalin , rufinamide , tiagabine , topiramate , vigabatrin , or ZNS is effective in treating new-onset epilepsy because no high-quality studies exist in adults of various ages. A recent Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore , for focal epilepsy , eslicarbazepine and lacosamide ( oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥ 4 years old and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.
