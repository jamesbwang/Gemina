  The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of appeals to ingroup wrongdoings , as opposed to ingroup rightdoings , on reconciliation between groups in a real-world conflict. We conducted an experiment in Indonesia , where separatist conflict in the province West Papua is currently unresolved. Participants were a sample of Javanese residents ( N = 502) , representing the majority group in Indonesia. Compared to ingroup rightdoings , being reminded of ingroup wrongdoings significantly increased participants ' sense of perpetratorhood. These feelings of being a perpetrator in turn fostered participants ' reconciliatory attitudes towards the separatist group. These findings reveal that an appeal to ingroup wrongdoings can be effective in promoting intergroup reconciliation. In addition to theoretical implications , we discuss practical implications in terms of highlighting the importance of acknowledging ingroup wrongdoings as part of an intervention programme.
