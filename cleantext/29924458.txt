  The implementation of potential new step-up or step-down treatment recommendations in response to current guidelines is one of the main challenges currently faced in actual daily practice settings. In the present narrative review , we aim to discuss the relevance of these step-up and step-down proposals at the patient level in daily clinical practice. In particular , we aim to review the challenges associated with inhaled maintenance therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) in four clinical scenarios. First , we discuss the step up from single to double bronchodilation , including current controversies regarding the addition of a second bronchodilator versus initial treatment with two bronchodilators. Second , we discuss the step up from double bronchodilation to triple therapy while challenging current indications for inhaled steroid therapy and discussing triple therapy designs. Third , we discuss the step down from triple therapy to double bronchodilation while evaluating the effect of this downshift in risk categories on the patient according to the new classifications. Finally , we discuss the step down from double to single bronchodilation , with a special focus on safety. We believe this review will help to highlight the most relevant discussion points regarding the treatment of COPD in a manner that will stimulate and guide related clinical research.
