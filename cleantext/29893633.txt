  It has been claimed that effective responses to child sexual abuse ( CSA) must engage with the specific cultural , social , and religious contexts of the target communities. For Jewish communities in Australia , the program J-Safe was established to raise awareness , create cultural change , and empower the Jewish community to be able to prevent , recognize , and address child sexual assault within the school setting. This paper reports on the experiences of teachers in two Jewish-day schools who had participated in the J-Safe Project 's protective behaviors teacher training program. Participants ' accounts of the training indicate the Project builds teachers ' knowledge and supports teachers ' skill development in the areas of incidence , behavioral indicators and responding to disclosure suggest the training has relevance for the Jewish teaching context. However , the extent to which the training was successful at engaging with culturally specific norms within the Jewish community seems to have been limited , although it may be that the participants were not atypical from the wider group who participated in the J-Safe Project training.
