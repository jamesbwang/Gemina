  The detection of high-frequency spectral notches has been shown to be worse at 70-80 dB sound pressure level ( SPL) than at higher levels up to 100 dB SPL. The performance improvement at levels higher than 70-80 dB SPL has been related to an ` ideal observer ' comparison of population auditory nerve spike trains to stimuli with and without high-frequency spectral notches. Insofar as vertical localization partly relies on information provided by pinna-based high-frequency spectral notches , we hypothesized that localization would be worse at 70-80 dB SPL than at higher levels. Results from a first experiment using a virtual localization set-up and non-individualized head-related transfer functions ( HRTFs) were consistent with this hypothesis , but a second experiment using a free-field set-up showed that vertical localization deteriorates monotonically with increasing level up to 100 dB SPL. These results suggest that listeners use different cues when localizing sound sources in virtual and free-field conditions. In addition , they confirm that the worsening in vertical localization with increasing level continues beyond 70-80 dB SPL , the highest levels tested by previous studies. Further , they suggest that vertical localization , unlike high-frequency spectral notch detection , does not rely on an ` ideal observer ' analysis of auditory nerve spike trains.
