  A series of methyl or ethyl 4- ( substitutedphenyl/pyridyl) -6-methyl-2-oxo/ thioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate ( HPM) analogues 4a-g was synthesized and evaluated for larvicidal activity against Anopheles<pathogen> arabiensis. These newly synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral studies such as FT-IR , NMR (
