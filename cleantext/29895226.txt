  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs) , which have been shown to participate in intracellular RNA regulatory networks and play vital roles in many pathological processes. Recently , circular RNA_PRKCI ( circ-PRKCI) has been reported to regulate cell proliferation , migration and invasion in several human cancers. Hirschsprung disease ( HSCR) is a well-known congenital gut motility disorder which roots in the aberrance of cranial-caudal neural crest cell migration. In this study , we investigated whether circ-PRKCI may affect cell migration and proliferation in HSCR. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression of circ-PRKCI in 48 HSCR aganglionic tissues and 48 normal bowel tissues. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP) assay verified the direct interaction between miR-1324 and PLCB1 or circ-PRKCI. Cell counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) and Ethynyldeoxyuridine ( EdU) assays were employed to appraise the effects of miR-1324 or circ-PRKCI on cell proliferative potential , while transwell was performed to detect the migration in vitro. We found that circ-PRKCI was significantly down-regulated in HSCR aganglionic tissues. Morever , knockdown of circ-PRKCI suppressed cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Mechanistically , we confirmed that circ-PRKCI functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-1324 to upregulate the expression of PLCB1. In conclusion , our present study revealed the important role of circ-PRKCI-miR-1324-PLCB1 regulatory network in HSCR , providing a novel insight for the pathogenesis of HSCR.
