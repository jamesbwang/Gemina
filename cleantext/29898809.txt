  Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is considered to be a notorious type of cancer due to its aggressive metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that BLT2 , a low-affinity LTB4 receptor is critically associated with the phenotypes of TNBC cells , including invasion , metastasis , and survival. Furthermore , in a group of 545 breast cancer patients with metastasis , we observed that the high-BLT2 subgroup had a lower disease-free-survival rate than the low-BLT2 subgroup. Thus , we theorized that anti-BLT2 strategies could facilitate the development of new therapies used for TNBC. This review focuses on recent discoveries regarding BLT2 and its roles in as a novel prognostic biomarker in TNBC.
