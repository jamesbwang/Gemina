  South Asians ( SAs) are at heightened risk for cardiovascular disease as compared to other ethnic groups , facing premature and more severe coronary artery disease , and decreased insulin sensitivity. This disease burden can only be partially explained by conventional risk factors , suggesting the need for a specific cardiovascular risk profile for SAs. Current research , as explored through a comprehensive literature review , suggests the existence of population specific genetic risk factors such as lipoprotein ( a) , as well as population specific gene modulating factors. This review catalogues the available research on cardiovascular disease and genetics , anthropometry , and pathophysiology , and cancer genetics among SAs , with a geographical focus on the U.S.. A tailored risk profile will hinge upon population customized classification and treatment guidelines , informed by continued research.
