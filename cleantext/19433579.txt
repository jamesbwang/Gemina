  Haptoglobin ( Hp) is an abundant hemoglobin- ( Hb-) binding serum protein and a constituent of the HDL proteome. In man , there exists a common polymorphism at the Hp locus with two common alleles defined by the presence ( Hp 2 allele) or absence ( Hp 1 allele) of a 1.7 kb in-frame partial duplication of exons 3 and 4 of the Hp gene. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Hp 2-2 genotype is associated with a 3-5-fold increase in vascular disease among individuals with diabetes mellitus ( DM). Increased Hp-Hb complex has been shown to be associated with the HDL of Hp 2-2 DM individuals. Hb-associated HDL has been proposed to result in the oxidation of HDL and the consumption of antioxidants in HDL , such as vitamin E , rendering the HDL further susceptible to oxidation. In this study , we set out to identify proteins which become cross-linked to Hb in HDL and to measure vitamin E in HDL as a function of the Hp genotype. We report on the identification of a novel 72 kd Hb reactive species which is cross-linked to HDL and demonstrate that vitamin E in HDL is decreased in Hp 2-2 DM individuals.
