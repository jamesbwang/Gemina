  This study was aimed to detect a new mutation responsible for X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy with hyper-CKemia. We studied a proband who presented with cardiac symptoms with hyper-CKemia , but no clinical skeletal involvement in physical examination , laboratory tests , electromyography , echocardiography , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of cardiac muscles. Muscle biopsy for histopathology and immunohistochemistry for accessing sarcolemma changes. The next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed on the patient and Sanger sequencing was confirmed on the other 6 unaffected families.The clinic investigations illustrated a dilated cardiomyopathy. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed dystrophic changes and an obvious reduction of dystrophin-N and Î´-sarcoglycan , respectively. One hemizygous splicing pathogenic mutation c. 31 + 1G > C of exon 1 in the DMD gene ( chrX33229398 , NM_00 4006) was finally identified in the patient and his nephew , but it was carried in his mother and sister.A novel small mutation was identified at the first exon-intron boundary splicing site by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.
