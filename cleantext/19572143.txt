  Pre-match warm-ups are standard in many sports but the focus has excluded the substitute players. The aim of this research was to investigate the result of inactivity on physiological and performance responses in substitute basketball players during competition. Two basketball players from the second tier of the State League of Queensland , Australia volunteered for this study and were assessed for performance ( countermovement jump-CMJ) and physiological ( core temperature via ingestible pill; skin temperature at the arm , chest , calf and thigh; heart rate-HR) responses prior to and following a 20-min warm-up , and during the first half of a competitive basketball match ( 2 × 20-min real time quarters). Warm up resulted in increases in CMJ ( ~ 7 %) , HR ( ~ 100 bpm) and core ( ~ 0.8 °C) and skin ( ~ 1.0 °C) temperatures. Following the warm up and during inactivity , substitute players exhibited a decrease in all responses including CMJ ( ~ 13 %) , HR ( ~ 100 bpm) , and core ( ~ 0.5 °C) and skin ( ~ 2.0 °C) temperatures. Rest resulted in reductions in key performance and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> during a competitive match that poses a risk for match strategies. Coaches should consider implementing a warm up to enhance core/skin temperature for substitute players immediately before they engage with competition to optimise player performance.
