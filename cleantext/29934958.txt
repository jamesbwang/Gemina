  Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor arising on the head and neck in 40 % -50 % of patients. Between 20 % and 40 % will harbor subclinical nodal metastasis. Using search terms ` Merkel AND sentinel ' , MEDLINE , PUMED , and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed for publications regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) in classification I and II MCC of the head and neck. Twenty-nine publications encompassing 136 patients were included. The SLNB finding was positive in 42 patients ( 30.9 %). Primary MCC was located on the malar/zygomatic ( 34.4 %) , forehead/frontal ( 13.5 %) , and nasal ( 13.5 %) regions. Recurrence in an SLNB negative nodal basin result occurred in 10 patients ( false negative rate of 19.2 %). Site of primary MCC was not associated with a false-negative SLNB result; however , there was a non-statistically significant trend for increased frequency among midline lesions<symptom>. Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) is recommended for eligible patients with classification I and II head and neck MCC.
