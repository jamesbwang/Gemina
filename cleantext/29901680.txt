  For sensor applications , superparamagnetic anisotropy is an indispensable property , which is typically achieved by employing an external field to guide the arrangement of magnetic nanoparticles ( NPs). In the present investigation , the diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) ( PS-b-PNIPAM) is printed as a template to localize magnetic iron oxide NPs without any external field. Via microphase separation , cylindrical nanostructures of PS in a PNIPAM matrix are obtained , aligned perpendicular to the substrate. Since the magnetite NPs ( Fe3O4) are functionalized with hydrophobic organic chains showing affinity to the PS blocks , they can selectively aggregate inside the PS cylinders. Moreover , solvent vapor annealing allows the achievement of nanostructures inside the hybrid system with a very high order , even at a high NP loading. Therefore , NPs can accumulate within PS domains to form perpendicularly aligned aggregates with high periodicity. The magnetic properties of the hybrid films are determined at various temperatures in two orthogonal directions ( with PS cylinders vertical and parallel to the applied magnetic field). All hybrid films show superparamagnetism and a remarkable magnetic anisotropy is achieved at certain NP concentrations. This investigation shows a facile route to prepare superparamagnetic films with magnetic anisotropy and offers a novel possibility to future magnetic sensor fabrication.
