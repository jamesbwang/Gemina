  Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation cause dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson 's disease. The neuroprotective approach is a promising strategy to slow disease progression in Parkinson 's disease. A standardized extract of Centella asiatica<pathogen> ECa233 has been previously reported to have pharmacological effects in the central nervous system. This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats. Rats were orally given either vehicle or ECa233 ( 10 , 30 and 100 mg/kg) for 20 consecutive days. Rotenone ( 2.5 mg/kg i.p.) was given to parkinsonism ( PD) and ECa-treated rats from day 15 to 20. Locomotor activity was recorded on day 1 , 14 , 17 and 20. Tyrosine-hydroxylase ( TH) immunohistological staining was used to determine dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum<pathogen>. Furthermore , mitochondrial complex I activity , malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase protein expression were measured in brain tissue. Rats receiving ECa233 30 mg/kg showed a significant increase in distances ( p < 0.01) together with a higher number and intensity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum<pathogen> ( p < 0.001) compared to PD rats. ECa233 ( 30 mg/kg) protected against mitochondrial complex I inhibition , decreased MDA levels ( p < 0.05) and increased SOD ( p < 0.01) and catalase ( p < 0.05) expression. ECa233 can protect against rotenone-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal death. These effects are mediated through the protection of mitochondrial complex I activity , the effects of antioxidants and the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme expression.
