  Mathematical cognition research has largely emphasized concepts that can be directly perceived or grounded in visuospatial referents. These include concrete number systems like natural numbers , integers , and rational numbers. Here , we investigate how a more abstract number system , the irrationals denoted by radical expressions like 2 , is understood across three tasks. Performance on a magnitude comparison task suggests that people interpret irrational numbers ( specifically , the radicands of radical expressions) as natural numbers. Strategy self-reports during a number line estimation task reveal that the spatial locations of irrationals are determined by referencing neighboring perfect squares. Finally , perfect squares facilitate the evaluation of arithmetic expressions. These converging results align with a constellation of related phenomena spanning tasks and number systems of varying complexity. Accordingly , we propose that the task-specific recruitment of more concrete representations to make sense of more abstract concepts ( referential processing) is an important mechanism for teaching and learning mathematics.
