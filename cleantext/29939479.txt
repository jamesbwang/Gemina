  Crash sensing and its assessment play a pivotal role in autonomous vehicles for preventing fatal casualties. Existing crash sensors are severely bottlenecked by sluggish response time , rigid mechanical components , and space constraints. Miniaturized sensors embedded with custom-tailored nanomaterials upholds potential to overcome these limitations. In this article , piezoelectric Zinc-Oxide thin film as a crash sensing layer is integrated onto a flexible metal-alloy cantilever. Material characterization studies are conducted to confirm piezoelectric property of sputtered ZnO film. The piezoelectric d
