  This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO) on acute spinal cord injury ( SCI) by measuring the in vivo diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) parameters apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) and fractional anisotropy ( FA) and observing diffusion tensor tractography ( DTT) of fiber bundle morphology. The rats were randomly divided into sham-operated ( SH) , SCI , and SCI and hyperbaric oxygen treatment ( SCI + HBO) groups ( n = 6 in each group). The Basso-Bettie-Bresnahan ( BBB) score was used to evaluate motor function recovery , and DTI was performed on days 3 , 7 , 14 , and 21 after surgery. BBB scores and FA values decreased significantly after SCI , while the two values significantly improved in the SCI + HBO group compared with the SCI group on days 7 , 14 , and 21. ADC increased significantly on days 14 and 21 postoperatively in the SCI group compared with the SH group but did not significantly differ between the SCI and SCI + HBO groups at any time point. BBB scores had the same variation trend with ADC values and FA values in all three groups. In the SH group , DTT showed a well-organized spinal cord , but the spinal cord showed interruptions at sites of injury after SCI. In conclusion , HBO promotes the recovery of neuronal function after SCI. Parameters of DTI , especially FA , can quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of HBO treatment in SCI , while DTT enables the visualization of the fiber tracking of spinal cord tracts.
