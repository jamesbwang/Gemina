  Molecular imaging has become a powerful technique in preclinical and clinical research aiming towards the diagnosis of many diseases. In this work , we address the synthetic challenges in achieving lab-scale , batch-to-batch reproducible copper-64- and gallium-68-radiolabelled metal nanoparticles ( MNPs) for cellular imaging purposes. Composite NPs incorporating magnetic iron oxide cores with luminescent quantum dots were simultaneously encapsulated within a thin silica shell , yielding water-dispersible , biocompatible and luminescent NPs. Scalable surface modification protocols to attach the radioisotopes
