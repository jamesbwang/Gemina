  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) inhibitors are a new class of oral antidiabetic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) patients. However , the effects and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM patients with renal impairment ( RI) remain controversial. Therefore , we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors in T2DM patients with moderate to severe RI. The PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science database were searched for published randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) , which compared DPP-4 inhibitors with placebo or a control regimen. A fixed-model effect or random-effect model was used to assess the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on T2DM patients with RI. Subgroup analysis or meta-regression analysis were performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity among the included studies. 13 RCTs with a total of 2,940 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with other treatments , DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with a greater change in HbA1c level ( weight mean difference ( WMD) = -0.50 , 95 % CI: -0.61 , -0.39; p < 0.001) , and a higher response rate of patients achieving the HbA1c goal of < 7 % ( risk ratio ( RR) = 1.38 , 95 % CI: 1.12 , 1.70; p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis suggested that the reduced HbA1c was observed in all types of DPP-4 inhibitors , and in patients with moderate or severe RI , but not in those with end-stage renal disease. DPP-4 inhibitors did not significantly lower the FPG level ( WMD = -0.36 , 95 % CI: -0.92 , 0.20; p = 0.204) , and this was seen in all types of DPP-4 inhibitors except gemigliptin , which showed a significant reduction in FPG level. The prevalence of adverse events ( RR = 0.98 , 95 % CI: 0.94 , 1.02; p = 0.256) in the two groups was not significantly different , and DPP-4 inhibitors did not induce a higher rate of hypoglycemia ( RR = 1.31 , 95 % CI: 0.97 , 1.77; p = 0.075). DPP-4 inhibitors significantly lowered HbA1c levels in T2DM patients with moderate to severe RI. And the treatment of DPP-4 inhibitors did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia and adverse events. Considering the potential limitations in this meta-analysis , more large-scale , well-conducted RCTs are needed to identify our findings.
