  The relationships between autophagy-associated gene expression and clinical characteristics and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) have not been well revealed. We examined mRNA expression of Bcl-2 , p62 , Beclin 1 , VPS34 , Rubicon , ALFY , UVRAG , ULK1 , LC3 and NBR1 in 20 AML cases and 10 benign hematological cases by real-time PCR. Clinical information , treatment responses and outcomes of the AML patients were collected. Beclin 1 , LC3 , UVRAG , Rubicon and NBR1 were downregulated in AML patients compared with control group ( P Keywords: acute myeloid leukemia<disease>; autophagy; clinical outcome.
