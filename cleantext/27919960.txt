  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most lethal cancer worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. Tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B codifies the enzyme GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase , which participates in the biosynthesis of GDP-l-fucose. GDP-l-fucose is an important substrate involved in the biosynthesis of many glycoproteins. Cancer cells are often accompanied by the changes in glycoprotein structure , which affects the adhesion , invasion , and metastasis of cells. It is not clear whether tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B has any effect on the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We used an immunohistochemical method to assess the expression of tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B in 104 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples. The results showed tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B expression was associated with some clinical features in patients , such as age ( P = .017) , clinical stage ( P = .010) , and lymph node metastasis ( P = .043). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test showed that patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma having high tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B expression had a worse prognosis compared to the patients with low expression ( P = .048). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that high expression of tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B could predict poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma independently. In conclusion , abnormal fucosylation might participate in the progress of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and tissue-specific transplantation antigen P35B may serve as a novel biomarker for prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
