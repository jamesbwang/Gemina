  Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD) is a major public health problem and is increasingly being recognized as an important driver of costs in all health care systems. The diversity of outcomes for people living with CKD is in part due to variability in biology , access to care , environmental factors , and health care system differences. The International Society of Nephrology ( ISN) , working in collaboration with its partners , has evolved into a philanthropic organization , from a traditional medical society , committed to a vision that sees `` a future where all people have access to sustainable kidney health ''. A set of activities , including a Global Kidney Health Summit , the Global Kidney Health Atlas , and a Global Kidney Health Policy Forum , which has formed the basis of a multi-stakeholder engagement process , building on a solid base of ISN programs and educational activities , is described. Through building awareness and increasing capacity to conduct research , the international community will build a more solid foundation on which to advocate for sustainable , ethical solutions to the problem of kidney disease throughout the world. The ISN aims to improve kidney health worldwide through a variety of diverse activities addressing education , advocacy , and research. Collaboration with partners within and outside the medical community is key in achieving this goal. Key Messages: Kidney disease is an important public health problem and is driven by genetic , environmental , and socioeconomic factors. Through active collaboration with diverse partners , the international community is striving for sustainable kidney health and aims to achieve this through coordinated work in a variety of spheres.
