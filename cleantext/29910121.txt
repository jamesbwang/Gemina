  Impaired emotion perception is a well-established and stable deficit in schizophrenia; however , there is limited knowledge about the underlying aberrant cognitive and brain processes that result in emotion perception deficits. Recent influential work has shown that perceptual deficits in schizophrenia may result from aberrant precision in prior expectations , associated with disrupted activity in frontal regions. In the present study , we investigated the perception of dynamic , multisensory emotion , the influence of prior expectations and the underlying aberrant brain processes in schizophrenia. During a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan , participants completed the Dynamic Emotion Perception task , which induces prior expectations with emotion instruction cues. We delineated neural responses and functional connectivity in whole-brain large-scale networks underlying emotion perception. Compared to healthy individuals , schizophrenia patients had lower accuracy specifically for emotions that were congruent with prior expectations. At the neural level , schizophrenia patients had less engagement of right inferior frontal and parietal regions , as well as right amygdala dysconnectivity during discrimination of emotions congruent with prior expectations. The results indicate that individuals with schizophrenia may have aberrant prior expectations about emotional expressions , associated with under-activity in inferior frontoparietal regions and right amygdala dysconnectivity , which results in impaired perception of emotion.
