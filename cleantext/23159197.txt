  Acute myocardial infarction ( MI) accounts for one third of deaths. Cardiac troponin I ( TnI) is a reliable biomarker of cardiac muscle tissue injury and is employed in the early diagnosis of MI. In this study , a molecular method is introduced to early diagnosis of MI by rapid detection of TnI. The detection method was based on electrochemical aptasensing , being developed using different methods and evaluation steps. A gold electrode was used as a transducer to successful immobilize 76base aptamer to fabricate a TnI biosensor. The designed aptasensor could detect TnI in a range of 0.03 to 2.0 ng mL-1 without using any label , pre-concentration or amplification steps. The limit of detection was attained as 10 pg mL-1 without significant trouble of interfering species. The TnI biosensor demonestrated a stable , regenerative and reproducible function. 89 human samples were used to evaluate the performance of the TnI biosensor , and it represented 100 % and 81 % , diagnostic sensitivity and specificity , respectively. This aptasensor may be used as an applicable tool in the future of early medical diagnosis of MI.
