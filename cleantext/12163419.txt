  Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> patients are exposed to a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality even in the early phases of the disease. We evaluated carotid common carotid intimal media thickness ( ccIMT) intimal thickness and brachial flow-mediated dilation ( FMD) of 45 rheumatoid arthritis<disease> patients without known cardiovascular risk factors or heart disease on a stable dose of During Abatacept treatment , ccIMT and FMD remained stable and disease activity 28 score , CRP , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , and interleukin-6 decreased significantly ( This study shows that the endothelial function remained stable during Abatacept treatment.
