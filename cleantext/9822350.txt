  NF-κB is an important mediator of immune activity and its activation is essential in mounting immune response to pathogens. Here , we describe the optimization and implementation of a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes high content imaging and analysis to monitor NF-κB nuclear translocation. We screened 38,991 compounds from three different small molecule libraries and identified 103 compound as hits; 31 % of these were active in a dose response assay. Several of the molecules lacked cytotoxicity or had a selectivity index of more than 2-fold. Our image-based approach provides an important first step towards identifying small molecules with immunomodulatory activity.
