  Human mate choice is influenced by limb proportions. Previous work has focused on leg-to-body ratio ( LBR) as a determinant of male attractiveness and found a preference for limbs that are close to , or slightly above , the average. We investigated the influence of two other key aspects of limb morphology: arm-to-body ratio ( ABR) and intra-limb ratio ( IR). In three studies of heterosexual women from the USA , we tested the attractiveness of male physiques that varied in LBR , ABR and IR , using figures that ranged from -3 to +3 standard deviations from the population mean. We replicated previous work by finding that the optimally attractive LBR is approximately 0.5 standard deviations above the baseline. We also found a weak effect of IR , with evidence of a weak preference for the baseline proportions. In contrast , there was no effect of ABR on attractiveness , and no interactions between the effects of LBR , ABR and IR. Our results indicate that ABR is not an important determinant of human mate choice for this population , and that IR may exert some influence but that this is much smaller than the effects of LBR. We discuss possible reasons for these results , including the limited variability in upper limb proportions and the potentially weak fitness-signal provided by this aspect of morphology.
