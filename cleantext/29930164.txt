  Plasma cell mucositis ( PCM) is a rare non-neoplastic plasma cell proliferative disorder of the mucous<symptom> membranes<symptom> , which typically presents as soft tissue lesions<symptom> involving oral , upper airway or genital mucosa. Laryngeal involvement resulting in stridor has been reported in four other cases previously , with three requiring tracheostomy. We present a case of supraglottic stenosis in a 53-year-old woman presenting with dysphonia<symptom> and stridor , requiring surgical resection on three occasions accompanied by tracheostomy on two occasions; biopsy was consistent with PCM. Due to relapsing disease activity , high-dose prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil were commenced with prednisolone eventually being ceased. After 2 years of mycophenolate mofetil therapy , the patient 's disease has been controlled without need for further surgical intervention. This is the first reported case of prolonged symptomatic improvement with the use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil in PCM.
