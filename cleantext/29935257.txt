  This paper describes an adaptive approach to regularizing model-based reconstructions in magnetic resonance imaging to account for local structure or image content. In conjunction with common models like wavelet and total variation sparsity , this content-aware regularization avoids oversmoothing or compromising image features while suppressing noise and incoherent aliasing from accelerated imaging. To evaluate this regularization approach , the experiments reconstruct images from single- and multi-channel , Cartesian and non-Cartesian , brain and cardiac data. These reconstructions combine common analysis-form regularizers and autocalibrating parallel imaging ( when applicable). In most cases , the results show widespread improvement in structural similarity and peak-signal-to-error ratio relative to the fully sampled images. These results suggest that this content-aware regularization can preserve local image structures such as edges while providing denoising power superior to sparsity-promoting or sparsity-reweighted regularization.
