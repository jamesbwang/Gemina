  Dynamics-function correlations are usually inferred when molecular mobility and protein function are simultaneously impaired at characteristic temperatures or hydration levels. In this sense , excitation energy transfer in the photosynthetic light-harvesting complex II ( LHC II) is an untypical example because it remains fully functional even at cryogenic temperatures relying mainly on interactions of electronic states with protein vibrations. Here , we study the vibrational and conformational protein dynamics of monomeric and trimeric LHC II from spinach using inelastic neutron scattering ( INS) in the temperature range of 20-305 K. INS spectra of trimeric LHC II reveal a distinct vibrational peak at ∼ 2.4 meV. At temperatures above ∼ 160 K , however , the inelastic peak shifts toward lower energies , which is attributed to vibrational anharmonicity. A more drastic shift is observed at about 240 K , which is interpreted in terms of a `` softening '' of the protein matrix along with the dynamical transition. Monomeric LHC II exhibits a higher degree of conformational mobility at physiological temperatures , which can be attributed to a higher number of solvent-exposed side chains at the protein surface. The effects of the changes in protein dynamics on the spectroscopic properties of LHC II are considered in comparative model calculations. The absorption line shapes of a pigment molecule embedded into LHC II are simulated for the cases of ( i) a rigid protein matrix , ( ii) a protein matrix with temperature-dependent spectral density of protein vibrations , and ( iii) temperature-dependent electron-phonon coupling strength. Our findings indicate that vibrational and conformational protein dynamics affect the spectroscopic ( absorption) properties of LHC II at physiological temperatures.
