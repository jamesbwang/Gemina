  Stem cells and their paracrine factors have emerged as a resource for regenerative medicine. Many studies have shown the beneficial effects of paracrine factors secreted from adult stem cells , such as exosomes , on skin aging. However , to date , few reports have demonstrated the use of exosomes derived from human pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of skin aging. In this study , we collected exosomes from the conditioned medium of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) and investigated the effect on aged human dermal fibroblasts ( HDFs). Cell proliferation and viability were determined by an MTT assay and cell migration capacity was shown by a scratch wound<disease> assay and a transwell migration assay. To induce photoaging and natural senescence , HDFs were irradiated by UVB ( 315 nm) and subcultured for over 30 passages , respectively. The expression level of certain mRNAs was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR). Senescence-associated- & beta;- galactosidase ( SA- & beta;- Gal) activity was assessed as a marker of natural senescence. As a result , we found that exosomes derived from human iPSCs ( iPSCs-Exo) stimulated the proliferation and migration of HDFs under normal conditions. Pretreatment with iPSCs-Exo inhibited the damages of HDFs and overexpression of matrix-degrading enzymes ( MMP-1/ 3) caused by UVB irradiation. The iPSCs-Exo also increased the expression level of collagen type I in the photo-aged HDFs. In addition , we demonstrated that iPSCs-Exo significantly reduced the expression level of SA- & beta;- Gal and MMP-1/ 3 and restored the collagen type I expression in senescent HDFs. Taken together , it is anticipated that these results suggest a therapeutic potential of iPSCs-Exo for the treatment of skin aging.
