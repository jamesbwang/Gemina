  Management of neuropathic pain is a real clinical challenge. Despite intense investigation , the mechanisms of neuropathic pain remain substantially unidentified. Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -9 and MMP-2 have been reported to contribute to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Therefore , inhibition of MMP-9/ 2 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study , we aim to investigate the effect of procyanidins ( PC) , clinically used health product , on MMP-9/ 2 in neuropathic pain. The nociception was assessed by measuring the incidence of foot withdrawal in response to mechanical indentation in mice. Cell signaling was assayed using gelatin zymography , western blotting , and immunohistochemistry. The BV2 cells were cultured to investigate the effects of PC on microglia. Both in vitro and in vivo administration of PC significantly suppresses the activity of MMP-9/ 2. Oral administration of PC relieves neuropathic pain behaviors<symptom> induced by chronic constriction sciatic nerve injury ( CCI) in mice. Additionally , PC blocks the maturation of interleukin-1β , which is a critical substrate of MMPs , and markedly suppresses CCI-induced MAPK phosphorylation and neuronal and microglia activation , including the reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase C γ and NMDAR1. Furthermore , PC decreases the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibits the translocation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) in microglia. PC is an effective and safe approach to alleviate neuropathic pain via a powerful inhibition on the activation of MMP-9/ 2.
