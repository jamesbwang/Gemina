  This Editorial discusses the importance of scientists currently working in separate fields-experimental characterization of novel materials and theoretical investigations of electrochemical processes-joining forces to advance the field of energy-storage materials and devices. Some of these efforts are published in this Special Issue by ChemSusChem.
