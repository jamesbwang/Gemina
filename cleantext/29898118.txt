  Brachiaria brizantha is a forage grass well adapted to tropical areas and cultivated in millions of hectares in Brazil. The apomictic mode of reproduction in this species , in addition to differences in ploidy between sexual and apomictic plants , impairs crossbreeding. The development of a methodology to transform apomictic cultivars will provide an option to introduce agronomic important traits to B. brizantha cv. Marandu. In addition , it will open the possibility to study in vivo the function of candidate genes involved in the apomictic reproduction. The objective of this work was to evaluate peeled seeds , isolated embryo from mature seeds , embryogenic calluses and embryogenic cell suspensions , as target explant for genetic transformation via biolistics. Plasmids bearing the marker genes gus and hptII under the control of the rice actin 1 promoter ( pAct1-Os) or the maize ubiquitin 1 promoter ( pUbi1Zm) were used. All the target-explants used were suitable for transient gene expression after bombardment , showing gus expression and resistance to hygromycin. Using embryogenic calluses and cell suspensions as target tissues , transgenic plants were regenerated and transgenes detected.
