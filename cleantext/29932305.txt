  Unlike anastrozole , the effect of long-term exemestane ( EXE) therapy on bone mineral density ( BMD) is still unknown. We assessed changes in BMD from baseline to 5 years of EXE treatment. Postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer receiving EXE as adjuvant therapy were enrolled in this study. EXE was administered for 5 years. The BMD of the lumbar spine ( LS) and femoral neck ( FN) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 6 months and 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 years. Oral bisphosphonate ( Bis) treatment was initiated when patients were diagnosed with osteoporosis with a T-score of -2.5 or lower. Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the study between 2005 and 2010. The median follow-up period was 54.9 months. Forty-two patients were administered Bis. Overall , the BMD of the LS increased by 7.3 % from baseline and that of the FN increased by 3.4 % with 5 years of EXE treatment. At the sixth year ( i.e. 1 year after the treatment) , BMD of the LS increased by 7.2 % and that of the FN increased by 5.7 %. Furthermore , the BMD of the FN increased by 12.0 % in patients treated upfront with Bis and by 1.2 % in those not treated with Bis ( P = 0.0262). Fractures developed in nine patients ( 11.1 %) and seven ( 8.6 %) had fragility fractures. Oral Bis improves BMD of the FN in patients with osteoporosis. Five-year EXE treatment with proper addition of Bis helps maintain the BMD of the LS and FN at the sixth year.
