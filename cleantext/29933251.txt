  The use of light and no sedation is gaining currency in the intensive care unit , resulting in more conscious patients. Due to mechanical ventilation , patients are unable to communicate verbally , and may feel frustration. Communication tools may help; however , they are not used systematically in clinical practice. Based on `` complex interventions '' and a qualitative approach , a communication tool was modified , tested , and evaluated in this study. The tools consisted of a tablet with communication software and a laminated `` communication book '' with identical structure. Seven nonsedated , mechanically ventilated patients tested the tools and were observed in field studies. Findings show that challenges in using communication tools may be related to the patient , nurses , and/or technology. Patients may experience difficulties in using the tools , especially if they are extremely fatigued or have cognitive impairments and/or reduced muscle strength. Communication tools were not always necessary; however , some found them very helpful and the only way of conveying a message. Findings also show that the best way to facilitate communication is through a systematic communication strategy initiated by the nurse.
