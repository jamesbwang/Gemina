  The endoscopic endonasal approach has recently become an acceptable option for resection of all pituitary adenomas. We assessed biochemical outcome of endoscopic endonasal surgery in growth hormone ( GH)- secreting adenomas , including remission rate , predictors of remission , and associated complications. Sixty-eight consecutive patients with acromegaly who underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery were analyzed prospectively. Tumors were classified according to size , Knosp grade , and Hardy-Wilson classification. Biochemical remission was defined as normal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 level and either a suppressed GH serum level less than 0.4 μg/L during an oral glucose tolerance test or a random GH level less than 1.0 μg/L at least 3 months after surgery. Total biochemical remission rate was 64.7 %. Gross total resection was achieved in 61 of the 68 patients ( 89.7 %). Remission was achieved in 12 of 16 microadenomas ( 75 %) and 32 of 52 macroadenomas ( 61.5 %). Based on univariate logistic regression analysis , preoperative variables predictive of remission were age ( P = 0.004) , Knosp grade ( P = 0.023) , and preoperative GH levels ( P = 0.042). Three patients ( 4.4 %) experienced postoperative panhypopituitarism , and permanent diabetes insipidus was seen in 4 patients ( 5.9 %). Two patients ( 2.9 %) developed cerebrospinal fluid leaks , which were treated by lumbar puncture in one case and early surgical repair in the other case. Endoscopic endonasal adenoma resection leads to a high rate of endocrinologic remission in GH-secreting adenomas with a low complication rate. Patients with older age , higher preoperative GH levels , and higher Knosp grades are less likely to achieve remission.
