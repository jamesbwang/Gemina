  There is great evidence linking neurotrophic factor ( NF) dysfunction with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) pathophysiology. This study was conducted to evaluate plasma levels of NFs and their possible associations with clinical symptoms in PD. For this purpose , 40 PD patients and 25 controls were subjected to a clinical evaluation and peripheral blood draw. Plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) , pro-BDNF , neurotrophin 3 , neurotrophin 4 , nerve growth , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was no significant difference between PD patients and controls regarding the plasma levels of the evaluated NFs. In addition , NF levels were not associated with disease duration , degree of motor or functional impairment , cognitive performance or severity of depressive symptoms. In conclusion , although NFs may play relevant roles in the pathophysiology of PD , the circulating levels of these molecules are not necessarily changed in patients with PD.
