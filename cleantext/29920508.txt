  The benefits of endoscopic fetal surgery are deteriorated by the high risk of iatrogenic preterm prelabor rupture of fetal membranes<symptom> ( iPPROM). While previous studies have reported good sealing candidates to prevent membrane rupture , the delivery of these materials to the location of membrane puncture remains unsolved. We describe an approach to apply sealing materials onto the amnion through the fetoscopy port. We developed a device composed of an umbrella-shaped polyester coated nitinol mesh and an applicator. The spontaneously unfolding umbrella is pushed through the port , pulled against the amnion , and glued onto the amnion defect site. We tested the adhesion strength of multiple glues and tested the feasibility and reproducibility of this fetal membrane sealing approach in an ex vivo model. The umbrella unfolded and was well positioned in all tests ( n = 18). When applied via the fetoscopy port , umbrellas were successfully glued onto the fetal membrane , and all of them completely covered the defect ( n = 5). The mean time needed for the whole procedure was 3 min. This study is a proof of concept presenting a potential future solution for the precise local application of bioadhesives for the prevention of iPPROM.
