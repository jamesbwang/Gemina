  Escherichia<pathogen> coli is considered a leading bacterial trigger of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates from IBD patients primarily belong to phylogroup B2. Previous studies have focused on broad comparative genomic analysis of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> B2 isolates , and identified virulence factors that allow B2 strains to reside within human intestinal mucosa. Metabolic capabilities of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains have been shown to be related to their colonization site , but remain unexplored in IBD-associated strains. In this study , we utilized pan-genome analysis and genome-scale models ( GEMs) of metabolism to study metabolic capabilities of IBD-associated E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> B2 strains. The study yielded three results: i) Pan-genome analysis of 110 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains ( including 53 isolates from IBD studies) revealed discriminating metabolic genes between B2 strains and other strains; ii) Both comparative genomic analysis and GEMs suggested that B2 strains have an advantage in degrading and utilizing sugars derived from mucus glycan , and iii) GEMs revealed distinct metabolic features in B2 strains that potentially allow them to utilize energy more efficiently. For example , B2 strains lack the enzymes to degrade amadori products , but instead rely on neighboring bacteria to convert these substrates into a more readily usable and potentially less sought after product. Taken together , these results suggest that the metabolic capabilities of B2 strains vary significantly from those of other strains , enabling B2 strains to colonize intestinal mucosa.The results from this study motivate a broad experimental assessment of the nutritional effects on E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> B2 pathophysiology in IBD patients.
