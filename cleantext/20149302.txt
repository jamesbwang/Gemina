  The application of more sensitive imaging techniques , such as ultrasonography ( US) , changed the concept of non-erosive arthritis<disease> in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) , underlining the need for biomarkers to identify patients developing the erosive phenotype. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies ( ACPA) , associated with erosions in inflammatory arthritis<disease> , have been identified in about 50 % of patients with SLE with erosive arthritis<disease>. More recently , anti-carbamylated proteins antibodies ( anti-CarP) have been associated with erosive damage in rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. We aimed to assess the association between anti-CarP and erosive damage in a large SLE cohort with joint involvement. We evaluated 152 patients ( male/female patients 11/141; median age 46 years , IQR 16; median disease duration 108 months , IQR 168). All patients underwent blood draw to detect rheumatoid factor ( RF) and ACPA ( commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) kit) , and anti-CarP ( `` home-made '' ELISA , cutoff 340 aU/mL). The bone surfaces of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints were assessed by US: the presence of erosions was registered as a dichotomous value ( 0/1) , obtaining a total score ( 0-20). The prevalence of anti-CarP was 28.3 % , similar to RF ( 27.6 %) and significantly higher than ACPA ( 11.2 % , p = 0.003). Erosive arthritis<disease> was identified in 25.6 % of patients: this phenotype was significantly associated with anti-CarP ( p = 0.004). Significant correlation between anti-CarP titer and US erosive score was observed ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.01). Significant association was identified between anti-CarP and erosive damage in SLE-related arthritis<disease> , in terms of frequency and severity , suggesting that these antibodies can represent a biomarker of severity in patients with SLE with joint involvement.
