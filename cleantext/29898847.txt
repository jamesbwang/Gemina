  B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) is known to be a risk marker following acute myocardial infarction ( MI). More recently , truncated molecular forms of the BNP molecule have been identified , with the association of these forms and outcome in acute MI not known. The present study investigated their use as risk stratifying biomarkers of this condition. BNP molecular forms ( BNP 5-32 , BNP 4-32 and BNP 3-32) were measured in plasma from 1078 acute MI patients using immunocapture followed by MALDI-ToF-mass spectrometry. Associations of molecular forms with short-term and long-term adverse outcomes were assessed. BNP molecular forms were independent predictors of mortality/reinfarction , mortality/rehospitalization due to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and a composite of all events at 6 months , 1 year and 2 years and showed prognostic ability comparable with conventional BNP measurements ( P < .001-0.026 vs. N-terminal ( NT)- proBNP P < .001-0.020 , respectively). Reclassification analyses showed BNP molecular forms successfully reclassified patient risk when used in addition to the GRACE clinical risk score ( P â‰¤ .005). BNP 5-32 showed utility as a secondary risk stratification biomarker when used in combination with the GRACE score and NT-proBNP by successful down-classification of high-risk patients. BNP molecular forms were associated with poor prognosis at 6 months , 1 year and at 2 years in patients with acute MI. BNP 5-32 showed successful utility as a secondary marker in combination with NT-proBNP after GRACE scoring. This study suggests a potential role for BNP molecular forms in prognosis and risk stratification after acute MI.
