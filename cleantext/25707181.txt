  The main objective of this study was to describe the temporal distribution of monthly reported human brucellosis<disease> cases in mainland China and develop an appropriate time series model for short-term extrapolation forecast. Surveillance data of the monthly reported human brucellosis<disease> cases occurring from April 1 , 2007 , to March 31 , 2017 , in mainland China were obtained. The spectrum analysis was first adopted to find the cyclic and seasonal features , the existence of the seasonality and trend was determined by exponential smoothing method and the seasonal-trend decomposition. The candidate models of exponential smoothing included the additive model and multiplicative model; R From April 1 , 2007 , to March 31 , 2017 , a total of 435,108 cases of Brucellosis<disease> occurred in mainland China were reported , with an average of 3626 cases per month and a standard deviation of 1834 cases. The R Human brucellosis<disease> cases peaked during the months from March to August in mainland China , with clear seasonality. The exponential smoothing based on the additive model method could be effectively used in the time series analysis of human brucellosis<disease> in China. Control methods , such as vaccination , quarantine , elimination of infected animals , and good hygiene within the production cycle , should be strengthened with paying more attention to the seasonality. Further research is warranted to explore the drivers behind the seasonality.
