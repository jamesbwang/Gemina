  In recent years , great progress has been made in the development of sensors and biosensors to meet the demands of environmental and food analysis. In this Special Issue , the state of art and the future trends in the field of environmental and food analyses have been explored. A total of seven papers ( three research and four review papers) are included. These are focused on the fabrication and detection of contaminates such as heavy metals , pesticides and food components , including uric acid and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Included in this Issue is a paper dedicated to the experimental determination of the electroactive area of screen-printed electrodes , an important parameter in the development of such sensors.
