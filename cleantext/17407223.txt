  Rough weather conditions in the subarctic areas of Norway may influence on the risk of wrist fracture. We implemented data from the Norwegian System of Patient Injury Compensation ( NPE). All claims due to wrist surgery , performed at the public hospitals in Northern Norway , during 2005-2014 were analyzed. We employed the ICD-10 classification codes S52 .5 ( fracture of distal end of radius) and S52 .6 ( fracture of distal end of radius and ulna). Treatment was defined by NCSP codes. 84 patients ( 0.3 %) complained. Females complained four times more often than males did ( P = 0.005) and received five times more frequently a compensation ( P < 0.001). NPE accepted 34 claims ( 40 %) for injury compensation ( 0.1 % of patients). The percentage of claims accepted for compensation decreased from 48 % to 30 % during study period , probably due to delay in filling claims. The main causes of complains were pain , reduced range of motion , malfunction and weakness<symptom> ( 35/84). The main causes of compensation were `` operative treatment should have been performed '' ( 14/34) and `` wrong operative method applied '' ( 13/34). The mean amount per compensation was $ 14,927 ( $ 0- $ 52,995). Stonger focus on quality of care , updated guidelines and shared decission-making may reduce the number og complains and compensations.
