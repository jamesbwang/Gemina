  Mitochondria are composed of many small proteins that control protein synthesis , complex assembly , metabolism , and ion and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) handling. We show that a skeletal muscle- and heart-enriched long non-coding RNA , LINC00116 , encodes a highly conserved 56-amino-acid microprotein that we named mitoregulin ( Mtln). Mtln localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane , where it binds cardiolipin and influences protein complex assembly. In cultured cells , Mtln overexpression increases mitochondrial membrane potential , respiration<symptom> rates , and Ca
