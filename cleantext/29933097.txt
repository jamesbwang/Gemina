  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD) and colonoscopy are common outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures that frequently use sedation. We aimed to identify a protocol that combines safety with cost effectiveness. We collected data from consecutive outpatients ( age , 20-98 y) who underwent diagnostic EGD ( n = 117,661) or colonoscopy ( n = 32,550) with propofol sedation from January 2006 through December 2016. Propofol was administered by a nurse via bolus injection using an age-adjusted standard protocol , up to a total of 200 mg. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of adverse events within 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures included rates of procedure success , respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> , and other procedure-related adverse events. The median dose of propofol administered for EGD was 77 mg ( range , 20-160 mg) and for colonoscopy was 99 mg ( range , 40-200 mg). Among patients undergoing EGD , those younger than 41 years required 1.5-fold more propofol than patients 61-80 years old. The only adverse event was the transient need for supplemental oxygen supply , required by 1950 patients ( 1.3 %): 1689 undergoing EGD ( 1.4 %) and 261 undergoing colonoscopy ( 0.8 %). Patients were discharged after 60 minutes and at least 66,250 patients ( 44 %) drove themselves from the hospital. None experienced a traffic accident within 24 hours after receiving propofol sedation. Nurse-administered propofol monosedation using an age-adjusted standard protocol up to a maximal of 200 mg is safe and practical for outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopy.
