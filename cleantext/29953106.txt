  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of collagen biomaterial application during the 4-week follow-up of patients with diabetic foot syndrome<disease>. 75 patients with diabetic foot ( Wagner II ( 69.3 %) and III ( 30.7 %)) aged 30-80 years were included in the multicenter study , among them were 50.7 % with the wound<disease> unhealed for 1.5-6 months and 49.3 % over 6-48 months. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 1) standard therapy ( n = 37) , 2) the additional use of the collagen material Collost ( n = 38). Observation period was at least 4 weeks for each patient. The size of ulcers<disease> , results of general and biochemical blood tests , oximetry , microbiological testing , ultrasound of lower extremities vessels as well as a detailed medical history , social and functional status , level of cardiovascular comorbidity and ongoing therapy were estimated. Additional use of a collagen biomaterial has led to a significant reduction ulcers<disease> of all sizes from 13.5 to 2.1 cm We have proved the efficacy and safety of collagen biomaterial topical application in a diabetic foot syndrome<disease> treatment.
