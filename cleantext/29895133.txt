  We present a very rare case of an adenosquamous infiltrating breast carcinoma with sarcomatous stromal overgrowth of hypocellular collagenised type , which subsequently developed local recurrence , mistaken for a benign skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> due to bland keloid-like morphological appearance. All the histological , immunohistochemical , and clinical features must be taken into consideration when distinguishing between a benign skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> and a local recurrence of a rare subtype of breast carcinoma.
