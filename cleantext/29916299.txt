  Objective An increasing trend of uterine rupture ( UR) after laparoscopic surgery of the uterus ( LSU) has been observed. Although the overall incidence is extremely low , UR may have catastrophic outcomes. Therefore , investigation of its potential risk factors is important. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of 10 women who developed UR after LSU performed at our hospital from October 2003 to October 2016 and conducted a literature review. Results All cases of UR occurred during the third trimester of pregnancy. The surgeries contributing to UR were laparoscopic myomectomy , adhesion decomposition , and salpingectomy , resulting in unfavorable outcomes especially for the fetus. Diathermy was routinely used for hemostasis , and multilayer suturing was not adequately performed in many cases. The posterior wall was the most common site of UR in most cases. Silent rupture with unremarkable symptoms was not rare. Similar risk factors were identified in the literature review. Conclusions Excessive use of energy equipment and the lack of multilayer suturing were the most common characteristics of UR after LSU. A history of LSU should always be considered a risk factor for UR.
