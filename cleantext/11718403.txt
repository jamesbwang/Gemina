  The abdominal aorta is the most common site of an aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease>. The visceral and most proximal infrarenal segment ( aneurysm<disease> neck) are usually spared and considered more resistant to aneurysmal degeneration. However , if an abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) is left untreated , the natural history of the aortic neck is progressive dilatation and shortening. This may have significant implications for patients undergoing endovascular repair of AAAs ( EVAR) as endograft stability and integrity of the repair are dependent on an intact proximal seal<disease> zone. Compromised seal<disease> zones , caused by progressive diameter enlargement and foreshortening of the aortic neck , may lead to distal endograft migration , type Ia endoleak , aortic sac repressurization , and , ultimately , aortic rupture.
