  Ice-free vitreous cryopreservation ( vitrification) is regarded as the principal method for avoiding ice crystallization damage in cryopreserved tissues and organs. We previously established the fundamental thermodynamics of isochoric ( constant volume) systems for cryopreservation , and now extend this novel approach to vitrification in an isochoric system. This was achieved by measuring pressure changes in a 2 ml isochoric chamber containing a variety of aqueous solutions of the ubiquitous cryoprotective additives ( CPA) , dimethyl sulfoxide ( Me
