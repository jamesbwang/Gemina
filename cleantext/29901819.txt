  A new method of synthesis of peptide conjugates with aromatic moieties substituted with two sulfhydryl groups at 1,3-positions is proposed. Amphiphilic peptides derivatized in such a way under oxidative conditions spontaneously form cyclic , covalent trimers and tetramers dominated by Î±-helical conformations. The tendency to form tri- or tetrahelical bundles depends on sequences of the peptides and on the oxidation conditions , pH , and additives.
