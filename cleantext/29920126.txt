  Discuss the effectiveness of locomotor training ( LT) in children following spinal cord injury ( SCI). This intervention was assessed following an exhaustive search of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses: The PRISMA Statement as a guideline. Six databases were searched including PubMed , PEDro , CINAHL , Cochrane , PsycINFO , and Web of Knowledge in January 2016 and November 2016 , without date restrictions. Inclusion criteria were: studies in English and peer-reviewed and journal articles with a primary intervention of LT in children following SCI. Twelve articles , reporting eleven studies , were included. A systematic review assessing locomotor training in children with SCI published in April 2016 was also included. Participants were ages 15 months to 18 years old. Forms of LT included body-weight supported treadmill or over ground training , functional electrical stimulation , robotics , and virtual reality. Protocols differed in set-up and delivery mode , with improvements seen in ambulation for all 41 participants following LT. Children might benefit from LT to develop or restore ambulation following SCI. Age , completeness , and level of injury remain the most important prognostic factors to consider with this intervention. Additional benefits include improved bowel/ bladder management and control , bone density , cardiovascular endurance , and overall quality of life. Looking beyond the effects LT has just on ambulation is crucial because it can offer benefits to all children sustaining a SCI , even if restoration or development of walking is not the primary goal. Further rigorous research is required to determine the overall effectiveness of LT.
