  The increasingly complex functionality of RNA is contrasted by its simple chemical composition. RNA is generally built from only four different nucleotides ( adenine , guanine , cytosine , and uracil). To date , > 160 chemical modifications are known to decorate RNA molecules and thereby alter their function or stability. Many RNA modifications are conserved throughout bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes , while some are unique to each branch of life. Most known modifications occur at internal positions , while there is limited diversity at the termini. The dynamic nature of RNA modifications and newly discovered regulatory functions of some of these RNA modifications gave birth to a new field , now often referred to as `` epitranscriptomics. '' This review highlights the major developments in this field and summarizes detection principles for internal as well as 5 '- terminal mRNA modifications in prokaryotes and archaea to investigate their biological significance.
