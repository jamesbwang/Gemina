  3 The database of the senior author ( J.D.W.) was reviewed. A total of 126 hip replacements performed in 108 patients ( average age 39.6 years) with an average follow-up of 12.1 years ( 10-16 years) was identified. Clinical notes and plain radiographs were reviewed. To measure function , patients were contacted and an Oxford Hip Questionnaire was completed. Patients were also directly questioned about the presence of squeaking or any other sounds<symptom> from the hip. Radiographs were evaluated for signs of wear , osteolysis , loosening and heterotopic ossification. The abduction angle of the acetabular component was measured. The average Oxford Hip Score was 39.8 out of 48. Survivorship at 10 years was 94.6 % ( 95 % CI) with revision for any cause as the endpoint. There was 1 femoral head fracture , no osteolysis , no squeaking and no detectable wear. The good clinical and radiographic results for this series of patients are similar to other recent long-term studies looking at 3
