  Selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs) target estrogen receptors ( ERs) to treat breast cancer and osteoporosis. Several SERMs exhibit anti-cancer activity not related to ERs. To discover novel anti-cancer drugs acting via ER-independent mechanisms , derivatives of the SERM tamoxifen , known as the `` ridaifen '' compounds , have been developed that exhibit reduced or no ER affinity , while maintaining cytotoxicity. Tamoxifen and other SERMs bind to cannabinoid receptors with moderate affinity. Therefore , ER-independent effects of SERMs might be mediated via cannabinoid receptors. This study determined whether RID-B , a first generation ridaifen compound , exhibits affinity and/or activity at CB
