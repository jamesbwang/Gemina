  We report a multi-step synthetic method to obtain ultrathin silver nanowires ( Ag NWs) from an aqueous solution with a âˆ¼ 17 nm diameter average , and where some of them decreased down to 9 nm. Carefully designed seed screening processes including LED irradiation at high temperature for a short time , and then continuous H2O2 etching , and relative growth mechanisms of high-yield five-twinned pentagonal seeds and ultrathin Ag NWs in aqueous environment are detailed. Then , a rapid and simple multiphase interfacial assembly method particularly suitable for the separation of ultrathin Ag NWs from various by-products was demonstrated with a clear mechanism explanation. Next , a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs , as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film , was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100 % transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics , high-clarity displays , visible transparent heaters , photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.
