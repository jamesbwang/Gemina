  It has been demonstrated previously that induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC)- derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have immunosuppressive effects on activated T cells. However , the effects of iPSC-MSCs on quiescent T cells are still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the immunomodulatory role of iPSC-MSCs on resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) from allergic rhinitis ( AR) patients. PBMCs were cocultured with iPSC-MSCs without any stimulation , following which lymphocyte<symptom> proliferation , activation of T cells , T iPSC-MSCs promoted the proliferation of resting lymphocytes , activated CD4 iPSC-MSCs activate quiescent T cells and elevate regulatory T-cell response in AR patients , suggesting different immunomodulatory functions of iPSC-MSCs according to the phases of diseases. Therefore , iPSC-MSCs are a potential therapeutic candidate for treating allergic airway
