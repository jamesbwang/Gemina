  The imaging application Auto Beam Hold ( ABH) allows for the online analysis of 2-dimensional kV images acquired during treatment. ABH can automatically detect fiducial markers and initiate a beam interrupt. In this study , we investigate the practical use and results of this intrafraction monitoring tool for patients with prostate cancer who have implanted gold seeds treated with a RapidArc technique. A total of 105 patients were included. For setup , the seeds were lined up using 2 orthogonal 2-dimensional kV images. After the setup procedure , ABH was applied at an interval of 3 seconds. The software requires a maximum-allowed deviation to be defined for each seed , which is referred to as a deviation limit ( DL). Online , the ABH application evaluates the position of the seeds and indicates for each seed whether or not it exceeds the DL. Patients were divided in 3 groups. For the first group ABH was used with the DL at 6 mm , which corresponds to the planning target volume ( PTV) margin. For the second group , the DL was set at 5 mm with an unchanged PTV margin of 6 mm. For the third group , the PTV margin was reduced to 5 mm with a DL of 5 mm. Offline , we performed an analysis of the number of beam stops and resulting re-setups. ABH initiated a beam interrupt 223 times ( 13 %) during a total of 1736 sessions. By decreasing the DL from 6 mm to 5 mm , the amount of workload for re-setups increased from 6 % ( group 1) to 14 % ( groups 2 and 3). Re-setup , 3-dimensional shifts larger than the PTV margin were found in 44 % , 35 % , and 45 % for groups 1,2 , and 3 , respectively. Intrafraction imaging of prostate position during treatment using automatic detection of implanted gold seeds was successfully implemented. PTV margins were safely reduced from 6 mm to 5 mm without a substantial increase in workload.
