  Follistatin like-1 ( Fstl1) is a secreted glycoprotein and can be up-regulated by TGF-β1. To better study the function of Fstl1 in lung development , we examined Fstl1 expression in the developing lung , in a cell type specific manner , using a tamoxifen inducible Fstl1-reporter mouse strain. Our results show that Fstl1 is ubiquitously expressed at saccular stage in the developing lung. At E18 .5 , Fstl1 expression is robust in most type of mesenchymal cells , including airway smooth muscle cells surrounding airways , vascular smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells , and vascular pericytes from blood vessel , but not PDGFRα
