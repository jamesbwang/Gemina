  In this study , a simple , rapid and effective in-syringe micro-solid phase extraction ( MSPE) method was developed for the separation and preconcetration of parabens ( methyl , ethyl , propyl and butyl paraben) in environmental water samples. The parabens were determined and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography and a photo diode array detector ( HPLC-PDA). Chitosan-coated activated carbon ( CAC) was used as the sorbent in the in-syringe MSPE device. A response surface methodology based on central composite design was used for the optimization of factors ( eluent solvent type , eluent volume , number of elution cycles , sample volume , sample pH) affecting the extraction efficiency of the preconcentration procedure. The adsorbent used displayed excellent absorption performance and the adsorption capacity ranged from 227 ‚Åª 256 mg g
