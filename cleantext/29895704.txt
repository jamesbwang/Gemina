  This study describes and analyses compliance with tobacco product graphic health warning ( GHW) legislation introduced in Bangladesh in March 2016. A survey based on a structured questionnaire was conducted in April 2016 ( immediately following the law coming into force) , and 8 months later in November 2016 , in eight divisional cities in Bangladesh. Five stores from three categories of retailers of combustible and smokeless tobacco products were surveyed , providing a total of 120 completed questionnaires. The study investigated a range of measures including the image and text of GHW , their ratio and colour use , and prescribed rotation. Warning labels for 3312 tobacco items were assessed. In April 2016 , 75 % of tobacco products surveyed did not have GHWs. In November 2016 , 19 % were still found to not have the prescribed warnings. Even among products which did include GHW , there was significant non-compliance with the full range of requirements , in both survey periods. Compliance was highest for cigarette packets and lowest among smokeless tobacco products. In addition , awareness among tobacco retailers about the range of GHW requirements was low. Effective implementation of GHW labels in low-income and middle-income countries requires awareness-raising among key stakeholders , combined with focused monitoring and compliance strategies. This should take into account different product categories and manufacturers , as well as measures targeted at retailers.
