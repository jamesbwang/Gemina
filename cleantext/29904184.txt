  Folate , vitamin B Cases ( n = 150) were identified from all hospitals in the metropolitan areas of the Twin Cities and the Mayo Clinic , Minnesota. Controls ( n = 459) were selected randomly from the general population and were frequency matched to cases by age , sex , and race. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI) for risk of pancreatic cancer in relation to intake of nutrients considered. Dietary intake of folate was associated with a reduced pancreatic cancer risk ( OR ( 95 % CI) for quartile ( Q) 4 vs. Q1: 0.31 ( 0.12-0.78)). A composite score ( range from 2 to 8) , reflecting combined dietary intake of folate and vitamin B Dietary folate intake was associated with a reduced pancreatic cancer risk , and this association became stronger when dietary intake of folate and vitamin B
