  Immune dysregulation has been hypothesized to be important in the development and pathophysiology of compulsive disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD) , which has a high comorbid overlap with trichotillomania ( both are OC-related disorders). The role of inflammation<symptom> in the pathophysiology of trichotillomania has garnered little research to date. Individuals with trichotillomania provided saliva sample for analysis of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally , these participants were examined on a variety of demographic variables ( including body mass index ( BMI) , previously found to relate to inflammation<symptom>) along with clinical measures ( symptom severity , functioning , and comorbidity). Thirty-one participants , mean age of 24.7 ( ± 10.2) years , 27 ( 87.1 %) females were- included. The mean score on the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale was 15.7 ( ± 4.2) , reflective of moderate symptom severity. Compared to normative data , the mean inflammatory marker levels in the trichotillomania sample had the following Z scores: interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) Z = -0.26 , IL-6 Z = -0.39 , IL-8 Z = -0.32 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α Z = -0.83. Levels of inflammatory markers did not correlate significantly with BMI , depressive mood , symptom severity , or disability. The relatively low level of inflammatory saliva cytokines observed in the current study ( negative z scores versus normative data with medium effect sizes) indicates that evaluation of blood inflammatory levels in trichotillomania versus matched controls would be valuable in future work. If a hypoinflammatory state is confirmed- using blood samples , this would differentiate trichotillomania from other mental disorders ( such as OCD , schizophrenia , and depression<symptom> , which have typically been linked with high inflammatory measures in the literature , at least in some cases.
