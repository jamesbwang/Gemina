  Regulatory T cells ( Treg) are critical for maintaining self-tolerance and immune homeostasis , but their suppressive function can impede effective antitumor immune responses. FOXP3 is a transcription factor expressed in Tregs that is required for their function. However , the pathways and microenvironmental cues governing FOXP3 expression and Treg function are not completely understood. Herein , we report that YAP , a coactivator of the Hippo pathway , is highly expressed in Tregs and bolsters FOXP3 expression and Treg function
