  A power line is particularly vulnerable to wildfires in its vicinity , and various damage including line tripping can be caused by wildfires. Using remote sensing techniques , a novel model developed to assess the risk of line tripping caused by the wildfire occurrence in high-voltage power line corridors is presented. This model mainly contains the wildfire risk assessment for power line corridors and the estimation of the probability of line tripping when a wildfire occurs in power line corridors. For the wildfire risk assessment , high-resolution satellite data , Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) data , meteorological data , and digital elevation model ( DEM) data were employed to infer the natural factors. Human factors were also included to achieve good reliability. In the estimation of the probability of line tripping , vegetation characteristics , meteorological status , topographic conditions , and transmission line parameters were chosen as influencing factors. According to the above input variables and observed historical datasets , the risk levels for wildfire occurrence and line tripping were obtained with a logic regression approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed model can provide good results in predicting wildfire occurrence and line tripping for high-voltage power line corridors.
