  We experimentally characterize the structure of concentrated suspensions of cornstarch and water in response to impact. Using surface imaging and particle tracking at the boundary opposite the impactor , we observed that a visible structure and particle flow at the boundary occur with a delay after impact. We show the delay time is about the same time as the strong stress response , confirming that the strong stress response results from deformation of the dynamically jammed structure once it spans between the impactor and a solid boundary. A characterization of this strong stress response is reported in a companion paper ( Maharjan , Mukhopadhyay , Allen , Storz , and Brown , Phys. Rev. E 97 , 052602 ( 2018) 10.1103/ PhysRevE .97.052602). We observed particle flow in the outer part of the dynamically jammed region at the bottom boundary , with a net transverse displacement of up to about 5 % of the impactor displacement , indicating shear at the boundary. Direct imaging of the surface of the outer part of the dynamically jammed region reveals a change in surface structure that appears the same as the result of dilation in other cornstarch suspensions. Imaging also reveals cracks , like a brittle solid. These observations suggest the dynamically jammed structure can temporarily support stress according to an effective modulus , like a soil or dense granular material , along a network of frictional contacts between the impactor and solid boundary.
