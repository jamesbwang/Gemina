  Pharmacy schools must encourage a culture of inquiry so future pharmacists approach practice in a scholarly fashion. To develop an instrument measuring intentions to engage in various scholarly activities. Items representing scholarly activities relevant to pharmacists were developed. Exploratory factor analysis ( EFA) was used to refine the list and identify underlying factors. Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach 's alpha. Results were compared across student characteristics using unpaired t tests and 1-way analysis of variance. The initial list of 54 items was reduced to 31 after review and then administered to 381 pharmacy students ( 337 complete responses; 88 % response rate). EFA suggested 3 factors with 4 items being removed due to low factor loadings. The final Potential Involvement in Scholarly Activities ( PISA) instrument contained 27 items in 3 domains: research activities ( 13 items) , professional writing ( 9 items) , and practice evaluation/quality improvement ( 5 items). Cronbach 's alphas were â‰¥ 0.85 for the total scale and domains. PISA scores were statistically higher for first-year students and those with previous research experience or post-graduate training interests. Initial development of the PISA instrument suggested a 3-factor structure with acceptable internal consistency in this sample. Continued work is needed to examine the instrument in more diverse samples.
