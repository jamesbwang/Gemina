  Sepsis<disease> is a major health care problem , which affects millions of people around the world. Glucose metabolic reprogramming of immune cells plays a crucial role during advancement of sepsis<disease>. However , the association between glucose metabolic reprogramming and mortality in patients with sepsis<disease> is unclear. Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis. Investigating the relationship between LDH and mortality is important to understand the effect of metabolic reprogramming on prognosis of patients with sepsis<disease>. A total of 192 patients with sepsis<disease> were included in our study. Data on characteristics of patients , biochemical variables , and inflammatory mediator were collected. Association between the level of serum LDH and 28-day mortality was also analyzed. The correlations between serum LDH , interleukin-1β , creatinine , PaO There were statistic difference in 28-day mortality between elevated LDH group and normal LDH group ( P = 0.021). Level of serum LDH was an independent risk factor for death of patients with sepsis<disease> ( hazard ratio 1.005 , 95 % confidence interval 1.002-1.007 , P = 0.001). There were significant correlations between LDH , interleukin-1β ( r = 0.514 , P = 0.000) , creatinine ( r = 0.368 , P = 0.000) , PaO Serum LDH is probably associated with 28-day mortality in patients with
