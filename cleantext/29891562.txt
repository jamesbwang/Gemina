  Single-molecule fluorescence methods have illuminated the dynamics of the translational machinery. Structural and bulk biochemical experiments have provided detailed atomic and global mechanistic views of translation , respectively. Single-molecule studies of translation have bridged these views by temporally connecting the conformational and compositional states defined from structural data within the mechanistic framework of translation produced from biochemical studies. Here , we discuss the context for applying different single-molecule fluorescence experiments , and present recent applications to studying prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation. We underscore the power of observing single translating ribosomes to delineate and sort complex mechanistic pathways during initiation and elongation , and discuss future applications of current and improved technologies.
