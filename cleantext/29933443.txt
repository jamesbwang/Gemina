  National initiatives have encouraged oral health training for family physicians and other nondental providers for almost 2 decades. Our national survey assesses progress of family medicine residency programs on this important health topic since our last survey in 2011. Family medicine residency program directors ( PDs) completed an online survey covering various themes including number of hours of oral health ( OH) teaching , topics covered , barriers , evaluation , positive influences , and program demographics. Compared to 2011 , more PDs feel OH should be addressed by physicians ( 86 % in 2017 vs 79 % in 2011) , yet fewer programs are teaching OH ( 81 % vs 96 %) with fewer hours overall ( 31 % vs 45 % with 4 or more hours). Satisfaction with the competence of graduating residents in OH significantly decreased ( 17 % in 2017 vs 32 % in 2011). Program directors who report graduates being well prepared to answer board questions on oral health topics are more likely to have an oral health champion ( P < 0.001) and report satisfaction with the graduates ' level of oral health competency ( P < 0.001). Programs with an oral health champion , or having a relationship with a state or national oral health coalition , or having routine teaching from a dental professional are significantly more likely to have more hours of oral health curriculum ( P < 0.001). Family medicine PDs are more aware of the importance of oral health , yet less oral health is being taught in residency programs. Developing more faculty oral health champions and connecting programs to dental faculty and coalitions may help reduce this educational void.
