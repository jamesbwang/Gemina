  Information that is the most salient and important for future use is preferentially preserved through active processing during sleep. Emotional salience is a biologically adaptive cue that influences episodic memory processing through interactions between amygdalar and hippocampal activity. However , other cues that influence the importance of information , such as the explicit direction to remember or forget , interact with the inherent salience of information to determine its fate in memory. It is unknown how sleep-based processes selectively consolidate this complex information. The current study examined the development of memory for emotional and neutral information that was either cued to-be-remembered ( TBR) or to-be-forgotten ( TBF) across a daytime period including either napping or wakefulness. Baseline memory revealed dominance of the TBR cue , regardless of emotional salience. As anticipated , napping was found to preserve memory overall significantly better than remaining awake. Furthermore , we observed a trending interaction indicating that napping specifically enhanced the discrimination between the most salient information ( negative TBR items) over other information. We found that memory for negative items was positively associated with the percentage of SWS obtained during a nap. Furthermore , the magnitude of the difference in memory between negative TBR items and negative TBF items increased with greater sleep spindle activity. Taken together , our results suggest that although the cue to actively remember or intentionally forget initially wins out , active processes during sleep facilitate the competition between salience cues to promote the most salient information in memory.
