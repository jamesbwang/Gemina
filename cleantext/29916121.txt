  To compare visual dysfunction between very preterm-born ( VPB) children with no retinopathy of prematurity ( no-ROP) at 6-10 years of age and age- and sex-matched full-term-born controls. This is an observational , prospective study that included 30 children , 6-10 years of age , born ≤ 32 weeks of gestation , with no-ROP , and 30 age- and sex-matched full-term-born controls , conducted from January 2015 until August 2015. All children underwent complete ophthalmic evaluation. Main outcome measures include visual functions ( best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , color<symptom> vision<symptom> , and stereoacuity) , ocular alignment , refractive errors , and the presence of amblyopia and nystagmus<symptom>. Mean BCVA of the right eyes was 0.04 ± 0.08 logMAR for VPB children and 0.02 ± 0.05 logMAR for the full-term children ( P = 0.075). Mean BCVA for the left eyes was 0.07 ± 0.09 logMAR for VPB children and 0.02 ± 0.05 logMAR for the full-term children ( P = 0.014). Refractive errors were slightly higher though not statistically significant in VPB children compared to full-term children ( P = 0.125). The incidence of myopia and hypermetropia was 16.7 and 40 % , respectively , in VPB children and 10 and 23.3 % , respectively , in full-term children. Anisometropia found only in VPB children with an incidence of 16.7 %. Amblyopia found in 10 % of VPB children compared to 3.3 % in full-term children. Strabismus was found equally in 10 % of each group. VPB children with no-ROP are at an increased risk of developing decreased BCVA at least in one eye and anisometropia compared to age-matched full-term controls.
