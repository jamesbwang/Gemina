  Up to 60 % of patients decline routine HIV<pathogen> testing offer in US emergency departments ( EDs). The objective of this study is to determine whether the provision of HIV<pathogen> self-testing ( HIVST) kit would increase engagement of HIV<pathogen> testing among these HIV<pathogen> test ` Decliners '. Patients who declined a test offered in an ED-based triage nurse-driven HIV<pathogen> screening programme were enrolled and randomised to either the HIVST or the control group. The patients in the HIVST group received HIVST kits to take home , were encouraged to report test results to an established internet-based STI/HIV testing recruitment website ` I Want the Kit ' ( IWTK) and received five referral cards for their peers to request HIVST kits from IWTK. The control group received pamphlets about publicly available HIV<pathogen> testing sites. HIV<pathogen> testing from both groups after enrolment was determined via telephone follow-up at 1 month. Testing rate ratio ( RR) was determined using Ï‡ Fifty-two patients were randomised to the HIVST group and 48 to the control group. Among all 64 patients completing any follow-up , 14/29 ( 48 %) patients in the HIVST group tested themselves at home with the provided kit. Four of these had never had an HIV<pathogen> test. Only 2/35 ( 6 %) in the control group reported having an HIV<pathogen> test after enrolment ( RR: 8.45 ( 95 % CI: 2.09 to 34.17)). 57 % ( 8/14) in the HIVST group reported test results to IWTK. Provision of HIVST kits supplements ED-based screening programme and significantly improved engagement of HIV<pathogen> testing among those test ` Decliners ' in the ED. NCT03021005 , results.
