  Because rotavirus<pathogen> ( RV) and norovirus<pathogen> ( NoV) are transmitted through the fecal-oral route , tonsils due to their location within the oropharynx may sample or become infected with these viruses. We investigated if RV and NoV RNA/antigen , or virus-specific memory/plasma B cells can be detected in the tonsils. While neither RV/NoV antigen , nor genomic RNA was detected , 90 % ( 27/30) of tonsils tested had RV- and NoV-specific IgG memory B cells. However , the mechanism explaining how these cells get there ( whether because of local induction or homing after induction at other sites) and the role these cells might play during active infection is not yet clear.
