  Several phytoseiid species can potentially control the citrus rust mite ( CRM). Their effectiveness varies , however , as do their intraguild interactions. Under laboratory conditions , Euseius stipulatus , E. scutalis and Iphiseius degenerans preyed effectively on CRM , whereas Amblyseius swirskii and Typhlodromus athiasae had no effect on CRM. In combination with A. swirskii , Euseius numbers were reduced due to intraguild predation , and consequently CRM suppression was less effective. In the field , predatory mite species can be variably provisioned by windborne pollen released from cover crops such as Rhodes Grass ( RG). We aimed to determine the effects of RG on the phytoseiid community in two field experiments , on different cultivars ( pomelo and Shamouti orange). We also tested these communities for negative interspecific abundance relationships that are expected if their respective laboratory-observed intraguild interactions are manifested in the field. Overall , on pomelo , we observed a dominance of A. swirskii , relatively low E. stipulatus and high CRM abundances. Amblyseius swirskii and E. stipulatus abundances were both elevated near RG , despite apparent intraguild predation by A. swirskii. Conversely , T. athiasae abundances were lower near RG , likely due to predation by A. swirskii. On Shamouti , E. stipulatus abundances were much higher than on pomelo and were not negatively related to A. swirskii abundances. There , RG increased E. stipulatus abundance , and CRM was reduced. RG cover cropping can enhance CRM control , depending on variation in intraguild interactions among phytoseiids , particularly between A. swirskii and E. stipulatus. These may be modulated by climatic and/or cultivar effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
