  This study examines whether nonverbal displays of parents ' warmth during an in-lab conflict discussion mitigate the links between affiliation with deviant peers and risky behaviors. A sample of 107 youth and their parents participated in a study spanning from mid-adolescence ( T1) to late adolescence ( T2). At T1 , family members discussed a contentious issue , which was coded for parents ' nonverbal warmth. At T1 and T2 , youth reported on their friends ' and their own risky behaviors. Fathers ' warmth moderated each prospective association between deviant peers and risky behaviors. Mothers ' warmth did not emerge as a significant moderator. Girls , in particular , benefitted from fathers ' warmth as a buffer in the trajectory from T1 risky behaviors to T2 risky behaviors and deviant peers.
