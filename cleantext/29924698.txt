  There is a growing interest in soft actuators for human-friendly robotic applications. However , it is very challenging for conventional soft actuators to achieve both a large working distance and high force. To address this problem , we present a high-contraction ratio pneumatic artificial muscle ( HCRPAM) , which has a novel actuation concept. The HCRPAM can contract substantially while generating a large force suitable for a wide range of robotic applications. Our proposed prototyping method allows for an easy and quick fabrication , considering various design variables. We derived a mathematical model using a virtual work principle , and validated the model experimentally. We conducted simulations for the design optimization using this model. Our experimental results show that the HCRPAM has a 183.3 % larger contraction ratio and 37.1 % higher force output than the conventional pneumatic artificial muscle ( McKibben muscle). Furthermore , the actuator has a compatible position tracking performance of 1.0 Hz and relatively low hysteresis error of 4.8 %. Finally , we discussed the controllable bending characteristics of the HCRPAM , which uses heterogeneous materials and has an asymmetrical structure to make it comfortable for a human to wear.
