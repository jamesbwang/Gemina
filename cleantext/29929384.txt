  The use of quantitative self-report methods for assessing the stress associated with dementia caregiving , especially among minority groups , has been lately criticized. The aim of this study was to examine whether Human Figures Drawings might provide a tool for assessing caregivers ' burden. Sixty Israeli Arabs- 30 family caregivers of a person with dementia and 30 gender and age-matched non-caregivers- were asked to draw a caregiver of an elderly person with dementia and a caregiver of an elderly person with a physical disability. While no differences were found between the drawings of caregivers and non-caregivers , statistically significant differences were found between all the characteristics of the drawings depicting a caregiver of an elderly person with dementia and a caregiver of an elderly person with a physical disability , as drawn by caregivers. Several of the drawings ' characteristics were significantly associated with caregiver burden. By introducing a nonverbal form of expression , Human Figures Drawings might add utility to the assessment of dementia caregivers ' burden.
