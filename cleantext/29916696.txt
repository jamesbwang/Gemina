  Reverse osmosis ( RO)- based desalination and advanced water purification facilities have inherent challenges associated with concentrate management and disposal. Although enhanced permeate recovery and concentrate minimization are desired , membrane scaling due to inorganic constituents , such as silica , calcium , phosphate , and iron , hinders the process. To solve this problem , a new diatom-based photobiological process has been developed to remove these scaling constituents by biological uptake and precipitation. In this study , RO concentrate samples were collected from a full-scale advanced water reclamation facility in California and were treated in 3.8 and 57 L photobioreactors inoculated with a brackish water diatom Pseudostaurosira trainorii PEWL001 using light-emitting diode bulbs or natural sunlight as a light source. The photobiological treatment removed 95 % of reactive silica and 64 % of calcium and enabled additional water recovery using a secondary RO at a recovery rate up to 66 %. This represents 95 % overall recovery , including 85 % recovery in the primary RO unit. In addition to the scaling constituents , the photobiological treatment removed 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products , as well as N-nitrosodimethylamine , from RO concentrate samples primarily via photolysis. This novel approach has a strong potential for application to brackish water desalination and advanced water purification in arid and semiarid areas.
