  Harnessing the endogenous immune system to eliminate malignant cells has long been an intriguing approach. After considerable success in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> , chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR)- modified T cells have entered early clinical evaluation in the field of multiple myeloma ( MM). The choice of suitable non-CD19 target antigens is challenging and a variety of myeloma-associated surface molecules have been under preclinical investigation. Most recent clinical protocols have focused on targeting B-cell maturation antigen ( BCMA) , and early results are promising. The trials differ in receptor constructs , patient selection , dosing strategies and conditioning chemotherapy and will thus pave the way to eventually define the optimal parameters. Other sources for autologous T-cell therapy of MM include affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor-modified cells and marrow infiltrating lymphocytes. In summary , adoptive T-cell transfer for the treatment of MM is still in its infancy , but if early response rates indicate durability , will be a paradigm changing therapeutic modality for the treatment of MM.
