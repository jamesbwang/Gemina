  The rise in multidrug resistant Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> poses a threat to healthcare , while the development of an effective vaccine has remained elusive due to antigenic and phase variability of surface-expressed proteins. In the current study , we identified a fully conserved surface expressed protein and characterized its suitability as a vaccine antigen. An in silico approach was used to predict surface-expressed proteins and analyze sequence conservation and phase variability. The most conserved protein and its surface-exposed Loop 2 , which was displayed as both a structural and linear epitope on the oligomerization domain of C4b binding protein , were used to immunize mice. Immunogenicity was subsequently analyzed by determination of antibody titers and serum bactericidal activity. MtrE was identified as one of the most conserved surface-expressed proteins. Furthermore , MtrE and both Loop 2-containing fusion proteins elicited high protein-specific antibody titers and particularly the two Loop 2 fusion proteins showed high anti-Loop 2 titers. In addition , antibodies raised against all three proteins were able to recognize MtrE expressed on the surface of N.<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> and showed high MtrE-dependent bactericidal activity. Our results show that MtrE and Loop 2 are promising novel conserved surface-expressed antigens for vaccine development against
