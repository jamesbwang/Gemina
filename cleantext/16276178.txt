  Sepsis<disease> is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It remains a highly lethal condition in which current tools for early diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making are far from ideal. Extracellular vesicles ( EVs) , 30 nm to several micrometers in size , are released from cells upon activation and apoptosis and express membrane epitopes specific for their parental cells. Since their discovery two decades ago , their role as biomarkers and mediators in various diseases has been intensively studied. However , their potential importance in the sepsis<disease> syndrome<disease> has gained attention only recently. Sepsis<disease> and EVs are both complex fields in which standardization has long been overdue. In this review , several topics are discussed. First , we review current studies on EVs in septic patients with emphasis on their variable quality and clinical utility. Second , we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs as well as their role as facilitators of cell communication via micro RNA and the relevance of micro-organism-derived EVs. Third , we give an overview over the potential beneficial but also detrimental roles of EVs in sepsis<disease>. Finally , we focus on the role of EVs in selected intensive care scenarios such as coagulopathy , mechanical ventilation and blood transfusion. Overall , the prospect for EV use in septic patients is bright , ranging from rapid and precise ( point-of-care) diagnostics , prevention of harmful iatrogenic interventions , to using EVs as guides of individualized therapy. Before the above is achieved , however , the EV research field requires reliable standardization of the current methods and development of new analytical procedures that can close the existing technological gaps.
