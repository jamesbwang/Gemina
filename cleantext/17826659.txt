  Inflammation<symptom> has been suggested to play an important role in onset and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa). Histological analysis of prostatectomy specimens has revealed focal inflammation<symptom> in early stage lesions<symptom> of this malignancy. We addressed the role of inflammatory stimuli in the release of PCa-specific , tumor-derived soluble factors ( PCa-TDSFs) already reported to be mediators of PCa morbidity , such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO) and interleukin ( IL) -6. Inflammation-driven production and functions of PCa-TDFSs were tested ''
