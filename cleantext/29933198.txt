  Adolescents who have experienced maltreatment face many developmental and educational challenges compared with their non-maltreated peers. Research demonstrates the importance of social relationships in academic achievement among non-maltreated youth , and suggests the influence of parent and peer relationships for academic success in maltreated youth as well , including the potential benefit of school engagement. Data for the study comes from the first wave of the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being ( NSCAW II) , a nationally-representative sample of children involved in Child Protective Services in the United States. The study finds that maltreated adolescents ' perceptions of relationship quality with both parents and peers significantly predict academic achievement. In addition , results demonstrate a mediating effect of school engagement between parent and peer variables and some academic achievement outcomes.
