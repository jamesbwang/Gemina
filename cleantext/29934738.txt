  Post-traumatic cyst-like lesions<symptom> are an infrequent complication of fractures in children. To our knowledge , no more than 30 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. They most commonly affect the distal radius following a greenstick or torus fracture. These cortical defects are often asymptomatic , non-expansile , and typically resolve spontaneously in 1-3 years. They appear proximal to the compression site and are usually identified 2-4 months after a minor fracture. These lesions<symptom> have a distinct appearance on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , with intralesional fatty marrow , which may help to differentiate it from other bone lesions<symptom>. We review the literature and present 3 more cases studied with plain radiographs , computed tomography ( CT) , and MRI. Post-traumatic cyst-like lesions<symptom> require no treatment , and therefore recognition of its typical features is crucial to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures.
