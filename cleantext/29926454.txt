  Capture-SELEX is an effective molecular strategy enabling the discovery of structure-switching aptamers , which might find useful application in molecular detection or separation. We here provide a protocol to perform capture-SELEX for DNA aptamers binding soluble small molecules , which includes a straightforward functional validation by SPR. The SELEX strategy here described is adaptable to any water-soluble molecular target and might foster the development of DNA aptamers binding therapeutic small molecules , at the great advantage of clinical bioanalytics.
