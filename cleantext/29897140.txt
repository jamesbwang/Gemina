  Elevated serum procalcitonin ( PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections , but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease> ( SJS)/ toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections ( systemic infected group) , with skin surface bacterial infections ( skin surface infected group) and without infections ( non-infected group) , to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein ( CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver-operator curve ( ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups ( P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy , with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6 % and 89.7 % , respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.
