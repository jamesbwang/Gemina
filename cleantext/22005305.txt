  We aimed to assess the utility of serum level IL-13Rα2 receptors as a non-invasive marker for early diagnosis of biliary atresia ( BA) and selection of BA patients indicated for Kasai portoenterostomy. The study included 60 infants with neonatal cholestasis in three groups; early BA group ( The mean value of IL-13Rα2 was significantly higher in delayed BA group ( 11.05 ± 10.9 ng/ml) compared to early BA ( 0.34 ± 0.37 ng/ml) , non-BA ( 0.54 ± 0.85 ng/ml) and control ( 0.24-0.2 ng/ml) groups. The levels of serum IL-13Rα2 increase with the severity of the degree of fibrosis<disease>. IL-13Rα2 at a cutoff level > 0.782 ng/ml could predict late fibrosis<disease> with accuracy of 77.55 % ( Serum IL-13Rα2 not a diagnostic marker for BA however it could be used as a noninvasive marker for detection of advanced liver fibrosis<disease> and presence of disturbed liver architecture that helps in patient selection for undergoing Kasai operation. Serum IL-13Rα2 could be a future therapeutic target for management of BA patients and any fibrotic liver disease.
