  Darunavir ( DRV) was the last approved protease inhibitor ( PI) and has been extensively used for the treatment of HIV<pathogen> in both naïve and experienced subjects due to its high genetic barrier and efficacy. The introduction in clinical practice of integrase strand transfer inhibitors limited its role in the management of naïve subjects and in antiretroviral treatment simplification strategies. However , recent data from trials that have investigated the new DRV/cobicistat/emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide ( D/C/F/ TAF) combination showed an excellent efficacy and tolerability of this coformulation both in naïve patients and in those with viral suppression , making D/C/F/ TAF a new option for the treatment of HIV<pathogen> infection. Areas covered: The authors present and discuss the efficacy and safety data of DRV when used in antiretroviral-naïve , multiexperienced subjects and in the setting of treatment deintensification in subjects with viral suppression. Moreover , the authors evaluate the recent data from two different Phase III trials on D/C/F/ TAF both in treatment-naïve and virologically suppressed subjects. Expert opinion: Although novel antiretroviral drugs may become available over time , DRV continues to represent a valuable option for multiexperienced subjects and has a role in simplification regimens. In addition , the convenience of D/C/F/ TAF coformulation may be useful for the future management of HIV-infected subjects.
