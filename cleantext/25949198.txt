  In aquaculture , cultured fish often undergo continuous cross-fertilization without any inflow of new broodstock. This lowers genetic diversity , leading to increased disease rates and decreased survival rates. To improve the mass production and easy culture of Israeli carp , it is essential to investigate the population structure and genetic diversity of these fish. However , such a survey has not yet been performed on Korean Israeli carp. In this study , we used seven microsatellite markers to analyze the genetic diversity and association of cultured Israeli carp from Korea and China. The average numbers of alleles per locus ( N
