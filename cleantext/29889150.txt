  Lacrosse is a fast-paced game that incorporates elements from multiple sports , such as soccer , basketball , baseball , tennis , and hockey. The sport involves rapid changes of direction , endurance , sprinting , physical contact , rotational movement , passing , and shooting. Passing and shooting are further complicated by having a weighted object ( ball) at the end of a long moment arm ( crosse<disease>) which places increased stress on the body segments. Thus , it is important to properly prepare for sport participation by improving strength , endurance , and dynamic stability of the postural and core stability muscles. Because high mechanical loads are experienced during play , ( re) establishment of symmetric strength and flexibility is essential for rehabilitation and injury prevention. This article will focus on the musculoskeletal demands placed on the body in lacrosse , the importance of core strength and dynamic stability to prevent injury , and the elements of both prehabilitation and rehabilitation programs to properly prepare the athlete for participation.
