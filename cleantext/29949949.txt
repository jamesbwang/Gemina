  Oxidative stress ( OS) is an indispensable condition to ensure genomic instability in cancer cells. In breast cancer ( BC) , redox alterations have been widely characterized , but since this process results from a chain of inflammatory events , the causal molecular triggers remain to be identified. In this context , we used a microarray approach to investigate the role of the main pro-oxidant transcription factor , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) , in gene profiles of BC subtypes. Our results showed that NF-κB knockdown in distinct BC subtypes led to differential expression of relevant factors involved in glutathione metabolism , prostaglandins , cytochrome P450 and cyclooxygenase , suggesting a relationship between the redox balance<symptom> and NF-κB in such cells. In addition , we performed biochemical analyses to validate the microarray dataset focusing on OS and correlated these parameters with normal expression or NF-κB inhibition. Our data showed a distinct oxidative status pattern for each of the three studied BC subtype models , consistent with the intrinsic characteristics of each BC subtype. Thus , our findings suggest that NF-κB may represent an additional mechanism related to OS maintenance in BC , operating in various forms to mediate other important predominant signaling components of each BC subtype.
