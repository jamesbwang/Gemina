  To measure the quality of life and clinical outcomes of patients treated with interosseous membrane ( IOM) ligament reconstruction of the forearm , using the brachioradialis ( BR) , and describe a new surgical technique for the treatment of joint<symptom> instability<symptom> of the distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ). From January 2013 to September 2016 , 24 patients with longitudinal injury of the distal radioulnar joint DRUJ were submitted to surgical treatment with a reconstruction procedure of the distal portion of the interosseous membrane or distal oblique band ( DOB). The clinical-functional and radiographic parameters were analyzed and complications and time of return to work were described. The follow-up time was 20 months ( 6-36). The ROM averaged 167.92 Â° ( 93.29 % of the normal side). VAS was 2/10 ( 1-6). DASH was 5.63/ 100 ( 1-18). The time to return to work was 7.37 months ( 3-12). As to complications , one patient had an unstable DRUJ , and was submitted to a new reconstruction by the Brian-Adams technique months. Currently , he has evolved with improved function , and has returned to his professional activities. Three other patients developed problems around the transverse K-wire and were treated with its removal , all of whom are doing well. The new approach presented in this study is safe and effective in the treatment of longitudinal instability of the DRUJ , since it has low rate of complications , as well as satisfactory radiographic , clinical , and functional results. It allows return to social and professional activities , and increases the quality of life of these patients.
