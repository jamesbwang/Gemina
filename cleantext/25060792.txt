  The Mediterranean diet has been long associated with improved cardiovascular prognosis , chemoprevention , and lower incidence of neurodegeneration. Of the multiple components of this diet , olive oil stands out because its use has historically been limited to the Mediterranean basin. The health benefits of olive oil and some of its components are being rapidly decoded. In this paper we review the most recent pharma-nutritional investigations on olive oil biophenols and their health effects , chiefly focusing on recent findings that elucidate their molecular mechanisms of action.
