  Extracellular vesicles ( EV 's) are membrane surrounded structures released by different cell types and are emerging as potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets in cancer. In the present study , plasma samples derived from 7 patients with metastatic and non-metastatic ER + ( estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer ( BC) were collected and their respective ( EVs) isolated and the protein content analyzed by mass spectrometry and FunRich analysis. Here we report on the presence of two putative plasma EV biomarkers ( which were absent in healthy controls samples) that could be used to detect early ER + breast cancer and for those with lymph node ( LN) involvement However , given the preliminar nature of the work , further investigation in a larger patient cohort is warranted to corroborate these findings. If confirmed , these biomarkers could be incorporated into simple blood test kit for the early detection of those with ER + breast cancer and lymph node involvement.
