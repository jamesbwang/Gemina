  Sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids can regulate cell recognition and signalling. Ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate are major players in the sphingolipid pathways and are involved in the initiation and regulation of signalling , apoptosis , stress responses and infection. Specific chemically synthesised sphingolipid derivatives containing small functionalities like azide or alkyne can mimic the biological properties of natural lipid species , which turns them into useful tools for the investigation of the highly complex sphingolipid metabolism by rapid and selective ` click chemistry ' using sensitive tags like fluorophores. Subsequent analysis by various fluorescence microscopy techniques or mass spectrometry allows the identification and quantification of the corresponding sphingolipid metabolites as well as the research of associated enzymes. Here we present an overview of recent advances in the synthesis of ceramide and sphingosine analogues for bioorthogonal click reactions to study biosynthetic pathways and localization of sphingolipids for the development of novel therapeutics against lipid-dependent diseases.
