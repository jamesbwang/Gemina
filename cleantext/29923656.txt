  The first example of highly enantioselective intramolecular hydroarylation of allyl aryl ethers was realized by palladium-catalyzed reductive heck reactions utilizing a new chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand ( N-Me-XuPhos). N-Me-XuPhos can be easily prepared on gram scale from readily available starting materials in a one-pot synthesis approach. A series of optically active 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans bearing a quaternary stereocenter were obtained in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The practicality of this reaction was validated in the straightforward synthesis of CB2 receptor agonists. Moreover , deuterium was efficiently incorporated into the products.
