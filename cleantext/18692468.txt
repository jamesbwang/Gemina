  The stress-responsive genes of Sestrin family are recognized as new tumor suppressor genes in breast carcinoma , however , the function of Sestrin family in human prostate cancer is not clear. Ionizing radiation ( IR) is known to induce Sestrin gene expression in breast cancer cells. However , the response of Sestrin to IR has not been reported in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Sestrin2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines ( PC3 , LNCaP clone FGC , and DU145) was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR. Cell counting kit ( CCK-8) was used to detect cellular proliferation. The radiosensitivity of PC3 cells was detected by clonogenic assay. Sestrin2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines ( PC3 , LNCaP clone FGC , and DU145) is low. In vitro assays indicated that over-expressing Sestrin2 in human prostate cancer PC3 inhibited tumor proliferation. In addition , elevated Sestrin2 expression sensitized PC3 cells to IR. We determined Sestrin2 may function as a tumor suppressor through repressing proliferation , mediating sensitization to IR in PC3 cells.
