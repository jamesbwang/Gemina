  The cost-effectiveness of initial treatment strategies for mild-to-moderate Decision-analytic models were constructed to compare initial treatment with metronidazole , vancomycin , and fidaxomicin. The primary model included 1 recurrence , and the secondary model included up to 3 recurrences. Model variables were extracted from published literature with costs based on a healthcare system perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effective ratio ( ICER) between initial treatment strategies. In the primary model , the overall percentage of patients cured was 94.23 % , 95.19 % , and 96.53 % with metronidazole , vancomycin , and fidaxomicin , respectively. Expected costs per case were $ 1,553.01 , $ 1,306.62 , and $ 5,095.70 , respectively. In both models , vancomycin was more effective and less costly than metronidazole , resulting in negative ICERs. The ICERs for fidaxomicin compared with those for metronidazole and vancomycin in the primary model were $ 1,540.23 and $ 2,828.69 per 1 % gain in cure , respectively. Using these models , a hospital currently treating initial episodes of mild-to-moderate CDI with metronidazole could expect to save $ 246.39- $ 388.37 per case treated by using vancomycin for initial therapy. A decision-analytic model revealed vancomycin to be cost-effective , compared with metronidazole , for treatment of initial episodes of mild-to-moderate CDI in adult inpatients. From the hospital perspective , initial treatment with vancomycin resulted in a higher probability of cure and a lower probability of colectomy , recurrence , persistent recurrence , and cost per case treated , compared with metronidazole. Use of fidaxomicin was associated with an increased probability of cure compared with metronidazole and vancomycin , but at a substantially increased cost.
