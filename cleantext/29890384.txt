  This paper discusses octonion-valued neural networks ( OVNNs) with leakage delay , time-varying delays , and distributed delays , for which the states , weights , and activation functions belong to the normed division algebra of octonions. The octonion algebra is a nonassociative and noncommutative generalization of the complex and quaternion algebras , but does not belong to the category of Clifford algebras , which are associative. In order to avoid the nonassociativity of the octonion algebra and also the noncommutativity of the quaternion algebra , the Cayley-Dickson construction is used to decompose the OVNNs into 4 complex-valued systems. By using appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals , with double and triple integral terms , the free weighting matrix method , and simple and double integral Jensen inequalities , delay-dependent criteria are established for the exponential stability of the considered OVNNs. The criteria are given in terms of complex-valued linear matrix inequalities , for two types of Lipschitz conditions which are assumed to be satisfied by the octonion-valued activation functions. Finally , two numerical examples illustrate the feasibility , effectiveness , and correctness of the theoretical results.
