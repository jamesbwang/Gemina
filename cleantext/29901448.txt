  Complex<pathogen> single ventricle topography , changes in vessel geometry after surgical steps and subsequent stenoses are difficult to visualise with biplane conventional angiography ( CA). This study investigated the additional value of three-dimensional rotational angiography ( 3DRA) compared to CA for diagnostic and interventional purposes in children with univentricular hearts. Demographic data , clinical data and catheterisation details of both imaging techniques were collected retrospectively. Image quality , interventional success and additional value of 3DRA were reviewed and scored. Between January 2003 and March 2017 140 patients underwent 183 CAs and 107 3DRAs. 3DRA image quality was superior to CA with less diagnostic angiographies made ( p < 0.001). Intervention rate ( p < 0.001) and interventional success ( p = 0.03) were higher with 3DRA , while complication rates were similar. Mean radiation was lower in the 3DRA group , reaching significance pre-PCPC. 3DRA was considered of additional value in imaging of cardiovascular anatomy , collaterals , stenosis , vessel-vessel and vessel-bronchi interactions. In univentricular hearts three-dimensional rotational angiography provides superior image quality when compared to conventional angiography. Furthermore , 3DRA is performed with less diagnostic angiographies , less radiation and higher interventional success.
