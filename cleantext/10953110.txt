  Myocardial bridge is defined as the narrowing of any coronary artery segment in systole but a normal diameter in diastole. It is most frequently seen on left anterior descending ( LAD) artery. Left circumflex artery ( LCx) is very rare. A 62 year-old male patient presented with severe , squeezing chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. The electrocardiogram showed T wave inversion in V1-V4 and ST depression<symptom> in DII , DIII , aVF. Coronary angiography showed complicated lesion<symptom> on after S2 branches of LAD and myocardial bridge causing 100 % systolic narrowing of fourth obtus marginal branch of LCx. Bare metal stent was placed to LAD lesions<symptom> with no residual occlusion. The patient was discharged with beta-blocker therapy. He had no recurrent chest<symptom> pain<symptom> during six months of follow-up.
