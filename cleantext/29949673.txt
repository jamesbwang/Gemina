  Nanoengineered materials can embody distinct atomic structures which deviate from that of the bulk-grain counterpart and induce significantly modified electronic structures and physical/chemical properties. The phonon structure and thermal properties , which can also be potentially modulated by the modified atomic structure in nanostructured materials , however , are seldom investigated. Employed here is a mild approach to fabricate nanostructured PbBi
