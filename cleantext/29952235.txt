  This study was designed to assess the feasibility of using the Jaw Dynasplint System as an adjunct to conventional stretching exercises as a preventative measure against trismus in patients undergoing radiotherapy. Study participants ( n = 40) were randomized using a permuted block design to conventional stretching or stretching plus use of the Jaw Dynasplint 3 times per day for 30 minutes. Patients were instructed to record maximum interincisal opening each day as well as logging use of the Jaw Dynasplint. At 6 months after initiation of the preventative regimen , 50 % of patients in the Dynasplint arm and 75 % in the conventional stretching arm remained on their assigned therapy. Trismus was diagnosed in 2 patients in the control arm and in 4 patients in the Dynasplint arm. Only 25 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 11.1 , 46.9) of patients in the Dynasplint arm used the device as prescribed. The addition of the Jaw Dynasplint decreased compliance compared with conventional stretching. It is unlikely that the prescribed regimen will prove efficacious as a preventative measure due to low compliance.
