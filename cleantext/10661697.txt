  This is the case of a 57-year-old woman who underwent coronary-artery-bypass-grafting following a diagnosis of NSTEMI with triple-coronary-vessel-disease. During separation from cardiopulmonary-bypass she developed acute severe-right-ventricular-failure refractory to inotropic support and intra-aortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation. Therefore VA-ECMO was established in order to separate the patient from cardiopulmonary-bypass. VA-ECMO was then transitioned to RVAD support which allowed complete recovery of RV-function and subsequent explantation. The patient was eventually discharged home.
