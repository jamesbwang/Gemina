  Hyperemesis gravidarum ( HG) is characterized by severe gestational nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> , leading to dehydration<symptom> , electrolyte imbalance and nutritional deficits. HG adversely affects the health and wellbeing of the woman. However , the detrimental impact of HG on fetal brain development has not been addressed. We evaluate herein the emerging evidence suggesting that HG interferes with human brain development , and discuss putative mechanisms. Evidence emerges from prospective developmental studies in offspring exposed in utero to HG , from studies of pregnancy outcome after in utero exposure to famine , as well as evidence on specific nutritional deficiencies affecting fetal brain development.
