  While tobacco use remains the largest single cause of premature death in the industrialized countries , low-and-middle income countries are also experiencing a rising burden of the tobacco epidemic and are making various programmatic efforts to tackle the issue. Evidence-based policy making is critical to the long-term success of tobacco intervention programs and is reliant on regular monitoring of the trends and prevalence rates of tobacco use though population-based surveys , which are sparse for countries in eastern Africa. Therefore , in the present study we aimed to ( 1) estimate the trends in the prevalence of self-reported smoking status; and ( 2) explore the sociodemographic factors associated with smoking among adult men in Ethiopia and Kenya.
