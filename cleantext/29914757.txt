  Huntington 's disease ( HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. HD symptoms include severe motor , cognitive , and psychiatric impairments that result from dysfunction and later degeneration of medium-sized spiny neurons ( MSNs) in the striatum<pathogen>. A key early pathogenic mechanism is dysregulated synaptic transmission due to enhanced surface expression of juvenile NMDA-type glutamate receptors containing GluN3A subunits , which trigger the aberrant pruning of synapses formed by cortical afferents onto MSNs. Here , we tested the therapeutic potential of silencing GluN3A expression in YAC128 mice , a well-established HD model. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses encoding a short-hairpin RNA against GluN3A ( rAAV-shGluN3A) were generated , and the ability of different serotypes to transduce MSNs was compared. A single injection of rAAV9-shGluN3A into the striatum<pathogen> of 1-month-old mice drove potent ( > 90 %) and long-lasting reductions of GluN3A expression in MSNs , prevented dendritic spine loss and improved motor performance in YAC128 mice. Later delivery , when spine pathology is already apparent , was also effective. Our data provide proof-of-concept for GluN3A silencing as a beneficial strategy to prevent or reverse corticostriatal disconnectivity and motor impairment in HD and support the use of RNAi-based or small-molecule approaches for harnessing this therapeutic potential.
