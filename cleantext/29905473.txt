  Infrared nonlinear optical ( IR NLO) crystals are the major materials to widen the output range of solid-state lasers to mid- or far-infrared regions. The IR NLO crystals used in the middle IR region are still inadequate for high-power laser applications because of deleterious thermal effects ( lensing and expansion) , low laser-induced damage threshold , and two-photon absorption. Herein , the unbiased global minimum search method was used for the first time to search for IR NLO optical materials and ultimately found a new IR NLO material NaGaS
