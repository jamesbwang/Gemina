  Immigrants from South Asia have higher risks of mental health problems. Low levels of acculturation and self-efficacy may be risk factors for depression<symptom> and psychological distress in immigrants. 355 Pakistani immigrant women in Oslo , filled out a questionnaire concerning demographic variables , self-efficacy , and psychological distress. A bidimensional acculturation variable was constructed. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to investigate the importance of the level of acculturation and self-efficacy on psychological distress. Low levels of acculturation were reported. Integrated participants reported significantly less psychological distress on the depression<symptom> score and total score than separated and marginalized participants. The model showed that assimilated or marginalized participants had a fourth and three times higher risk of high levels of distress compared with integrated participants. The possibility to be bicultural seems important in order to ensure mental health and national policies should promote an integrative and multiculturalism approach.
