  An electrochemical Hofmann rearrangement is reported. With the mediation of NaBr , highly corrosive and toxic halogens are avoided. Moreover , this efficient and green approach is well compatible with a broad range of amides , including several commercial medicine derivatives , and provides direct access to synthetically useful carbamates. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated by the preparation of
