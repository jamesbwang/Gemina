  The biomedical applications of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) have experienced rapid growth in recent years , due to their expected benefits in medical imaging and therapy. In this work , we report the development of a theranostic nanocomplex constructed from alginate hydrogel co-loaded with cisplatin and AuNPs ( abbreviated as ACA) for simultaneous drug delivery and computed tomography imaging. CT26 cells derived from mouse colon adenocarcinoma were exposed to various concentrations of ACA nanocomplex ( for 24 h) and the cytotoxicity was measured using MTT assay. Moreover , the cells treated with ACA nanocomplex were imaged in a computed tomography scanner and the contrast enhancement due to the presence of nanocomplex was assessed. The cytotoxicity results showed that ACA nanocomplex had a more potent chemotherapy efficacy than free cisplatin , so that ACA nanocomplex at the concentration of 5 µg/ml ( per cisplatin) and 20 µg/ml of free cisplatin resulted in the same cytotoxicity ( survival rate: 66 %). The computed tomography imaging study revealed that ACA nanocomplex increased the brightness of computed tomography images , the computed tomography number value , and contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR). ACA nanocomplex can be presented as a computed tomography-traceable nanocarrier that allows to monitor the delivery of therapeutics by assessing their localized accumulation and in vivo biodistribution.
