  The psychophysical impairment of drivers caused by psychoactive substances is still a common and important factor in road accidents. While in the case of ethyl alcohol the initial detection of drivers who have consumed alcohol is not a problem due to the widespread use of breathalyzers , other psychoactive substances are a problem. These substances are a group of numerous , variously acting and regularly growing compounds. In this publication , the authors have reviewed the methods used worldwide for the initial detection of psychoactive substances , i.e. saliva testers and elements of the medical examination grouped into test kits , which can be used as part of routine police control , and have also assessed their usefulness. New methods of detection based on the evaluation of pupils and eyeball mobility , which are still in the process of improvement , were also discussed.
