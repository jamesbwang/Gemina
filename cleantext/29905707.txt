  We present numerical investigation of the mechanism of surface-enhanced circular dichroism of a chiral medium near nanoantennas. Strong circular dichroism was observed from the chiral medium surrounding nanoantennas with multipolar resonant modes , and the strong circular dichroism was more correlated to the multipolar resonances than to nearfield enhancement or optical helicity enhancement. According to this observation , we suggest multipolar radiative coupling between the nanoantennas and chiral medium as a possible mechanism of the strong chiral response. This work clarifies a mechanism of surface-enhanced chiral responses and would be useful for designing an enantiomeric-sensing platform and realizing devices relying on strong chirality , such as topological metamaterials for scattering-immune propagation of light and negative index metamaterials.
