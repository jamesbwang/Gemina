  The Stokes-Einstein relation ( SER) is one of the most robust and widely employed results from the theory of liquids. Yet sizable deviations can be observed for self-solvation , which can not be explained by the standard hydrodynamic derivation. Here , we revisit the work of Masters and Madden ( J. Chem. Phys. 74 , 2450-2459 ( 1981)) , who first solved a statistical mechanics model of the SER using the projection operator formalism. By generalizing their analysis to all spatial dimensions and to partially structured solvents , we identify a potential microscopic origin of some of these deviations. We also reproduce the SER-like result from the exact dynamics of infinite-dimensional fluids.
