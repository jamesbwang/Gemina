  In this work , liquid and solid fractions of grass biomass were used as co-substrates for anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge. The input of grass biomass was increased gradually , and the underlying methanogenic microbiome was assessed by means of microscopy-based cell counting and full-length 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing , proving for the first time the suitability of nanopore-based portable sequencers as a monitoring tool for anaerobic digestion systems. In both cases co-fermentation resulted in an increased number of bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Interestingly , the microbial communities were highly different between solid and liquid-fed batches. Liquid-fed batches developed a more stable microbiome , enriched in Methanosarcina spp. , and resulted in higher methanogenic yield. In contrast , solid-fed batches were highly unstable at higher substrate concentrations , and kept Methanosaeta spp.- typically associated to sewage sludge- as the majoritary methanogenic archaea.
