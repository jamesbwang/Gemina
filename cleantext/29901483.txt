  Although the association between periodontitis<disease> and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) has been reported , whether periodontitis<disease> and poor oral health behavior influence CVD risk remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine whether periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and poor oral health behavior predict 10-year general CVD risk using the Framingham Risk Score. Patients older than 30 years with no CVD history ( n = 8370) were selected using cross-sectional study data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013 and 2014. To reduce selection bias in this population-based study , propensity score matching analysis was used with SPSS and R programs to compare CVD risk. Overall , 39.2 % of the study population ( n = 3277) had a global CVD risk of 10 % or greater. In the low- and at-risk groups , 20.7 % and 45.3 % of patients , respectively , were diagnosed with periodontal<disease> disease<disease> by a dentist. Moreover , 43.2 % and 62.8 % of the low- and at-risk group patients , respectively , brushed teeth less than 3 times a day. After 1:1 propensity score matching of the low-risk ( n = 1135) and at-risk ( n = 1135) groups , bivariate analyses showed that a diagnosis of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and less frequent toothbrushing were associated with a higher CVD risk ( P < .001). Logistic regression analysis also showed that patients having periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and who brushed teeth less frequently were 1.38 and 1.33 times , respectively , more likely to be at risk of CVD ( P < .001). Education on periodontitis<disease> management and oral hygiene behavior should be included , when strategies for public risk reduction of CVD are developed.
