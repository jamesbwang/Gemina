  This study is performed to evaluate the usefulness of arthroscopic surgery prior to open reduction and fixation surgery to treat acetabular fractures and hip fractures-dislocation. From January 2010 to March 2014 , a total of 54 patients with acetabular fractures or hip fractures with dislocation were treated arthroscopically via fracture surface before open reduction and fixation ( group 1 , n = 11) , and without hip arthroscopy prior to open reduction and fixation ( group 2; n = 43). Clinical results were evaluated using Harris hip score ( HHS) and visual analogue scale ( VAS) pain scores. The mean age of patients is 43.2 years and there are 10 males and 1 females in group 1. The mean follow-up period is 15 months. The acetabular status of each case was assessed arthroscopically. Bone fragment was performed in 6 cases , and ligamentum teres shrinkage in 1 case. At the final follow up , the mean HHS and VAS pain scores were 78.6 and 2.18 , respectively. During follow up , one case of osteoarthritis and one case of heterotopic ossification were identified. At the final follow up , the mean HHS and VAS pain scores were 77.5 and 2.23 , respectively. In group 2 , oteoarthritis and ectopic ossification were observed in 4 and 1 cases , respectively. No differences were observed in the clinical outcomes of patients with acetabular fracture or hip fracture-dislocation when treated with or without arthroscopic surgery before open reduction and fixation. However , arthroscopy is thought to be useful for evaluating the joint cartilage surface and fracture fragments more accurately.
