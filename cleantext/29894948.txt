  The concentration and recovery of the high-added value phenolic fraction from two-phase olive mill wastewater and the simultaneous effluent treatment by a novel micro/ultra/nanocentrifugation membrane process assessment is addressed , permitting to gather information for a correct and effective screening procedure for the adequate membrane election ( MF-UF-loose NF) for the target. Phenolic compounds are the major factor of phytotoxicity of these effluents , but on the other hand they present high antioxidant properties that makes them very relevant for food , cosmetic , pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. The selection of a membrane MWCO between 100 kDa and 0.45 μm permitted the complete transfer of the phenolic fraction to the permeate , whereas below 3 kDa they would be transferred to the concentrate stream instead , with ∼ 60 % COD reduction and EC lowered to 551-662 μS cm
