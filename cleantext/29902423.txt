  This work aims to increase the information on the entero-parasitism in Holocene carnivores , by examining coprolites found in Patagonia. Molecular analysis was conducted following the Authenticity Criteria to Determine Ancient DNA sequences. The nucleotide sequences showed 99 % of identity with the Control Region sequences of Lycalopex culpaeus ( culpeo fox). Coprolites were positive for gastrointestinal parasites. The presence of Alaria sp. and Clonorchis sp. represents the first record for pre-Columbian America. The parasitological findings suggest the importance of these carnivores for the dissemination of their own parasites and those to their prey in rockshelters , areas with high re-use of space.
