  The last decade has been an era of accelerated technological progress for flow cytometry. New technologies have been developed such as mass cytometry in which standard fluorochromes have been replaced by lanthanide-based non-radioactive metals and by spectral cytometry that measures the complete fluorescence spectrum. In this review , we schematically describe conventional , mass and spectral cytometry and present the plus and minus of each technology.
