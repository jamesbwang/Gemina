  Animal-assisted activities ( AAAs) show promise in providing emotional and social benefits to older adults and may be used as a tool to promote therapeutic communication between students and cognitively impaired older adults. The purpose was to develop a program incorporating AAAs to enhance social engagement of cognitively impaired older adults in a community respite program and in turn enhance student comfort when caring for this vulnerable population. The Dementia Attitudes Scale , a validated tool , was used to measure students ' attitudes before and after AAA intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Students were significantly more comfortable and demonstrated a gain in knowledge after AAAs were included in the community clinical experience. Incorporating AAAs into student community/service-learning clinical experience improved communication between students and cognitively impaired older adults , improving students ' attitudes when caring for this population.
