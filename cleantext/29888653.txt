  The goal of this study was to isolate cancer stem-like cells marked by high expression of CD44 , a putative cancer stem cell marker , from primary oral squamous cell carcinomas and identify distinctive gene expression patterns in these cells. From 1 October 2013 to 4 September 2015 , 76 stage III-IV primary oral squamous cell carcinoma of the gingivobuccal sulcus were resected. In all , 13 tumours were analysed by immunohistochemistry to visualise CD44-expressing cells. Expression of CD44 within The Cancer Genome Atlas-Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma RNA-sequencing data was also assessed. Seventy resected tumours were dissociated into single cells and stained with antibodies to CD44 as well as CD45 and CD31 ( together referred as Lineage/Lin). From 45 of these , CD44
