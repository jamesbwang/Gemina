  We focused on the temporal space before stressor exposure and examined two constructs- daily stressor forecasting and anticipatory coping- for daily emotional well-being. 107 younger ( M age = 19.44 , range 18-36) and 116 older ( M age = 64.71 , range 60-90) participants reported on 1627 total days via an online daily diary study. Participants reported baseline demographic information ( Day 1) and stressor forecasts , anticipatory coping , stressor exposure , and negative affect ( Days 2-9). We found significant intraindividual variability in stressor forecasts. Increases in forecasts of upcoming stressors were associated with increases in anticipatory coping of those stressors in some domains. Older adults forecasted more upcoming home stressors than younger adults , but older adults reported less anticipatory coping than younger adults. Finally , we found age differences in emotional reactivity to daily home stressors depending on previous-day forecasts and coping of those home stressors. Forecasting home stressors was associated with a stronger reduction in reactivity for younger adults relative to older adults , but stagnant deliberation coping was associated with increased reactivity for younger adults , not for older adults. Daily stressor forecasts are dynamic and situation-specific and linked to daily anticipatory coping and age differences in reactivity to home stressors.
