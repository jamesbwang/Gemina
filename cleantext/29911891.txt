  Youth with multiple sclerosis ( MS) often experience cognitive impairment and psychosocial disturbances. We describe the relationship between memory function , psychosocial skills , and brain volume in 32 patients with pediatric-onset MS and 30 controls. Amygdala volume was significantly lower in patients compared with controls. In general , poorer memory was associated with reduced functional communication skills and reduced amygdala volume. Greater amygdala volume in patients correlated with parent-reported functional communication and social skills. Adjusting for whole-brain volume , right amygdala volume was positively associated with visual memory; left amygdala volume was a stronger predictor of parent-reported social skills.
