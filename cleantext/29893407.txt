  Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have emerged as an important class of molecules that have been associated with brain function and neurological disease , but the expression profiles of lncRNAs after intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) remain to be elucidated. In this study , we determined the expression pattern of nuclear factor-k-gene binding ( NF-kB) interacting lncRNA ( NKILA) after ICH and examined its respective effects on the endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS)/ autophagy pathway , hippocampal neuron loss , and the NF-kB pathway after type VII collagenase-induced ICH in rats. The regulatory mechanisms of NKILA were investigated by an intraperitoneal injection of small interfering ( siRNA) against NKILA into rats after ICH. NKILA inhibition mediated by siRNA against NKILA was shown to significantly reduce ERS and autophagy , activate the NF-kB pathway , decrease neurological deficits , brain edema<symptom> , and injury , and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown , further leading to hippocampal neuron loss and the production of inflammation<symptom> cytokines. Taken together , the demonstration that NKILA induces the ERS/autophagy pathway and inhibits the NF-kB pathway after ICH supports the concept that NKILA functions as a novel target that is required for the attenuation of brain injuries after ICH.
