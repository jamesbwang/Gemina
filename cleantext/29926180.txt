  We studied the effects of temperature on the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal reproduction and related events in the subtropical tree sparrow at Shillong , India. In the first experiment , one group of birds was maintained in an outdoor open aviary receiving natural photoperiod and temperature conditions , while the other group was exposed to natural photoperiod and constant temperature of 17 ± 2 °C in an outdoor closed aviary for 12 months. Although both sexes achieved peak gonadal growth at the same time ( May) under the two conditions , gonadal regression and feathers molt were delayed under the temperature controlled condition. In the second experiment , the groups of birds were exposed to three different temperatures ( 17 , 25 and 30 °C) under both long ( LD-14L: 10D) and short ( SD-9L: 15D) day lengths for 7 months. Birds showed relatively small but significant gonadal growth , darkening of bill color and feathers molt only at 30 °C under SD. However , they behaved as though they were under natural conditions and exhibited the above responses significantly at all temperatures under LD. There was delayed gonadal regression at the lower temperature ( 17 °C) , while feathers molt delayed with increasing temperature ( 25 , 30 °C) under LD. These results clearly indicate that temperature modulates photoperiodic seasonal responses in the tree sparrow.
