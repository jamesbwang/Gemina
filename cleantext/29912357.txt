  The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of adding engineered biocarbon to a high-forage diet on ruminal fermentation , nutrient digestion , and enteric methane ( CH4) production in a semi-continuous culture artificial rumen system ( RUSITEC). The experiment was a completely randomized block design with four treatments assigned to sixteen fermentation vessels ( four/treatment) in two RUSITEC apparatuses. The basal diet consisted of 60 % barley silage , 27 % barley grain , 10 % canola meal , and 3 % supplement ( DM basis) with biocarbon added at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2 % of substrate DM. The study period was 17 d , with a 10-d adaptation and 7-d sample collection period. Increasing biocarbon linearly increased ( P < 0.05) disappearance of DM , OM , CP , ADF and NDF. Compared to control , increasing biocarbon enhanced ( P < 0.01) production of total VFA , acetate , propionate , branch-chained VFAs , and tended to increase ( P = 0.06) NH3-N. Microbial protein synthesis linearly increased ( P = 0.01) with increasing biocarbon. Addition of biocarbon reduced overall CH4 production compared with the control ( P â‰¤ 0.05). There were no differences ( P > 0.05) in production of total gas , large or small peptides , or in the number of protozoa as a result of addition of biocarbon to the diet. Addition of biocarbon to a forage diet increased DM digestibility by up to 2 % , while lowering enteric CH4 production and enhancing microbial protein synthesis in in vitro semi- continuous culture fermenters.
