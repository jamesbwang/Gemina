  Obesity is a major health concern in Saudi Arabia. Uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2) seems to play a major role in the regulation of human metabolism; therefore , genetic polymorphisms in the UCP2 gene might contribute to obesity. This study aims to establish whether 45-blood pressure ( BP) insertion ( I)/ deletion ( D) polymorphisms in UCP2 are associated with moderate and/or severe obesity in a Saudi Arabian population. Case-control study design. The study enrolled 151 male and female subjects originating from the eastern province of Saudi Arabia , and assigned each to a `` nonobese , '' `` moderately obese , '' or `` severely obese '' group. Genomic DNA was extracted from all subjects and screened for UCP2 I/D polymorphisms using a standard polymerase chain response protocol. Analysis of variance , Chi-squared tests , and logistic regression analysis. The frequencies of the UCP2 45-BP I/D genotypes The present study reported that the frequency of UCP2 45-BP I/D polymorphisms in a population originating from eastern Saudi Arabia and identified a strong association between the
