  The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI) in Washington , DC , has catalyzed a meaningful shift in the composition of research project teams since its initial research funding cycle in 2011. Despite the influx of funding in the research community for patient-centered research , research on how to effectively engage patients and stakeholders in the research process is still relatively nascent. Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute ( KPWHRI) in Seattle , WA , was an early recipient of PCORI research funding and , as of December 2017 , has received 8 PCORI research awards totaling nearly $ 15 million. Anticipating the pivotal importance of PCORI 's patient-focused approach , KPWHRI developed a set of 8 principles to guide how research teams should work with patients and other stakeholders to simultaneously achieve research aims and embrace this new paradigm in how research teams collaborate. With a goal of assisting other research teams , this article describes the genesis of the KPWHRI principles , their relevance to patient- and stakeholder-engaged research , and how these principles were brought to life in the context of a specific PCORI-funded project on surveillance imaging in women after a breast cancer diagnosis.
