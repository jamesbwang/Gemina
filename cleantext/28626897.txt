  The simple integration of chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers ( PSs) into the same nanocarriers only achieves a combination of chemo-photodynamic therapy but may not confer synergistic effects. The boosted intracellular release of chemotherapeutic drugs during the photodynamic therapy ( PDT) process is necessary to achieve a cascade of amplified synergistic therapeutic effects of chemo-photodynamic therapy.
