  We report on etching of polyacrylic acid-stabilised silver nanoparticles in the presence of glutathione ( GSH). The initial particles with a radius of 3.2 nm and consisting of âˆ¼ 8100 silver atoms dissolve in a two-step reaction mechanism while in parallel smaller silver particles with a radius of 0.65 nm and consisting of 60 to 70 silver atoms were formed. The kinetics of the etching of the initial particles , accompanied by formation of smaller silver particles was interpreted based on in situ , time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS) experiments.
