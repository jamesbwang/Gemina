  The adenoviruses are essential tools for basic research and therapeutic development. Robust methods for the generation of mutant and recombinant viruses are crucial for these diverse applications. Here we describe a simple plasmid-based method that permits highly efficient modification of the adenoviral genome and rapid production of high-titer virus stocks. The 36-kilobase genome of adenovirus<pathogen> serotype 5 was divided into seven tractable blocks that could be individually modified in a single step and reassembled in vitro. Because the system is composed of compact modules , modifications at different loci can be readily recombined. Viral assemblies were delivered to packaging cells by electroporation , a strategy that consistently resulted in the de novo production of 108 infectious units in 3-5 days. In principle , a similar strategy could be applied to any other adenovirus<pathogen> serotype or to other double-strand DNA viruses.
