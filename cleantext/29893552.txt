  Genetic and epigenetic alterations in FK506-binding protein 5 ( FKBP5) have been associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders , including post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). Some of these common variants can increase the expression of FKBP5 , the gene that encodes FKBP51. Excess FKBP51 promotes hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis dysregulation through altered glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) signaling. Thus , we hypothesized that GR activity could be restored by perturbing FKBP51. Here , we screened 1280 pharmacologically active compounds and identified three compounds that rescued FKBP51-mediated suppression of GR activity without directly activating GR. One of the three compounds , benztropine mesylate , disrupted the association of FKBP51 with the GR/Hsp90 complex in vitro. Moreover , we show that removal of FKBP51 from this complex by benztropine restored GR localization in ex vivo brain slices and primary neurons from mice. In conclusion , we have identified a novel disruptor of the FKBP51/GR/Hsp90 complex. Targeting this complex may be a viable approach to developing treatments for disorders related to aberrant FKBP51 expression.
