  In this study , a novel and high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric ( LC-MS-MS) assay was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of two glycopeptides ( vancomycin , teicoplanin) and two small molecule compounds ( meropenem , voriconazole) in human plasma. Only 50 μL of human plasma is used to quantify these four drugs simultaneously at clinical concentration levels. After a relative simple protein precipitation , the supernatant was then diluted with mobile phase acetonitrile: 0.1 % formic acid ( 5:95 , v/v) to avoid solvent effect and reduce the matrix effect. Then , the target compounds were separated on an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column ( 4.6 × 50 mm , 2.7 μm). All the target compounds were detected by positive ion mode. The teicoplanin concentration was determined as the sum of six components ( A2-1 , A2-2 , A2-3 , A2-4 , A2-5 and A3-1). The method was linear in the concentration range 0.3-30 μg/mL for meropenem; 1-100 μg/mL for teicoplanin and vancomycin; 0.3-10 μg/mL for voriconazole. The lower limit of quantitation ( LLOQ) of meropenem and voriconazole were 0.30 μg/mL; and the LLOQ of teicoplanin and vancomycin were 1.0 μg/mL. The intra- and inter-day accuracies were < 9.67 % and 13.0 % , and the precisions were < 14.5 % at all tested concentrations. The entire analysis time for the four drugs was only 5 min for each sample. The currently developed assay was successfully applied for the therapeutic drug monitoring of 85 patients administered with standard drug treatments , demonstrating its high-throughput clinical usage for the therapeutic drug monitoring.
