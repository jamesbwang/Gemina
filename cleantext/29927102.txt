  This unit describes a protocol for acquiring and analyzing high-content super-resolution images of human stem cell nuclei for the characterization and classification of the cell differentiation paths based on distinct patterns of epigenetic mark organization. Here , we describe the cell culture , immunocytochemical labeling , super-resolution imaging parameters , and MATLAB-based quantitative image analysis approaches for monitoring human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs) as the cells differentiate towards various lineages. Although this protocol uses specific cell types as examples , this approach could be easily extended to a variety of cell types and nuclear epigenetic and mechanosensitive biomarkers that are relevant to specific cell developmental scenarios.
