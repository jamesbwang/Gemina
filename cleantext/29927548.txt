  Urine cytology specimens are essential for screening and monitoring high-grade urothelial carcinomas. However , inconsistent reporting and equivocal diagnostic categories have remained a challenge. The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology ( TPS) was developed to provide clear cytomorphologic criteria for urine cytology specimens. Significant correlation between the surgical biopsy diagnosis ( SD) and TPS diagnosis ( PD) has been established in lower urothelial tract carcinomas , but to the authors ' knowledge limited information is available regarding upper urinary tract carcinomas. A total of 56 cytology specimens from 35 patients within 90 days of an SD of upper urinary tract carcinoma were included. Cytology was re-reviewed and assigned a PD. The original diagnosis ( OD) and PD were compared with the corresponding SD to determine which correlated best. The PD corresponded to the SD in 35 of 56 cases ( 63 %) , which was greater than that for the OD and SD , which were concordant in 19 of 56 cases ( 34 %). Both the OD and PD were concordant in 18 of 56 cases ( 32 %) , and neither corresponded in 20 of 56 cases ( 36 %). A total of 27 of 33 cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma/carcinoma in situ on SD ( 82 %) were identified using the PD whereas only 15 cases ( 45 %) were identified with the OD. The number of `` atypical '' diagnoses in the OD was reduced from 16 of 56 cases ( 29 %) to 7 of 56 cases ( 13 %) using the PD. Of the 14 of 56 `` negative '' OD ( 25 %) , only 4 remained after implementation of the PD. A diagnosis of low-grade urothelial neoplasm was established in 6 of 20 cases ( 30 %) with the PD compared with 3 of 20 cases with the OD ( 15 %). The authors found that reclassification with TPS improved correlation with the SD compared with previous methodologies. Specifically , TPS increased the number of high-grade urothelial carcinoma diagnoses and decreased the number of equivocal or `` atypical '' diagnoses. Cancer Cytopathol 2018.
