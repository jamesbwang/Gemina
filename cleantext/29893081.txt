  CAR-T cell therapy that targets surface antigens to kill tumor cells specifically has recently become another cornerstone in tumor immunotherapy. In this study , a lentiviral expression plasmid of CAR targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) was constructed by genetic engineering. The recombinant plasmid was co-transfected with other packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation to generate lenti-car , which are CAR lentiviral particles. HER2-specific CAR-T cells were obtained by transducing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with lenti-car. Their specific inhibitory effects on HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumor cells were analyzed in vitro. The constructed CAR-T cells were specifically activated by HER2-expressing tumor cells as indicated by secretion of IFN-γ and IL-2. The inhibitory rate on HER2-positive SK-OV-3 cell line was ( 58.47 ± 1.72) % , significantly higher than that on the mock-treated control group ( P < 0.05). The inhibitory rate on HER2-negative K562 cell lines was ( 11.74 ± 2.37) % , which was not significantly different from that on the control group ( P > 0.05). Furthermore , when we transfected a HER2-expressing vector into K562 , the inhibitory rate increased to ( 30.41 ± 7.59) % , which was higher than that on HER2-negative K562 ( P < 0.05). Thus , the constructed second-generation HER2-specific CAR-T cells specifically suppressed growth of tumor cells overexpressing HER2 protein , suggesting that HER2-specific CAR-T cells might prove useful for immunotherapy of HER2-positive cancer.
