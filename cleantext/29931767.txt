  Chemotherapeutic agents are part of the standard treatment algorithms for many malignancies; however , their application and dosage are limited by their toxic effects to normal tissues. Chemotherapy-induced toxicities can be long-lasting and may be incompletely reversible; therefore , causative therapies for chemotherapy-dependent side effects are needed , especially considering the increasing survival rates of treated cancer patients. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have been shown to exhibit regenerative abilities for various forms of tissue damage. Preclinical data suggest that MSCs may also help to alleviate tissue lesions<symptom> caused by chemotherapeutic agents , mainly by establishing a protective microenvironment for functional cells. Due to the systemic administration of most anticancer agents , the effects of these drugs on the MSCs themselves is of crucial importance to utilize stem cell-based approaches for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced tissue toxicities. Here , we present a concise review of the published data regarding the influence of various classes of chemotherapeutic agents on the survival , stem cell characteristics and physiological functions of MSCs. Molecular mechanisms underlying the effects are outlined , and resulting challenges of MSC-based treatments for chemotherapy-induced tissue injuries are discussed.
