  IFNγ is a cytokine with important roles in tissue homeostasis , immune and inflammatory responses and tumour immunosurveillance. Signalling by the IFNγ receptor activates the Janus kinase ( JAK)- signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1) pathway to induce the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes that have key immune effector functions. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the transcriptional , chromatin-based and metabolic mechanisms that underlie IFNγ-mediated polarization of macrophages to an 'M 1-like ' state , which is characterized by increased pro-inflammatory activity and macrophage resistance to tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory factors. In addition , I describe the newly discovered effects of IFNγ on other leukocytes , vascular cells , adipose tissue cells , neurons and tumour cells that have important implications for autoimmunity , metabolic diseases , atherosclerosis , neurological diseases and immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapy.
