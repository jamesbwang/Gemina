  Diabetes prevention is a public health priority. Vitamin D supplementation may help prevent the development of diabetes in persons at increased risk. We performed a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials that assessed glycemic outcome measures among adults at risk for type 2 diabetes , including prediabetes , overweight , or obesity. We searched PUBMED/ MEDLINE , CINAHL , and Google Scholar databases for trials published prior to April 2017. Placebo-controlled clinical trials with random allocation to vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation were selected. Data collection included country , study design , inclusion criteria , sample size , form , and dose of vitamin D , supplementation interval , control group , duration , participant characteristics , comorbidities , baseline and follow-up serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentration , and available outcome measures ( glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) , fasting plasma glucose , plasma glucose after 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test , and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR)). Data synthesis was conducted using random-effect models ( PROSPERO registration no. CRD42017055326). Twenty-eight trials , representing 3848 participants , met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the control group , vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced HbA1c level by -0.48 % ( 95 % CI , -0.79 to -0.18) , fasting plasma glucose level by -0.46 mmol/L ( 95 % CI , -0.74 to -0.19) , and HOMA-IR level by -0.39 ( 95 % CI , -0.68 to -0.11). Subgroup analysis revealed that the effects of vitamin D supplementation on different glycemic measures were influenced by age , calcium coadministration , vitamin D deficiency , serum 25 ( OH) D level after supplementation , and duration of supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation and improved vitamin D status improved glycemic measures and insulin sensitivity and may be useful as part of a preventive strategy for type 2 diabetes.
