  Metal bioavailability and extracellular enzyme activity are two important indicators of soil quality in metal-contaminated soil. However , it is unclear how the chronosequence effect modifies these two factors in highly contaminated calcareous soils undergoing afforestation. We used Populus simonii Carr. and the calciphilous Ulmus macrocarpa Hance as contrasting tree species to study the chronosequence effect. We found that afforestation significantly increased soil total nitrogen ( N) content as well as soil carbon ( C)/ phosphorus ( P) and N/P ratios , but decreased soil total P content and soil C/N ratio , regardless of the tree species and stand age , suggesting strong P limitation. However , available P did not change significantly with stand<symptom> age. In both tree species , P mobilization depleted soil organic matter through the priming effect of dissolved organic carbon , whereas the decrease in soil pH in the U. macrocarpa stands enhanced CaCO
