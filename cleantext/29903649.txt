  An emerging body of literature has examined cortical activity during walking and balance<symptom> tasks in older adults and in people with Parkinson 's disease , specifically using functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS) or electroencephalography ( EEG). This review provides an overview of this developing area , and examines the disease-specific mechanisms underlying walking or balance<symptom> deficits. Medline , PubMed , PsychInfo and Scopus databases were searched. Articles that described cortical activity during walking and balance<symptom> tasks in older adults and in those with PD were screened by the reviewers. Thirty-seven full-text articles were included for review , following an initial yield of 566 studies. This review summarizes study findings , where increased cortical activity appears to be required for older adults and further for participants with PD to perform walking and balance<symptom> tasks , but specific activation patterns vary with the demands of the particular task. Studies attributed cortical activation to compensatory mechanisms for underlying age- or PD-related deficits in automatic movement control. However , a lack of standardization within the reviewed studies was evident from the wide range of study protocols , instruments , regions of interest , outcomes and interpretation of outcomes that were reported. Unstandardized data collection , processing and reporting limited the clinical relevance and interpretation of study findings. Future work to standardize approaches to the measurement of cortical activity during walking and balance<symptom> tasks in older adults and people with PD with fNIRS and EEG systems is needed , which will allow direct comparison of results and ensure robust data collection/reporting. Based on the reviewed articles we provide clinical and future research recommendations.
