  Boldine , a major aporphine alkaloid found in the Chilean boldo tree , is a potent antioxidant. Oxidative stress plays a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage in renovascular hypertension ( RVH). The activation of the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) is crucial to the development and progression of hypertensive renal damage and TGF- & beta; is closely associated with the activation of RAS. In the present study , we assessed the effect of boldine on the progression of kidney disease using the 2K1C hypertension model and identifying mediators in the RAS , such as TGF- & beta; , that could be modulated by this alkaloid. Toward this hypothesis , rats (
