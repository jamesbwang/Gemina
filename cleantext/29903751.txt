  Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 ( F508del) in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) is the most common cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF)- causing mutation. Recently , ORKAMBI , a combination therapy that includes a corrector of the processing defect of F508del-CFTR ( lumacaftor or VX-809) and a potentiator of channel activity ( ivacaftor or VX-770) , was approved for CF patients homozygous for this mutation. However , clinical studies revealed that the effect of ORKAMBI on lung function is modest and it was proposed that this modest effect relates to a negative impact of VX-770 on the stability of F508del-CFTR. In the current studies , we showed that this negative effect of VX-770 at 10
