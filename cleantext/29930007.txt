  Vascular fusion represents an important mechanism of vessel enlargement during development; however , its significance in postnatal vessel enlargement is still unknown. During fusion , 2 adjoining vessels merge to share 1 larger lumen. The aim of this research was to identify the molecular mechanism responsible for vascular fusion. We previously showed that both low shear stress and DAPT ( This study provides the first evidence that VEC phosphorylation , induced by DAPT treatment and low shear stress , is involved in the process of fusion during vascular remodeling.
