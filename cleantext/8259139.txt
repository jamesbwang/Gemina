  We examined changes in prevalence of diabetic microvascular/macrovascular complications and diabetes care indicators for adults in Japan with type 2 and type 1 diabetes over one decade. Two independent cohorts were recruited with the same inclusion criteria in 2004 ( cohort 1: 3319 with type 2 and 286 with type 1 diabetes) and in 2014 ( cohort 2: 3932 with type 2 and 308 with type 1 diabetes). Prevalence of complications and care indicators including achieving treatment targets for glycemia , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , lipid control , body mass index ( BMI) , and smoking were compared. In addition , patients in cohort 1 were re-examined in 2014 and their data were compared with the baseline data of each cohort. In type 2 diabetes , the prevalence of nephropathy , retinopathy , neuropathy , chronic kidney disease , current smoking and stroke significantly decreased , with improvements in achieving treatment target rates in cohort 2 two as compared with cohort 1. In type 1 diabetes , the prevalence of nephropathy , retinopathy , chronic kidney disease , and hemoglobin A We observed declining trends of diabetic microvascular complications with improvement in diabetes care indicators in type 2 and type 1 diabetes. Younger patients with type 2 diabetes exhibited marked increase in BMI and lower rates of achieving treatment targets compared with elderly patients , which remains a concern.
