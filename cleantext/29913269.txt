  It is often difficult to achieve stable fixation in Tile type C1 pelvic fractures and there is no standard fixation technique for these types of injuries. Iliac screw fixation can be used for treating Type C1 pelvic fractures. A retrospective review was performed on 47 patients who underwent iliac screw fixation in posterior column of ilium ( PCI) for Tile type C1 pelvic fractures from July 2007 to December 2014. All patients were treated with fracture reduction , sacral nerve root decompression ( if needed) , internal fixation by iliac screw and connecting rod. The data on surgical time , intraoperative bleeding volume , postoperative neurologic functions and postoperative complications were analyzed. Patients were follow-up for at least 12 months. The mean surgical time was 148minutes , and the mean intraoperative bleeding volume was 763 ml. Patients were encouraged in-bed activities immediately after surgery. The postoperative Majeed functional score was 48-100 points ( mean 80.2) , corresponding to an excellent and good recovery of 91.5 %. Postoperative X-radiographs and CT scans indicated satisfactory fracture reduction. Iliac screw fixation combined with sacral nerve canal decompression could effectively restore pelvic alignment and improve neurological functions for complex pelvic trauma.
