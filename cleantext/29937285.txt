  The objective of this study was to assess outcomes of a hybrid technique for treatment of abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) associated with iliac aneurysm<disease> without distal neck by combining an AAA endovascular repair approach with open surgery for preservation of the internal iliac artery ( IIA). The files of 51 patients operated on between 1998 and 2017 in a single vascular surgery department were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were patients with AAA associated with uni-iliac or bi-iliac aneurysm<disease> without suitable distal sealing zone. Surgery consisted of deployment of an aortouni-iliac stent graft combined with an extra-anatomic crossover prosthetic bypass. With use of a limited retroperitoneal approach , the contralateral proximal common iliac aneurysm<disease> was surgically excluded and the IIA revascularized by direct ilioiliac anastomosis or terminal common iliac suture , preserving the iliac bifurcation. The patients ' mean age was 74 years ( 58-88 years) , and 92 % were men. The mean follow-up was 5.8 years ( 0.1-18 years). Twenty-nine patients ( 57 %) had one or more high-risk criteria for open surgery. Nineteen patients ( 37.3 %) had aortouni-iliac aneurysms<disease> , 19 ( 37.3 %) aortobi-iliac aneurysms<disease> , 5 ( 10 %) isolated iliac aneurysms<disease> , and 8 ( 15.7 %) bi-iliac aneurysms<disease> without aortic location. Four patients ( 7.8 %) also had IIA aneurysms<disease>. Surgery was successful in all cases. Two patients ( 4 %) died during the 30 days after surgery. One surgically preserved IIA occluded within the first month , resulting in buttock claudication. The 5-year IIA primary patency rate was 96 %. Type I proximal endoleaks occurred in two patients , requiring additional surgery 3 years and 13 years after the initial surgery , respectively. This hybrid technique , consisting of AAA endovascular exclusion combined with open IIA revascularization , is safe and effective for preservation of pelvic vascularization. It is associated with long-term patency and low morbidity rates. We have been using this technique since before the advent of branched dedicated devices , allowing preservation of the IIA with good results. This technique should continue to be proposed , especially in patients not eligible for endovascular iliac branch repair because of anatomic contraindications , to avoid pelvic ischemia if the IIA has to be sacrificed.
