  To determine the potential for productive efficiency and genetic improvement in the blood clam Tegillarca granosa , four offspring populations ( ZZ , ZK , KZ and KK) were produced from a diallel mating of two different geographical stocks ( Z and K). The levels of genetic diversity and population structures of four populations were analyzed using 14 polymorphic microsatellites. The results showed that the mean observed heterozygosities ( Ho) of reciprocal cross populations ( ZK and KZ) was higher than those of pure populations ( ZZ and KK). The largest values of genetic differentiation coefficient ( F
