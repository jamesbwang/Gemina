  Adequate vitamin A is essential for healthy pregnancy , but high levels may be teratogenic. We present a patient who underwent bariatric surgery , prior to child bearing , and suffered maternal and foetal complications during eleven pregnancies , possibly associated with vitamin A deficiency , amongst multiple micronutrient deficiencies and risk factors including smoking and obesity. Maternal complications included visual disturbance , night blindness<symptom> and recurrent infections. Recurrent foetal pulmonary hypoplasia and microphthalmia led to foetal and neonatal loss , not previously described in the medical literature. Current guidance on vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is focused on developing countries where aetiology of vitamin A deficiency is different to that of women in developed countries. We describe nutritional management of the micronutritient deficiencies , focusing on vitamin A , during her last pregnancy. The need for specific antenatal nutritional guidance for pregnant women post-bariatric surgery is becoming more urgent as more mothers and offspring will be affected.
