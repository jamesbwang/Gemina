  This study is a scoping review of the original research literature onthe misuse of opioids in the rural United States ( US) and maps theliterature of interest to address the question: What does theoriginal research evidence reveal about the misuse of opioids inrural US communities? This study used a modified preferred reporting items for systematicreviews and meta-analyses ( PRISMA) approach which is organized byfive distinct elements or steps: beginning with a clearly formulatedquestion , using the question to develop clear inclusion criteria toidentify relevant studies , using an approach to appraise the studiesor a subset of the studies , summarizing the evidence using anexplicit methodology , and interpreting the findings of the review. The initial search yielded 119 peer reviewed articles and aftercoding , 41 papers met the inclusion criteria. Researcher generatedsurveys constituted the most frequent source of data. Most studieshad a significant quantitative dimension to them. All the studieswere observational or cross-sectional by design. This analysis found an emerging research literature that hasgenerated evidence supporting the claim that rural US residents andcommunities suffer a disproportionate burden from the misuseof opioidscompared to their urban or metropolitan counterparts.
