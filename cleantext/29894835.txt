  Due to the enforcement of regulatory restrictions to prevent risk to human health from Bisphenol A ( BPA) , its structural analogue Bisphenol F ( BPF) has been introduced into the market as an alternative. But however recent studies describe BPF as an effectual endocrine disruptor. Hence , there is an indispensible need for research concerning BPF human and environmental exposure level. In this work , we have elicited the development of an economical electrochemical sensor , to quantify and investigate in detail the electrochemical behavior of BPF using carbon paste electrode ( CPE) modified with zinc oxide reduced graphene nanocomposite ( ZnO/G) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB). The ZnO/G was synthesized using Hummers method and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Under optimal conditions , conductive and biocompatible ZnO/G/CTAB/ MCPE offered ultra sensitivity for BPF recognition by Differential Pulse Voltammetry ( DPV) , with a detection limit of 0.06 Î¼M. Lowering of activation energy for electro-oxidation of BPF and absence of peak for interfering molecule Ascorbic acid ( AA) makes it an unique sensor for the detection of BPF with significant analytical advantage over other electrodes reported in literature. Versatility of the electrode was demonstrated by applying it to real time analysis of human body fluids , canned beverage and different water samples fortified with BPF. The satisfactory recoveries obtained , consequently authenticates the practicality of the proposed sensor.
