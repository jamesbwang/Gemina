  Opioid use is a severe problem in Iran. Despite methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT) programs being one of the most important treatment strategies for reducing individual and public harms associated with opioid use , a large proportion of Iranian patients refuse to participate in such treatment programs. The present study aims to explore the beliefs and attitudes toward MMT programs of opioid-dependent patients who were participating or had participated in methadone therapy. In-depth interviews were conducted with 23 opioid users between 27 and 58 years of age from Kurdistan provinces. Overall , six themes were discovered to be key barriers relating to methadone treatment , including financial barriers related to methadone treatment , lack of awareness about methadone treatment , negative attitudes regarding using methadone , worries about methadone 's side effects , social stigma ascribed to methadone therapy , and systemic barriers to methadone treatment. Our study revealed that the cost of treatment is a major obstacle to attending and continuing at MMT programs and that addicts and their families are not always accurately informed about the duration of MMT programs and the side effects of methadone treatment.
