  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common paediatric cancer. Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( SALL) are at risk of obesity and related cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes , hypertension , stroke and cardiovascular events. Therefore , it is important to address obesity in this population as this may help mitigate future cardiometabolic comorbidities. In this systematic review , we aim to assess current treatment strategies including lifestyle interventions , pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery to manage overweight and obesity in SALL. We will search the following databases for primary studies: CINAHL , SPORTDiscus , EMBASE , MEDLINE , PsycINFO , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition , unpublished primary studies will be searched in ClinicalTrials.gov as well as conference proceedings , presentations , abstracts , editorials and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I. Reviewers will perform title , abstract , and full-text screening as well as data abstraction and risk of bias assessment independently with a third reviewer to be consulted to resolve disagreements. Searches will be run and updated through May 1st , 2018. The overall quality of the evidence will be determined using the Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development , and Evaluation criteria for each outcome. A meta-analysis will be performed if two studies deploying similar interventions , populations , and design and outcomes are identified. As individual patient data will not be included , we do not require ethics approval. This review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CRD42016051031.
