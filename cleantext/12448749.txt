  For a long time , it was considered that interactions between microbes are only inhibitory in nature. However , latest developments in research have demonstrated that within our environment , several classes of microbes exist which produce different products upon interaction and thus embrace a wider scope of useful and potentially valuable aspects beyond simple antibiosis. Therefore , the current review explores different types of microbial interactions and describes the role of various physical , chemical , biological , and genetic factors regulating such interactions. It further explains the mechanism of action of biofilm formation and role of secondary metabolites regulating bacteria-fungi interaction. Special emphasis and focus is placed on microbial interactions which are important in medicine , food industry , agriculture , and environment. In short , this review reveals the recent contributions of microbial interaction for the benefit of mankind.
