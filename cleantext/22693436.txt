  Boolean networks with asynchronous updates are a class of logical models particularly well adapted to describe the dynamics of biological networks with uncertain measures. The state space of these models can be described by an asynchronous state transition graph , which represents all the possible exits from every single state , and gives a global image of all the possible trajectories of the system. In addition , the asynchronous state transition graph can be associated with an absorbing Markov chain , further providing a semi-quantitative framework where it becomes possible to compute probabilities for the different trajectories. For large networks , however , such direct analyses become computationally untractable , given the exponential dimension of the graph. Exploiting the general modularity of biological systems , we have introduced the novel concept of
