  South Asians have higher rates of coronary heart disease ( CHD) than White European individuals. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) is one of the most important risk factors for CHD and ethnic differences in BP have been identified in childhood. Early life exposures could explain some of these differences. We examined associations of family social and economic and maternal pregnancy exposures and BP at age 4/5 in 1644 White British and 1824 Pakistani mother-offspring pairs from the Born in Bradford study. We found that systolic BP was similar but diastolic BP was higher , in Pakistani compared to White British children ( adjusted mean differences were -0.170 mmHg 95 % CI -0.884 , 0.543 for systolic BP; 1.328 mmHg 95 % CI 0.592 , 2.064 for diastolic BP). Social and economic exposures were not associated with BP in either ethnic group. Maternal BMI was positively associated with BP in both groups but this association was mediated by child BMI. Only gestational hypertension was associated with child systolic and diastolic BP and this was only identified in Pakistani mother-offspring pairs. These findings suggest that Pakistani populations may have a different BP trajectory compared to White British groups and that this is already evident at age 4/5 years.
