  Spirituality and religious attendance ( RA) have been associated with personal attitudes and values , and this may affect lifestyle. The aim of this study was to explore their association with adolescent leisure-time choices in a highly secular environment. A nationally representative sample of adolescents ( n = 4,182 , 14.4 Â± 1.1 years , 48.6 % boys) participated in the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children cross-sectional study. We measured RA , spirituality ( adjusted shortened version of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale) , excessive television , computer games , and internet use , as well as participation in organized leisure-time activities. Compared to non-attending and non-spiritual respondents , respectively , both attending respondents and spiritual respondents were less likely to watch television and play computer games excessively , with odds ratios ( ORs) ranging from 0.6 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.5-0.8) to 0.92 ( 0.9-0.99). Only attending and only spiritual respondents were more likely to use the internet excessively , but this was not the case for those that were both attending and spiritual. Moreover , religious and spiritual respondents were more likely to be involved in at least one organised activity. ORs were 2.9 ( 1.9-4.3) for RA and 1.3 ( 1.2-1.4) for spirituality compared to their counterparts. The same pattern was observed for sporting and non-sporting activities combined ( ORs 4.6 ( 3.0-7.1) and 1.5 ( 1.4-1.7) , respectively) and regularly reading books or playing a musical instrument. Adolescent RA and spirituality are associated with a more active way of spending leisure-time. Further research should focus on understanding potential mechanisms that underlie these associations.
