  Solution pH plays an important role in structure and dynamics of biomolecular systems; however , pH effects can not be accurately accounted for in conventional molecular dynamics simulations based on fixed protonation states. Continuous constant pH molecular dynamics ( CpHMD) based on the Î»-dynamics framework calculates protonation states on the fly during dynamical simulation at a specified pH condition. Here we report the CPU-based implementation of the CpHMD method based on the GBNeck2 generalized Born ( GB) implicit-solvent model in the pmemd engine of the Amber molecular dynamics package. The performance of the method was tested using pH replica-exchange titration simulations of Asp , Glu and His side chains in 4 miniproteins and 7 enzymes with experimentally known p K
