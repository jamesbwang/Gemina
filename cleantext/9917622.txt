  Bone remodeling plays an important role in the bone healing process; for example , following fracture. The relative ratio of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand ( RANKL)/ osteoprotegerin ( OPG) controls osteoclast differentiation , thereby playing a pivotal role in the regulation of bone remodeling. Propofol , a widely used anesthetic agent in orthopedic procedures , is considered to possess potential antioxidant properties owing to its structural similarity to Î±-tocopherol. Antioxidants are known to enhance bone healing. Accordingly , in the present study , we aimed to investigate osteoblastic differentiation and RANKL/OPG expression following propofol administration , in order to assess the potentially beneficial effects of this drug on the bone remodeling process , using calvarial primary osteoblasts from newborn mice. Calvarial pre-osteoblast cells were cultured in media containing clinically relevant concentrations of propofol , and cytotoxicity , effects on cell proliferation , osteogenic activity , and osteoclastogenesis were examined. The present findings indicated that propofol did not exert cytotoxic effects or alter cell proliferation in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Further , propofol did not affect osteoblast differentiation. The RANKL/OPG ratio was found to be decreased following propofol administration , and osteoclastogenesis was significantly reduced , indicating that propofol attenuated the osteoclastogenesis-supporting activity of osteoblasts. The results demonstrate that propofol , at clinically relevant concentrations , exerts beneficial effects on bone remodeling by attenuating osteoclastogenesis via suppression of the RANKL/OPG expression axis.
