  A region-specific regulation of inflammation<symptom> on the expression hepcidin in the brain has been demonstrated , however , it remains unknown whether there is also a cell-specific regulation of inflammation<symptom> on hepcidin in the brain. Here , we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) on the expression of hepcidin mRNA and also the expression of IL-6 mRNA , the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of ferroportin 1 ( Fpn1) and ferritin light chain ( Ft-L) proteins in neurons and astrocytes obtained from wild type ( IL-6 +/ +) and IL-6 knockout ( IL-6-/-) mice. We demonstrated that the responses of the expression of hepcidin and IL-6 mRNAs , the phosphorylation of STAT3 , and the expression of Fpn1 protein to LPS in IL-6 +/ + astrocytes and also the responses of the expression of hepcidin mRNA , the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of Fpn1 protein to IL-6 in IL-6-/- astrocytes were much stronger than those in IL-6 +/ + and IL-6-/- neurons. A significant increase in Ft-L was found in LPS-treated IL-6 +/ + and IL-6-treated IL-6-/- astrocytes , but not in LPS-treated IL-6 +/ + and IL-6-treated IL-6-/- neurons. Our findings provide in vitro evidence for the existence of a cell-specific regulation of LPS on the expression of hepcidin and also Ft-L in the brain.
