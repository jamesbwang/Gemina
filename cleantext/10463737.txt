  Ganglions are the cysts<symptom> derived from myxomatous degeneration of periarticular tissue , commonly found around wrist and foot. Ganglion cysts<symptom> are uncommon in Knee region and if present their occurrence is mostly incidental and benign. Based on their location , this could be extraarticular or intraarticular. Lesions<symptom> with similar pathology in subchondral region around joints are lesser common entity called Intraosseous ganglions. Rarer still is the lesion<symptom> produced by myxomatous degeneration of periosteum of long bone , called periosteal ganglion. We here present a case of 35 year old Male with gradual onset , poorly localised pain behind left knee which was radiologically suggestive of periosteal ganglion , eroding the posterior aspect of femur and confirmed histopathologically following the excision of a lesion<symptom> from posterior aspect of femoral condyles.
