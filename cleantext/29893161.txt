  The purpose of this study was to create a valid and reliable assessment scale for the evaluation of three basic tennis strokes ( forehand , backhand , serve) for 6-12-year-old tennis players , named the Tennis Rating Score for Children ( TRSC). Altogether 60 players ( 21: forehand , 22: backhand , 17: serve) were video recorded ( 30 frames per second) while performing three main tennis strokes and later evaluated using the TRSC by five tennis trainers at Day 1 and Day 7. Agreement between days and raters was examined using the intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC). A Pearson 's correlation was calculated to determine convergent validity ( score related to participant 's level of experience). The reliability between raters was very high for all three main strokes ( ICC
