  Predictive computational modeling has revolutionized classical engineering disciplines and is in the process of transforming cardiovascular research. This is particularly relevant for investigating emergent therapies for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , which remains a leading cause of death globally. The creation of subject-specific biventricular computational cardiac models has been a long-term endeavor within the biomedical engineering community. Using high resolution ( 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.8 mm)
