  The brain 's body representation is amenable to rapid change , even though we tend to think of our bodies as relatively fixed and stable. For example , it has been shown that a life-sized body perceived in virtual reality as substituting the participant 's real body , can be felt as if it were their own , and that the body type can induce perceptual , attitudinal and behavioral changes. Here we show that changes can also occur in cognitive processing and specifically , executive functioning. Fifteen male participants were embodied in a virtual body that signifies super-intelligence ( Einstein) and 15 in a ( Normal) virtual body of similar age to their own. The Einstein body participants performed better on a cognitive task than the Normal body , considering prior cognitive ability ( IQ) , with the improvement greatest for those with low self-esteem. Einstein embodiment also reduced implicit bias against older people. Hence virtual body ownership may additionally be used to enhance executive functioning.
