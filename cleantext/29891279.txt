  This work reports the preparation , the characterization and the prednisolone release profile of biocompatible hydrogel nanocomposites containing mesoporous silica ( SBA) and alginate as a biomaterial for enhanced drug delivery with reduced burst effect and improved mechanical properties. Such systems , which were prepared using specific SBA/alginate-crosslinking chemistry , exhibited interconnecting pore hybrid network owing to both mesoporous silica and hydrogel characteristics. Activated SBA was shown to be a determinant factor in inhibiting initial burst by nearly 90 % and the drug was released with minimal burst kinetics. The nanoparticles reduced the movements of polymer chains , affecting macromolecular relaxation , and the distribution of mesoporous silica within the hydrogel made drug release into surrounding liquid less favorable. The proposed systems are biocompatible with human immortalized RWPE-1 prostatic epithelial cells. This report offers an approach of up-to-date interest for the development of advanced biomaterials for further physiological and pathological applications.
