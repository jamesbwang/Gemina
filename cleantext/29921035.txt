  Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y51 has been widely used in investigations of perchloroethylene ( PCE) biodegradation , but limited information exists on its other physiological capabilities. We investigated how D. hafniense Y51 confronts the debilitating limitations of not having enough electron donor ( lactate) , or electron acceptor ( fumarate) during cultivation in chemostats. The residual concentrations of the substrates supplied in excess were much lower than expected. Transcriptomics , proteomics , and fluxomics were integrated to investigate how this phenomenon was regulated. Through diverse regulation at both transcriptional and translational levels , strain Y51 turned to fermenting the excess lactate and disproportionating the excess fumarate under fumarate- and lactate-limiting conditions , respectively. Genes and proteins related to the utilization of a variety of alternative electron donors and acceptors absent from the medium were induced , apparently involving the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Through this metabolic flexibility , D. hafniense Y51 may be able to switch between different metabolic capabilities under limiting conditions. This article is protected by copyright.
