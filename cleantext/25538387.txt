  Ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive common odontogenic tumor of the jaws. Although histopathological and radiological findings have been extensively studied for the diagnosis of ameloblastoma , usefulness of fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC) has not been explored much. Here , we have reported four cases of ameloblastomas diagnosed by FNAC and subsequently confirmed by histopathology.
