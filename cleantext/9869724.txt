  ERCP can lead to complications , which can be prevented by the recognition of risk factors. To identify these risk factors , with quality evaluation. Retrospective study in a Brazilian hospital in 194 patients , excluding surgically altered anatomy. 211 ERCPs were performed: 97.6 % were therapeutic , 83.4 % were started by trainees , with deep cannulation rate of 89.6 %. Precut was needed in 16.6 % of the ERCPs and classic sphincterotomy in 67.3 % , with 75.4 % of ductal clearance at single session and 8.0 % of technical failure. Inacessible papillas ocurred in 2.5 % of cases. There were 2.5 % of late complications and 16 % of early complications. Multivariate analysis identified six predictors for early complications: fistulotomy precut ( OR = 3.4 , p = 0.010) , difficult cannulation ( OR = 21.5 , p = 0.002) , attending 's procedural time ( OR = 2.4 , p = 0.020) , choledocholithiasis ( adjusted OR = 1.8 , p = 0.015) , cannulation time ( adjusted OR = 3.2 , p = 0.018) and ERCP duration ( adjusted OR = 2.7 , p = 0.041). Six risk factors for post-ERCP complications were identified. ERCP duration and cannulation time are suggested as new potential quality indicators.
