  Tetrahydroberberine ( THB) , tetrahydrocoptisine ( THCP) and tetrahydrocolumbamine ( THCB) belong to the tetrahydroprotoberberine ( THPB) alkaloids. Most of them have been extensively studied because of their pharmacological activities such as anti-hypertension , anti-arrhythmia , antimicrobial activity and antioxidant. However , limited information on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the three alkaloids has been reported. The purpose of the study was to investigate the in vitro metabolism of THB , THCP and THCB in rat liver S9 by using a rapid and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometry ( HPLC/QqTOF-MS) method. The incubation mixture was processed with 15 % trichloroacetic acid. Chromatographic separations of three THPB alkaloids and their metabolites was achieved by HPLC/QqTOF-MS and accurate mass measurements of metabolites were automatically performed through data-dependent acquisition in only a 30-min analysis. The detailed structural elucidations of these metabolites were performed by comparing their changes in accurate molecular masses , elemental compositions and product ions with those of the parent drug. Five , five and four metabolites of THB , THCP and THCB were identified in rat liver S9 , respectively. The results show that tO-demethylenation of the 9,10-vicinal methoxyl group was the main metabolic pathway of THB and THCB and that t demethylenation of the two methylenedioxy groups was the main metabolic pathway of THCP. In addition , minor oxidation and methylation reactions could occur for these alkaloids in rat liver S9. This was the first ever investigation of in vitro metabolism of THB , THCP and THCB in rat liver S9 by using a sensitive and accurate HPLC/QqTOF-MS method. The tentatively proposed metabolic pathways of the three alkaloids will provide a basis for further studies of the in vivo metabolism of the three compounds in animals and humans.
