  Interfascial blocks of the thoracic wall are being developed as an alternative to central blocks in breast surgery. However , there are few studies that have evaluated the anatomical extension of the local anaesthetic. The objective of this study was to analyse , using fluoroscopy , the spreading of two volumes ( 10 vs. 20 ml) of radiological contrast in the serratus-intercostal plane block in an experimental pig model. Ten Large-White breed pigs were selected to have a bilateral ultrasound serratus-intercostal plane block performed , with the administering of 10 ml and 20 ml of iopamidol in the right and left hemithorax , respectively. The spreading of contrast was analysed by fluoroscopy. The Spearman test correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between the administered volume and radiological spreading. A value of P < .05 was considered significant. Twenty anaesthetic blocks were performed , being able to analyse 18 of them. The administration of 10 ml of contrast was associated with a mean spreading of 2.28 ± 0.31 ( 95 % CI; 2.01-2.54) intercostal spaces , while the administration of 20 ml showed a spreading of 3 ± 0.25 ( 95 % CI; 2.81-3.18) intercostal spaces. There was a significant correlation between the injected volume and the spreading of the contrast ( Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.81; P = .0001). The results showed a spreading of volume subject to the serratus-intercostal plane block , although not maintaining a 1:1 ratio. Doubling the volume increased the blocked segments by 31 %. These findings , if corroborated in the clinical practice , would allow a more precise adjustment in the anaesthetic volume administered.
