  Gene expression can be influenced by DNA methylation 1) distally , at regulatory elements such as enhancers , as well as 2) proximally , at promoters. Our current understanding of the influence of distal DNA methylation changes on gene expression patterns is incomplete. Here , we characterize genome-wide methylation and expression patterns for ~ 13 k genes to explore how DNA methylation interacts with gene expression , throughout the genome. We used a linear mixed model framework to assess the correlation of DNA methylation at ~ 400 k CpGs with gene expression changes at ~ 13 k transcripts in two independent datasets from human blood cells. Among CpGs at which methylation significantly associates with transcription ( eCpGs) , > 50 % are distal ( > 50 kb) or trans ( different chromosome) to the correlated gene. Many eCpG-transcript pairs are consistent between studies and ~ 90 % of neighboring eCpGs associate with the same gene , within studies. We find that enhancers ( P < 5e-18) and microRNA genes ( P = 9e-3) are overrepresented among trans eCpGs , and insulators and long intergenic non-coding RNAs are enriched among cis and distal eCpGs. Intragenic-eCpG-transcript correlations are negative in 60-70 % of occurrences and are enriched for annotated gene promoters and enhancers ( P < 0.002) , highlighting the importance of intragenic regulation. Gene Ontology analysis indicates that trans eCpGs are enriched for transcription factor genes and chromatin modifiers , suggesting that some trans eCpGs represent the influence of gene networks and higher-order transcriptional control. This work sheds new light on the interplay between epigenetic changes and gene expression , and provides useful data for mining biologically-relevant results from epigenome-wide association studies.
