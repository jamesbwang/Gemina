  A simple and sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) method based on liquid-liquid extraction was established and validated for determination of docetaxel ( DTX) in plasma of rat. Samples were spiked with paclitaxel as the internal standard and the chromatographic separation was carried out using C18 HPLC column. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile/water with the ratio of 60/40 v/v. The ultraviolet detector was operated at 230 nm , and the flow rate of mobile phase was 1 ml/min. The method was validated for linearity , precision , accuracy , recovery , and limit of quantification ( LOQ). Then the method was applied to quantify DTX in the rat plasma after intravenous ( IV) administration of the self-assembled micelles of folate-targeted Synpronic F127/cholesterol ( FA-PF127-Chol) loaded with DTX and Taxotere Calibration curve was linear between the concentration ranges of 0.1-7.5 μg/ml with the relative standard deviation % and evaluating error % ranged from 2.263 to 15.53 and -12.75 to 12.7 for intra- and inter-day validity , respectively. The mean recovery of the drug after plasma extraction was 95.67 ± 0.99 % for the concentration of 1 μg/ml. The LOQ and the limit of detection for DTX in serum were 100 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml , respectively. The results indicated that the developed method could be adopted for pharmacokinetic studies of DTX-loaded FA-PF127-Chol micelles and Taxotere
