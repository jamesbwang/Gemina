  Enniatin A ( EN-A) is a Fusarium<pathogen> mycotoxin which is a common contaminant in grains and especially in maize and it causes serious loss of product. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects using 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2) -2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay in human cervix carcinoma ( HeLa) cell line , and genotoxic effects of EN-A using chromosome aberrations ( CAs) , sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs) , micronuclei ( MN) and comet assays in human lymphocytes. The cells were treated with 0.07 , 0.14 , 0.29 , 0.57 , 1.15 , 2.29 , 4.59 and 9.17 Î¼M concentrations of EN-A. It exhibited cytotoxic effects in HeLa cell lines especially when the concentrations were increased. The half-inhibitory value ( IC
