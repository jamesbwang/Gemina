  Selenium is an essential micronutrient for humans. In food , selenium can be present in both inorganic and organic forms , the latter mainly being selenomethionine , Se-methyl-selenocysteine , and selenocystine. Selenoamino acid speciation rarely involves the chirality of selenoamino acids. In this work , a 5 cm long CHIROBIOTIC TAG chromatographic column was used for enantioresolution of selenoamino acids ( d- and l-selenomethionine , Se-methyl-l-selenocysteine , d- , l- and meso-selenocystine); in the optimized conditions , the complete resolution of the analytes was achieved within 15 min by using a very polar aqueous mobile phase ( gradient elution by methanol/acetonitrile/H
