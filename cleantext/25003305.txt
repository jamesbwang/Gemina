  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is still the leading cause of death in all western world countries and genetic predisposition in combination with traditional risk factors frequently mediates their manifestation. Genome-wide association ( GWA) studies revealed numerous potentially disease modifying genetic loci often including several SNPs and associated genes. However , pure genetic association does not prove direct or indirect relevance of the modifier region on pathogenesis , nor does it define within the associated region the exact genetic driver of the disease. Therefore , the relevance of the identified genetic disease associations needs to be confirmed either in monogenic traits or in experimental
