  Motivated by recent experimental processes , we systemically investigate strongly correlated spin-1 ultracold bosons trapped in a three-dimensional optical lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. Based on a recently developed bosonic dynamical mean-field theory ( BDMFT) , we map out complete phase diagrams of the system for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions , where various phases are found as a result of the interplay of spin-dependent interaction and quadratic Zeeman energy. For antiferromagnetic interactions , the system demonstrates competing magnetic orders , including nematic , spin-singlet and ferromagnetic insulating phase , depending on longitudinal magnetization , whereas , for ferromagnetic case , a ferromagnetic-to-nematic-insulating phase transition is observed for small quadratic Zeeman energy , and the insulating phase demonstrates the nematic order for large Zeeman energy. Interestingly , at low magnetic field and finite temperature , we find an abnormal multi-step condensation of the strongly correlated superfluid , i.e. the critical condensing temperature of the m
