  Prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2) is associated with a diverse array of functions in mammals including regulation of appetite<symptom> , body temperature , sleep , and immune responses. Although much is known about the effects of PGD2 in mammals , there is a lack of information about its effects in birds. Therefore , the purpose of the present study was to determine if intracerebroventricular ( ICV) and intraperitoneal ( IP) injections of PGD2 affect feeding , voluntary movement , crop-emptying rate , corticosterone release , and cloacal temperature in chicks ( Gallus gallus). ICV injection of PGD2 was associated with a reduction in food intake , a reduction in voluntary movement , an increase in the time spent sitting , a decline in crop emptying rate , and also short-term hypothermia<symptom>. Central injection of PGD2 also decreased the plasma glucose concentration in chicks while it tended to increase the plasma corticosterone concentration. On the other hand , except for crop emptying , such physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> are not observed after IP injection of PGD2. In sum , the present study suggests that PGD2 induces anorexia<symptom> , change in behavior , decline in crop empting rate , hypoglycemia and hypothermia<symptom> , but most of these effects are exerted via central nervous system in chicks.
