  This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Astragalus membranaceus polysaccharide ( AMP) supplementation on the growth performance and immunity of juvenile broilers. High-performance liquid chromatography spectrum and sugar composition analysis indicated that AMP is a heteropolysaccharide with a molecular weight of 11,078 Da and consists of glucose , galactose , rhamnose , and arabinose. Four diets supplemented with four different levels of AMP ( 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2 g kg-1) were formulated and tested for their effects on the growth performance and immunity of juvenile broilers. After 6 wk of feeding , the juvenile broilers fed with AMP-containing diets exhibited higher body<symptom> weight gains; the activities of digestive enzymes ( amylase , lipase , and protease) , superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase; and serum IgG , IgM , and IgA levels; and lower malondialdehyde level than the control. However , excessive AMP dose ( > 1 g kg-1) could not improve its efficiency further. Results indicate that dietary administration of AMP can improve the growth performance and immune responses of juvenile broilers.
