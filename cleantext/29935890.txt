  Three Entamoeba spp. including E. suis<pathogen> , zoonotic E. polecki , and E. histolytica<pathogen> , have been described in pigs to date. However , little is known about the molecular epidemiology of these neglected parasites in pigs globally. In this study we surveyed the occurrence and molecular epidemiology of porcine Entamoeba spp. in pigs in eastern China and evaluated their zoonotic potential. Five hundred fresh fecal samples , collected from seven pig farms in Anhui province , eastern China , were examined for the presence of E. histolytica<pathogen> , E. suis , and E. polecki ST1 and ST3 infections by a combination of nested PCR targeting the small subunit ribosomal DNA gene and subsequent sequencing.The overall occurrence of Entamoeba spp. was 45.8 % ( 229/500). Infection with E. polecki ST1 ( 38.2 %; 191/500) was the most common , followed by E. polecki ST3 ( 10.0 %; 50/500) , and E. suis<pathogen> ( 0.8 %; 4/500). No E. histolytica<pathogen> infection was detected. Double infections with E. polecki ST1 and E. suis<pathogen> , and with E. polecki ST1 and ST3 were found in two ( 0.4 %) and 14 ( 2.8 %) samples , respectively. No age predisposition to infection with Entamoeba spp. was observed. PCR and subsequent sequencing confirmed the validity and feasibility of the nested PCR method used in this study in identifying species/subtypes of porcine Entamoeba spp.This is the first report to describe the occurrence and molecular epidemiology of Entamoeba species in pigs in China. The presence of two zoonotic E. polecki subtypes implies that pigs can be reservoirs for human E. polecki infections. More studiess are needed to better understand the transmission and public health significance of porcine Entamoeba spp..
