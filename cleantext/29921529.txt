  Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique with potential for cost-effective therapeutic neuromodulation. Although positive therapeutic effects were found by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC) , few studies have investigated physiological effects of DLPFC-tDCS. To investigate effects of tDCS with different parameter settings applied to the left DLPFC on cortical responses , measured by resting-state electroencephalography ( rs-EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS)- evoked/induced EEG responses. 22 healthy subjects underwent 5 tDCS sessions with different tDCS parameter settings in a double-blinded randomized crossover design ( 1: 1.5 mA , anode left-DLPFC , cathode right-DLPFC; 2: 1.5 mA , cathode left-DLPFC , anode right-DLPFC; 3: 0.5 mA , anode left-DLPFC , cathode right-DLPFC; 4: 1.5 mA , anode left-DLPFC , cathode left deltoid<symptom> muscle; 5: sham stimulation). Rs-EEG and TMS-EEG were recorded before and after tDCS. Rs-EEG power spectrum analysis showed no difference comparing baseline with post stimulation in any of the tDCS conditions. TMS-EEG evoked potential amplitude decreased in parietal cortex after 1.5 mA left-DLPFC anodal tDCS , and TMS-induced gamma and theta oscillations decreased after all conditions using left-DLPFC anodal tDCS. Left-DLPFC cathodal tDCS did not lead to significant change. None of the post-intervention changes was different when comparing the effects across conditions , including sham. Our study does not provide evidence that a single tDCS session results in significant changes in rs-EEG , using the current stimulation parameters. Significant changes in EEG responses to TMS pulses were observed following the anodal 1.5 mA tDCS interventions , although these changes were not statistically significant in a group comparison.
