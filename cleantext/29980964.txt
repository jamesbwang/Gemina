  We describe the implementation and impact of a province-wide program of knowledge exchange ( KE) , aimed at developing capacity for the treatment of people with eating disorders ( EDs). The program is designed to equip clinicians working in nonspecialized health-care installations with skills to evaluate and treat people with EDs. Trainings were conducted at 21 institutions. The majority of clinicians reported satisfaction with the KE program and indicated that the trainings enhanced their confidence and ability to treat patients with EDs. A subset of clinicians received case supervision with a specialist ED therapist and followed patients with EDs ( n = 119). Treated patients showed significant improvements on eating and depressive symptoms , and reported satisfaction with the treatments they received.
