  Recent progress in α-cell research has newly revealed its versatility including secretion of multiple hormones , trans-differentiation , and abundant proliferation. A recent report from the Kushner laboratory further provided direct evidence of active proliferation of α-cells in both T1D and non-diabetic control donors. α-cells are suggested to maintain both quality and quantity of islets by serving as ` guardians ' of the islets.
