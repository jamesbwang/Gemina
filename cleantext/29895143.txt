  Aroma is a primary hedonic aspect of a good coffee. Coffee aroma quality is generally defined by cup tasting , which however is time-consuming in terms of panel training and alignment and too subjective. It is challenging to define a relationship between chemical profile and aroma sensory impact , but it might provide an objective evaluation of industrial products. This study aimed to define the chemical signature of coffee sensory notes , to develop prediction models based on analytical measurements for use at the control level. In particular , the sensory profile was linked with the chemical composition defined by HS-SPME-GC-MS , using a chemometric-driven approach. The strategy was found to be discriminative and informative , identifying aroma compounds characteristic of the selected sensory notes. The predictive ability in defining the sensory scores of each aroma note was used as a validation tool for the chemical signatures characterized. The most reliable models were those obtained for woody , bitter , and acidic properties , whose selected volatiles reliably represented the sensory note fingerprints. Prediction models could be exploited in quality control , but compromises must be determined if they are to become complementary to panel tasting.
