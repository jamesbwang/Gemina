  The ` exterior-interior relationship between the lung and the large intestine ' is a classical basic theory in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of the toll like receptor/nuclear factor‑κB ( TLR/NF κB) signaling pathway in the mutual interactions between the lung and the large intestine. A rat model of allergic asthma complicated with intestinal flora disorder was established by oral administration of Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and intraperitoneal injection with ovalbumin. The number of inflammatory cells and expression levels immunoglobulin ( Ig) E , secretory IgA , interleukin ( IL) 4 and interferon‑γ in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were subsequently measured. Bacterial colonies and expression of 16S ribosomal DNA were studied in feces samples and pathological alterations of lung tissues were identified. Furthermore , the expression levels of genes associated with the TLR/NF κB signaling pathway in the lung and intestinal tissues were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study indicated that , in the rat model of allergic asthma complicated with intestinal flora disorder , the expression levels of IL‑4 and IgE , and the numbers of inflammatory cells and C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> increased , and marked inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in lung tissues , suggesting that the animal model was successfully established. Furthermore , the present results revealed the mRNA expression levels of genes associated with the TLR/NF κB signaling ( including myeloid differentiation primary response 88 , TNF receptor associated factor 6 and β‑arrestin) were upregulated in both of the lung and intestinal tissues of the model group rats. Collectively , the results demonstrated that the TLR/NF κB signaling may serve roles in the mutual interactions between the lung and the large intestine , and TLR and NF‑κB may be potential targets for the treatment of lung diseases complicated with intestinal disorders.
