  Mycorrhizal symbiosis requires several common symbiosis genes including CYCLOPS/IPD3. The reduced mycorrhizal colonisation ( rmc) tomato mutant has a deletion of five genes including CYCLOPS/IPD3 , and rmc is more susceptible to Fusarium<pathogen> wilt than its wild-type parental line. This study investigated the genetic defects leading to both fungal interaction phenotypes and whether these were separable. Complementation was performed in rmc to test the requirement for CYCLOPS/IPD3 in mycorrhiza formation and Fusarium<pathogen> wilt tolerance. Promoter analysis via GFP expression in roots was conducted to determine the role of native regulatory elements in the proper functioning of CYCLOPS/IPD3. CYCLOPS/IPD3 regulated by its native promoter , but not a 2 × 35S promoter , restores mycorrhizal association in rmc. GFP regulated by the 2 × 35S promoter is not expressed in epidermal cells of roots , indicating that expression of CYCLOPS/IPD3 in these cells is required for colonisation by the fungi<pathogen> utilised in this research. CYCLOPS/IPD3 did not restore Fusarium<pathogen> wilt tolerance , however , showing that the genetic requirements for mycorrhizal association and Fusarium<pathogen> wilt tolerance are different. Our results confirm the expected role of CYCLOPS/IPD3 in mycorrhizal symbiosis and suggest that Fusarium<pathogen> tolerance is conferred by one of the other four genes affected by the deletion.
