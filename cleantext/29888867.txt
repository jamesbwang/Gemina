  PTPRJ is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase mainly known for its antiproliferative and tumor-suppressive functions. PTPRJ dephosphorylates several growth factors and their receptors , negatively regulating cell proliferation and migration. We recently identified a disulfide-bridged nonapeptide , named PTPRJ-19 ( H- ( Cys-His-His-Asn-Leu-Thr-His-Ala-Cys)- OH) , which activates PTPRJ , thereby causing cell growth inhibition and apoptosis of both cancer and endothelial cells. With the aim of replacing the disulfide bridge by a chemically more stable moiety , we have synthesized and tested a series of lactam analogues of PTPRJ-19. This replacement led to analogues with higher activity and greater stability than the parent peptide.
