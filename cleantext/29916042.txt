  A central issue in visual and spoken word recognition is the lexical representation of complex words-in particular , whether the lexical representation of complex words depends on semantic transparency: Is a complex verb like understand lexically represented as a whole word or via its base stand<symptom> , given that its meaning is not transparent from the meanings of its parts? To study this issue , a number of stimulus characteristics are of interest that are not yet available in public databases of German. This article provides semantic association ratings , lexical paraphrases , and vector-based similarity measures for German verbs , measuring ( a) the semantic transparency between 1,259 complex verbs and their bases , ( b) the semantic relatedness between 1,109 verb pairs with 432 different bases , and ( c) the vector-based similarity measures of 846 verb pairs. Additionally , we include the verb regularity of all verbs and two counts of verb family size for 184 base verbs , as well as estimates of age of acquisition and age of reading for 200 verbs. Together with lemma and type frequencies from public lexical databases , all measures can be downloaded along with this article. Statistical analyses indicate that verb family size , morphological complexity , frequency , and verb regularity affect the semantic transparency and relatedness ratings as well as the age of acquisition estimates , indicating that these are relevant variables in psycholinguistic experiments. Although lexical paraphrases , vector-based similarity measures , and semantic association ratings may deliver complementary information , the interrater reliability of the semantic association ratings for each verb pair provides valuable information when selecting stimuli for psycholinguistic experiments.
