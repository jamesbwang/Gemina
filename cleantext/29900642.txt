  Macrocycles are an important player in supramolecular chemistry. In 2008 , a new class of macrocycles , `` pillar ( n) arenes '' , were first discovered. Research efforts in the area of pillar ( n) arenes have elucidated key properties such as their shape , reaction mechanism , host-guest properties and their versatile functionality , which has contributed to the development of pillar ( n) arene chemistry and their applications to various fields. This mini-review describes how pillar ( n) arene-based supramolecular assemblies can be applied to supramolecular gel formation , reactions , light-harvesting systems , drug delivery systems , biochemical applications , separation and storage materials and surface chemistry.
