  Many classical prescriptions still have superior clinical values nowadays , and their modern studies also have far-reaching scientific research demonstration values. Gegen decoction , a representative prescription for common cold due to wind-cold , can treat primary dysmenorrhea due to cold and dampness , characterized by continuous administration without recurrence. It is not only in accordance with the principle of homotherapy for heteropathy , but also demonstrates the unique feature of traditional Chinese medicine of relieving the primary and secondary symptoms simultaneously. This article aimed to discuss the method and strategy of Gegen decoction study based on the discovery of its novel application in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and previous research progress of our group. It was assumed that modern medicine and biology studies , as well as chemical research based on biological activity should be used for reference. Principal active ingredients ( groups) in Gegen decoction could be accurately and effectively identified , and its possible mechanism in treatment of primary dysmenorrhea could be eventually elucidated as well. Simultaneously , the theoretical and clinical advantages of traditional Chinese medicine were explored in this paper , focusing on the compatibility characteristics of Gegen decoction. The research hypothesis showed the necessity of following the characteristics and advantages of traditional Chinese medicine in the modern research and reflected the importance of basic research based on the clinical efficacy , expecting to provide some ideas and methods for reference for further modern studies of classical prescriptions.
