  Lipid derivatives of nucleoside analogs have been highlighted for their potential for effective gene delivery. A novel class of nucleobase-lipids are rationally designed and readily synthesized , comprising thymine/cytosine , an ester/amide linker and an oleyl lipid. The diversity of four nucleobase-lipids termed DXBAs ( DOTA , DNTA , DOCA and DNCA) is investigated. Besides , DNCA is demonstrated to be an effective neutral transfection material for nucleic acid delivery , which enbles to bind to oligonucleotides via H-bonding and π-π stacking with reduced toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Several kinds of nucleic acid drugs including aptamer , ssRNA , antisense oligonucleotide , and plasmid DNAs can be delivered by DXBAs , especially DNCA. In particular , G4-aptamer AS1411 encapsulated by DNCA exhibits cellular uptake enhancement , lysosome degradation reduction , cell apoptosis promotion , cell cycle phase alteration in vitro and duration prolongation in vivo , resulting in significant anti-proliferative activity. Our results demonstrate that DNCA is a promising transfection agent for G4-aptamers and exhibites bright application prospects in the permeation improvement of single-stranded oligonucleotides or plasmid DNAs.
