  Cancer is a complex<disease> disease<disease> with profound genomic alterations and extensive heterogeneity. Recent studies on a large-scale genomics have shed lights on the impact of core oncogenic pathways which are frequently dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancer types. Aberrant activation of hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) signaling axis has been associated with promoting various oncogenic programs during tumor initiation , progression , and treatment resistance. As a result , HGF-targeted therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. However , recent clinical trials involving HGF-targeted therapies have demonstrated rather disappointing results. Thus , an alternative , in-depth assessment of new patient stratification is necessary to shift the current clinical course. To address such challenges , we have evaluated therapeutic efficacy of YYB-101 , a HGF neutralizing antibody , in a series of primary glioblastoma stem cells ( GSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore , we performed genome and transcriptome analysis to determine genetic and molecular traits that exhibit vulnerability to HGF-mediated therapy. We have identified differentially expressed genes , including MET , KDR , and SOX3 which are associated with tumor invasiveness , malignancy , and unfavorable prognosis in glioblastoma patients. We also demonstrated HGF-MET signaling axis as a key molecular determinant in GSC invasion and also discovered that a significant association in HGF expression existed between mesenchymal phenotype and immune cell recruitment. Up-regulation of MET and mesenchymal cellular state are essential in generating HGF-mediated therapeutic responses. Our results provide an important framework for evaluating HGF-targeted therapy in future clinical settings.
