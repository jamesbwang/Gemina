  A new direct alkylheteroarylation of alkenes with simple alkylnitriles via distal heteroaryl ipso-migration has been accomplished under metal-free conditions , in which inexpensive alkylnitriles served as radical precursors , which together with ease of operation makes this process a very practical protocol.
