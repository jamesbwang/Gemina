  Difficulties managing medications , particularly among older adults experiencing cognitive deficits , is an important contributing factor to medication nonadherence that may have significant negative financial and health outcomes. The current study examined the performance of healthy older adults ' ( HOA) and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI) on the medication management abilities assessment 's ( MMAA , a performance-based measure of medication management) original scoring criteria and derived error process measures , assessing medication overtaking and undertaking magnitude. Exploratory correlations between performances on the MMAA and self-reported confidence in medication management skills and cognitive abilities were also examined. A sample of 25 HOAs with aMCI and 25 age- and education-matched HOAs completed the MMAA , a self-reported medication management confidence rating and a battery of neuropsychological tests. HOAs performed significantly better on the MMAA score and committed significantly less process errors than individuals with aMCI. Despite these differences in MMAA performance , the HOA and aMCI groups rated similar high levels of confidence in their ability to manage a new medication routine. Notably , while the HOA group 's performance on all of the MMAA measures did not relate to cognitive measures , the aMCI group 's performance on the MMAA score was significantly related to memory and executive functioning and a new process error score for overtaking was related to processing speed. Although these results present promising potential for the MMAA as a measure of medication management in a clinical setting , further studies need to examine the validity of the MMAA against real-world adherence measures.
