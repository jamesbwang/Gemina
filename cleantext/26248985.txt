  The stem cell-based therapy has emerged as the promising therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs). Recently , increasing evidence suggest stem cell-derived active exosomes are important communicators among cells in the heart via delivering specific substances to the adjacent/distant target cells. These exosomes and their contents such as certain proteins , miRNAs and lncRNAs exhibit huge beneficial effects on preventing heart damage and promoting cardiac repair. More importantly , stem cell-derived exosomes are more effective and safer than stem cell transplantation. Therefore , administration of stem cell-derived exosomes will expectantly be an alternative stem cell-based therapy for the treatment of CVDs. Furthermore , modification of stem cell-derived exosomes or artificial synthesis of exosomes will be the new therapeutic tools for CVDs in the future. In addition , stem cell-derived exosomes also have been implicated in the diagnosis and prognosis of CVDs. In this review , we summarize the current advances of stem cell-derived exosome-based treatment and prognosis for CVDs , including their potential benefits , underlying mechanisms and limitations , which will provide novel insights of exosomes as a new tool in clinical therapeutic translation in the future.
