  This study evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane-tazobactam and comparators against 2647 Enterobacteriaceae and 355 Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> nonduplicate isolates collected from hospitalized patients with bloodstream infections in US hospitals from 2013 to 2015.Ceftolozane-tazobactam ( 95.5 % susceptible) , amikacin ( 99.2 % susceptible) , and meropenem ( 98.4 % susceptible) were the most active against Enterobacteriaceae. For Enterobacteriaceae , 1.4 % ( n = 37) were carbapenem-resistant ( CRE) , and 10.2 % ( n = 271) exhibited an extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL) non-CRE phenotype. The most common ESBL enzyme detected was bla
