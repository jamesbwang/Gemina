  Adequate catheter-tissue contact facilitates efficient heat energy transfer to target tissue. Tissue contact is thus critical to achieving lesion<symptom> transmurality and success of radiofrequency ( RF) ablation procedures , a fact recognized more than 2 decades ago. The availability of real-time contact force ( CF)- sensing catheters has reinvigorated the field of ablation biophysics and optimized lesion<symptom> formation. The ability to measure and display CF came with the promise of dramatic improvement in safety and efficacy; however , CF quality was noted to have just as important an influence on lesion<symptom> formation as absolute CF quantity. Multiple other factors have emerged as key elements influencing effective lesion<symptom> formation , including catheter stability , lesion<symptom> contiguity and continuity , lesion<symptom> density , contact homogeneity across a line of ablation , spatiotemporal dynamics of contact governed by cardiac and respiratory motion , contact directionality , and anatomic wall thickness , in addition to traditional ablation indices of power and RF duration. There is greater appreciation of surrogate markers as a guide to lesion<symptom> formation , such as impedance fall , loss of pace capture , and change in unipolar electrogram morphology. In contrast , other surrogates such as tactile feedback , catheter motion , and electrogram amplitude are notably poor predictors of actual contact and lesion<symptom> formation. This review aims to contextualize the role of CF sensing in lesion<symptom> formation with respect of the fundamental principles of biophysics of RF ablation and summarize the state-of-the-art evidence behind the role of CF in optimizing lesion<symptom> formation.
