  Actually the lifestyle exposes the population to several risk factors related to alimentary habits and less physical activity that contributes to chronic<disease> diseases<disease> appearance worldwide. To analyze the association between salivary cortisol and the components of metabolic syndrome<disease>. This is a cross-sectional study. As part of it , 28 individuals aged 30-59 years presenting three or more of the following findings: CA: ≥ 88 cm for women and ≥ 102 cm for men; SBP > 130 mmHg and DBP > 85 mmHg; GL > 100 mg/dl; TG > 150 mg/dl; HDL < 40 mg/dl for men and < 50 mg/dl for women. Was performed analysis of salivary cortisol ( by radioimmunoassay) from 25 salivary samples collected throughout the day , for evaluating changes in the circadian rhythm of this hormone ( 8AM , noon and 8PM). 28 evaluated individuals had a mean age of 51.9 ± 7.5 years , mostly women ( 64.3 %) and a mean of BMI 33.6 ± 3.2 kg/m ². The cortisol level from the 8AM averaged 18.7 ± 4.8 ng/dlL. Individuals with FPG > 110mg/dl , have significantly lower average levels of cortisol than ones with FPG < 110 ( 12.8 ± 5,2 vs. 17.3 ± 4.2). Significant correlations were HOMA vs. WC ( r = 0,465; p˂0 ,005) and TG ( r = 0,473; p˂0 ,005) , WC vs. FG ( r = 0,446; p˂0 ,005) and BMI ( r = 0,730; p˂0 .0001); TG vs. HDL ( r = 0,441 p˂0 ,005) and FG ( r = 0,440; p˂0 ,005). Morning salivary cortisol in subjects with chronically elevated blood glucose can represent a downregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. This is an important finding not yet well investigated.
