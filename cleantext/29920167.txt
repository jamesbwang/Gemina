  Using a combination of personal reflections , published literature , and original empirical research , we argue that the disgust triggered by gay men 's sexual practices ( specifically , anal intercourse) is a critical , though overlooked , contributor to heterosexual men and women 's homonegativity ( i.e. , negative attitudes and behaviors directed toward men who are or are perceived to be gay). We conclude our article by articulating several directions for future inquiry that we believe will advance current understanding of prejudice and discrimination directed toward gay men.
