  To assess the effect of operational factors on the positivity rates of three HPV assays. Within the cross-sectional ESTAMPA study , women aged 30-64 years were recruited at healthcare centers from Soacha , Colombia , during 2012-2015. Cervical samples were collected for cotesting with Hybrid Capture 2 ( HC2; Qiagen , Gaithersburg , MD , USA) , and either Aptima ( Hologic , Marlborough , MA , USA) or Cobas 4800 ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN , USA). The effect of operational factors on assay performance was assessed using adjusted positivity rates obtained from logistic regression models. There were 4168 women included. For samples collected in assay-specific medium , positivity rate differences were associated with the expertise of the nurse collecting the sample ( P = 0.014 HC2; P = 0.091 Aptima) and if sample collection occurred after an initial cytology ( P = 0.025 HC2; P = 0.033 Aptima). If PreservCyt medium ( Hologic) was used , HC2 positivity differences were observed depending on the time between sample collection and processing ( P = 0.026) and on the laboratory technician processing the samples ( P = 0.003). No differences were observed for PreservCyt samples processed with Aptima or Cobas. Nurse expertise , collection of previous cytology , processing time , and laboratory technician could influence HPV assay performance. Suitable quality assurance protocols for HPV-based screening programs are required. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01881659.
