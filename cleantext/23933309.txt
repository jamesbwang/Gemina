  Cell autophagy and cell apoptosis are both observed in the process of hypoxia-induced ischemic cerebral infarction ( ICI). Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 ( Ulk1) and FUN14 Domain-containing Protein 1 ( FUNDC1) are both involved in the regulation of cell autophagy. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 on hypoxia-induced nerve cell autophagy and apoptosis. Cell viability was measured using cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-PE/7-ADD staining assay. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 in PC-12 cells. Cell transfection was performed to up-regulate the expression of Ulk1. 3-Methyladenine ( 3-MA) was used as autophagy inhibitor and rapamycin was used as autophagy activator in our experiments. SP600125 was used as c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) inhibitor. Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression levels of key factors that are related to cell autophagy , apoptosis and JNK pathway. We found that hypoxia simultaneously induced apoptosis and autophagy of PC-12 cells. The activation of Ulk1 and FUNDC1 were also found in PC-12 cells after hypoxia induction. Overexpression of Ulk1 promoted the activation of FUNDC1 and prevented PC-12 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Suppression of Ulk1 had opposite effects. Furthermore , we also found that JNK pathway participated in the effects of Ulk1 overexpression on PC-12 cell apoptosis reduction. To conclude , Ulk1/FUNDC1 played critical regulatory roles in hypoxia-induced nerve cell autophagy and apoptosis. Overexpression of Ulk1 prevented nerve cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis by promoting cell autophagy.
