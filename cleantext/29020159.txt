  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) had spread rapidly in the past few years in southern hemisphere where dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) had caused epidemic problems for over half a century. The high degree of cross-reactivity of Envelope ( E) protein specific antibody responses between ZIKV and DENV<pathogen> made it challenging to perform differential diagnosis between the two infections using standard ELISA method for E protein. Using an IgG capture ELISA , we investigated the kinetics of nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1) antibody response during natural ZIKV infection and the cross-reactivity to NS1 proteins using convalescent sera obtained from patients infected by either DENV<pathogen> or ZIKV. The analyses of the sequential serum samples from ZIKV infected individuals showed NS1 specific Abs appeared 2 weeks later than E specific Abs. Notably , human sera from ZIKV infected individuals did not contain cross-reactivity to NS1 proteins of any of the four DENV<pathogen> serotypes. Furthermore , four out of five NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) isolated from ZIKV infected individuals did not bind to DENV<pathogen> NS1 proteins. Only limited amount of cross-reactivity to ZIKV NS1 was displayed in 108 DENV1 immune sera at 1:100 dilution. The high degree of NS1-specific Abs in both ZIKV and DENV<pathogen> infection revealed here suggest that NS1-based diagnostics would significantly improve the differential diagnosis between DENV and ZIKV infections.
