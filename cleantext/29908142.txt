  We aimed to evaluate the effect of three extracellular cryoprotectants on the morphology of vitrified feline preantral follicles. Feline ovarian fragments ( 0.5 × 2 × 2 mm) collected from five domestic adult cats subjected to ovariohysterectomy for routine castration were vitrified with ethylene glycol ( EG) 40 % combined or not with sucrose ( 0.1 or 0.5 M) , trehalose ( 0.1 or 0.5 M) , or raffinose ( 0.1 M). After vitrification using the solid-surface method and warming of the tissues , cryoprotectants were washed out of the ovarian tissues , which were fixed for histological analysis. The percentages of normal follicles were similar to the control ( fresh) ( 62.9 ± 4.1 %) only for tissues exposed and cryopreserved with EG + trehalose at concentrations of 0.1 ( 35.8 ± 8.3 %) and 0.5 M ( 33.4 ± 5.4 %). All the other sugars decreased the percentages of morphologically normal follicles as compared to the control group and the trehalose groups. Based on the results of the present study , we recommend the use of trehalose as the extracellular cryoprotectant for the vitrification of feline ovarian tissue.
