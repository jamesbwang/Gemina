The mean follow-up time was 11.2 ( Â± 1.2). Of patients , 51 % ( n = 24) were smokers before surgery. In the follow-up 43 % ( n = 20) were smokers , of whom 4 patients began smoking after surgery. Twenty-seven patients were nonsmokers , 8 of whom quit over the years ( 33 % of previous smokers).

Thirty-two patients never smoked; 52 were smoking before surgery , yet 24 successfully quit. In both groups there were no statistically significant differences in percentage excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> between smokers and nonsmokers , or between those who quit and did not.
