  Integrated health care ( IHC) is a proposed change to the U.S. health care system to address health care disparities for individuals with mental and physical health conditions. Computer applications may provide an effective strategy to prepare social workers for the transition to IHC. An Internet-based tool , Integrated Healthcare ( Version 1.0) was developed and tested through rapid prototyping to access knowledge required for behavioral health providers to practice in IHC settings. Two focus groups ( N = 5 , N = 7) and individual interviews ( N = 5) were conducted with social work professors and students. Nielsen 's usability heuristics were used to evaluate data from focus groups and interviews , and changes were incorporated in development. The final computer application is an introduction to IHC concepts , reinforces the integrated nature of physical and behavioral health , and puts evidence-based knowledge at the point of care.
