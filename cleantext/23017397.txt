  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with dementia and cognitive impairment most common in elderly population. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed by numerous researcher , although , exact mechanism is not yet elucidated. Several studies have been indicated that neuroinflammation associated with deposition of amyloid- beta ( Aβ) in brain is a major hallmark toward the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. So , there is a need to unravel the link of inflammatory process in neurodegeneration. Increased microglial activation , expression of cytokines , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) participate in inflammatory process of AD. This review mainly concentrates on involvement of neuroinflammation and the molecular mechanisms adapted by various natural compounds , phytochemicals and herbal formulations in various signaling pathways involved in neuroprotection. Currently , pharmacologically active natural products , having anti-neuroinflammatory potential are being focused which makes them potential candidate to cure AD. A number of preclinical and clinical trials have been done on nutritional and botanical agents. Analysis of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective phytochemicals such as terpenoids , phenolic derivatives , alkaloids , glycosides , and steroidal saponins displays therapeutic potential toward amelioration and prevention of devastating neurodegeneration observed in AD.
