  To carry out rapid genetic diagnosis for a child affected with citrullinemia type Ⅰ. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained from the two-day-old child and his parents as well as 100 healthy controls. Serum ammonia<pathogen> and citrulline was determined by biochemical test and tandem mass spectrometry. Sixteen pairs of primers were designed for high-resolution melting ( HRM) analysis of all exons and adjacent intronic sequences of the ASS1 gene in the proband , parents and healthy controls. Suspected mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing , while the mRNA transcripts of the ASS1 gene were determined by reverse transcription ( RT)- PCR. Functional impact of the mutation sites was predicted with PolyPhen-2 and SIFT Blink software. Blood ammonia<pathogen> and citrulline of the proband have respectively reached 286 μmol/L and 487.69 μmol/L , which far superseded the normal values. HRM analysis and DNA sequencing have identified in the child a homozygous c. 380G > A ( p.R127Q) mutation in exon 6 of the ASS1 gene , in addition with a homozygous IVS8 +60 G > A substitution in intron 8 , while his parents were heterozygous carriers for both mutations. RT-PCR assay indicated that the IVS8 +60 G > A mutation did not result in abnormal splicing of the ASS1 gene transcripts. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the site for p.R127Q was conserved among 45 species of vertebrates and may play a crucial role in citrulline metabolism. The severe urea cycle disorder in the proband was probably due to the compound homozygous R127Q and IVS8 +60 G > A mutations of the ASS1 gene.
