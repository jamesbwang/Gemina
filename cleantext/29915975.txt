  To compare the efficacy and safety of UVA1 and narrowband UVB ( NB-UVB) therapy in the treatment of scalp psoriasis. Patients with scalp psoriasis were randomly assigned to either UVA1 or NB-UVB therapy. Both treatments were performed three times weekly for 6 weeks. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by using Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index ( PSSI) , and patient-reported quality of life ( QoL) was assessed by Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI). Totally 68 patients completed the study. Both UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy achieved a statistically significant reduction of PSSI and DLQI scores at the end of the treatment period. Compared with the NB-UVB group , the significantly greater improvements occurred in UVA1 treatment group at week 3 , although differences declined thereafter through week 10. Both UVA1 and NB-UVB therapy were well-tolerated in this study , and the occurrence of adverse events ( AEs) was uncommon. Both UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy could offer relief of scalp symptoms in patients with scalp involvement. Furthermore , UVA1 treatment could improve the clinical manifestations and QoL more quickly than NB-UVB therapy.
