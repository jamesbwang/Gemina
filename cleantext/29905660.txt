  The current study focused on the association between resilience and social functioning in patients with bipolar disorder ( BD). Forty clinically stable patients with BD type I and BD type II , as well as 40 healthy controls , matched for age , sex , and educational background were enrolled. Clinical status was assessed by the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Functioning was evaluated by the Mini International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health rating of activities and participation in mental illnesses , and the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale. Resilience was measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale. Patients demonstrated significantly lower resilience levels compared with healthy individuals. A stepwise regression analysis indicated that only resilience contributed significantly to social functioning 's outcome. Because resilience may constitute a social functioning moderator in clinically stable patients with BD , a paradigm shift toward protective factors could lead to implementation of resilience-oriented interventions designed specifically for patients with BD.
