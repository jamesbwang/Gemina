  Novel periodic mesoporous organosilicas ( PMOs) containing 1,4,5,8-Naphthalenediimide ( NDI) chromophores as an integral part of the pore walls were synthesized in acidic conditions , in the presence of inorganic tetraethyl orthosilicate , using triblock copolymer surfactant Pluronic P-123 as a template. The NDI precursor , the bridged silsesquioxane N , N '- bis ( 3-triethoxysilylpropyl) -1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide , was synthesized by reaction of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride with excess 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. A series of samples containing up to 19 % ( weight %) of NDI were prepared ( the materials were labeled PMONDIs).
