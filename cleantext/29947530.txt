  The global epidemic of diabetes is of significant concern. Diabetes associated vascular disease signifies the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. It is also the most rapidly increasing risk factor for cognitive impairment , a silent disease that causes loss of creativity , productivity , and quality of life. Small vessel disease in the cerebral vasculature plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in diabetes. Endothelin system , including endothelin-1 ( ET-1) and the receptors ( ET ( A) and ET ( B)) , is a likely candidate that may be involved in many aspects of the diabetes cerebrovascular disease. In this review , we took a brain-centric approach and discussed the role of the ET system in cerebrovascular and cognitive dysfunction in diabetes.
