  Upon reflection , a light beam embedded with m-order orbital angular momentum ( OAM) will undergo the Imbert-Fedorov ( IF) shift , which induces OAM sidebands. The energies of the neighboring (- m-1) and (- m +1) sideband modes of the reflected beam are always equal. Controllable OAM sidebands are theoretically achieved by introducing a monolayer graphene in a three-layer structure composed of air , hexagonal boron nitride , and metal. By modulating the Fermi energy of graphene , the OAM-dependent IF shift can be tuned from positive to negative values , and the OAM sideband modes can be suppressed or enhanced , since the reflectivity for perpendicular and parallel polarizations vary with the Fermi energy. These findings provide an alternative method for the control of optical OAM in the terahertz region.
