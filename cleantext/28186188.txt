  Here , MineLoC is described as a pipeline developed to generate 3D printable models of master templates for Lab-on-a-Chip ( LoC) by using a popular multi-player sandbox game & ldquo; Minecraft & rdquo;. The user can draw a simple diagram describing the channels and chambers of the Lab-on-a-Chip devices with pre-registered color codes which indicate the height of the generated structure. MineLoC converts the diagram into large chunks of blocks ( equal sized cube units composing every object in the game) in the game world. The user and co-workers can simultaneously access the game and edit , modify , or review , which is a feature not generally supported by conventional design software. Once the review is complete , the resultant structure can be exported into a stereolithography ( STL) file which can be used in additive manufacturing. Then , the Lab-on-a-Chip device can be fabricated by the standard protocol to produce a Lab-on-a-Chip. The simple polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) device for the bacterial growth measurement used in the previous research was copied by the proposed method. The error calculation by a 3D model comparison showed an accuracy of 86 %. It is anticipated that this work will facilitate more use of 3D printer-based Lab-on-a-Chip fabrication , which greatly lowers the entry barrier in the field of Lab-on-a-Chip research.
