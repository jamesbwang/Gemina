  Aims The goal of the present review was to identify studies that assess how pharmaceutical services contribute to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of published studies describing results from clinical services provided by pharmacists working with HSCT , conducted according to PRISMA guidelines ( PROSPERO registration number CRD42017062391). A search strategy was applied within PubMed , CENTRAL , EMBASE , SCOPUS , and LILACS databases in April 2017. Inclusion criteria were observational or experimental studies that addressed the following research question: `` What are a clinical pharmacist 's main contributions to HSCT? '' The quality of selected studies was evaluated using the Downs and Black checklist. Results We identified 1838 studies , and seven were included in the systematic review. The results indicated that clinical pharmacy is useful during HSCT treatment within both inpatient and outpatient settings. Pharmaceutical contributions identified included management of pharmacotherapy-related problems , participation in discussions with clinical teams , drug reconciliation , patient and team education regarding pharmacotherapy , preparation of guidelines and educational materials , and evaluation of medication adherence. These activities favored the control and prevention of pharmacotherapy-related problems , the maintenance of immunosuppressive serum levels , improvement in patients ' clinical and nutritional status , facilitated medication adherence , and provided economic and humanistic gains. Conclusions Despite the small number of articles discussing the topic under analysis , the results were unanimous in confirming the positive impact of pharmacists ' contributions to clinical practice for HSCT.
