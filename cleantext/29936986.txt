  Reliable detection of any circulatory issue threatening flap viability after free flap surgery is essential for prompt flap salvage. Currently , the gold standard of flap monitoring is clinical monitoring. However , this method presents logistical challenges to insufficient trained personnel. Auxiliary methods are becoming increasingly vital. Twelve swine pedicle myocutaneous flaps were harvested and monitored using infrared cameras to investigate the developed monitoring parameters and vascular thrombosis in the free flap model. The mean flap surface temperature after vein or artery occlusion decreased significantly , but the differences were relatively small. As a result , the difference between recorded ( flap surface temperature ( T Infrared thermal imaging has the advantages of being noninvasive , contact-free , continuous , and able to detect the whole flap surface area. Two indicators , Î”T and SD
