  The Ilizarov frame is an external fixation device , primarily used for the treatment of complex fractures. The authors postulate that the size and weight of the frame may lead to biomechanical adaptations to gait , independent to any injury. Temporospatial characteristics , kinetics and kinematics were assessed when simulating the use of an Ilizarov frame. Fifteen healthy participants performed walking trials , with and without the simulated frame. Significant changes to temporospatial characteristics were identified , with a decreased mean walking speed ( with: 1.24 m s
