  Assessment of acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor insecticide ( AChEII) toxicity depends on the measurement of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase ( RBC-AChE) activity. Its interpretation requires baseline values which is lacking in scientific literature. We aim to find the measures of central tendency and variation for RBC-AChE activity among dwellers of Anuradhapura , where the use and abuse of AChEIIs were rampant for the last few decades. A descriptive cross-sectional study with a community-based sampling for 100 healthy non-farmers ( male: female = 1:1) was done using pre-determined selection criteria. Duplicate measurements of RBC-AChE activity were performed according to the modified Ellman procedure. Pearson 's correlation and regression analysis were sort for RBC-AChE activity against its possible determinants. RBC-AChE activity had a mean of 449.8 ( SD 74.2) mU/μM Hb with a statistical power of 0.847. It was similar to values of `` healthy controls '' from previous Sri Lankan toxicological studies but was low against international reference value ( 586.1 ( SD 65.1) mU/μM Hb). None of the possible determinants showed a significant strength of relationship with RBC-AChE activity. The baseline RBC-AChE activity among people of Anuradhapura is low in comparison with international reference values. This arises a need to find a causative mechanism.
