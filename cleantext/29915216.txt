  Fludarabine is used as a common component of conditioning regimens for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). However , knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic characteristics of once-daily fludarabine dosing in children is limited. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine and evaluated its associations with clinical outcomes in paediatric patients. A total of 802 blood samples obtained from 43 paediatric patients who underwent HSCT were included in a population pharmacokinetic analysis using non-linear mixed-effects modelling. The relationships between systemic 9-Î²-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine ( F-ara-A) exposure derived from the model and the clinical outcome variables were explored. A two-compartment model with proportional residual error adequately described the pharmacokinetics of F-ara-A. The body surface area and glomerular filtration rate were significant covariates for the clearance of F-ara-A. After the first dose of fludarabine at 40 mg/m
