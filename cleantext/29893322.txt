  The purpose of this study was to identify human Cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) in tissue blocks obtained from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC). Formalin-fixed paraffin wax processed NPC tissue were obtained from 150 tissue blocks and retrospectively investigated for the presence of HCMV using polymerase chain reaction. Of the 150 NPC tissue specimens , HCMV was identified in 53/150 ( 35.3 %) of the samples. Out of the 53 samples infected with HCMV , 33/97 ( 34 %) were among males and 20/53 ( 37.7 %) were among females. Of the 53 positive samples , 36/53 ( 68 %) were found to harbor Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV). The present study has shown a relatively considerable association between HCMV and NPC. The great majority of samples sheltering HCMV were also found to hide EBV , which proposes the potentiality of EBV over HCMV.
