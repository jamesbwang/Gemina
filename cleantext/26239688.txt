  Since their discovery in 1993 , numerous microRNAs ( miRNAs) have been identified in humans and other eukaryotic organisms , and their role as key regulators of gene expression is still being elucidated. It is now known that miRNAs not only play a central role in the processes that ensure normal development and physiology , but they are often dysregulated in various diseases. In this review , we present an overview of the role of miRNAs in normal renal development and physiology , in maladaptive renal repair after injury , and in the pathogenesis of renal parenchymal diseases. In addition , we describe methods used for their detection and their potential as therapeutic targets. Continued research on renal miRNAs will undoubtedly improve our understanding of diseases affecting the kidneys and may also lead to new therapeutic agents.
