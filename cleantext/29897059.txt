  An efficient and straightforward method has been developed for the synthesis of polysubstituted phenanthridines from simple aryl iodides and alkyl/aryl nitriles via the palladium-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of aryl iodides to nitriles followed by cascade formation of C-C and C-N bonds viz. in situ generated imine directed sequential two fold C-H activation.
