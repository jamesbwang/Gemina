  Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor which shows skeletal muscle differentiation. Leptomeningeal metastasis can occur as a late complication , but currently there are no reports that have documented the cytologic features in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF). We report a case of metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosed in the CSF of a 28-year-old male who was originally diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma on the neck , and that went through systemic therapy. The tumor was positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase , but progressed despite additional therapy with crizotinib. The CSF specimen revealed small round cells , large atypical cells with abundant cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei , and cells with horseshoe-shaped nuclei. These cytologic findings were in agreement with previous literature and well-correlated with histopathology. This is the first report to document the cytologic feature of rhabdomyosarcoma in CSF. In many cases it is difficult to perform ancillary tests in a CSF specimen and cytopathologists should be aware of the cytomorphologic characteristics to avoid misdiagnosis.
