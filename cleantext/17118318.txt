  Seed migration is a common finding after low dose rate brachytherapy of the prostate. It has often been assessed soon after implantation , but little is known about late seed migration. We evaluated the incidence , site , symptoms , and therapeutic consequences of late seed migration more than 3 years postoperatively. We retrospectively examined the data of 63 unselected patients with transrectal ultrasound-guided , transperineal low dose rate brachytherapy of the prostate with stranded seeds between 2001 and 2010. A pelvic X-ray was taken the day after implantation and after 6 weeks in combination with a pelvic computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scan ( image fusion) for dosimetry. Late radiological follow-up with a further pelvic and chest X-ray was conducted 3 or more years postoperatively. We differed between seed loss without anatomical detection and seed migration into another anatomical region. We found seed loss up to 3 years and more after brachytherapy in 36 of 63 patients ( 57 %). Between one and nine seeds had been lost. Late seed migration after 3 or more years occurred in two of 36 patients ( 6 %) , with pelvic migration of one seed and extrapelvic migration of one seed to the lung and two seeds to the liver , respectively. All late seed migrations were asymptomatic and had no therapeutic consequences. Beside a frequent number of seed losses , seed migration 3 or more years after implantation was as well a frequent finding but seems to be asymptomatic. Long-term follow-up with complementary radiological controls could be helpful in detecting any rare complications.
