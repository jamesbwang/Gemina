  Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome<disease> ( PSIS) is a distinct and rare clinical entity responsible for congenital hypopituitarism resulting in deficiency of pituitary hormones with deficiency of the growth hormone ( 100 %) and gonadotropins ( 97.2 %) being its most common presentation at the time of hospital encounter ( Wang et al. , 2015). Isolated sparing of thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) with deficiency of the remaining anterior pituitary hormones may be present in PSIS , as is true in our case. Therefore , it should be kept in mind at the time of examination in suspected cases of PSIS.
