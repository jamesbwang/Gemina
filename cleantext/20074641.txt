  Heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1) is crucially involved in cell adaptation to oxidative stress and has been demonstrated to play an important role in cancer progression and resistance to therapies. We recently highlighted that undifferentiated neuroblastoma ( NB) cells are prone to counteract oxidative stress through the induction of HO-1. Conversely , differentiated NB cells were more sensitive to oxidative stress since HO-1 was scarcely upregulated. In this work , we investigated the role played by miR-494 , which has been proved to be involved in cancer biology and in the modulation of oxidative stress , in the upregulation of HO-1. We showed that NB differentiation downregulates miR-494 level. In addition , endogenous miR-494 inhibition in undifferentiated cells impairs HO-1 induction in response to exposure to 500 ÂµM H
