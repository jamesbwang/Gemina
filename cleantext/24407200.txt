  The ability to read is essential for cognitive development. To deepen our understanding of reading acquisition , we explored the neuroanatomical correlates ( cortical thickness ( CT)) of word reading fluency and sentence comprehension efficiency in Chinese with a group of typically developing children ( N = 21; 12 females and 9 males; age range 10.7-12.3 years). Then , we investigated the relationship between the CT of reading-defined regions and the cognitive subcomponents of reading to determine whether our study lends support to the multi-component model. The results demonstrated that children 's performance on oral word reading was positively correlated with CT in the left superior temporal gyrus ( LSTG) , inferior temporal gyrus ( LITG) , supramarginal gyrus ( LSMG) and right superior temporal gyrus ( RSTG). Moreover , CT in the LSTG , LSMG and LITG uniquely predicted children 's phonetic representation , phonological awareness , and orthography-phonology mapping skills , respectively. By contrast , children 's performance on sentence reading comprehension was positively correlated with CT in the left parahippocampus ( LPHP) and right calcarine fissure ( RV1). As for the subcomponents of reading , CT in the LPHP was exclusively correlated with morphological awareness , whereas CT in the RV1 was correlated with orthography-semantic mapping. Taken together , these findings indicate that the reading network of typically developing children consists of multiple subdivisions , thus providing neuroanatomical evidence in support of the multi-componential view of reading.
