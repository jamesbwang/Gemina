  To evaluate the effect of 2 % lignocaine containing 1:80,000 adrenaline on the microleakage and ultrastructure of resin tooth interface using an acetone based total etch adhesive ( Prime and Bond NT) and an ethanol water based self etch adhesive system ( Xeno III). Class V cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces of 72 maxillary first premolars scheduled for orthodontic extraction. In 36 premolars procedure was performed under local anaesthesia ( LA) and in other 36 teeth without LA. Restorations were done with hybrid composite Spectrum TPH using either Prime and Bond NT or Xeno III bonding agents. Administration of 2 % lignocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline significantly reduced microleakage and improved quality of hybrid layer and tubular penetration in Prime and Bond NT specimens; but no significant effect was observed in Xeno III specimens. Under clinical conditions , administration of LA reduced microleakage and improved quality of hybrid layer and tubular penetration in total etch adhesive systems.
