  Circulating uric acid ( UA) is positively associated with body mass index ( BMI) , blood glucose , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , markers of inflammation<symptom> , and altered lipid profile. UA has also anti-oxidative properties which might be beneficial for cardiovascular ( CV) system. It is still debated whether or not UA is independently associated with increased CV morbidity and/or mortality. We studied prognostic impact of UA in 8833 hypertensive adults ( mean age 53 Â± 12 yrs , 3857 women) from the Campania Salute Network , without prevalent CV disease and more than stage 3 CKD. We calculated standardized UA Z-score , adjusted for age , sex , glomerular filtration rate , and BMI. Low and high UA and UA Z-score quartiles were compared to the 2 middle quartiles assumed to be `` normal ''. Prevalence of obesity and diabetes was higher in low and high than in normal UA Z-score group ( all p < 0.001). Systolic BP , left ventricular mass , carotid intima thickness were significantly higher and ejection fraction was reduced in the presence of high UA Z-score ( all p < 0.001). Over 33-months average follow-up , incident major CV end-points ( MACE) were not significantly different among low , normal and high UA or UA Z-score. In the latter analysis , however , incident MACE tended to be more frequent in the low than the high UA Z-score. Despite the results of multivariable analyses , the effect of less aggressive therapy in low UA Z-score can not be excluded with certainty. In treated hypertensive patients , high levels of UA normalized for major biological determinants do not independently predict CV outcome. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02211365.
