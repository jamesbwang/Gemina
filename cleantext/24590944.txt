  To assess the patterns of emergency department ( ED) utilisation among those with and without criminal justice contact in California in 2014 , comparing variation in ED use , visit frequency , diagnoses and insurance coverage. Retrospective , cross-sectional study. Analyses included ED visits to all licensed hospitals in California using statewide data on all ED encounters in 2014. Study participants included 3 757 870 non-elderly adult ED patients who made at least one ED visit in 2014. We assessed the patterns and characteristics of ED visits among those with criminal justice contact-patients who were either admitted to or discharged from the ED by a correctional institution-with patients who did not have criminal justice contact recorded during an ED visit. ED patients with criminal justice contact had higher proportions of frequent ED users ( 27.2 % vs 9.4 %) , were at higher risk of an ED visit resulting in hospitalisation ( 26.6 % vs 15.2 %) and had higher prevalence of mental health conditions ( 52.8 % vs 30.4 %) compared with patients with no criminal justice contact recorded during an ED visit. Of the top 10 , four primary diagnoses among patients with criminal justice contact were related to behavioural health conditions , accounting for 19.0 % of all primary diagnoses in this population. In contrast , behavioural health conditions were absent from the top 10 primary diagnoses in ED patients with no observed criminal justice contact. Despite a high burden of disease , a lack of health insurance coverage was more common among those with criminal justice contact than those without ( 41.3 % vs 14.1 %). Given that a large proportion of ED patients with criminal justice contact are frequent users with considerable mental health conditions , current efforts in California 's Medicaid programme to identify individuals in need of coordinated services could reduce costly ED utilisation among this group.
