  The aim of this study was to isolate and identify lipolytic bacteria. Perform a statistical stepwise physicochemical optimization for maximum production of extracellular lipase and its validation in a bioreactor. Several lipolytic bacteria were isolated from petroleum hydrocarbon-polluted soil. The strain expressing the highest lipase activity ( 47 U ml The mesophilic and neutrophilic B. stratosphericus PSP8 isolated from petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil is a proper source of lipase. The closeness of the predicted response with that of the experimental value and the enhancement of lipase productivity in fermenter scale by approximately 1 Â· 9-fold , showed that statistically optimized design can be used in order to improve the lipase production to meet the increasing demand. The RSM-CCF statistical optimization is useful for optimizing a large number of variables and studying their interactive effects on extracellular lipase production.
