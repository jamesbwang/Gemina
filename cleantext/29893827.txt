  Low voltage areas ( LVAs) represent advanced remodelling processes in left atrium in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) and are associated with higher rates of arrhythmia recurrences. However , the prediction of LVA based on clinical parameters is understudied. Recently , we introduced APPLE score to predict rhythm outcomes after catheter ablation. The aim of this study was to analyse ( i) LVA prediction using APPLE score and ( ii) differences in biomarker profiles according to APPLE score in AF patients. Patients undergoing first AF ablation were included. The APPLE score ( one point for Age > 65 years , Persistent AF , imPaired eGFR < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 , LA diameter ≥ 43 mm , EF < 50 %) was calculated before ablation. Blood plasma samples from femoral vein were collected before ablation. Low voltage area were determined using high-density maps and defined as < 0.5 mV. NT-proANP , NT-proBNP , L-Selectin , and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 ( VCAM-1) were studied using commercially available assays. We studied 214 patients ( age median ( interquartile range) 65 ( 57-72) years , 59 % males , 59 % persistent AF , 27 % LVA). There were 42 % patients with APPLE ≥ 3. The levels of NT-proANP ( P < 0.001) , NT-proBNP ( P = 0.016) , and VCAM-1 ( P = 0.040) increased with each APPLE point. In the univariable analysis , APPLE score ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.921 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.453-2.538; P < 0.001) , female gender ( OR 2.283 , 95 % CI 1.280-4.071; P = 0.005) , and NT-proANP ( OR 1.031 , 95 % CI 1.008-1.054; P = 0.007) were significant predictors for LVA. On the multivariable analysis , only APPLE score and female gender remained associated with LVA. The APPLE score can be used for prediction of LVA before AF ablation. There was a positive correlation between biomarker levels and APPLE score.
