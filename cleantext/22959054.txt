  Endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs) and outgrowth endothelial cells ( OECs) play a pivotal role in vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues; however , their therapeutic application in clinical settings is limited due to the low quality and quantity of patient-derived circulating EPCs. To solve this problem , we evaluated whether three priming small molecules ( tauroursodeoxycholic acid , fucoidan , and oleuropein) could enhance the angiogenic potential of EPCs. Such enhancement would promote the cellular bioactivities and help to develop functionally improved EPC therapeutics for ischemic diseases by accelerating the priming effect of the defined physiological molecules. We found that preconditioning of each of the three small molecules significantly induced the differentiation potential of CD34
