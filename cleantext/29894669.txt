  Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> that leads to significant changes in metabolic activity. Succinate , an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle , has emerged as a metabolic mediator of the innate immune response. However , the involvement of succinate in the generation of the adaptive immune response and establishment of autoimmune response has not been addressed thus far. Here we demonstrated that the succinate-sensing receptor ( Sucnr1/GPR91) plays a critical role in the development of immune-mediated arthritis<disease>. We found that Sucnr1 acts as a chemotactic gradient sensor that guides dendritic cells ( DCs) into the lymph nodes , orchestrating the expansion of the T helper ( T
