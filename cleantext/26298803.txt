  Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH) is a common orthopedic disease. The lack of specific manifestations and effective diagnostic methods make it difficult for this disease to be diagnosed at early stages. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs ( miRNA) participate in the development of steroid-induced ONFH , but there is limited research into the diagnostic use of circulating miRNAs. Blood samples from 23 human subjects ( 7 systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) patients with steroid-induced ONFH; 7 SLE controls without ONFH; and 9 healthy controls) and 71 rats ( 19 with steroid-induced ONFH; 28 receiving steroids without ONFH; and 24 untreated controls) were collected to verify the abundance of changes of 6 previously identified ONFH-associated plasma miRNAs ( miR-423-5p , miR-99a-5p , miR-10a-5p , miR-21-5p , miR-130a-3p and miR-6787-5p) by quantitative RT-PCR ( Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction). In humans , the circulating levels of miR-10a-5p , miR-99a-5p and miR-21-5p were increased in SLE patients treated with cortico steroid regardless of ONFH status when compared with healthy controls. However , miR-423-5p , miR-6787-5p and miR-130a-3p showed no significant differences between the three groups. In the rat model , the success rate of steroid-induced ONFH was 40.4 % ( 19/47) based on pathological examination and confirmation by micro-CT scan. Similar to human plasma , the circulating levels of miR-10a-5p , miR-99a-5p and miR-21-5p were increased in steroid-treated rats independent of ONFH development. The serum levels of miR-10a-5p , miR-99a-5p and miR-21-5p were increased by steroid treatment regardless of ONFH development in both humans and rats. These data suggested that miR-10a-5p , miR-99a-5p and miR-21-5p are steroid-responsive circulating miRNAs , but they are not specific for diagnosing steroid-induced ONFH.
