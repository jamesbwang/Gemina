  A new strategy for the synthesis of the oxa-azabicyclo ( 3.3.1) nonane subunit , a component of the naucleamide E core structure , has been developed. This annulation reaction between 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinolines and coumarin derivatives conveniently affords the oxa-azabicyclo ( 3.3.1) nonane framework via a base-mediated cascade cyclization under aqueous conditions. The value of this work lies in the efficient formation of the oxa-azabicyclo ( 3.3.1) nonane skeleton via a process whereby all the C-C , C-O , and C-N bond formations occur in a single chemical operation. In addition , the subsequent ring opening of these compounds furnished pyridoisoquinoline derivatives.
