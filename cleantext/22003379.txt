  The deep history and early diversification of retroviruses remains elusive , largely because few retroviruses have been characterized in vertebrates other than mammals and birds. Endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs) documented past retroviral infections and thus provide ` molecular fossils ' for studying the deep history of retroviruses. Here we perform a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of ERVs within the genomes of 92 non-avian/mammalian vertebrates , including 72 fishes , 4 amphibians , and 16 reptiles. We find that ERVs are present in all the genomes of jawed vertebrates , revealing the ubiquitous presence of ERVs in jawed vertebrates. We identify a total of > 8,000 ERVs and reconstruct ~ 450 complete or partial ERV genomes , which dramatically expands the phylogenetic diversity of retroviruses and suggests that the diversity of exogenous retroviruses might be much underestimated in non-avian/mammalian vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses show that retroviruses cluster into five major groups with different host distributions , providing important insights into the classification and diversification of retroviruses. Moreover , we find retroviruses mainly underwent frequent host switches in non-avian/mammalian vertebrates , with exception of spumavirus-related viruses that codiverged with their ray-finned fish hosts. Interestingly , ray-finned fishes and turtles appear to serve as unappreciated hubs for the transmission of retroviruses. Finally , we find retroviruses underwent many independent water-land transmissions , indicating the water-land interface is not a strict barrier for retrovirus transmission. Our analyses provide unprecedented insights into and valuable resources for studying the diversification , key evolutionary transitions , and macroevolution of retroviruses.
