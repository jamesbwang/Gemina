  Immature copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ( Sod1) is activated by its copper chaperone ( Ccs1). Ccs1 delivers a single copper ion and catalyzes oxidation of an intra-subunit disulfide bond within each Sod1 monomer through a mechanistically ambiguous process. Here , we use residue specific fluorescent labeling of immature Sod1 to quantitate the thermodynamics of the Sod1 â€¢ Ccs1 interaction while determining a more complete view of Ccs1 function. Ccs1 preferentially binds a completely immature form of Sod1 that is metal deficient and disulfide reduced ( E , E-Sod1
