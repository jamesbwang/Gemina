  We report an efficient , one-step synthesis of the chelator 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-selenopyrone ( selenomaltol). Complexes of selenomaltol with Fe ( iii) , Ni ( ii) , Cu ( ii) and Zn ( ii) have been prepared and studied by NMR , X-ray crystallography , cyclic voltammetry , EPR and electronic absorption. The Ni ( ii) and Cu ( ii) complexes show chemically reversible oxidations which are suggested to be ligand-based. Nuclear independent chemical shifts ( NICS) analysis is used to compare aromaticity of the heterocyclic rings of selenomaltol and its chelates. The compounds described here should significantly expand the scope and utility of unusual O,Se-donor chelates.
