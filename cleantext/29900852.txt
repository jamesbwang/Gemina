  MD-PhD programs allow students to undergo research training and to be granted a PhD during medical education. In France , before years 2000 , the scientific training of MD-PhD students was traditionally initiated during , or even after residency. Integrated MD-PhD programs have been launched in France in 2003 by Inserm , the public scientific and technological institute dedicated to biomedical research and human health. Irrespective of the MD-PhD training pathway followed , students enrolled in these programs face several difficulties. Those mainly result from an insufficient integration of scientific and medical trainings. The aims of this work are to describe the structure of the french MD-PhD programs , identify the main difficulties faced by MD-PhD students in France , and make proposals which could facilitate the training and further strengthen the MD-PhD workforce in France.
