  Phosphoglucomutases ( PGM) ( 5.4.2.2.) belong to the Phosphohexomutases superfamily and are highly specific in catalyzing the interconversion of Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. In this study , we characterize the expression and activity of two cytosolic PGMs ( cPGM2 and cPGM3) stigmas of ornamental kale during flower development. In stigmas , cPGM expression and activity showed a gradual increase during stigma development with the highest activity around the time of anthesis. Blocking of cPGM activity in the stigmas using a known inhibitor , resulted in breakdown of self-incompatibility in immature S3 and S4 stigmas , but had no effect on the fully mature S5 stigmas. It is likely that cPGMs are required for accumulation of factors necessary for SI response in mature stigmas.
