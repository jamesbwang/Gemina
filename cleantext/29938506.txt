  Super-resolution microscopy enables imaging of structures smaller than the diffraction limit. Single-molecule localization microscopy methods , such as photoactivation localization microscopy and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy , reconstruct images by plotting the centroids of fluorescent point sources from a series of frames in which only a few molecules are fluorescing at a time. These approaches require simpler instrumentation than methods that depend on structured illumination and thus are becoming widespread. The functionalized rhodamine derivative reported in this paper spontaneously converts between a bright and dark state due to pH-dependent cyclization. At pH 7 , less than 0.5 % of the dye molecules are fluorescent at any given time. Blinking occurs on time scales of seconds to minutes and can therefore be used for single-molecule localization microscopy without sample treatment or activation. The dye is bright and straightforward to use , and it is easy to synthesize and functionalize. Thus , it has potential to become a new and powerful addition to the toolset for super-resolution imaging.
