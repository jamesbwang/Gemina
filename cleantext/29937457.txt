  Alacepril is a relatively novel angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; however , the safety , tolerance , and efficacy of alacepril in terms of cough<symptom> suppression in dogs with mitral valve disease ( MVD) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety , tolerance , and cough<symptom> suppression efficacy of alacepril in dogs with MVD. This was a multi-center , prospective study. Forty-two dogs with echocardiographic or radiographic evidence of cardiac enlargement in addition to cough were enrolled. Dogs were treated with alacepril ( 1.0-3.0 mg/kg/day) for at least 4 weeks. One dog ( 2.4 %) developed complications , including appetite<symptom> loss<symptom> , lethargy<symptom> , and vomiting<symptom>. Thirty-six dogs were re-evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment. Cough<symptom> resolved or improved in 20 dogs ( 55.6 %) after treatment. Based on the efficacy of alacepril , the dogs were divided into an effective group ( n = 20) and an ineffective group ( n = 16). After treatment , the left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter corrected for body<symptom> weight was significantly increased from baseline in the ineffective group but was significantly decreased in the effective group. Univariate binomial logistic regression analyses showed that high atrial natriuretic peptide level , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level , and E wave velocity at baseline were significantly correlated with alacepril inefficacy. Alacepril as treatment for MVD is well tolerated in most dogs , and different conditions of cardiac loading may influence the effect of the drug. Alacepril is expected to improve the quality of life of dogs with early stage MVD.
