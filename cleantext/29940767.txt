  Gastric cancer is the main leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The aberrant expression of paternally expressed gene 10 ( PEG10) is involved in development of a range of cancers. However , the potential biological function and the underling mechanism of PEG10 in human gastric carcinoma are still unknown. Knocking down LncRNA PEG10 might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer. The expression of PEG10 , miR-3200 , and AEG1 in human gastric carcinoma NCI-N87 cells were altered by cell transfection assay. Cell viability , migration , invasion , and apoptosis were determined by trypan blue exclusion , Transwell assay , and flow cytometric analysis , respectively. RNA and protein expression level of gene was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine the target gene of miR-3200. JNK and Wnt signal pathway protein expressions were tested by Western blot. The up-regulation of PEG10 was found in clinical samples. PEG10 knockdown effectively inhibited gastric carcinoma cell viability , migration , and invasion , but promoted cell apoptosis. This tumor-suppressing effect of PEG10 knockdown might be realized by up-regulating miR-3200 in vitro and in vivo. AEG1 was a direct target gene of miR-3200. Moreover , miR-3200 might suppress NCI-N87 cells by negative regulating AEG1. Up-regulating miR-3200 effectively blocked JNK and Wnt pathways likely via down-regulating AEG1. PEG10 knockdown played a carcinostatic role via up-regulating miR-3200 and further regulating AEG1 in gastric carcinoma cells , during which process , JNK pathway and Wnt pathway were blocked.
