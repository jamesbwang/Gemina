  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) are involved in the proliferative and invasive behavior of colorectal cancer ( CRC). Nonetheless , CAFs represent a heterogeneous population with both cancer-promoting and cancer-restraining actions , lacking specific markers to target them. Expression of the immune checkpoint molecule CD70 is normally limited to cells of the lymphoid lineage. Instead , tumor cells hijack CD70 to facilitate immune evasion by increasing the amount of suppressive regulatory T cells ( Tregs). The aim of this study was to explore CD70 expression patterns in CRC , not merely focusing on the tumor cells , but also taking the tumor stromal cells into account. We have analyzed the prognostic value of CD70 expression by immunohistochemistry in CRC specimens and its relationship with well-known fibroblast markers and Tregs. In addition ,
