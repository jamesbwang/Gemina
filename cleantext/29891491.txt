  Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 ( AKR1C3) also known as type 5 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is responsible for intratumoral androgen biosynthesis , contributing to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) and eventual chemotherapeutic failure. Significant upregulation of AKR1C3 is observed in CRPC patient samples and derived CRPC cell lines. As AKR1C3 is a downstream steroidogenic enzyme synthesizing intratumoral testosterone ( T) and 5α-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT) , the enzyme represents a promising therapeutic target to manage CRPC and combat the emergence of resistance to clinically employed androgen deprivation therapy. Herein , we demonstrate the antineoplastic activity of a potent , isoform selective and hydrolytically stable AKR1C3 inhibitor ( E) -3- ( 4- ( 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl) -3- ( 3-phenylpropanamido) phenyl) acrylic acid ( KV-37) which reduces prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo , and sensitizes CRPC cell lines ( 22Rv1 and LNCaP1C3) towards the anti-tumor effects of enzalutamide. Crucially , KV-37 does not induce toxicity in non-malignant WPMY-1 prostate cells nor does it induce weight<symptom> loss<symptom> in mouse xenografts. Moreover , KV-37 reduces androgen receptor ( AR) transactivation and prostate specific antigen ( PSA) expression levels in CRPC cells lines indicative of a therapeutic effect in prostate cancer. Combination studies of KV-37 with enzalutamide reveal a very high degree of synergistic drug interaction that induces significant reduction in prostate cancer cell viability via apoptosis , resulting in > 200-fold potentiation of enzalutamide action in drug resistant 22Rv1 cells. These results demonstrate a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of drug resistant CRPC that invariably develops in prostate cancer patients following initial treatment with AR antagonists such as enzalutamide.
