  A supported community gardening program became appealing and therapeutically beneficial to people living with the impacts of dementia and their carers , despite not targeting either cohort specifically. This paper discusses how this program provides insights into the landscape of dementia inclusivity. The gardens involved were spaces that allowed positive risk-taking opportunities , respectful intersubjectivity and active citizenship. Our research findings indicate that a meaningful response to the rising incidence of dementia may be to build upon social and geographical attributes of community gardens. Understanding the multifaceted nature of a dementia inclusive landscape will enable authentic engagement and rights-based support for people living with the impacts of dementia.
