  Cardiovascular disease still represents , together with cancer , a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Atherosclerosis is a silent progressive process , which can start in early life and usually progresses with advancing age. Besides genetic predisposition , atherosclerosis is accelerated by the presence of several modifiable risk factors such as smoking , dyslipidaemia , arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Asymptomatic atherosclerosis may lead to an acute event , mostly due to plaque rupture and secondary thrombosis. If the thrombus is occlusive , according to the artery where it occurs , the acute complication involves most often an acute coronary event or an ischaemic stroke. Major cardiovascular events ( MACEs) represent the primary outcome in a majority of clinical trials. Some populations , as patients with type 2 diabetes , are especially prone to these complications due to atherothrombosis linked to subclinical accelerated atherosclerosis. In most cases , an emergency intervention is mandatory to avoid premature death or irreversible sequelae.
