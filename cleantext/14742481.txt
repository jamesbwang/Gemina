  Potato is prone to many drastic diseases like potato common scab ( CS). As no highly effective methods exist for managing CS , this study explored the possibility of using biological control. Ten bacterial strains were isolated from CS-infected potato tubers from four different locations of Punjab , Pakistan , and identified based on biochemical and molecular analysis. Analysis of 16s rDNA sequences amplified by PCR revealed the isolated bacterial strains to be
