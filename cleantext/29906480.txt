  To compare the risk of mortality among men treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) with 5?- reductase inhibitors ( 5ARI) to those treated with alpha-blockers ( AB) in community practice settings. We employed a retrospective matched cohort study in 4 regions of an integrated healthcare system. Men ages 50 years and older who initiated pharmaceutical treatment for BPH/LUTS between 1992 and 2008 and had at least 3 consecutive prescriptions were eligible and followed through 2010 ( N = 174,895). Adjusted hazard ratios ( HR) were used to estimate the risk of mortality due to all-causes associated with 5?- reductase inhibitor use ( with or without concomitant alpha-blockers) as compared to alpha-blocker use. In this large and diverse sample with 543,523 person-years of follow-up , 35,266 men died during the study period , 18.9 % of the 5ARI users and 20.4 % of the AB users. After adjustment for age , medication initiation year , race , region , prior AB history , Charlson score and comorbidities , 5ARI use was not associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared to AB use ( Adjusted HR: 0.64 , 95 % CI: 0.62 , 0.66). Among men receiving medications for BPH in community practice settings , 5?- reductase inhibitor use was not associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared to alpha-blocker use. These data provide reassurance about the safety of using 5ARIs in general practice to manage BPH/LUTS.
