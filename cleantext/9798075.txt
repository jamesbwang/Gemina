  Several domains of cognitive function , e.g. , verbal memory , information processing , fluency , attention , and executive function are impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia have attracted interests as a treatment target , because they are considered to greatly affect functional outcome. Electrophysiological markers , including electroencephalogram ( EEG) , particularly , event-related potentials , have contributed to psychiatric research and clinical practice. In this review , we provide a summary of studies relating electrophysiological findings to cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Electrophysiological indices may provide an objective marker of cognitive processes , contributing to the development of effective interventions to improve cognitive and social outcomes. Further efforts to understand biological mechanisms of cognitive disturbances , and develop effective therapeutics are warranted.
