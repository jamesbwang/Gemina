  Fucoidan is a hetero-sulfated polysaccharide found in brown algae<pathogen> and has received much attention as an ingredient in functional and health foods. The marine bacterial strain Luteolibacter algae<pathogen> H18 degrades fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus. We purified the fucoidanase from a cell-free extract of L. algae<pathogen> H18 , used it to decrease the molecular weight of deacetylated-fucoidan , determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme , and identified the gene involved in the degradation of fucoidan , fct114 , in a draft genome sequence of strain H18. The gene product was heterologously produced in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and demonstrated to catalyze the degradation of deacetylated-fucoidan into lower molecular weight fragments. The mass of the gene product Fct114 is 112 kDa ( 1026 amino acid residues). The general properties of the enzyme were investigated by measuring the amount of reducing ends produced from deacetylated-fucoidan during the reaction. The enzyme was inactive toward fucoidans from other brown seaweed species or toward polysaccharides such as alginic acid , carrageenan , hyaluronic acid , and chondroitin sulfate. The amino acid sequence of Fct114 shared less than 25 % identity and had no conserved motifs when compared with previously identified fucoidanases from other marine bacterial strains. These data suggest that Fct114 is a novel polysaccharide-degrading enzyme.
