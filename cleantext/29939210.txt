  The many thousands of high-quality genomes available nowadays imply a shift from single genome to pan-genomic analyses. A basic algorithmic building brick for such a scenario is online search over a collection of similar texts , a problem with surprisingly few solutions presented so far. We present SOPanG , a simple tool for exact pattern matching over an elastic-degenerate string , a recently proposed simplified model for the pan-genome. Thanks to bit-parallelism , it achieves pattern matching speeds above 400MB/s , more than an order of magnitude higher than of other software. SOPanG is available for free from: https://github.com/MrAlexSee/sopang. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
