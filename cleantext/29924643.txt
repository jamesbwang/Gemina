Diabetes-related knowledge of Polish national mountain<disease> leaders. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000 , 2018.-Mountain trekking is a popular activity for patients with diabetes. In Poland , mountain<disease> leaders often accompany organized groups to ensure their safety during treks; we aimed to evaluate their competency in caring for diabetic clients by assessing their diabetes-related knowledge. This was a cross-sectional study among Polish , certified , active mountain<disease> leaders carried out by means of an anonymous , standardized 41-item questionnaire adapted from a study by Wee et al.. It was distributed through e-mail to 500 leaders. A total of 106 ( 21.2 %) mountain<disease> leaders completed the questionnaire ( males 60.4 %) with a mean ( standard deviation ( SD)) age of 38.6 ( 13.5) years. Their mean ( SD) length of experience acting as a mountain<disease> leader was 11.9 ( 10.2) years. The average score was 72.4 % of the maximum possible ( 29.7 of 41 points). Results varied significantly depending on gender ( p = 0.006). The percentage of correct answers among questions in each section varied between 23.6 % and 100 %. The main sources of diabetes-related knowledge identified by respondents were members of their family and their friends who suffer from diabetes ( 33 %). First aid courses were indicated as sources of information by only 12.6 % of the informants. Results of the questionnaire revealed that respondents did have a reasonable level of diabetes-related knowledge. There were topics in which the respondents achieved lower than an average score , demonstrating a need for further education.
