  The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of nanoparticles in several chronic<disease> diseases<disease> have been extensively researched. The aim of this review is to examine how nanoparticles modulate the inflammatory pathways that characterize the most prevalent forms of microcrystal-induced arthritis<disease> , including gout , pseudogout , and BCP-induced arthritis<disease>. The nanoparticles of chitosan-coated calcium phosphate , uricase , aceclofenac , and gold have been investigated in crystal-inducedarthritis. The most important results of the studies outlined in this review show that nanoparticles can inhibit the expression and the release of some pro-inflammatory mediators and proteolytic enzymes , and the activity of different transcriptional factors in vitro , as well as decrease the uric acid levels in several studies of in vitro and in vivo models of gout , which show interesting results in terms of decreasing the amount of crystals and tissue damage , respectively. In view of their multiple beneficial effects , nanoparticles can be considered a valuable therapy that contributes to the pharmacological treatment in crystalinduced
