  The transformation effects of metal ions and temperature on the DNA base guanine ( G) metal-organic coordination motifs in water have been investigated by scanning tunneling microcopy ( STM). The G molecules form an ordered hydrogen-bonded structure at the water-highly oriented pyrolytic graphite interface. The STM observations reveal that the canonical G/9H form can be transformed into the G/ ( 3H ,7 H) tautomer by increasing the temperature of the G solution to 38.6 Â°C. Moreover , metal ions bind with G molecules to form G
