  Endothelial dysfunction and the related increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production are important events in the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus ( DM). Methylene blue ( MB) has been systematically investigated for its protective effects against refractory hypotension<symptom> and mitochondrial dysfunction. We have previously demonstrated that MB improved mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and partially decreased oxidative stress in diabetic rat hearts. The present study was aimed to investigate whether MB modulates vascular function and ROS production in thoracic aortic rings isolated from rats with streptozotocin-induced DM ( after 4 weeks of hyperglycemia). The effects of MB ( 0.1 Î¼M , 30 min ex vivo incubation) on vascular reactivity in organ chamber ( phenylephrine-induced contraction , acetylcholine-induced relaxation) and H
