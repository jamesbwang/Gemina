  Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Large intracranial arterial stenosis ( ICAS) is a major cause of stroke. This study investigated the prevalence and associated vascular risk factors of ICAS in a high-risk population in Qalyeubia Governorate , Egypt. A cross-sectional pilot survey using transcranial Doppler ( TCD) was conducted at Toukh Central Hospital and Aghore El-qubra primary healthcare units in the Qalyeubia Governorate from 1 January 2016 until the end of June 2016. A total of 153 participants were included in this study. The prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS was 13.1 %. Among the modifiable risk factors , cardiac diseases , hypertension , diabetes , obesity , dyslipidemia , physical inactivity , and smoking were the strongest independent predictors of ICAS. This pilot study concluded that the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS is relatively high in Egypt , and modifiable risk factors were the strongest predisposing factors of ICAS. TCD is an efficient non-invasive modality for the diagnostic evaluation of ICAS.
