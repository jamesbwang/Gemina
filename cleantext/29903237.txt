  To explore the effects of medium-chain fatty acid ( MCFA) on high-density-lipoprotein ( HDL) in serum , liver and small intestine in Sprague Dawley rats fed with high fat diet. Thirty obese rats were divided into 3 groups randomly , and were fed high fat diet mixed with 2 % octanoic acid , 2 % decanoic acid , 2 % oleic acid respectively for 8 weeks. The levels of blood HDL , apolipoprotein A1 ( ApoA1) , apolipoprotein A2 ( ApoA2) , triglyceride ( TG) , total cholesterol ( TC) , high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c) in serum were measured at the fourth and eighth week. The levels of HDL , ApoA1 , and ApoA2 in liver and small intestine were measured by ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of ApoA1 and ApoA2 in liver and small intestine from rats at the eighth week. At the eighth week , significant decreases in levels of serum TG and TC were observed in octanoic acid and decanoic acid groups as compared with oleic acid group ( P < 0. 05). Greater increases in levels of serum HDL and HDL-c/LDL-c were observed in octanoic acid group than in oleic acid group ( P < 0. 05). Greater increases in protein expression of HDL and ApoA1 and in mRNA expression of ApoA1 in small intestine were observed in octanoic acid group than in oleic acid group ( P < 0. 05). MCFA can elevate the levels of HDL , HDL-c/LDL-c in serum , and increase the expressions of HDL and ApoA1 in small intestine.
