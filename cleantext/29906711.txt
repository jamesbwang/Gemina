  The condylar cartilage is a key site of growth and development of the mandible. The aim of this research was to determine the mRNA expression levels of a number of chondrogenic and osteogenic regulatory factors in the condylar cartilage of the postnatal rat. Condyles were extracted from 40 rats aged 4 , 10 , 21 or 90 days with 10 rats assigned to each age group. The condyles from one rat from each age group was fixed and decalcified in 10 % EDTA for histology. Using cryogenic grinding combined with QIAzol reagent total RNA was purified from pooled samples collected for each age group. Each pool contained six condyles ( N = 3). mRNA expression levels for 28 genes were determined using qPCR. Histological analysis revealed distinct morphological differences in the condyle tissue of the 4 , 10 , 21 and 90 day old postnatal rats. Expression of all examined genes was detected. High levels of mRNA for Alpl , Bglap , Col1a1 , Col2a1 , Runx2 , Sox9 and Sp7 but not Msx1 were detected. Fgf1 and Fgf2 were expressed at a similar level. No significant difference ( defined as Â± fold-regulation > 2 and P < 0.05) in the gene mRNA expression levels was found when days 10 , 21 or 90 were compared to day 4. Apparent morphological changes of the rat condylar cartilage are not reflected in a change in the expression levels of the chondrogenic and osteogenic regulatory factor mRNA investigated in this study.
