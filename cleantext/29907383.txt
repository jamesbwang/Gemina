  Greenland is not only the largest island<disease> in the world , it is also the least densely populated country on the globe. The majority of Greenland 's landmass lies within the Arctic Circle. Weather conditions in Arctic areas can be extreme , thus exposing locals and visitors to a high risk of acquiring frostbite injuries. More than two thirds of Greenland is covered by a permanent ice sheet , and temperatures can drop to below -70 Â°C. In addition , frequent storms , occupational exposure , and alcohol all contribute to an increased risk for frostbite injury. Frostbite may cause major morbidity , including tissue loss and limb amputation. Hence , proper diagnosis and treatment of frostbite injuries is of utmost importance. We present 6 cases of frostbite injuries in Greenland , ranging from mild to severe frostbite in both locals and foreign visitors. The cases illustrate some of the known risk factors for frostbite injuries. The etiology , pathophysiology , clinical presentation , and recommended management of frostbite are summarized. Novel treatments for frostbite and frostbite sequelae are discussed in the context of the Greenlandic healthcare system. Furthermore , cultural aspects and reasons for a seemingly low incidence of frostbite injuries in Greenland are explored.
