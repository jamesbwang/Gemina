  To evaluate the musculoskeletal discomfort , work ability and residual fatigue<symptom> in nursing professionals working in the hospital setting. Cross-sectional study with professionals from a medium-sized public hospital. The Nordic symptom questionnaire , the work ability index , and the need for recovery scale ( fatigue<symptom>) were used. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferential tests were applied in order to verify the association of fatigue<symptom> and work ability , and compare the fatigue<symptom> among sectors analyzed. Participation of 110 professionals in the study. A total of 86.24 % of workers reported musculoskeletal discomfort , with a higher prevalence in the cervical , thoracic and lumbar spine. Approximately 43 % of professionals presented residual fatigue<symptom>. There was a significant association between fatigue<symptom> and reduction of work ability ( p < 0.003) , as well as association between younger age and greater fatigue<symptom> ( p < 0.03). Results demonstrated a high prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort in the previous year and a considerable number of professionals with residual fatigue<symptom>. There was a substantial portion of workers with moderate work ability and requiring attention in the medium term.
