  Several interfacial phenomena are active during polymeric foaming , the dynamics of which significantly influence terminal stability , cell structure , and in turn the thermomechanical properties of temporally evolved foam. Understanding these dynamics is important in achieving desired foam properties. Here , we introduce a method to simultaneously portray the time evolution of bubble growth , lamella thinning , and plateau border drainage , occurring during reactive polymeric foaming. In this method , we initially conduct bulk and surface shear rheology under polymerizing and nonfoaming conditions. In a subsequent step , foaming experiments were conducted in a rheometer. The microscopic structural dimensions pertaining to the terminal values of the dynamics of each interfacial phenomena are then measured using a combination of scanning electron microscopy , optical microscopy , and imaging ellipsometry , after the foaming is over. The measured surface and bulk rheological parameters are incorporated in time evolution equations that are derived from mass and momentum transport occurring when a model viscoelastic fluid is foamed by gas dispersion. Analytical and numerical solutions to these equations portray the dynamics. We demonstrate this method for a series of reactive polyurethane foams generated from different chemical sources. The effectiveness of our method is in simultaneously obtaining these dynamics that are difficult to directly monitor because of short active durations over multiple length scales.
