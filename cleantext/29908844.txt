  Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that express self-antigens ( SAgs) and donor human leukocyte antigens. Tissue-specific exosomes can be detected in the circulation following lung , heart , kidney and islet cell transplantations. We collected serum samples from patients who had undergone lung ( n = 30) , heart ( n = 8) , or kidney ( n = 15) transplantations to isolate circulating exosomes. Exosome purity was analyzed by Western blot , using CD9 exosome-specific markers. Tissue-associated lung SAgs , collagen V ( Col-V) and K-alpha 1 tubulin ( Kα1T) , heart SAgs , myosin and vimentin , and kidney SAgs , fibronectin and collagen IV ( Col-IV) , were identified using western blot. Lung transplant recipients diagnosed with bronchiolitis<disease> obliterans syndrome<disease> had exosomes with higher expression of Col-V ( 4.2-fold) and Kα1T ( 37.1-fold) than stable. Exosomes isolated from heart transplant recipients diagnosed with coronary artery vasculopathy had a 3.9-fold increase in myosin and a 4.7-fold increase in vimentin compared with stable. Further , Kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with transplant glomerulopathy had circulating exosomes with a 2-fold increased expression of fibronectin and 2.5-fold increase in Col-IV compared with stable. We conclude that circulating exosomes with tissue associated SAgs have the potential to be a noninvasive biomarker for allograft rejection.
