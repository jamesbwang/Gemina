  A transition-metal-free tandem process for the synthesis of substituted quinolin-4 ( 1 H)- ones or enaminones is presented. A base-promoted insertion of ynones into the C-N Ïƒ-bond of amides is the key step in this process , which provides the corresponding aminoacylation products in good to high yields. Quinolin-4 ( 1 H)- ones are selectively formed via the subsequent N-cyclization pathway in the cases of ynones bearing an ortho-bromo-substituted aryl ring. Easily accessible starting materials and high atom economy make this procedure attractive.
