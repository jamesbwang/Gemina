  In this paper we propose and demonstrate two alternative methods for the high-precision calibration of fiber Bragg grating ( FBG) interrogators. The first method is based on the direct comparison between the wavelength measurements of the interrogator under test and a calibrated wavemeter , while analyzing a simulated symmetric Bragg grating constructed by a tunable filter and a fiber mirror. This first method is applicable to most commercial systems but presents an uncertainty limited by the spectral width and the wavelength stability of the tunable filter. The second method consists in measuring multiple reference absorption lines of calibrated absorption gas cells. This second method presents lower uncertainties , limited only by the optical resolution of the interrogator and the wavelength uncertainty of the reference cell absorption lines. However , it imposes more restrictive requirements on the interrogator software. Both methods were experimentally demonstrated by calibrating multiple commercial systems , reaching uncertainties down to 0.63 pm at a central wavelength of 1550 nm.
