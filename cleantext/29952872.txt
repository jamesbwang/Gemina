Acute and delayed effects of a resistance training session leading to muscular failure on mechanical , metabolic , and perceptual responses. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study explored the acute and delayed ( 24 and 48 hours after exercise) effects of a resistance training session leading to muscular failure. Eleven resistance-trained men completed a training session consisting on 3 sets of repetitions to failure during the back-squat exercise performed at the maximum possible speed with a load equivalent to a mean propulsive velocity ( MPV) of 1 m · s ( ≈ 60 % of 1 repetition maximum). A number of mechanical ( number of repetitions and starting MPV of the set , MPV achieved against the 1MPV load , countermovement jump ( CMJ) height , and handgrip strength) , metabolic ( lactate , uric acid , and ammonia<pathogen> concentrations) , and perceptual ( OMNI-RES perceived exertion) variables were measured. The results revealed ( a) a decrease of 38.7 % in set 2 and 54.7 % in set 3 of the number of repetitions performed compared with the first set ( p < 0.05) , ( b) a reduction in the MPV of the repetitions and an increase in lactate concentration and OMNI-RES values with the succession of sets ( p < 0.05) , ( c) comparable decrements in CMJ height after the 3 sets ( 25-32 %) , ( d) a decrease in CMJ height ( p < 0.05; 6.7-7.9 %) and in the MPV attained against the 1MPV load ( p < 0.05; 13-14 %) after 24 and 48 hours of completing the training session , but no significant changes were observed in handgrip strength ( p > 0.05; < 2 %) , and ( e) uric acid and ammonia<pathogen> concentrations above the basal levels ( p < 0.05). The large decrements in mechanical performance together with the high metabolic stress discourage the frequent use of resistance training sessions leading to muscular failure.
