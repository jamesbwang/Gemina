  The diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection ( PJI) is still a challenge in some patients after total joint replacement. Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) strongly participates in the arrangement of the host-bacteria response. Therefore , increased levels of IL-6 should accompany every PJI. The aim of the study was to show diagnostic characteristics of serum IL-6 for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection ( PJI). We also compared the diagnostic values of serum IL-6 with synovial IL-6 ( sIL-6) and synovial C-reactive protein ( sCRP). We performed a prospective study of 240 patients in whom serum IL-6 was determined before total hip ( n = 124) or knee ( n = 116) reoperations. The PJI diagnosis was based on the MSIS ( Musculoskeletal Infection Society) criteria ( 2011). Receiver operating characteristic plots were constructed for IL-6 , sIL-6 , and sCRP. PJI was diagnosed in 93 patients , and aseptic revision was diagnosed in 147 patients. The AUC ( area under curve) for IL-6 was 0.938 ( 95 % CI; 0.904-0.971). The optimal IL-6 cut-off value for PJI was 12.55 ng/L. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for IL-6 were 8.24 ( 95 % CI; 4.79-14.17) and 0.15 ( 95 % CI; 0.09-0.26) , respectively. The optimal sIL-6 and sCRP cut-off values were 20,988 ng/L and 8.80 mg/L , respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for sIL-6 were 40.000 ( 95 % CI; 5.7-280.5) and 0.170 ( 95 % CI; 0.07-0.417) , respectively. Negative likelihood ratio for sCRP was 0.083 ( 95 % CI; 0.022-0.314). The present study identified the cut-off values for serum/synovial IL-6 and synovial CRP for diagnostics of PJI at the site of THA and TKA and separately for each site. The diagnostic odds ratio for serum/synovial IL-6 and synovial CRP is very good. Simultaneous positivity of serum IL-6 either with synovial IL-6 or synovial CRP almost excludes false negative detection of PJI at the site of interest.
