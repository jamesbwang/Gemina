  To assess the impact of MALDI-TOF MS coupled with antimicrobial stewardship on clinical outcomes for pediatric inpatients with bloodstream infections. Outcomes of pediatric inpatients were compared before and after MALDI-TOF MS implementation. Outcomes measured included time until organism identification and susceptibility , duration of antibiotics , patient length of stay ( LOS) , mortality and hospital costs. 210 and 135 patient events were compared pre- and post-intervention. Average time to organism identification decreased from 41 to 11 hours ( P = < 0.0001). Time to i) susceptibilities decreased from 50.8 to 37.7 hours ( P = < 0.0001) , ii) de-escalation of antibiotics decreased from 58 to 23 hours ( P = < 0.0001) , iii) discontinuation of unnecessary antibiotics decreased from 49 to 20 hours ( P = < 0.0001). Infection-related LOS decreased from 10.5 to 8.37 days ( P = 0.006). No significant differences were seen for other outcomes. MALDI-TOF MS identification of bacteria from blood culture broth improves time to appropriate antibiotic treatment for pediatric inpatients.
