  The inhibitory effects of cancer on T cell metabolism have been well established , but the metabolic impact of immunotherapy on tumor cells is poorly understood. Here , we developed a CD4 + T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy protocol that was curative for mice with implanted colorectal tumors. By conducting metabolic profiling on tumors , we show that adoptive immunotherapy profoundly altered tumor metabolism , resulting in glutathione depletion and accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in tumor cells. We further demonstrate that T cell-derived tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) can synergize with chemotherapy to intensify oxidative stress and tumor cell death in an NADPH ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen) oxidase-dependent manner. Reduction of oxidative stress , by preventing TNF-α-signaling in tumor cells or scavenging ROS , antagonized the therapeutic effects of adoptive immunotherapy. Conversely , provision of pro-oxidants after chemotherapy can partially recapitulate the antitumor effects of T cell transfer. These findings imply that reinforcing tumor oxidative stress represents an important mechanism underlying the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.
