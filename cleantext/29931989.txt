  Schwannoma is a mesenchymal tumor that is mainly located in the peripheral nerves or the central nervous system. Its retroperitoneal location is rare and commonly asymptomatic. Thus , it is usually diagnosed when imaging tests are performed for other purposes. The clinical course of Schwannoma is benign but it also has malignant potential. Therefore , surgical resection is the treatment of choice. The definitive diagnosis is anatomopathological. In this context , we present a patient with retroperitoneal Schwannoma.
