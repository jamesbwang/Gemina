  The continuous flow synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients , value-added chemicals , and materials has grown tremendously over the past ten years. This revolution in chemical manufacturing has resulted from innovations in both new methodology and technology. This field , however , has been predominantly focused on synthetic organic chemistry , and the use of biocatalysts in continuous flow systems is only now becoming popular. Although immobilized enzymes and whole cells in batch systems are common , their continuous flow counterparts have grown rapidly over the past two years. With continuous flow systems offering improved mixing , mass transfer , thermal control , pressurized processing , decreased variation , automation , process analytical technology , and in-line purification , the combination of biocatalysis and flow chemistry opens powerful new process windows. This Review explores continuous flow biocatalysts with emphasis on new technology , enzymes , whole cells , co-factor recycling , and immobilization methods for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals , value-added chemicals , and materials.
