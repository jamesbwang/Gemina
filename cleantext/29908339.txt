  To analyze the effect that the introduction of minimally invasive procedures has had on surgical and oncological outcomes when compared with conventional open radical hysterectomy ( ORH) in a national reference cancer after 17 years of experience in radical hysterectomy ( RH). A prospective controlled study ( Canadian Task Force II-2) SETTING: A university teaching hospital PATIENTS: All patients that underwent RH as primary treatment for cervical cancer in our institution between May 1999 and June 2016 , with a total of 188 patients. Patients underwent an open radical hysterectomy ( ORH) or minimally invasive surgery ( MIS): laparoscopic ( LRH) or robotically assisted radical hysterectomy ( RRH). 76 patients underwent an ORH , 90 LRH and 22 RRH. Blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and hospital stay were inferior in the MIS group ( p < .0001). The laparotomic group presented shorter operation times ( p = .0001). With a median follow-up of 112.4 months a total of 156 patients ( 83 %) were alive and free of disease at the time of the data analysis. Overall survival was higher in the MIS group when compared with the ORH group ( 91 vs 78.9; p = .026). There were no differences regarding recurrence rates between surgical approaches. With one of the largest follow-up periods in the literature , this study provides added evidence that minimally invasive surgery could become the preferable surgical approach for early stage cervical cancer , since it appears to reduce morbidity without affecting oncological results.
