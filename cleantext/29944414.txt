  Memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> in schizophrenia has been linked to abnormal functioning of fronto-temporal networks. In this pilot study , we investigated whether 12-weeks of exercise improved hippocampal-dependent memory functions and resting-state functional connectivity in middle-aged adults with schizophrenia. The exercise regimen was feasible , well-attended , and safe. There was a pre- to post-intervention increase in spatial memory accuracy that was correlated to an increase in hippocampal-prefrontal cortex connectivity. No increase was found in pattern separation performance or hippocampal volume. A controlled trial is needed to replicate these findings and elucidate the functional brain networks underlying exercise-induced cognitive improvement in schizophrenia.
