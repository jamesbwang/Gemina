  This study aimed to develop an HPLC method for simultaneous determination of the 3 components in Ziziphora bungeana. The optimum HPLC condition was as follows ： ZORBAX SB-C ₁₈ column （ 4.6 mm × 250 mm , 5.0 μm ） with gradient elution of methanol ( A) -0.2 % glacial acetic acid ( B) , detection wavelength 340 nm , column temperature 30 °C , flow rate 1 mL · min ⁻¹. There were good linearity between peak areas and injection quantity of caffeic acid , rosmarinic acid , and linarin in the range of 2-40 mg · L ⁻¹ （
