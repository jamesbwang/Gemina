  The breast cancer risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies explain only a small fraction of the familial relative risk , and the genes responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. To identify novel risk loci and likely causal genes , we performed a transcriptome-wide association study evaluating associations of genetically predicted gene expression with breast cancer risk in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry. We used data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project to establish genetic models to predict gene expression in breast tissue and evaluated model performance using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of the 8,597 genes evaluated , significant associations were identified for 48 at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P < 5.82 Ã— 10
