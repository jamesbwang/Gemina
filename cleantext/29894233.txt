  NHS trusts across the country are facing unprecedented financial pressures , along with rising levels of demand and widespread variation in surgical quality and cost. There is a moral and financial imperative to provide the most efficient use of resources in order to ensure sustainability of a system that is free at the point of use , and provide consistently high-value care for patients across the country. Delivering ` value ' does not mean any reduction in the quality of care- it means achieving the same or higher quality at the same or lower cost. Avoidable and costly incidents in surgery occur every day: patients do not receive the right care , procedures or tests are performed without real benefit , complications lead to prolonged hospital stays , to readmissions and re-interventions. Put simply: poor quality surgical care is expensive. The concept of value-based health care is well known in the UK , yet its principles are not yet fully embedded in the health-care system , surgical training or practice. The shift towards better value-based care with a focus on delivery system reform ( Getting It Right First Time) , outcomes-based commissioning and payment reform ( accountable care systems and integrated care systems) provides an opportunity to make significant improvements in surgical care. Radical and immediate change is required , and everyone , from trainees at the frontline , to clinical leaders , trust chief executives , local commissioners and policy-makers , has vital roles to play. The health-care system needs to be designed , organized and paid for differently to deliver better surgical value for patients.
