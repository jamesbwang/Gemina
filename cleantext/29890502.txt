  Muscular fatigue<symptom> impacts on normal shoulder function , which is particularly pertinent to throwing athletes. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between grip strength and shoulder muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> to evaluate the role of grip strength as a surrogate measure for upper limb performance. Twenty healthy participants were recruited. EMG was recorded from 15 shoulder muscles during different fatiguing contractions: an initial baseline recording ( Fat-Baseline); after a shoulder exhausting exercise regime ( Fat-Exhaustion); and after a 10 min rest period ( Fat-Recovery). Grip strength was similarly measured in the same conditions. Grip strength differed significantly across the testing scenarios ( p = 0.012- < 0.001). Greater fatigue<symptom> was seen in anterior deltoid<symptom> , middle deltoid<symptom> , posterior deltoid<symptom> and supraspinatus in the Fat-Exhaustion contraction as compared to the Fat-Baseline contraction ( p = < 0.001-0.043). Greater fatigue<symptom> was seen during the Fat-Recovery contraction for the trapezius , serratus anterior and biceps brachii as compared to the Fat-Exhaustion contraction ( p = 0.008-0.038). Grip strength decreased following an exhausting exercise protocol but recovered to baseline following a rest period. Conversely , EMG indices of fatigue<symptom> did not recover. Additional fatigue<symptom> was seen reflecting a reorganisation of movement strategy. Therefore , susceptibility to injury still exists if grip strength alone is used as a barometer of upper limb performance.
