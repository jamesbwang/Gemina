  Our work aimed to demonstrate the combination of machine learning and graph theory for the designing of a connectomic biomarker for mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) subjects using eyes-closed neuromagnetic recordings. The whole analysis based on source-reconstructed neuromagnetic activity. As ROI representation , we employed the principal component analysis ( PCA) and centroid approaches. As representative bi-variate connectivity estimators for the estimation of intra and cross-frequency interactions , we adopted the phase locking value ( PLV) , the imaginary part ( iPLV) and the correlation of the envelope ( CorrEnv). Both intra and cross-frequency interactions ( CFC) have been estimated with the three connectivity estimators within the seven frequency bands ( intra-frequency) and in pairs ( CFC) , correspondingly. We demonstrated how different versions of functional connectivity graphs single-layer ( SL-FCG) and multi-layer ( ML-FCG) can give us a different view of the functional interactions across the brain areas. Finally , we applied machine learning techniques with main scope to build a reliable connectomic biomarker by analyzing both SL-FCG and ML-FCG in two different options: as a whole unit using a tensorial extraction algorithm and as single pair-wise coupling estimations. We concluded that edge-weighed feature selection strategy outperformed the tensorial treatment of SL-FCG and ML-FCG. The highest classification performance was obtained with the centroid ROI representation and edge-weighted analysis of the SL-FCG reaching the 98 % for the CorrEnv in Î±
