  Dysfunction of the glutamatergic system is believed to underlie many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism , Rett syndrome<disease> and schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR5) positive allosteric modulators ( PAM) potentiate glutamatergic signaling , particularly indirectly via the NMDA receptor. Preclinical studies report mGluR5 PAMs can improve schizophrenia-relevant behaviours. Furthermore , adolescent administration has shown to prevent cognitive induced deficits in adult rodents. However , there is limited understanding of the short- and long-term neurochemical effects of mGluR5 PAMs , which may underlie their therapeutic effects. We examined the effect of 7-day adolescent ( PN28-34) treatment with the mGluR5 PAM , CDDPB ( 30 mg/kg) , on glutamatergic receptor expression at adolescence ( PN35) and adulthood ( PN96). Immunoblot analysis revealed that 7-day adolescent CDPPB treatment increased protein expression of glutamatergic receptors including the NMDA receptor subunits , NR1 and NR2A and the AMPA subunits ( GluA1 and GluA2) in the adolescent hippocampus , changes that did not extend to adulthood. In contrast , there were no changes in the adolescent frontal cortex , however elevated mGluR5 protein expression was observed at adulthood following adolescent CDPPB treatment. The present study indicates adolescent CDPPB treatment may cause brain region dependent effects on the glutamatergic system , which do not persist into adulthood. These findings may have implications for the preclinical development of mGluR5 PAMs for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.
