  Right hemihepatectomy or systematic resection of segment 7 or 8 involves partial resection of the paracaval portion of the caudate lobe. However , the boundary between the caudate lobe and segment 7 or 8 remains unclear. We examined the anatomical territory of the caudate lobe with special reference to the boundary between the paracaval portion and segment 7 or 8 for precise anatomical hepatectomies. We enrolled 63 consecutive healthy donor candidates for living-donor liver transplantation from 2012 to 2014 in this study. The caudate lobe was defined according to Kumon 's subdivision system , and the boundary between the paracaval portion and segment 7 or 8 was investigated based on three-dimensional computed tomography scan images using SYNAPSE VINCENT The paracaval portion of the liver protruded on the liver surface underneath the right diaphragm on the ventral side of the right<symptom> hepatic vein ( RHV) in 10 participants ( 16 %) and on the dorsal side of the RHV in 9 participants ( 14 %). A branch of the RHV , the `` paracaval vein , '' was found in all 63 participants and ran longitudinally along the right border of the paracaval portion ( n = 30 , 48 %) and within segment 7 ( n = 16 , 25 %) or segment 8 ( n = 17 , 27 %). The paracaval portion of the liver protruded on the liver surface underneath the right diaphragm in one third of our participants. The paracaval vein can be a landmark for the boundary between the caudate lobe and the segment 7 or 8 in half of the cases.
