  The use of sensors and optical fibers for monitoring structures is continuously growing. Strains , displacements , accelerations , temperatures are just a few of the monitoring possibilities. In the case of dam structures , concrete face rockfill dams constitute a type of structures where the monitoring of water infiltrations is of particular interest. In large structures of this type , opening of slab joints is a common effect of general strain distributions , but crack formation may also occur as a result of high compressive stresses , during and after the reservoir filling stage. In this context , this paper verifies , experimentally , the applicability and the response of a distributed fiber optic monitoring system in the identification of infiltration spots and its potential sizes. The experimental tests confirm the technical feasibility of detecting infiltrations , but did not show clear evidence of their sizes.
