  To determine whether percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy ( PTNB) increased the risk of pleural recurrence in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). In this retrospective study , we reviewed 830 consecutive patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent curative resection between 2004 and 2010. Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching were performed to identify risk factors for pleural recurrence. Of 830 patients , 540 ( 65.1 %) underwent PTNB before surgery , while 290 ( 34.9 %) underwent preoperative bronchoscopic biopsy or intraoperative wedge resection for a pathological diagnosis. Concomitant pleural recurrence occurred in 42 patients ( 5.1 % ( 95 % CI , 3.8-6.8); 34 ( 6.3 %) PTNB patients and eight ( 2.8 %) non-PTNB patients) and isolated pleural recurrence took place in 26 patients ( 3.1 % ( 95 % CI , 2.1-4.6); 20 ( 3.7 %) PTNB patients and 6 ( 2.1 %) non-PTNB patients). On multivariate analysis after matching , only visceral pleural invasion was associated with concomitant pleural recurrence ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 3.367; 95 % CI , 1.262-8.986; p = 0.015) and isolated pleural recurrence ( HR = 3.216; 95 % CI , 1.037-9.978; p = 0.043) , while PTNB was associated with neither concomitant nor isolated pleural recurrence ( p = 0.605 and p = 0.963 , respectively). Among 540 patients undergoing PTNB , the transfissural approach did not have a significant association with pleural recurrence ( p = 0.539 and p = 0.313 , respectively); instead , visceral pleural invasion and microscopic lymphatic invasion were significantly associated with concomitant pleural recurrence , and microscopic lymphatic invasion was associated with isolated pleural recurrence ( p < 0.05). PTNB did not significantly increase the risk of pleural recurrence in stage I NSCLC , whereas visceral pleural invasion was responsible for pleural recurrence. • PTNB did not significantly increase the risk of pleural recurrence in stage I NSCLC , whereas visceral pleural invasion was responsible for pleural recurrence. • The transfissural approach in PTNB did not increase the risk of pleural recurrence. • PTNB can be performed for the confirmatory diagnosis of peripheral stage I lung cancer without concern for the risk of pleural recurrence.
