  Deep Neural Networks ( DNN) , in particular , Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNN) , has recently achieved state-of-art results for the task of Drug-Drug Interaction ( DDI) extraction. Most CNN architectures incorporate a pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality of the convolution layer output , preserving relevant features and removing irrelevant details. All the previous CNN based systems for DDI extraction used max-pooling layers. In this paper , we evaluate the performance of various pooling methods ( in particular max-pooling , average-pooling and attentive pooling) , as well as their combination , for the task of DDI extraction. Our experiments show that max-pooling exhibits a higher performance in F1-score ( 64.56 %) than attentive pooling ( 59.92 %) and than average-pooling ( 58.35 %). Max-pooling outperforms the others alternatives because is the only one which is invariant to the special pad tokens that are appending to the shorter sentences known as padding. Actually , the combination of max-pooling and attentive pooling does not improve the performance as compared with the single max-pooling technique.
