  Hydrophobins are fungal proteins that can self-assemble into amphiphilic films at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces. Class I hydrophobin aggregates resemble amyloid fibrils , sharing some features with them. Here , five site-directed mutants of Vmh2 , a member of basidiomycota class I hydrophobins , were designed and characterized to elucidate the molecular determinants playing a key role in class I hydrophobin self-assembly. The mechanism of fibril formation proposed for Vmh2 foresees that the triggering event is the destabilization of a specific loop ( L1) , leading to the formation of a β-hairpin , which in turn generates the β-spine of the amyloid fibril.
