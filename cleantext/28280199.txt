  Precise control over microbial cell growth conditions could enable detection of minute phenotypic changes , which would improve our understanding of how genotypes are shaped by adaptive selection. Although automated cell-culture systems such as bioreactors offer strict control over liquid culture conditions , they often do not scale to high-throughput or require cumbersome redesign to alter growth conditions. We report the design and validation of eVOLVER , a scalable do-it-yourself ( DIY) framework , which can be configured to carry out high-throughput growth experiments in molecular evolution , systems biology , and microbiology. High-throughput evolution of yeast populations grown at different densities reveals that eVOLVER can be applied to characterize adaptive niches. Growth selection on a genome-wide yeast knockout library , using temperatures varied over different timescales , finds strains sensitive to temperature changes or frequency of temperature change. Inspired by large-scale integration of electronics and microfluidics , we also demonstrate millifluidic multiplexing modules that enable multiplexed media routing , cleaning , vial-to-vial transfers and automated yeast mating.
