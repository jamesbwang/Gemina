  A novel direct and diastereoselective amination of biosourced monobenzylated isohexides has been developed through borrowing hydrogen methodology using a cooperative catalysis between an iridium complex and a phosphoric acid. We also report herein the first regio- and diastereoselective direct amination of isosorbide.
