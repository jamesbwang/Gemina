  To detect infection by hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , a reliable kit with high sensitivity and specificity is indispensable. Detection kits for anti-HCV antibodies ( anti-HCV) are used for screening , and quantification kits for HCV<pathogen> RNA and core antigen are used for definite diagnosis of HCV<pathogen> infection. We evaluated the performance of these kits using International Standards and a regional reference panel with HCV<pathogen> negative and positive specimens. In vitro diagnostic kits ( 10 anti-HCV , two HCV<pathogen> RNA , and three HCV<pathogen> core antigen) were included. Nearly all specimens in the regional reference panel were correctly identified by all anti-HCV detection kits ( one false-positive was observed in one kit). Both HCV<pathogen> RNA quantification kits also correctly identified and quantified HCV<pathogen> RNA titers , without genotype-specific differences. Among the HCV<pathogen> core antigen kits , International Standard values were inconsistent. The sensitivities of these kits were insufficient to detect HCV<pathogen> in positive specimens in the regional reference panel. In vitro diagnostic kits assessing anti-HCV and HCV<pathogen> RNA have sufficient sensitivities and specificities to screen and detect HCV<pathogen> infection. However , HCV<pathogen> core antigen quantification kits have some limitations in their sensitivities and consistencies for diagnosis of HCV<pathogen> infection. Quality control with International Standards and a regional reference panel is important to maintain the performances of diagnostic kits for HCV<pathogen> infection and to verify the clinical reliability of these kits.
