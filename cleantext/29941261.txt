  To explore the formation process and mechanism of organic matter and organic-mineral complex under humification and mineralization conditions , a series of samples including humic acid , kaolin , and humic acid-kaolin complex were prepared using a subcritical water treatment method ( SWT) under specific temperature , pressure and reaction time conditions. HA was used as a surrogate for natural organic matter because it has a similar abundant pore structure , variety of carbon types , and chemical components. These samples were used in carbamazepine ( CBZ) sorption experiments and characterized by a variety of techniques. The polymerization of humic acid under the conditions of increased temperature and pressure resulted in an increase in specific surface area and molecular quantity. In addition , the degree of aromaticity rose from 59.52 % to 70.90 %. These changes were consistent with the transformation from ` soft carbon ' to ` hard carbon ' that occurs in nature. The results of sorption experiments confirmed the interaction between humic acid and kaolin from the difference between the predicted and actual Q
