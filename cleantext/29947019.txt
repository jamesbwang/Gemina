  Epigenetic modifications ( e.g. , DNA methylation or histone deacetylation) are commonly implicated in cancer chemoresistance. We previously showed that pretreating resistant MCF-7/ ADR breast cancer cells with a demethylating agent ( 5-aza-2 '- deoxycytidine ( DAC)) or with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA)) sensitized resistant cells to doxorubicin ( DOX) treatment. However , even with increasing doses of DOX , a fraction of resistant cells remained nonresponsive to this pretreatment ( ~ 25 % pretreated with DAC , ~ 45 % with SAHA). We hypothesized that pretreating resistant cells with a combination of epigenetic drugs ( DAC + SAHA) could more effectively overcome drug resistance. We postulated that delivery of epigenetic drugs encapsulated in biodegradable nanogels ( NGs) would further enhance their efficacy. MCF-7/ ADR cells were first treated with a single drug vs. a combination of epigenetic drugs , either as solutions or encapsulated in NGs , then subjected to DOX , either in solution or in NGs. Antiproliferative data showed that pretreatment with epigenetic drugs in NGs , then with DOX in NGs , was most effective in overcoming resistance; this treatment inhibited cell growth by > 90 % , even at low doses of DOX. Cell cycle analysis showed that a major fraction of cells treated with a cocktail of epigenetic drugs + DOX , all in NG formulations , remained in the G2/M cell cycle arrest phase for a prolonged period. The mechanism of better efficacy of epigenetic drugs in NGs could be attributed to their sustained effect. A similar strategy could be developed for other cancer cells in which drug resistance is due to epigenetic modifications.
