  Lower-limb amputees have a higher risk of falling compared to non-amputees. Proper regulation of whole-body angular momentum is necessary to prevent falls , particularly in the frontal plane where individuals are most unstable. However , the balance<symptom> recovery mechanisms used by lower-limb amputees when recovering from a perturbation are not well-understood. This study sought to understand the balance<symptom> recovery mechanisms used by lower-limb amputees in response to mediolateral foot perturbations by examining changes to frontal plane whole-body angular momentum and hip<symptom> joint work. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of frontal plane dynamic balance<symptom> and associated joint contributions required to maintain balance<symptom> during gait. Nine amputees and 11 non-amputees participated in this study where an unexpected medial or lateral foot placement perturbation occurred immediately prior to heel strike on the residual , sound or non-amputee limbs. Lateral perturbations of all limbs resulted in a reduced range of whole-body angular momentum and increased positive frontal plane hip work in the first half of single limb support. Medial perturbations for all limbs resulted in increased range of whole-body angular momentum and decreased positive frontal plane hip work , also in the first half of single limb support. These results suggest that medial foot placement perturbations are particularly challenging and that hip strategies play an important role in balance<symptom> recovery. Thus , rehabilitation interventions that focus on hip muscles that regulate mediolateral balance<symptom> , particularly the hip abductors , and the use of prostheses with active ankle control , may reduce the risk of falls.
