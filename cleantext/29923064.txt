  Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the effects of highly toxic and dangerous metals ( Pb , Cd , Hg) and essential microelements ( Cr , Cu , Ni , Zn) on the seed germination process in vetch and eight plant species of major importance to human consumption. The degree of metal toxicity was determined on the basis of acute LC50 values calculated by means of two different methods. All the metals were found to inhibit the germination process , but in a varying , species-dependent degree. Of all the plant seeds under study , the most sensitive to the presence of the examined metals during germination were the seeds of cress ( Cu , Pb , Hg) , rye ( Ni , Zn , Cd) and barley ( Cr) , while vetch ( Cr , Ni , Zn , Cd , Pb , Hg) , rape ( Cr , Cu) and pea ( Ni , Cd) were found to be least affected.
