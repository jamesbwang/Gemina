  Constitutive androstane receptor ( CAR) is a xenobiotic-responsive nuclear receptor that is highly expressed in the liver. CAR activation induces hepatocyte proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents , but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study , we investigated the association of CAR-dependent cell proliferation with Yes-associated protein ( YAP) , which is a transcriptional cofactor controlling organ size and cell growth through the interaction with various transcriptional factors including TEAD. In mouse livers , TCPOBOP ( a mouse CAR activator) treatment increased the nuclear YAP accumulation and mRNA levels of YAP target genes as well as cell-cycle related genes along with liver hypertrophy and verteporfin ( an inhibitor of YAP/TEAD interaction) cotreatment tended to attenuate them. Furthermore , in cell-based reporter gene assays , CAR activation enhanced the YAP/TEAD-dependent transcription. To investigate the role of YAP/TEAD activation in the CAR-dependent hepatocyte proliferation , we sought to establish an in vitro system completely reproducing CAR-dependent cell proliferation. Since CAR was only slightly expressed in cultured mouse primary hepatocytes compared to mouse livers and no proliferation was observed after treatment with TCPOBOP , we overexpressed CAR using mouse CAR expressing adenovirus<pathogen> ( Ad-mCAR-V5) in mouse primary hepatocytes. Ad-mCAR-V5 infection and TCPOBOP treatment induced hepatocyte proliferation. Similar results were obtained with immortalized normal mouse hepatocytes as well. In the established in vitro system , CAR-dependent proliferation was strongly inhibited by Yap knockdown and completely abolished by verteporfin treatment. Our present results obtained in in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that YAP/TEAD activation plays key roles in CAR-dependent proliferation of murine hepatocytes.
