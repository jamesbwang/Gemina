  The hybridization capture of chromatin-associated proteins for proteomics ( HyCCAPP) technology was initially developed to uncover novel DNA-protein interactions in yeast. It allows analysis of a target region of interest without the need for prior knowledge about likely proteins bound to the target region. This , in theory , allows HyCCAPP to be used to analyze any genomic region of interest , and it provides sufficient flexibility to work in different cell systems. This method is not meant to study binding sites of known transcription factors , a task better suited for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) and ChIP-like methods. The strength of HyCCAPP lies in its ability to explore DNA regions for which there is limited or no knowledge about the proteins bound to it. It can also be a convenient method to avoid biases ( present in ChIP-like methods) introduced by protein-based chromatin enrichment using antibodies. Potentially , HyCCAPP can be a powerful tool to uncover truly novel DNA-protein interactions. To date , the technology has been predominantly applied to yeast cells or to high copy repeat sequences in mammalian cells. In order to become the powerful tool we envision , HyCCAPP approaches need to be optimized to efficiently capture single-copy loci in mammalian cells. Here , we present our adaptation of the initial yeast HyCCAPP capture protocol to human cell lines , and show that single-copy chromatin regions can be efficiently isolated with this modified protocol.
