  The selective hydrogenation of α , β-unsaturated aldehyde is an extremely important transformation , while developing efficient catalysts with desirable selectivity to highly value-added products is challenging , mainly due to the coexistence of two conjugated unsaturated functional groups. Herein , we report that a series of Pt-based zigzag nanowires ( ZNWs) can be adopted as selectivity controllers for α , β-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation , where the excellent unsaturated alcohol ( UOL) selectivity ( > 95 %) and high saturated aldehyde ( SA) selectivity ( > 94 %) are achieved on PtFe ZNWs and PtFeNi ZNWs + AlCl
