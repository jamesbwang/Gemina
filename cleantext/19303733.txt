  Type 1 diabetes ( T1D) care requires multiple daily self-management behaviors ( SMBs). Preliminary studies on SMBs rely mainly on self-reported survey and interview data. There is little information on adult T1D SMBs , along with corresponding compensation techniques ( CTs) , gathered in real-time. The article aims to use a patient-centered approach to design iDECIDE , a smartphone application that gathers daily diabetes SMBs and CTs related to meal and alcohol intake and exercise in real-time , and contrast patients ' actual behaviors against those self-reported with the app. Two usability studies were used to improve iDECIDE 's functionality. These were followed by a 30-day pilot test of the redesigned app. A survey designed to capture diabetes SMBs and CTs was administered prior to the 30-day pilot test. Survey results were compared against iDECIDE logs. Usability studies revealed that participants desired advanced features for self-tracking meals and alcohol intake. Thirteen participants recorded over 1,200 CTs for carbohydrates during the 30-day study. Participants also recorded 76 alcohol and 166 exercise CTs. Comparisons of survey responses and iDECIDE logs showed mean % ( standard deviation) concordance of 77 % ( 25) for SMBs related to meals , where concordance of 100 % indicates a perfect match. There was low concordance of 35 % ( 35) and 46 % ( 41) for alcohol and exercise events , respectively. The high variability found in SMBs and CTs highlights the need for real-time diabetes self-tracking mechanisms to better understand SMBs and CTs. Future work will use the developed app to collect SMBs and CTs and identify patient-specific diabetes adherence barriers that could be addressed with individualized education interventions.
