  The synthesis of a 1,5-lactone 2,4- O-alkylidene-d-erythrose derivative was found to be a highly stereoselective template in Michael addition trough the reaction of a d-erythrosyl 1,5-lactone derivative with nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles. The sulfur adducts formed are 1 ( d-erythrose derivative): 1 ( nucleophile) , and the nitrogen adducts are 1:2. Both were then treated under HCl to give 2,6-dideoxy-4-functionalized-d- ribono-hexono-1,4-lactone by a reaction cascade in high overall yield. Reaction 's scale up even improves the yield. The theoretical and computational results clearly explain the origin of the stereoselectivity , and the energetic course of reactions starting with nitrogen and sulfide nucleophiles. Considering that the 1,4-lactones obtained in this work offer a new molecular scaffold for organic synthesis , these new results provide a solid theoretical platform that can be used to speed up synthesis of other derivatives in a stereo- and regioselective way.
