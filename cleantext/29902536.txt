  Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. During cardiac failure , the metabolism of cardiomyocyte switches from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. However , the roles of key metabolic enzymes in cardiac hypertrophy are not understood fully. Here in the present work , we identified Aldolase A ( AldoA) as a core regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. The mRNA and protein levels of AldoA were significantly up-regulated in transverse aortic constriction ( TAC)- and isoproterenol ( ISO)- induced hypertrophic mouse hearts. Overexpression of AldoA in cardiomyocytes promoted ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , whereas AldoA knockdown repressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition , adeno-associated virus 9 ( AAV9)- mediated in vivo knockdown of AldoA in the hearts rescued ISO-induced decrease in cardiac ejection fraction and fractional shortening and repressed cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanism study revealed that AldoA repressed the activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase ( AMPK) signaling in a liver kinase B1 ( LKB1)- dependent and AMP-independent manner. Inactivation of AMPK is a core mechanism underlying AldoA-mediated promotion of ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. By contrast , activation of AMPK with metformin and AICAR blocked AldoA function during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In summary , our data support the notion that AldoA-AMPK axis is a core regulatory signaling sensing energetic status and participates in cardiac hypertrophy.
