  Embryonic stem cells ( ESC) are widely used due to their unlimited capacity of differentiation into different cell lineages , which makes ESC a viable choice as a toxicology test model. Toxicological analysis using embryonic stem cells ( ESC) has become an important tool in toxicology procedures. Regarding toxicological analysis methods , flow cytometry ( FC) is one technique designed to detect and evaluate cells in suspension , for example , ESC suspension , thus making possible to study different biological , physical , and/or chemical characteristics of cells. Thus , FC can be very useful for cell toxicology and tumorigenic analyses.
