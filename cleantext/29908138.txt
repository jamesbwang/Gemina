  Studying the interaction of therapeutic molecules with serum albumin is important to understand their biopharmaceutics , pharmacokinetics and toxicity as well as their relation with the structure and function of protein. The biomolecular interaction of an anti-spasmodic drug , pirenzepine with bovine serum albumin ( BSA) was investigated using multi-spectroscopic , calorimetric and docking studies. Fluorescence quenching of BSA on interaction with pirenzepine revealed the static mode of quenching. Pirenzepine exhibited a moderate binding to serum albumin with the binding constant value in the order of 10
