  A novel cascade photoelectrochemical ( PEC) signal amplification biosensing tactics was developed for DNA detection based on a target-driven DNA association to induce cyclic hairpin assembly. In the circulatory system there are two ssDNA<pathogen> ( A and B) and two hairpins ( C and D). The hybridization of these ssDNA<pathogen> led to the formation of an A-target-B structure. The close proximity of their toehold and branch-migration regions was able to induce the cyclic hairpin assembly. Afterwards , the assembly result further causes the separation of a double-stranded probe DNA ( Q: F) to switch the PEC signal via toehold-mediated strand replacement. As such , the signal stranded DNA-CdS QDs ( F) as the signal tag was released in the presence of the target DNA. The signal DNA-CdS QDs was then coated to F-doped tin oxide ( FTO) electrode leading to the `` signal-on '' PEC signal. The designed biosensing strategy showed a low detection limit of 21.3 pM for target DNA and a broad linear range from 50 pM to 100 nM. This signal amplification PEC sensing method exhibited a potential application to detect protein molecules , RNA or metal ions via changing the sequence of A and B recognition.
