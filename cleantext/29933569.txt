  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide , and although new therapeutic approaches have been recently evaluated , overall patient survival is still poor. Thus , new effective and selective clinical treatments are urgently needed. An analysis of data from large-scale , high-throughput drug screening cell line projects identified Bosutinib , a Src/Abl inhibitor that is currently used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> , as a candidate drug to treat HNSCC. Using a panel of HNSCC-derived cell lines , we found that treatment with Bosutinib reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of sensitive cell lines. The drug rapidly inhibited Src and EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor) phosphorylation , and sensitivity to Bosutinib was correlated with the activation status of EGFR. Similar findings were observed in in vivo xenograft assays using HNSCC derived cells. Moreover , in the presence of mutations in
