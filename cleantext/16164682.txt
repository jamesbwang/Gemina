  Endodontic treatments have as their objective the appropriate sealing of the space caused by the root canal , providing a complete seal<disease> of the canal in all dimensions , creating an airtight seal<disease> against fluids. Thus , endodontic cements must possess physical properties such as solubility and long-term dimensional stability. An electronic search in the main endodontic magazines using appropriate keywords to identify studies that investigated the porosity of endodontic materials using micro-computed tomography. Of the 125 studies researched , 16 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Four studies analyzed the porosity of endodontic cements specifically. Twelve studies investigated and compared different techniques of root canal obturation and the repercussions from the lowering of porosity in the interior of the endodontic cement. The presence of porosity inside the endodontic cement is a constant in the treatments of root canals , even now when there is a great variety of endodontic cements.
