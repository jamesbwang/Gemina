  The purpose of this work was to investigate noninvasive early detection of treatment response of breast cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) using chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) measurements sensitive to amide proton transfer ( APT) at 7 T. CEST images were acquired in 10 tumors of nine breast cancer patients treated with NAC. APT signals in the tumor , before and after the first cycle of NAC , were quantified using a three-pool Lorentzian fit of the z-spectra in the region of interest. The changes in APT were subsequently related to pathological response after surgery defined by the Miller-Payne system. Significant differences ( P < 0.05 , unpaired Mann-Whitney test) were found in the APT signal before and after the first cycle of NAC in six out of 10 lesions<symptom> , of which two showed a pathological complete response. Of the remaining four lesions<symptom> , one showed a pathological complete response. No significant difference in changes of APT signal were found between the different pathological responses to NAC treatment ( P > 0.05 , Kruskal-Wallis test). This preliminary study shows the feasibility of using APT CEST magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive biomarker to assess the effect of NAC in an early stage of NAC treatment of breast cancer patients.
