  This study aims to examine the following functional polymorphisms in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) susceptibility: ( i) the 587C > T of kininogen gene , ( ii) the 287 bp Alu repeat insertion of angiotensin converting enzyme gene , ( iii) the 9 bp insertion of bradykinin receptor 2 gene , ( iv) the -58 T > C of bradykinin receptor 2 gene , and ( v) the -699 G > C of bradykinin receptor 1 gene. The study included 136 RA patients ( 27 males; 109 females; mean age 60.8 years; range 39 to 75 years) and 149 ethnic matching controls ( 30 males , 119 females; mean age 56.2 years; range 35 to 78 years). Polymerase chain reaction coupled with restriction assay was performed for 587C > T , -58 T > C , and -699 G > C. Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> patients and controls carried the wild type allele of 587C > T; therefore , produced the high molecular weight kininogen. No significant difference was observed in genotype or allele distribution of the studied functional polymorphisms between RA patients and controls. Kinin-kallikrein system related genes might not be major RA susceptibility loci.
