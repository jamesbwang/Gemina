  Populations are aging worldwide. This paper summarizes some of the challenges and opportunities due to the increasing burden of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> in an aging population. Older adults typically suffer elevated morbidity from infectious<disease> disease<disease> , leading to increased demand for healthcare resources and higher healthcare costs. Preventive medicine , including vaccination can potentially play a major role in preserving the health and independence of older adults. However , this potential of widespread vaccination is rarely realized. Here , we give a brief overview of the problem , discuss concrete obstacles and the potential for expanded vaccination programs to promote healthy aging. The increasing healthcare burden of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> expected in aging populations could , to a large extent , be reduced by achieving higher vaccination coverage among older adults. Vaccination can thus contribute to healthy aging , alongside healthy diet and physical exercise. The available evidence indicates that dedicated programs can achieve substantial improvements in vaccination coverage among older adults , but more research is required to assess the generalizability of the results achieved by specific interventions ( see Additional file 1).
