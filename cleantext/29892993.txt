  Obesity during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of thromboembolism , gestational diabetes , pre-eclampsia , miscarriage , congenital anomaly , macrosomia and stillbirth<symptom>. The current practice , directed at reducing gestational weight gain , is largely ineffective. The present pilot study was designed to assess the acceptability of a 24-week intensive weight management programme ( IWMP; full meal replacement followed by partial meal replacement and weight stabilization) to achieve weight<symptom> loss<symptom> for women with obesity requesting removal of their intra-uterine contraceptive device in order to conceive. Twenty six ( 65 %) of eligible participants consented to the IWMP; three received this as routine National Health Service care in the University College Hospital clinic and 14 participated in the study. The commonest reasons for not participating were dislike of milk , anxiety<symptom> and lack of support from family and friends. Omitting one woman who dropped out because of problems unrelated to the intervention , the completion rate was 46.2 %. Including all women who started the programme , mean body mass index decreased significantly ( P = 0.005) from 37.8 to 35.3 kg/m
