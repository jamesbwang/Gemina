  We aim to quantify the impact of obesity on maternal intensive care unit ( ICU) admission. This is a population-based , retrospective cohort study of Ohio live births from 2006 to 2012. The primary outcome was maternal ICU admission. The primary exposure was maternal body mass index ( BMI). Relative risk ( RR) of ICU admission was calculated by BMI category. Multivariate logistic regression quantified the risk of obesity on ICU admission after adjustment for coexisting factors. This study includes 999,437 births , with peripartum maternal ICU admission rate of 1.10 per 1,000. ICU admission rate for BMI 30 to 39.9 kg/m Obesity is a risk factor for maternal ICU admission. Risk increases with BMI. After adjustment , BMI â‰¥ 40 kg/m
