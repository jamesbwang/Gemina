  We derive the Boltzmann equation for the rotranslational dynamics of an arbitrary convex rigid body in a rarefied gas. It yields as a limiting case the Fokker-Planck equation accounting for friction , diffusion , and nonconservative drift forces and torques. We provide the rotranslational friction and diffusion tensors for specular and diffuse reflection off particles with spherical , cylindrical , and cuboidal shape , and show that the theory describes thermalization , photophoresis , and the inverse Magnus effect in the free molecular regime.
