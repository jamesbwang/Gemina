  Despite the great progress in recent years , many aspects of the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer remain unclear. A better understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastasis and recurrence is crucial to improve the treatment of this lethal disease. MCF-7 cells were xenografted into mice until visible tumor developed and the cells from tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue were cultured with 3 passages as MT cells and IT cells , respectively. Microarray analysis was performed to detect several viable MicroRNAs in these two types of cells. Further , MiR-30 knockdown was used to investigate its role in tumor aggression. Relative levels of miR-30 were significantly higher in IT cells than MT cells. Knockdown of miR-30 in both MT and IT cells lowered cell proliferation and cell invasion abilities , and thus increased the survival time of mice xenografted with tumor cells. This study suggested that the knockdown of miR-30 decreased proliferation and invasion of carcinoma cells , giving rise to the potential of miR-30 as tumor target or marker candidate for breast cancer therapy.
