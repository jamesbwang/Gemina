  Since improving the patient 's condition is the ultimate goal of clinical care and research , this review of research methodology focuses on outcomes in the musculoskeletal field.This paper provides an overview of conceptual models , different types of outcomes and commonly assessed outcomes in orthopaedics as well as epidemiological and statistical aspects of outcomes determination , measurement and interpretation.Clinicians should determine the outcome ( s) most important to patients and/or public health in collaboration with the patients , epidemiologists/statisticians and other stakeholders.Key points in outcome choice are to evaluate both the benefit and harm of a health intervention , and to consider short- and longer-term outcomes including patient-reported outcomes.Outcome estimation should aim at identifying a clinically important difference ( not the same as a statistically significant difference) , at presenting measures of effects with confidence intervals and at taking the necessary steps to minimize bias.
