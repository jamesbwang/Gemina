  In the present study , we investigated the removal of Cr ( VI) and the associated bacterial activity in the systems containing Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5 ( B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5) and hematite. The microcalorimetry was used to study the effect of hematite on the normal physiological functions of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5 towards the removal of Cr ( VI) for the first time. The results of the heat flux and the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE) showed that hematite does not affect the normal physiological functions of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5 , and can help the strains maintain their activity in the presence of Cr ( VI). More importantly , the relative capacity and intensity of Cr ( VI) and total Cr removal by B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5 in the presence of hematite were higher than that in the absence of hematite. The enhancement effect could be associated with their mineral adsorption , biosorption , Fe ( II) reduction , bioreduction and immobilization functions. This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the toxicity of Cr ( VI) and enhancing the Cr ( VI) removal efficiency in contaminated environments using a combination of hematite and B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> BSn5.
