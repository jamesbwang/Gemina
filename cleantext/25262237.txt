  Following cytokinesis in plants , Endoplasmic MTs ( EMTs) assemble on the nuclear surface , forming a radial network that extends out to the cell cortex , where they attach and incorporate into the cortical microtubule ( CMT) array. We found that in these post-cytokinetic cells , the MT-associated protein CLASP is enriched at sites of EMT-cortex attachment , and is required for stable EMT tethering and growth into the cell cortex. Loss of EMT-cortex anchoring in clasp-1 mutants results in destabilized EMT arrays , and is accompanied by enhanced mobility of the cytoplasm , premature vacuolation , and precocious entry into cell elongation phase. Thus , EMTs appear to maintain cells in a meristematic state by providing a structural scaffold that stabilizes the cytoplasm to counteract actomyosin-based cytoplasmic streaming forces , thereby preventing premature establishment of a central vacuole and rapid cell elongation.
