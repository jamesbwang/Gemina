  the effect of hospitalisation in emergency department-based short-stay units ( SSUs) has not been studied in older patients. We compared SSU hospitalisation with standard care at an Internal Medicine Department ( IMD) in acutely admitted older internal medicine patients. pragmatic randomised clinical trial. We randomly assigned patients aged 75 years or older , acutely admitted for an internal medicine disease and assessed to be suitable for SSU hospitalisation to SSU hospitalisation or IMD hospitalisation. SSU hospitalisation was provided by a pragmatic ` fast-track ' principle. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included adverse events , change in Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL) score within 90 days from admission , in-hospital length of stay and unplanned readmissions within 30 days after discharge. between January 2015 and October 2016 , 430 participants were randomised ( median age 84 years in both groups). Ninety-day mortality was 22 ( 11 %) in the SSU group and 32 ( 15 %) in the IMD group ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.66; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.37-1.18; P = 0.16). When comparing the SSU group to the IMD group , 16 ( 8 %) vs. 45 ( 21 %) experienced at least one adverse event ( OR 0.31; 95 % CI 0.17-0.56; P < 0.001); 6 ( 3 %) vs. 35 ( 20 %) experienced a reduction in IADL score within 90 days from admission ( P < 0.001); median in-hospital length of stay was 73 h ( interquartile range , IQR 36-147) vs. 100 h ( IQR 47-169) , ( P < 0.001) , and 26 ( 13 %) vs. 58 ( 29 %) were readmitted ( OR 0.37; 95 % CI 0.22-0.61; P < 0.001). mortality at 90 days after admission was not significantly lower in the SSU group , but SSU hospitalisation was associated with a lower risk of adverse events , less functional decline , fewer readmissions and shorter hospital stay.
