  Light-sheet microscopy is used extensively in developmental biology and neuroscience. One limitation of this approach is that absorption and scattering produces shadows in the illuminating light sheet , resulting in stripe artifacts. Here , we introduce diffuse light-sheet microscopes that use a line diffuser to randomize the light propagation within the image plane , allowing the light sheets to reform after obstacles. We incorporate diffuse light sheets in two existing configurations: selective plane illumination microscopy ( SPIM) in which the sample is illuminated with a static sheet of light , and digitally scanned light sheet ( DSLS) in which a thin Gaussian beam is scanned across the image plane during each acquisition. We compare diffuse light-sheet microscopes to their conventional counterparts for calcium imaging of neural activity in larval zebrafish. We show that stripe artifacts can cast deep shadows that conceal some neurons , and that the stripes can flicker , producing spurious signals that could be interpreted as biological activity. Diffuse light sheets mitigate these problems , illuminating the blind spots produced by stripes and removing artifacts produced by the stripes ' movements. The upgrade to diffuse light sheets is simple and inexpensive , especially in the case of DSLS , where it requires the addition of one optical element. This article is protected by copyright.
