  To evaluate the The color stability of test materials was determined using a spectrophotometer. A total of 30 specimens were prepared ( 10 from each) from each material on a round metal mold ( 11 mm diameter and 2 mm deep). The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 Â°C for 24 h for rehydration. Baseline color of all groups was recorded. Specimens of each material were divided into 2 groups of 5 specimens each ( The color stability is significantly higher in porcelain than composite and conventional GIC. Within the limitations of this study , it was concluded that the porcelain shows less discoloration than composite and conventional restorative GIC.
