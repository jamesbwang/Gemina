  Neuronal apoptosis plays key roles in secondary brain injury caused by intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). This study first reported the role of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor ( MANF) in alleviating secondary brain injury through anti-apoptosis in rat model of ICH. The recombinant human-MANF ( rh-MANF) and selective Akt inhibitor MK2206 was administrated intracerebroventricularly 1 h after ICH. Brain water content , behavioral assessment , BBB ( blood brain barrier) leakage was evaluated 24 h after the induction of ICH. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the expression level of target proteins ( MANF , mouse 3T3 cell double-minute 2 ( MDM2) , P53 , Akt , Bcl-2 , Bax , and caspase-3). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)- mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) was applied to evaluate the neuronal cell death. Besides , whether MANF was expressed in neurons was verified with double immunofluorescence staining. The results suggested that the level of MANF , and its downstream proteins , Akt , MDM2 was upregulated and reached peak at 24 h after ICH. MANF was mainly expressed in neurons. The administration of rh-MANF could significantly increase the level of p-Akt , p-MDM2 , Bcl/Bax ratio , but reduce the expression of p53 , caspase-3 and neuronal death , thus ameliorate the neurological functions at 24 h after ICH. However , these effects of rh-MANF could be obviously reversed by MK2206. MANF could exert its neuronal anti-apoptotic effects via Akt/MDM2/P53 pathways. Therefore , MANF could be a valuable drug target in the treatment of ICH.
