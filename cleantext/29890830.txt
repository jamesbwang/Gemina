  Epigenetic regulators that exhibit aberrant enzymatic activities or expression profiles are potential therapeutic targets for cancers. Specifically , enzymes responsible for methylation at histone-3 lysine-9 ( like G9a) and aberrant DNA hypermethylation ( DNMTs) have been implicated in a number of cancers. Recently , molecules bearing a 4-aminoquinoline scaffold were reported as dual inhibitors of these targets and showed a significant in vivo efficacy in animal models of hematological malignancies. Here , we report a detailed exploration around three growing vectors born by this chemotype. Exploring this chemical space led to the identification of features to navigate G9a and DNMT1 biological spaces: not only their corresponding exclusive areas , selective compounds , but also common spaces. Thus , we identified from selective G9a and first-in-class DNMT1 inhibitors , > 1 log unit between their IC
