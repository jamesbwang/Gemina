  Chemical control is important in the management of the tobacco whitefly , Bemisia tabaci ( Gennadius) ( Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Susceptibility of B. tabaci to insecticides may vary among different developmental stages and geographical populations. In this study , we examined toxicity of seven commonly-used insecticides to B. tabaci MED in four field populations from China. Avermectin has high level of toxicity to all stages of B. tabaci MED in all four populations. Cyantraniliprole and sulfoxaflor have high toxicity to adults. Spirotetramat , cyantraniliprole and flonicamid have high toxicity to nymphs but not adults. Acetamiprid , cyantraniliprole and sulfoxaflor have high toxicity to eggs. However , the relative toxicity of B. tabaci MED to these chemicals varied across different populations , with little consistency in population differences across developmental stages. Our findings together with some instances where LC
