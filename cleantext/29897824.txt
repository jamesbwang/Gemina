  Women with hypertensive pregnancy complications are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , metabolic diseases , stroke , and end-stage renal disease later in life. Pregnancy complications not only effect the mother 's long-term health , but also the health of the fetus immediately after delivery and into adulthood. The health of the fetus until adulthood can be influenced by developmental programming , in which the fetus is exposed to insults that will ultimately affect the growth of the offspring and increase the offspring 's risk of developing hypertension , coronary heart disease , metabolic disease , and chronic kidney disease in adulthood. Preeclampsia , the onset of hypertension during pregnancy , is one of the major risk factors for the development of renal , cerebral , and cardiovascular disease in the mother. Women with preeclampsia are at a 5-12 fold increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) , 2 fold risk of stroke , and 2 fold risk of developing CVD later in life. In this review article , we will discuss 1. Preeclampsia , 2. the risk of developing CVD , renal disease , and stroke later in life for women with hypertensive pregnancies , 3. the effects of a hypertensive pregnancy on the offspring.
