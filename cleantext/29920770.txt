  We determined the influence of cumulative dosing of caffeine citrate on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( VLBW) infants at 18-22 months of postmenstrual age. This retrospective chart analysis was conducted at Detroit Medical Center , Michigan , USA. The 181 infants we included were born between January 2006 and December 2016 , were less than 32 weeks of gestational age and weighed less than 1500 grams. Data on their perinatal and postnatal characteristics were retrieved from their medical records and they were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development- Third Edition. The 64 infants with no neurodevelopmental disability or a mild disability received a significantly higher average daily dose ( mg/kg/day) of caffeine citrate with a median of 7.58 ( range 2.7-12.2) mg/kg/day , than the 79 infants with a moderate to severe disability , who received a median of 6.47 ( range 3.1-12.5 , p = 0.01). The total cumulative dose had no effect on bronchopulmonary dysplasia or neurodevelopmental outcomes. A higher average daily dose of caffeine citrate was associated with better neurodevelopmental outcomes of VLBW infants. However , the cumulative dose did not have an impact on their short-term or long-term outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm our findings.
