  Few studies have evaluated continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) not using injectable therapy. CGM is useful for investigating hypoglycemia and glycemic variability , which is associated with complications in T2DM. A CGM substudy of Individualized treatMent aPproach for oldER patIents in a randomized trial in type 2 diabetes Mellitus ( IMPERIUM)) was conducted. Patients were vulnerable ( moderately ill and/or frail) older ( ≥ 65 years) individuals with suboptimally controlled T2DM. Strategy A comprised glucose-dependent therapies ( n = 26) with a nonsulfonylurea oral antihyperglycemic medication ( OAM) and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist as the first injectable. Strategy B comprised non-glucose-dependent therapies ( n = 21) with sulfonylurea as the preferred OAM and insulin glargine as the first injectable. Primary endpoints were duration and percentage of time spent with blood glucose ( BG) ≤ 70 mg/dL over 24 hours at week 24. Duration and percentage of time spent with hypoglycemia at ≤ 70 mg/dL were similar for Strategy A and Strategy B; glycemic control improved similarly in both arms ( LSM change in HbA1c at week 24; A = -1.2 % , B = -1.4 %). Duration and percentage time spent with euglycemia and hyperglycemia were also similar in both arms. However , Strategy A was associated with lower within-day ( 21.1 ± 1.2 vs 25.1 ± 1.4 , P = .046) and between-day ( 5.4 ± 1.0 vs 9.1 ± 1.3 , P = .038) BG variability ( coefficient of variance ( LSM ± SE)) at week 24. This CGM substudy in older patients with T2DM showed lower within- and between-day BG variability with glucose-dependent therapies but similar HbA1c reductions and hypoglycemia duration with glucose-independent strategies.
