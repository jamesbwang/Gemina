  Multi-object tracking is a crucial problem for autonomous vehicle. Most state-of-the-art approaches adopt the tracking-by-detection strategy , which is a two-step procedure consisting of the detection module and the tracking module. In this paper , we improve both steps. We improve the detection module by incorporating the temporal information , which is beneficial for detecting small objects. For the tracking module , we propose a novel compressed deep Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) feature based Correlation Filter tracker. By carefully integrating these two modules , the proposed multi-object tracking approach has the ability of re-identification ( ReID) once the tracked object gets lost. Extensive experiments were performed on the KITTI and MOT2015 tracking benchmarks. Results indicate that our approach outperforms most state-of-the-art tracking approaches.
