  The human immune system is constantly exposed to xenobiotics and pathogens from the environment. Although the mechanisms underlying their influence have already been at least partially recognized , the effects of some factors , such as lead ( Pb) , still need to be clarified. The results of many studies indicate that Pb has a negative effect on the immune system , and in our review , we summarize the most recent evidence that Pb can promote inflammatory response. We also discuss possible molecular and biochemical mechanisms of its proinflammatory action , including the influence of Pb on cytokine metabolism ( interleukins IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-8 , IL-1b , IL-6) , interferon gamma ( IFN & gamma ;-RRB- , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF- & alpha ;-RRB-; the activity and expression of enzymes involved in the inflammatory process ( cyclooxygenases); and the effect on selected acute phase proteins: C-reactive protein ( CRP) , haptoglobin , and ceruloplasmin. We also discuss the influence of Pb on the immune system cells ( T and B lymphocytes , macrophages , Langerhans cells) and the secretion of IgA , IgE , IgG , histamine , and endothelin.
