  The ability to maintain core temperature within a narrow range despite rapid and dramatic changes in environmental temperature is essential for the survival of free-living mammals , and growing evidence implicates an important role for the hormone , leptin. Given that thyroid hormone plays a major role in thermogenesis , and circulating thyroid hormone levels are reduced in leptin-deficient states- an effect partially restored by leptin replacement- we sought to determine the extent to which leptin 's role in thermogenesis is mediated by raising thyroid hormone levels. To this end , we 1) quantified the effect of physiological leptin replacement on circulating levels of thyroid hormone in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice , and 2) determined if the effect of leptin to prevent the fall in core temperature in these animals during cold-exposure is mimicked by administration of a physiological dose of triiodothyronine ( T
