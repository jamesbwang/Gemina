  The high photocatalytic power of TiO ₂ nanoparticles has drawn great attention in environmental and medical applications. Coating surfaces with these particles enables us to benefit from self-cleaning properties and decomposition of pollutants. In this paper , two strategies have been introduced to coat ceramic tiles with TiO ₂ nanoparticles , and the self-cleaning effect of the surfaces on degradation of an organic dye under ultraviolent ( UV) exposure is investigated. In the first approach , a simple one-step heat treatment method is introduced for coating , and different parameters of the heat treatment process are examined. In the second method , TiO ₂ nanoparticles are first aminosilanized using ( 3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTES) treatment followed by their covalently attachment onto CO ₂ plasma treated ceramic tiles via
