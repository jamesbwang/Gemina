  The dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) , of the genus Flavivirus<pathogen> ( Flaviviridae) , has four antigenically distinct serotypes , of which DENV-3 is classified into five genotypes. Here , we describe the detection of DENV-3 genotype I in sera of a Brazilian patient travelling from Singapore to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , by using multiplex real-time RT-PCR , DNA sequencing of the whole envelope protein gene , and phylogenetic analysis. The virus shares ancestry with those identified in Bali , Indonesia , in 2015. It is possible that arboviruses such as Chikungunya ECSA genotype , DENV-4 genotype I , and Zika were introduced in Brazil from other continents during the multiple international events hosted by the country over the last four years , including World Youth Day , the Soccer World Cup , and the Summer Olympics.
