  Rhodiola is an increasingly widely used traditional Tibetan medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in China. The composition profiles of bioactive compounds are somewhat jagged according to different species , which makes it crucial to identify authentic Rhodiola species accurately so as to ensure clinical application of Rhodiola. In this paper , a nondestructive , rapid , and efficient method in classification of Rhodiola was developed by Fourier transform near-infrared ( FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics analysis. A total of 160 batches of raw spectra were obtained from four different species of Rhodiola by FT-NIR , such as Rhodiola crenulata , Rhodiola fastigiata , Rhodiola kirilowii , and Rhodiola brevipetiolata. After excluding the outliers , different performances of 3 sample dividing methods , 12 spectral preprocessing methods , 2 wavelength selection methods , and 2 modeling evaluation methods were compared. The results indicated that this combination was superior than others in the authenticity identification analysis , which was FT-NIR combined with sample set partitioning based on joint x-y distances ( SPXY) , standard normal variate transformation ( SNV) + Norris-Williams ( NW) + 2nd derivative , competitive adaptive reweighted sampling ( CARS) , and kernel extreme learning machine ( KELM). The accuracy ( ACCU) , sensitivity ( SENS) , and specificity ( SPEC) of the optimal model were all 1 , which showed that this combination of FT-NIR and chemometrics methods had the optimal authenticity identification performance. The classification performance of the partial least squares discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) model was slightly lower than KELM model , and PLS-DA model results were ACCU = 0.97 , SENS = 0.93 , and SPEC = 0.98 , respectively. It can be concluded that FT-NIR combined with chemometrics analysis has great potential in authenticity identification and classification of Rhodiola , which can provide a valuable reference for the safety and effectiveness of clinical application of Rhodiola.
