  Despite the sustained enthusiastic interest in fluorescent carbon nanodots ( FCNDs) , it is still challenging to achieve bright and widely tunable solid-state luminescence. Herein , organogels embedded with FCNDs were simply synthesized via a one-pot pyrolysis method. Subsequently , the excitation of a single ultraviolet ( UV) excitation line results in tunable solid-state luminescence ranging from blue to red with quantum yields ( QYs) > 14 %. In this study , N and S elements were co-doped to regulate the aggregation of FCNDs , which consequently modulated the Stokes shift of the photoluminescence ( PL) by managing the degree of photon reabsorption. Notably , without compact aggregations , the dispersions of FCNDs in the organogel matrix indeed render bright fluorescence , which results from the suppression of excessive photon reabsorption and nonradiative resonant energy transfer ( NRET).
