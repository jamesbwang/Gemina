  Bilobed and trilobed transposition flaps are versatile random pattern transposition flaps that reliably restore nasal symmetry , topography , light reflex , and contour and are frequently used in cutaneous nasal reconstructive surgery. The authors wish to compare the characteristics of bilobed and trilobed flaps in cutaneous reconstructive surgery and to identify scenarios for their differential use. A retrospective chart review over 7 years of consecutive patients who underwent reconstruction with a bilobed or trilobed flap after Mohs micrographic surgery was performed. Statistical analysis of patient and surgery characteristics , anatomical distribution , postprocedural events , and need for revisions after both flap types was conducted. One hundred eleven patients with bilobed flaps and 74 patients with trilobed flaps were identified. Bilobed flaps are significantly more frequently used on the inferior nasal dorsum and on the sidewall , whereas trilobed flaps are significantly more frequently used on the nasal tip and infratip. No significant difference in postprocedural events ( e.g. , complications , erythema , trapdoor) was noted between the two flap types. Bilobed and trilobed transposition flaps are versatile means of repair for nasal reconstruction. Trilobed flaps may be used to repair defects in a more distal nasal location than bilobed flaps. Regardless of flap type , complications are rare. Therapeutic , III.
