  The epithelial barrier of the lung is destroyed during acute lung injury ( ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) due to the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs). Therefore , treatments that block AEC apoptosis might be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate ALI. Based on recent evidence , A2B adenosine receptor ( A2BAR) plays an important role in ALI in several different animal models , but its exact function in AECs has not been clarified. We investigated the role of A2BAR in AEC apoptosis in a mouse model of oleic acid ( OA)- induced ALI and in hydrogen peroxide ( H
