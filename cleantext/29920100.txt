  A Cu-catalyzed three-component cascade cyclization among 2-formylbenzonitrile , cyclopropyl ketones , and diaryliodonium salts for the construction of fused isoindolin-1-one compounds is achieved. Pentacyclic isoindolinone derivatives could be obtained in moderate to good yields. The proposed mechanism involved a ring expansion of cyclopropyl ketones/formation of N-acyliminium/hetero- ( 4 + 2)- cycloaddition process.
