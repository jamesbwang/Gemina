  This study revealed multifaceted regulation of ALDH1A1 by Cdk5 in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) pathogenesis. ALDH1A1 is a multifunctional enzyme with dehydrogenase , esterase , and anti-oxidant activities. ALDH1A1 is also a major regulator of retinoic acid ( RA) signaling , which is critical for normal brain homeostasis. We identified ALDH1A1 as both physiological and pathological target of Cdk5. First , under neurotoxic conditions , Cdk5-induced oxidative stress upregulates ALDH1A1 transcription. Second , Cdk5 increases ALDH1A1 levels by preventing its ubiquitylation via direct phosphorylation. Third , ALDH1A1 phosphorylation increases its dehydrogenase activity by altering its tetrameric state to a highly active monomeric state. Fourth , persistent oxidative stress triggered by deregulated Cdk5 inactivates ALDH1A1. Thus , initially , the good Cdk5 attempts to mitigate ensuing oxidative stress by upregulating ALDH1A1 via phosphorylation and paradoxically by increasing oxidative stress. Later , sustained oxidative stress generated by Cdk5 inhibits ALDH1A1 activity , leading to neurotoxicity. ALDH1A1 upregulation is highly neuroprotective. In human AD tissues , ALDH1A1 levels increase with disease severity. However , ALDH1A1 activity was highest at mild and moderate stages , but declines significantly at severe stage. These findings confirm that during the initial stages , neurons attempt to upregulate and activate ALDH1A1 to protect from accruing oxidative stress-induced damage; however , persistently deleterious conditions inactivate ALDH1A1 , further contributing to neurotoxicity. This study thus revealed two faces of Cdk5 , good and bad in neuronal function and survival , with a single substrate , ALDH1A1. The bad Cdk5 prevails in the end , overriding the good Cdk5 act , suggesting that Cdk5 is an effective therapeutic target for AD.
