  Centromere protein I ( CENPI) , an important member of centromere protein family , has been suggest to serve as a oncogene in breast cancer , but the clinical significance and biological function of CENPI in colorectal cancer ( CRC) is still unclear. In our results , we found CENPI was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cells , and associated with clinical stage , tumor depth , lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis and differentiation in CRC patients. However , there was no significant association between CENPI protein expression and overall survival time in colon cancer patients and rectal cancer patients through analyzing TCGA survival data. Moreover , CENPI mRNA and protein were increased in metastatic lymph nodes compared with primary CRC tissues. Down-regulation of CENPI expression suppresses CRC cell migration , invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition process. In conclusion , CENPI is overexpressed in CRC and functions as oncogene in modulating CRC cell migration , invasion and EMT process.
