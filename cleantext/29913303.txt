  Both the HIV<pathogen> epidemic and incarceration disproportionately affect Black men in the United States. A critical period for incarcerated Black men living with HIV/AIDS is re-entry into the community , which is often associated with adverse health outcomes. Additionally , Black men living with HIV/AIDS involved in the criminal justice system are burdened by multiple , intersecting disadvantaged identities and social positions. This study aimed to examine community re-entry experiences among Black men living with HIV/AIDS from an intersectional perspective. In-depth , semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 incarcerated Black men in Wisconsin , at pre-release from prison and six months after re-entry. Thematic analysis guided by intersectionality theory was used to analyze interview transcripts. Seven emerged themes included Intersectional Identities and Social Positions , Family Support , Neighborhood Violence , Relationship with Law Enforcement , Employment , Mental Health Concerns , and Medical Care and Medication Management. Intersecting identities and social positions interact with factors at multiple levels to inform health and HIV<pathogen> care. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate relationships among themes. Findings demonstrate the relevance of intersectionality theory in HIV<pathogen> care with Black men involved in criminal justice system. Incorporating a social-ecological perspective into intersectionality framework could be useful in theoretical and empirical research. Disenfranchised communities may particularly benefit from interventions that address community- and systemic-level issues.
