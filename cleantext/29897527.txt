  The benefits of indicated primary prevention among individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis ( CHR-P) are limited by the difficulty in detecting these individuals. To overcome this problem , a transdiagnostic , clinically based , individualized risk calculator has recently been developed and subjected to a first external validation in 2 different catchment areas of the South London and Maudsley ( SLaM) NHS Trust. Second external validation of real world , real-time electronic clinical register-based cohort study. All individuals who received a first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the Camden and Islington ( C&I) NHS Trust between 2009 and 2016 were included. The model previously validated included age , gender , ethnicity , age by gender , and ICD-10 index diagnosis to predict the development of any ICD-10 nonorganic psychosis. The model 's performance was measured using Harrell 's C-index. This study included a total of 13702 patients with an average age of 40 ( range 16-99) , 52 % were female , and most were of white ethnicity ( 64 %). There were no CHR-P or child/adolescent services in the C&I Trust. The C&I and SLaM Trust samples also differed significantly in terms of age , gender , ethnicity , and distribution of index diagnosis. Despite these significant differences , the original model retained an acceptable predictive performance ( Harrell 's C of 0.73) , which is comparable to that of CHR-P tools currently recommended for clinical use. This risk calculator may pragmatically support an improved transdiagnostic detection of at-risk individuals and psychosis prediction even in NHS Trusts in the United Kingdom where CHR-P services are not provided.
