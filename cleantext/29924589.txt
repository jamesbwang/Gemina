  As recent developments in noninvasive biosensors spearhead the thrust toward personalized health and fitness monitoring , there is a need for high throughput , cost-effective fabrication of flexible sensing components. Toward this goal , we present roll-to-roll ( R2R) gravure printed electrodes that are robust under a range of electrochemical sensing applications. We use inks and electrode morphologies designed for electrochemical and mechanical stability , achieving devices with uniform redox kinetics printed on 150 m flexible substrate rolls. We show that these electrodes can be functionalized into consistently high performing sensors for detecting ions , metabolites , heavy metals , and other small molecules in noninvasively accessed biofluids , including sensors for real-time , in situ perspiration monitoring during exercise. This development of robust and versatile R2R gravure printed electrodes represents a key translational step in enabling large-scale , low-cost fabrication of disposable wearable sensors for personalized health monitoring applications.
