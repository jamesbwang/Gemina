  Antroquinonol , a ubiquinone derivative that shows anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities , is produced during solid-state fermentation of A. camphorata , however , it can not be biosynthesized via conventional submerged fermentation. A method for enhancing the biosynthesis of Antroquinonol by controlling pH and adding oxygen vector in 7L bioreactor was studied. In shake flask experiments , a maximum Antroquinonol production of 31.39 Â± 0.78 mg/L was obtained by fermentation with adding 0.2 g/L Co Q The results demonstrated that pH played an important role in Antroquinonol synthesis in the presence of the effective precursor Co Q
