  Five new secondary metabolites , modiolides D-G ( 1-4) and 1- ( 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) -3-methoxy-butan-1-one ( 8) , one new natural product , 1- ( 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) -3-hydroxybutan-1-one ( 7) , along with three known compounds , modiolides A ( 5) and B ( 6) , and 1- ( 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) -2-buten-1-one ( 9) were isolated from a fermentation culture of the marine endophytic fungus Paraconiothyrium sp.. VK-13. Their chemical structures were elucidated by the NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis as well as the modified Mosher 's method. Compounds 7 and 9 inhibited the overproduction of proinflammatory mediators NO and PGE
