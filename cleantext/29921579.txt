  During the study of host-parasite relationships in taeniid parasite diseases , including cysticercosis and hydatidosis , reports have described the presence of host proteins in the cyst<symptom> fluid and tissue of metacestodes. However , the fate or role of host elements inside the parasite remains barely explored. After the publication of genomes of four cestode species , it became clear that these organisms possess a limited biosynthetic capability. The initial goal of the present study was to determine if uptaken host proteins could be a source of essential amino acids for cysticerci. To track the utilization of uptaken proteins , we added metabolically labeled IgG-
