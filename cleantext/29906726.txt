  Resistance-in-series models have been applied to investigate fouling behavior. However , it is difficult to model the influence of morphology on fouling behavior because resistance is indirectly calculated from the water flux and transmembrane pressure. In this study , optical coherence tomography ( OCT) was applied to evaluate the resistance of the fouling layer based on fouling morphology. Sodium alginate , humic acid , and bovine serum albumin ( BSA) with high salts concentrations ( conductivity: 23 mS/cm) were used as model foulants. At the same total fouling resistance , BSA showed the highest cake layer thickness ( BSA ( 114.5 μm) > humic acid ( 53.5 μm) > sodium alginate ( 20.0 μm)). However , a different order was found for the cake layer resistance ( BSA > sodium alginate > humic acid). This indicates that fouling thickness is not correlated with cake layer resistance. According to the Carman-Kozeny equation , fouling layer porosity decreased in the following order: humic acid ( 0.30) > BSA ( 0.21) > sodium alginate ( 0.20). In addition , we provided a specific value that was calculated using the ratio between the fouling thickness and cake layer resistance. The results show that alginic acid induced a stronger cake layer resistance , despite its thin fouling layer , whereas BSA showed a relatively low potential for inducing cake layer resistance. The results obtained in this study could be used for estimating and predicting fouling behavior.
