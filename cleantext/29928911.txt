  Mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL). Early-stage MF patches or plaques often resemble inflammatory skin disorders ( ISDs) , including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis<disease>. Cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1) , initially identified as a tumor suppressor gene in human non-small-cell lung cancer , has been reported as a diagnostic marker for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL). We investigated CADM1 expression in MF neoplastic cells , especially during early stages , and evaluated its usefulness as a diagnostic marker for MF. We conducted a retrospective study using immunohistochemical staining and confirmed the expression of CADM1 in MF. In addition , we compared CADM1 mRNA expression in microdissected MF samples and ISD samples. In the overall study period , 55 of 58 ( 94.8 %) MF samples stained positive for CADM1. None of the 50 ISD samples showed positive reactivity ( P < 0.0001). We found CADM1 mRNA expression in the intradermal lymphocytes of MF cases , but not in those of ISD cases. We did not conduct a validation study for MF cases in other institutions. CADM1 positive cells can be identified in early cases with less infiltrating cells and may be useful as a diagnostic marker for early-stage MF.
