  Niemann-Pick Type C1 disorder ( NPC) is a rare lysosomal storage disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. NPC has no FDA approved treatments yet , however 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ( HPβCD) has shown efficacy for treating the disease in both mouse and feline NPC models and is currently being investigated in late stage clinical trials. Despite promising results , therapeutic use of HPβCD is limited by the need for high doses , ototoxicity and intrathecal administration. These limitations can be attributed to its poor pharmacokinetic profile. In the attempt to overcome these limitations , we have designed a β-cyclodextrin ( βCD) based polymer prodrugs ( ORX-301) for an enhanced pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profile , which in turn can potentially provide an improved efficacy at lower doses. We demonstrated that subcutaneously injected ORX-301 extended the mean lifespan of NPC mice at a dosage 5-fold lower ( 800 mg/kg , body<symptom> weight) the HPβCD dose proven efficacious ( 4000 mg/kg). We also show that ORX-301 penetrates the blood brain barrier and counteracts neurological impairment. These properties represent a substantial improvement and appear to overcome major limitations of presently available βCD-based therapy , demonstrating that this novel prodrug is a valuable alternative/complement for existing therapies.
