  Mammary and extra-mammary Paget disease is a rare form of intra-epithelial glandular neoplasm which is characteristically recurrent and necessitates multiple excisions that have an important impact on morbidity. Local immuno-modulating treatments have been applied with promising results , but the local immune markers of Paget disease have not been studied. To investigate the local immune micro-environment of Paget disease. Sixty-four specimens from 41 patients , including cases with multiple recurrences and underlying primary neoplasm , have been studied for their expression of CD3 , PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Nineteen cases were mammary; 22 were extra-mammary and involved the vulva , the anus , the inguinal region and the lower extremity. PD-L1 was not expressed by any neoplastic lesion<symptom> or the associated lymphocytes. CTLA-4 expression was found in nine cases. Higher stromal CD3 expression and moderate levels of intra-epithelial CD3 expression were present in most cases. Biopsies , subsequent excision specimens and recurrences showed the same immunohistochemical profile of CD3 and PD-L1 , although there were different levels of CTLA-4 in a few cases. The underlying lesions<symptom> in mammary Paget disease showed the same immunohistochemical profile as the intra-epithelial neoplastic cells. The expression of the markers did not correlate with age , sex , localization or recurrence. Paget disease is characterized by an intense lymphocytic response , devoid of the immune-suppressive impact of the PD-L1 pathway , but with occasional CTLA-4 expression.
