  To explore the role of NADPH oxidase 4 ( NOX4) in transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β)- induced A549 cells migration. The A549 cells were allocated into five groups: TGF-β ( stimulation) group , Normal control group , DPI ( NOX4 inhibitor) group , TGF-β + DPI group , and DMSO ( solvent control) group. The level of ROS were detected by flow cytometry instrument. The level of NOX4 , snail and E-cadherin protein were detected by western blot. Use scratches experiment to express the change of A549 cells migration. After the quantification by Quantity One software , the expression of NOX4 in TGF-β group is ( 1. 80 ± 0. 07) , the TGF-β + DPI group is ( 0. 49 ± 0. 03) ( F = 327. 071 , P < 0. 001). The change of EMT related protein: the expression of snail protein in TGF-β group is ( 9. 0 ± 0. 6) , the TGF-β + DPI group is ( 1. 8 ± 0. 3) ( F = 119. 097 , P < 0. 001) , the expression of E-cadherin protein in TGF-β group is ( 0. 5 ± 0. 1) , the TGF-β + DPI group is ( 3. 3 ± 0. 3) ( F = 71. 063 , P < 0. 001). These aboveresult indicate that DPI can inhibit the expression of NOX4 and EMTprogress in A549 cells. Then TGF-β + DPI group compared with the TGF-β group , the scratch healing rate is decreased ( F = 33. 899 , P < 0. 001). It illustrates that DPI can inhibit migration ability of A549 cells. After the NOX4 was inhibited by DPI , TGF-β-induced migration of A549 cells was inhibited. And this phenomenon is associated with the progress of TGF-β-induced EMT.
