  We report an improved method for the calculation of tunneling splittings between degenerate configurations in molecules and clusters using path-integral molecular dynamics ( PIMD). Starting from an expression involving a ratio of thermodynamic density matrices at the bottom of the symmetric wells , we use thermodynamic integration with molecular dynamics simulations and a Langevin thermostat to compute the splittings stochastically. The thermodynamic integration is performed by sampling along the semiclassical instanton path , which provides an efficient reaction coordinate as well as being physically well-motivated. This approach allows us to carry out PIMD calculations of the multi-well tunneling splitting pattern in the water dimer and to refine previous PIMD calculations for one-dimensional models and malonaldehyde. The large ( acceptor) splitting in the water dimer agrees to within 20 % of benchmark variational results , and the smaller splittings agree to within 10 %.
