  Water clusters are an important species in the environment and atmosphere and take part in various chemical and biological reactions. How their optical properties vary with size is still an open question. Using the GW method and Bethe-Salpeter equation within the ab initio many-body Green<symptom> 's function theory , we study the electronic excitations in a series of water clusters ( H
