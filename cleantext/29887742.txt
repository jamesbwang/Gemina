  A power packet is a unit of electric power composed of a power pulse and an information tag. In Shannon 's information theory , messages are represented by symbol sequences in a digitized manner. Referring to this formulation , we define symbols in power packetization as a minimum unit of power transferred by a tagged pulse. Here , power is digitized and quantized. In this paper , we consider packetized power in networks for a finite duration , giving symbols and their energies to the networks. A network structure is defined using a graph whose nodes represent routers , sources and destinations. First , we introduce the concept of a symbol propagation matrix ( SPM) in which symbols are transferred at links during unit times. Packetized power is described as a network flow in a spatio-temporal structure. Then , we study the problem of selecting an SPM in terms of transferability , that is , the possibility to represent given energies at sources and destinations during the finite duration. To select an SPM , we consider a network flow problem of packetized power. The problem is formulated as an M-convex submodular flow problem which is a solvable generalization of the minimum cost flow problem. Finally , through examples , we verify that this formulation provides reasonable packetized power.
