  Liriomyza chinensis is a serious pest of onions in many countries , especially in East Asia. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of this species and compared it with five other Agromyzidae species. The L. chinensis mitogenome is a double-stranded 16,175 bp circular molecule with an A + T content of 78.3 %. It contains 37 genes and a control region as do the sequenced Liriomyza species. The mitogenomes of L. chinensis and other Agromyzidae species showed a clear bias in nucleotide composition with a positive AT-skew. Most PCGs used standard ATN as start codons , and TAN as termination codons. The tRNAs exhibited the typical clover-leaf structure , except for tRNASer
