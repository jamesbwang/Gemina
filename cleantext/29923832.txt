  It is well known that there are structural differences between cortical and cancellous bone. However , spinal surgeons currently have no reliable method to non-invasively determine these differences in real-time when choosing the optimal starting point and trajectory to insert pedicle screws and avoid surgical complications associated with breached or weakened bone. This paper explores 3D photoacoustic imaging of a human vertebra to noninvasively differentiate cortical from cancellous bone for this surgical task. We observed that signals from the cortical bone tend to appear as compact , high-amplitude signals , while signals from the cancellous bone have lower amplitudes and are more diffuse. In addition , we discovered that the location of the light source for photoacoustic imaging is a critical parameter that can be adjusted to non-invasively determine the optimal entry point into the pedicle. Once inside the pedicle , statistically significant differences in the contrast and SNR of signals originating from the cancellous core of the pedicle ( when compared to signals originating from the surrounding cortical bone) were obtained with laser energies of 0.23-2.08 mJ ( p < 0.05). Similar quantitative differences were observed with an energy of 1.57 mJ at distances â©¾ 6 mm from the cortical bone of the pedicle. These quantifiable differences between cortical and cancellous bone ( when imaging with an ultrasound probe in direct contact with each bone type) can potentially be used to ensure an optimal trajectory during surgery. Our results are promising for the introduction and development of photoacoustic imaging systems to overcome a wide range of longstanding challenges with spinal surgeries , including challenges with the occurrence of bone breaches due to misplaced pedicle screws.
