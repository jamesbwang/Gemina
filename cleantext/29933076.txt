  An adapted methodology for obtaining lipid nanoparticles that only uses the microwave reactor in the synthesis process was developed. The method has the following features: one-pot , one-step , fast , practical , economical , safe , readiness of scaling-up , lack of organic solvents and production of nanoparticles with low polydispersity index ( PDI) ( below 0.3). This new method was applied for the development of nanostructured lipid carriers ( NLC) loaded with a hydrophilic drug , the antiretroviral agent zidovudine ( AZT). The aim of the present work was to develop , evaluate and compare optimized NLC formulations produced by two different methods- hot ultrasonication and microwave-assisted method. The development and optimization of the NLC formulations were supported by a Quality by Design ( QbD) approach. All formulations were physicochemically characterized by the same parameters. The optimized formulations presented a suitable profile for oral administration ( particle size between 100 and 300 nm , PDI < 0.3 and negative zeta potential > -20 mV). Furthermore , the morphologies assessed by TEM showed spherical shape and confirmed the results obtained by DLS. Both AZT loaded formulations were physically stable for at least 45 days and non-toxic on Jurkat T cells. Drug release studies showed a controlled release of AZT under gastric and plasma-simulated conditions.
