  The effect of Zataria multiflora Boiss Essential oil ( EO) on the growth , spore production , and citrinin production of Penicellium citrinum<pathogen> PTCC 5304 in the culture media as well as Iranian ultra-filtered white cheese in brine was investigated. Radial growth and spore production on the potato dextrose agar ( PDA) were effectively inhibited by EO in a dose-dependent manner. At 200 ppm , the radial growth and sporulation declined by 92 % and 100 % , respectively. The growth was completely prevented at 400 ppm of EO on PDA and the minimum fungicidal concentration ( MFC) of the oil was estimated at 400 ppm. Furthermore , the Zataria multiflora also significantly suppressed the mycelial growth and citrinin production in broth medium at all investigated concentrations ( P < 0.05). At 150 ppm of EO , the citrinin accumulation and mycelial growth reduced by 88.6 % and 89.6 % , respectively. The EO was tested at all concentrations and the findings show an inhibitory effect of P.<pathogen> citrinum<pathogen> against the radial fungal growth and citrinin production in cheese. However , no concentration of EO could completely inhibit the growth and production of citrinin in cheese. We therefore concluded that Zataria multiflora has the potential to substitute the antifungal chemicals as a natural inhibitor to control the growth of molds in foods such as cheese.
