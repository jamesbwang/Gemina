  Pressure garments are widely employed for management of postburn scarring. Although pressure magnitude has been linked to efficacy , maintenance of uniform pressure delivery is challenging. An understanding of garment fabric properties is needed to optimize pressure delivery for the duration of garment use. To address this issue , compression vests were manufactured using two commonly used fabrics , Powernet or Dri-Tek Tricot , to achieve 10 % reduction in circumference for a child-sized mannequin. Applied pressure was tracked on five anatomical sites over 23 hours , before laundering or after one and five laundering cycles. Load relaxation and fatigue<symptom> of fabrics were tested before laundering or after one and five laundering cycles , and structural analysis via scanning electron microscopy was performed. Prior to laundering , pressure vests fabricated using Powernet or Dri-Tek Tricot generated a maximum pressure on the mannequin of 20 and 23 mm Hg , respectively. With both fabrics , pressure decreased during daily wear. Following five laundering cycles , Dri-Tek Tricot vests delivered a maximum of 7 vs 15 mm Hg pressure for Powernet at the same site. In cyclic tensile and load relaxation tests , exerted force correlated with fabric weave orientation with greatest force measured parallel to a fabric 's long axis. The results demonstrate that Powernet exhibited the greatest applied force with the least garment fatigue<symptom>. Fabric orientation with respect to the primary direction of tension was a critical factor in pressure generation and maintenance. This study suggests that fabrication of garments using Powernet with its long axis parallel to patient 's body part circumference may enhance the magnitude and maintenance of pressure delivery.
