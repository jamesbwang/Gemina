  Vertebrate retinal photoreceptors house visual pigments that absorb light to begin the process of vision. The light absorbed by a visual pigment depends on its two molecular components: protein ( opsin) and chromophore ( a vitamin A derivative). Although an increasing number of studies show intraretinal variability in visual pigment content , it is only for two mammals ( human and mouse) and two birds ( chicken and pigeon) that such variability has been demonstrated to underlie differences in spectral sensitivity of the animal. Here , we show that the spectral sensitivity of the northern anchovy varies with retinal quadrant<symptom> and that this variability can be explained by differences in the expression of opsin transcripts. Retinal ( vitamin A1) was the only chromophore detected in the retina , ruling out this molecular component as a source of variation in spectral sensitivity. Chromatic adaptation experiments further showed that the dorsal retina had the capacity to mediate color<symptom> vision<symptom>. Together with published results for the ventral retina , this study is the first to demonstrate that intraretinal opsin variability in a fish drives corresponding variation in the animal 's spectral sensitivity.
