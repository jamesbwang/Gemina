  Described as `` universal prepayment , '' the national health insurance ( or single-payer) model of universal health coverage is increasingly promoted by international actors as a means of raising revenue for health care and improving social risk protection in low- and middle-income countries. Likewise , in the United States , the recent failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have renewed debate about where to go next with health reform and arguably opened the door for a single-payer , Medicare-for-All plan , an alternative once considered politically infeasible. Policy debates about single-payer or national health insurance in the United States and abroad have relied heavily on Canada 's system as an ideal-typical single-payer system but have not systematically examined health system performance indicators across different universal coverage models. Using available cross-national data , we categorize countries with universal coverage into those best exemplifying national health insurance ( single-payer) , national health service , and social health insurance models and compare them to the United States in terms of cost , access , and quality. Through this comparison , we find that many critiques of single-payer are based on misconceptions or are factually incorrect , but also that single-payer is not the only option for achieving universal coverage in the United States and internationally.
