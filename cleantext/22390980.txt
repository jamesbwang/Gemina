  This study aimed to evaluate the dentin bond strength and degree of polymerization of bulk-fill and methacrylate-based flowable composites. Dentin bond strength of composites was evaluated using the microtensile bond strength ( μTBS) test. Five different composites were applied on flat dentin surfaces with self-etch and etch-and-rinse adhesives. Twenty microspecimens with a 1 mm According to the μTBS test results , the SDR Etch-and-Rinse group exhibited the highest dentin bonding strength and the Aelita self-etch group exhibited the lowest ( Bulk-fill composite demonstrates an even higher degree of polymerization of methacrylate-based flowable composite when applied in a 4-mm thickness.
