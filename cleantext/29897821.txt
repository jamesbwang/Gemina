  Resistance training promotes microvasculature expansion; however , it remains unknown how different resistance training programs contribute to angiogenesis. Thus , we recruited experienced resistance trained participants and determined the effect of 12 wk of either high-repetition/low-load or low-repetition/high-load resistance training performed to volitional fatigue<symptom> on muscle microvasculature. Twenty men performed either a high-repetition ( 20-25 repetitions , 30-50 % of 1RM; n = 10) or a low-repetition ( 8-12 repetitions , 75-90 % of 1RM; n = 10) resistance training program. Muscle biopsies were taken before and after resistance training , and immunohistochemistry was used to assess fiber-type ( I and II) specific microvascular variables. High-repetition/low-load and low-repetition/high-load groups were not different in any variable before resistance training. Both protocols resulted in an increase in capillarization. Specifically , after resistance training the capillary-to-fiber ratio , capillary contacts , capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange index , were elevated and sharing factor was reduced. These data demonstrate that resistance training performed to volitional failure , using either high-repetition/low-load or low-repetition/high-load , induced similar microvascular adaptations in recreationally resistance trained young men.
