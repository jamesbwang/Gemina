  Smoking is considered an important source for inorganic elements , most of them toxic for human health. During the last years , there has been a significant increase in the use of e-cigarettes , although the role of them as source of inorganic elements has not been well established. A cross-sectional study including a total of 150 subjects from Brasov ( Romania) , divided into three groups ( non-smokers , cigarette smokers and electronic cigarettes smokers) were recruited to disclose the role of smoking on the human exposure to inorganic elements. Concentration of 42 elements , including trace elements , elements in the ATSDR 's priority pollutant list and rare earth elements ( REE) were measured by ICP-MS in the blood serum of participants. Cigarette smokers showed the highest levels of copper , molybdenum , zinc , antimony , and strontium. Electronic cigarette ( e-cigarette) users presented the highest concentrations of selenium , silver , and vanadium. Beryllium , europium and lanthanides were detected more frequently among e-cigarette users ( 20.6 % , 23.5 % , and 14.7 %) than in cigarette smokers ( 1.7 % , 19.0 % , and 12.1 % , respectively); and the number of detected REE was also higher among e-cigarette users ( 11.8 % of them showed more than 10 different elements). Serum levels of cerium and erbium increased as the duration of the use of e-cigarettes was longer. We have found that smoking is mainly a source of heavy metals while the use of e-cigarettes is a potential source of REE. However , these elements were detected at low concentrations.
