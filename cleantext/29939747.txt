  In-solution small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering ( SAXS/SANS) have become popular methods to characterize the structure of membrane proteins , solubilized by either detergents or nanodiscs. SANS studies of protein-detergent complexes usually require deuterium-labeled proteins or detergents , which in turn often lead to problems in their expression or purification. Here , we report an approach whose novelty is the combined analysis of SAXS and SANS data from an unlabeled membrane protein complex in solution in two complementary ways. First , an explicit atomic analysis , including both protein and detergent molecules , using the program WAXSiS , which has been adapted to predict SANS data. Second , the use of MONSA which allows one to discriminate between detergent head- and tail-groups in an ab initio approach. Our approach is readily applicable to any detergent-solubilized protein and provides more detailed structural information on protein-detergent complexes from unlabeled samples than SAXS or SANS alone.
