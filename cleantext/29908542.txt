  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) remains a major threat to human health. Understanding the strategies mycobacteria take to overcome immune defense is important in order to control the infection. Micro ( mi) RNAs are master regulators of most pathways in the human body. Infection with mycobacterium<disease> impacts upon the host metabolic pathways as they are subverted to obtain the nutrition for intracellular TB survival. In this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG) infection on the expression of three miRNAs ( miR-1224 , -484 and -425) , which are important in infection and in the regulation of metabolic pathways. Peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophage ( MDM) cultures were prepared and infected with BCG at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI) = 10 or left uninfected as a control. 72h post-infection , RNA was extracted from the cultured cells and cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR performed. Expression levels miRNAs were normalized to the levels of U6 snRNA ( Rnu6) using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Infection with BCG resulted in a highly significant increase in miR-1224 expression ( 24.4 ± 3.8-fold induction) in human MDMs. The induction of miR-484 ( 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase) and of miR-425 ( 1.2 ± 0.2-fold increase) was less increased compared to miR-1224. Mycobacterium<disease> tolerates a hostile microenvironment by escaping from lysosomal degradation and providing a lipid-rich niche by trigger with and re-pattering host metabolism. This study highlighted the potential roles of miRNAs in host responses upon mycobacterium<disease> infection.
