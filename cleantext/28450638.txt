  Electrochemical deposition is a facile strategy to prepare functional materials but suffers from limitation in thin films and uncontrollable interface engineering. Here we report a universal electrosynthesis of metal hydroxides/oxides on varied substrates via reduction of oxyacid anions. On graphitic substrates , we find that the insertion of nitrate ion in graphene layers significantly enhances the electrodeposit-support interface , resulting in high mass loading and super hydrophilic/aerophobic properties. For the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction , the nanocrystalline cerium dioxide and amorphous nickel hydroxide co-electrodeposited on graphite exhibits low overpotential ( 177 mV@10 mA cm
