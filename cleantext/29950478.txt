  Limited studies have identified predictors of early and late hospital readmissions in Australian healthcare settings. Some of these predictors may be modifiable through targeted interventions. A recent study has identified malnutrition as a predictor of readmissions in older patients but this has not been verified in a larger population. This study investigated what predictors are associated with early and late readmissions and determined whether nutrition status during index hospitalisation can be used as a modifiable predictor of unplanned hospital readmissions. A retrospective cohort study. Two tertiary-level hospitals in Australia. All medical admissions ≥ 18 years over a period of 1 year. Primary objective was to determine predictors of early ( 0-7 days) and late ( 8-180 days) readmissions. Secondary objective was to determine whether nutrition status as determined by malnutrition universal screening tool ( MUST) can be used to predict readmissions. There were 11750 ( 44.8 %) readmissions within 6 months , with 2897 ( 11 %) early and 8853 ( 33.8 %) late readmissions. MUST was completed in 16.2 % patients and prevalence of malnutrition during index admission was 31 %. Malnourished patients had a higher risk of both early ( OR 1.39 , 95 % CI 1.12 to 1.73) and late readmissions ( OR 1.23 , 95 % CI 1.06 to 128). Weekend discharges were less likely to be associated with both early ( OR 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.74 to 0.91) and late readmissions ( OR 0.91 , 95 % CI 0.84 to 0.97). Indigenous Australians had a higher risk of early readmissions while those living alone had a higher risk of late readmissions. Patients ≥ 80 years had a lower risk of early readmissions while admission to intensive care unit was associated with a lower risk of late readmissions. Malnutrition is a strong predictor of unplanned readmissions while weekend discharges are less likely to be associated with readmissions. Targeted nutrition intervention may prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. ANZCTRN 12617001362381; Results.
