  To assess the effectiveness of the interventions to prevent a pregnancy in adolescence. Systematic review. The following databases were consulted: PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , Cuiden Plus , LILACS , and IME , in order to identify interventions aimed at preventing a pregnancy in adolescence. A total of 24 primary investigations , in which an educational program to prevent a pregnancy in the adolescence was evaluated , were selected. The quality of the selected studies was assessed according to the CASPe scale. Educational programs for the modification of the teenage pregnancy rate show inconclusive results , as there are 2 studies that find a reduction , and 2 that find that there are no significant changes. For secondary outcomes , it was found that educational programs are effective for increasing the knowledge level about sexuality and contraceptive methods and changing attitudes about the risk of a teenage pregnancy or the use of contraceptive methods. There are no statistically significant differences between the studies with a positive and negative outcome ( P > .05) for any of the results analysed in this review. There is no a single intervention modality that is the most effective for prevention of a teenage pregnancy. More research is needed with a longitudinal approach that assess not only intermediate results , but also a modification in the pregnancy rate.
