  Focused cardiac ultrasound ( FOCUS) examination using a portable device is increasingly used for bedside diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. This is a 4-week pilot project aiming to teach medical students to perform FOCUS to detect valvular heart lesions<symptom>. Patients undergoing routine transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) were recruited by third year medical students who performed physical examination ( PE) and FOCUS after 6-hour training to detect significant ( moderate-to-severe) valvular lesions<symptom>. Performance of FOCUS and PE was compared to TTE as reference using kappa statistics. 10 medical students performed 212 PE and FOCUS on 107 patients with mean age 63.7 ± 14.9 years. TTE detected 126 significant valvular lesions<symptom> of which FOCUS correctly identified 54 lesions<symptom> ( κ = 0.45) compared to 32 lesions<symptom> by PE ( κ = 0.28 , p < 0.01). FOCUS was better than PE in identifying mitral stenosis ( κ = 0.51 vs. 0.17) , aortic stenosis ( κ = 0.45 vs. 0.16) and tricuspid regurgitation ( κ = 0.39 vs. 0.09 , all p < 0.01). Students became more proficient in performing FOCUS examination with time. Teaching junior medical students to perform and interpret FOCUS was feasible after brief training and better than PE in detecting significant valvular lesions<symptom>. Further studies are warranted to determine the utility of incorporating this new technology into mainstream medical training.
