  We recently showed that plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP) is mainly derived from VSIG4-positive Kupffer cells. Activation of these cells by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) strongly decreases CETP expression. As Kupffer cell activation plays a detrimental role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) , we aimed to study if metabolic liver inflammation<symptom> is also associated with a decrease in hepatic and circulating CETP. We collected plasma and liver biopsy samples at various stages of NAFLD from 93 obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. Liver lobular inflammation<symptom> was histologically determined , and liver CETP expression , CETP positive cells , circulating CETP concentrations , and liver VSIG4 expression were quantified. Mean ( SD) plasma CETP concentration was 2.68 ( 0.89) Î¼g/mL. In the presence of liver inflammation<symptom> , compared to the absence of pathology , the difference in hepatic CETP expression was -0.03 arbitrary units ( 95 % CI -0.26 , 0.20) , the difference in number of hepatic CETP positive cells ( range 11-140 per mm We found no strong evidence for a strong negative association between metabolic liver inflammation<symptom> and CETP-related outcomes in obese individuals , although we observed consistent trends. These data indicate that metabolic liver inflammation<symptom> does not mimic the strong effects of LPS on the hepatic expression and production of CETP by Kupffer cells.
