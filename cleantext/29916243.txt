  DNA origami nanostructures provide a platform where dye molecules can be arranged with nanoscale accuracy allowing to assemble multiple fluorophores without dye-dye aggregation. Aiming to develop a bright and sensitive ratiometric sensor system , we systematically studied the optical properties of nanoarrays of dyes built on DNA origami platforms using a DNA template that provides a high versatility of label choice at minimum cost. The dyes are arranged at distances , at which they efficiently interact by FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET). To optimize array brightness , the FRET efficiencies between the donor fluorescein ( FAM) and the acceptor cyanine 3 were determined for different sizes of the array and for different arrangements of the dye molecules within the array. By utilizing nanoarrays providing optimum FRET efficiency and brightness , we subsequently designed a ratiometric pH nanosensor using coumarin 343 as a pH-inert FRET donor and FAM as a pH-responsive acceptor. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of a ratiometric sensor can be improved simply by arranging the dyes into a well-defined array. The dyes used here can be easily replaced by other analyte-responsive dyes , demonstrating the huge potential of DNA nanotechnology for light harvesting , signal enhancement , and sensing schemes in life sciences.
