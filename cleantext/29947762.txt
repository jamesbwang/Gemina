  Large-scale epidemiological and population data provide opportunities to identify subgroups of people who are at risk of disease or exposed to adverse environments. Clustering algorithms are popular data-driven tools to identify these subgroups; however , relying exclusively on algorithms may not produce the best results if the dataset does not have a clustered structure. For this reason , we propose a framework ( the R-library Numero) that combines the self-organizing map algorithm , permutation analysis for statistical evidence and a final expert-driven subgrouping step. We used Numero to define subgroups in two examples without an obvious clustering structure: a biomedical dataset of kidney disease and another dataset of community-level socioeconomic indicators. We benchmarked the Numero subgroupings against popular clustering algorithms ( principal components , K-means and hierarchical clustering). The Numero subgroupings were more intuitive and easier to interpret without losing mathematical quality. Therefore , we expect Numero to be useful for exploratory analyses of population-based epidemiological datasets.
