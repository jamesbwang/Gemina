  Non-invasive quantitation of liver disease using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) could refine clinical care pathways , trial design and preclinical drug development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of multiparametric MRI in experimental models of liver disease. Liver injury was induced in rats using 4 or 12 weeks of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl
