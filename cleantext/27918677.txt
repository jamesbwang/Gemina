  The countermovement jump ( CMJ) and isometric mid-thigh pull ( IMTP) are commonly used to compare one 's force capacity during dynamic and isometric assessments , respectively. However , little research has investigated the influence of maximum isometric strength on drop-jump ( DJ) performance. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to explore differences in CMJ and DJ force-time characteristics between stronger and weaker adolescent male basketball players. Sixteen adolescent male basketball players performed the IMTP to assess measures of peak force ( IMTP PF) , whereas CMJ and DJ calculated a range of kinetic and kinematic variables. Peak concentric force ( CMJ-PF) in the CMJ was greater for stronger players (
