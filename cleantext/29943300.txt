  Hematological malignancies ( HM) are a heterogeneous group of life-threatening hematological diseases. The heterogeneity and clonal evolution of HM subpopulations are the main obstacles for precise diagnoses , risk stratification , and even targeted therapies. Standard bulk-sample genomic examinations average total mutations from multiple subpopulations and conceal the clonal diversity that may play a significant role in HM progression. Therefore , the development of novel methods that detect intra-tumor heterogeneity is critical for the discovery of novel potential therapeutic targets. The recently developed single cell sequencing ( SCS) technologies can analyse genetic polymorphisms at a single cell level. SCS requires the precise isolation of single cells and amplification of their genetic material. It allows the analysis of genomic , transcriptomic , and epigenomic information in single cancer cells. SCS may also be able to monitor minimal residual disease ( MRD) of HM by sequencing circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) from peripheral blood. Functional heterogeneity and clonal evolution exist in acute leukemia<disease> , multiple myeloma ( MM) and chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) subpopulations and have prognostic value. In this thesis , we provide an overview of SCS technologies in HM and discuss the heterogeneous genetic variation and clonal structure among subpopulations of HM. Furthermore , we aimed to shed light on the clinical applications of SCS technologies , including the development of new targeted therapies for drug-resistant or recurrent HM.
