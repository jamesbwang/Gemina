  Testosterone is considered as a primary sex hormone , also known as an important anabolic steroid , that may involve in various mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder ( BID). The goal of this study was to compare the testosterone salivary levels between different phases of BID and its association with the clinical features of BID. In a case-control study , 15 patients in the mania phase , 10 patients in the depression<symptom> phase , and 16 in the euthymia phase were selected as patient groups. 18 healthy sex- and age-matched individuals were considered as healthy control group. Salivary samples obtained from all patients and control group and levels of testosterone were determined in saliva using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All statistical calculations were conducted with the software Statistical Package for Social Science version 20 ( IBM Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA). The mean testosterone level in euthymia phase was 186.34 ± 182.62 pg/mL , mania phase was 239.29 ± 273.22 pg/mL , depression<symptom> was 153.49 ± 222.50 pg/mL , and healthy participants was 155.73 ± 126.0 pg/mL; no significant difference was found between groups ( Our findings do not reveal significant difference between different phases of BID in terms of salivary testosterone levels. However , more comprehensive studies with larger sample size are required to confirm our findings.
