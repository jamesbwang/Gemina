  Data sourcesThe Pubmed , Evidence-Based Dentistry , BMJ Clinical Evidence , EmbaseDynamed , and www.opengrey.eu databases and manual search of reference lists.Study selectionRandomised clinical trials ( RCTs) were accepted if they had: participants with no periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and teeth restored with SCs or FDPs and compared fibre posts and other prosthetic systems and evaluated the prosthetic complications with a minimum observational period of 36 months.Data extraction and synthesisTitles and abstracts were evaluated independently by two reviewers , any disagreement was discussed with a third reviewer. The agreement for the two reviewers was 97 %. The quality and the risk of bias of the studies included was assessed following the Cochrane Handbook considering the domains of randomisation , sample size , inclusion and exclusion criteria , follow-up achieved , blinding , withdrawing and groups ' compatibility for quality assessment , and for the risk of bias the domains evaluated were allocation concealment , blinding of outcome assessor and follow-up. ResultsThe database search yielded 4,230 records; after duplications removal , 3,670 records were reviewed independently by the authors , and four articles were chosen to include in the systematic review.The most frequently reported failures in the available studies were as follows: fibre post debonding , loss of retention of single crowns and marginal gaps. Less frequently , chippings and fractures were recorded in SCs. No studies about complications related to FDPs were found.The failure rate ranged from 0 to 28.2 %. ConclusionsA correlation between the failure rates of fibre posts and the type of prosthetic restoration ( SCs or FDPs) can not be found. Further RCTs are required to achieve evidence-based conclusions , particularly about the use of fibre posts with FDPs.
