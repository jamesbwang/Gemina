  Flavour and fragrance compounds are extremely important for food , feed , cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In the last decades , due to the consumer 's increased trend towards natural products , a great interest in natural aroma compounds has arisen to the detriment of chemically synthesised ones. Recently , solid state fermentation ( SSF) has been applied in the production of many metabolites. Aroma compounds can be produced by SSF with a higher yield compared to submerged fermentation ( SmF). In SSF processes , aroma compounds can be produced in the solid matrix or in the headspace , but they can be lost or stripped when aeration is required. This review focuses on the production of aroma compounds by SSF processes with a special highlight on in situ systems to recover the volatiles released in the gaseous phase and stripped due to aeration. Following a brief presentation of specificities of SSF processes concerning the choice of microorganisms and the solid matrix used for the production of aroma compounds , bioreactor aspects , factors affecting production of aroma compounds and in situ gas phase aroma recovery systems in aerated SSF bioreactors are discussed.
