  Angiopoietin-like 4 ( ANGPTL4) is an endogenous inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase that modulates lipid levels , coronary atherosclerosis risk , and nutrient partitioning. We hypothesize that loss of ANGPTL4 function might improve glucose homeostasis and decrease risk of type 2 diabetes ( T2D). We investigate protein-altering variants in ANGPTL4 among 58,124 participants in the DiscovEHR human genetics study , with follow-up studies in 82,766 T2D cases and 498,761 controls. Carriers of p.E40K , a variant that abolishes ANGPTL4 ability to inhibit lipoprotein lipase , have lower odds of T2D ( odds ratio 0.89 , 95 % confidence interval 0.85-0.92 , p = 6.3 Ã— 10
