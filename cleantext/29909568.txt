  The association between the checkpoint kinase 2 * 1100delC ( CHEK2 * 1100delC) and breast cancer has been extensively explored. In light of the recent publication of studies on these specific findings , particularly regarding male patients with breast cancer , we performed an updated meta-analysis to investigate a more reliable estimate. This meta-analysis included 26 published studies selected in a search of electronic databases up to January 2018 , including 118,735 breast cancer cases and 195,807 controls. Odds ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were used to assess the association between 1100delC and breast cancer. Meta-analysis results suggested that 1100delC contributed to an increased breast cancer risk in overall populations ( OR 2.89; 95 % CI 2.63-3.16). Subgroup analysis found ORs of 3.13 ( 95 % CI 1.94-5.07) for male breast cancer , 2.88 ( 95 % CI 2.63-3.16) for female breast cancer , 2.87 ( 95 % CI 1.85-4.47) for early-onset breast cancer , 2.92 ( 95 % CI 2.65-3.22) for invasive breast cancer , and 3.21 ( 95 % CI 2.41-4.29) for familial breast cancer. The sensitivity analysis suggested that results of this meta-analysis were generally robust. CHEK2 * 1100delC is associated with an increased risk of both female and male breast cancer.
