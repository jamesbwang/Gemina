  While hepatitis<disease> B<disease> and C have been the main drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) has recently become an important cause of HCC. The aim of this study was to assess the causes of HCC among liver transplant ( LT) candidates in the U.S.. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients ( 2002-2016) was used to estimate the trends in prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with the most common types of chronic liver disease: alcoholic liver disease ( ALD) , chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB) , chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> , and NASH. 158,347 adult LT candidates were included. Of these , 26,121 ( 16.5 %) had HCC; this proportion increased from 6.4 % ( 2002) to 23.0 % ( 2016) ( trend p < 0.0001). Over the study period , CHC remained the most common etiology for HCC ( 65 %). The proportions of HCC accounted for by CHC and ALD remained stable ( both trend p > 0.10) , the proportion of CHB decreased 3.1-fold ( p < 0.0001) , while the proportion of NASH in HCC increased 7.7-fold ( from 2.1 % to 16.2 % , p < 0.0001). Furthermore , since 2002 , the prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with NASH increased 11.8-fold , while this rate increased 6.0-fold in CHB , 3.4-fold in ALD and 2.3-fold in CHC ( all p < 0.0001); the increasing trend in NASH was steeper than that for any other etiology ( p < 0.0001 in a trend regression model). The proportion of LT candidates with HCC who were ultimately transplanted or died while waiting did not differ between etiologies ( p > 0.05). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is the most rapidly growing cause of HCC among U.S. patients listed for liver transplantation.
