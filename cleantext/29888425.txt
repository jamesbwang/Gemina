  According to the somatic marker hypothesis , autonomic measures and arousal modulation can reveal a difference in subgroups of patients developing impaired decision-making because of addictions. Previously , Pathological Gambling ( PG) and Parkinson 's Disease ( PD) have been associated with differential arousal levels during gambling behavior. However , no research considered the specific autonomic responses of Parkinson 's Disease patients with pathological gambling and with a previous history of gambling. Thus , this study investigated Skin Conductance Responses ( SCRs) , Skin Conductance Level ( SCL) and Heart Rate ( HR) during the Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT) in two groups of PD patients with gambling disorder , active ( PD Gamblers; n = 14) or remitted ( PD Non-Gamblers; n = 13) and a control group of patients with Parkinson 's Disease only ( n = 13). Anticipatory autonomic responses to Disadvantageous Decks and Advantageous Decks during the Iowa Gambling Task were measured for each participant. The PD Gamblers group performed worse than the PD Non-Gamblers and the control groups at the IGT task and exhibited lower SCRs , SCL and HR during the decision-making processing of cards belonging to disadvantageous decks.
