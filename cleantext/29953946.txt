  Factor H binding protein ( fHbp) is the most promising vaccine candidate against serogroup<pathogen> B of Neisseria<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In order to facilitate large scale production of a commercial vaccine , we previously used transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana , but plant-derived fHbp is still far away from a commercial vaccine due to less biomass production. Herein , we presented an alternative route for the production of recombinant fHbp from the seeds of transgenic rice. The OsrfHbp gene encoding recombinant fHbp fused protein was introduced into the genome of rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The both stable integration and transcription of the foreign OsrfHbp were confirmed by Southern blotting and RT-PCR analysis respectively. Further , the expression of fHbp protein was measured by immunoblotting analysis and quantified by ELISA. The results indicated that fHbp was successfully expressed and the highest yield of fHbp was 0.52 Â± 0.03 % of TSP in the transgenic rice seeds. The purified fHbp protein showed good antigenicity and immunogenicity in the animal model. The results of this experiment offer a novel approach for large-scale production of plant-derived commercial vaccine fHbp.
