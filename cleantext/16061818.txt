  Many Gram-negative bacteria have evolved insect pathogenic lifestyles. In all cases , the ability to cause disease in insects involves specific bacterial proteins exported either to the surface , the extracellular environment , or the cytoplasm of the host cell. They also have several distinct mechanisms for secreting such proteins. In this review , we summarize the major protein secretion systems and discuss examples of secreted proteins that contribute to the virulence of a variety of Gram-negative entomopathogenic bacteria , including
