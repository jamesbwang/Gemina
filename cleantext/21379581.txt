  Little is known about associations between dietary inflammation<symptom> , age and anthropometric measurements. In this regard , we examine how DII is related to age , anthropometrics ( weight , Body mass index ( BMI) , waist to hip ratio ( WHR)) and other parameters of nutrition ( energy , protein , fats and cholesterol intake , Net Endogenous Acid Production ( NEAP) and Phytochemical Index ( PI)) in a cross-sectional study in Pakistan. Only men ( The results show that with increasing age , there was a significant increase in the DII score ( In conclusion , the present study shows direct positive correlations between the DII , age and indices of obesity , and thus supports the hypothesis that diet may have a role in the development of obesity through inflammatory modulation mechanisms in elderly.
