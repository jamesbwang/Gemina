  Intracellular protein delivery is of significance for cellular protein analysis and therapeutic development , but remains challenging technically. Herein , we report a general and highly potent strategy for intracellular protein delivery based on commercially available cationic lipids. In this strategy , a designed double branching poly-glutamate tag is site-specifically attached onto the C-terminal of protein cargos via expressed protein ligation ( EPL) , which mediates the entrapment of proteins into cationic liposomes driven by electrostatic interaction. The resultant protein-lipid complexes can enter into cytosol with a high efficiency even at the low protein concentration while maintaining protein 's biological activity.
