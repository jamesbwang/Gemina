  Hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) is a chronic debilitating cutaneous disorder. The recalcitrant nature of this disease may require surgery in severe cases. We aimed to delineate the types of operations performed , the risk factors associated with these operations , and the surgical services involved based on a national database. Data were collected through the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2016. Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT) and International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision , ( ICD-9) codes were used for data extraction and analysis as type of surgery and complication rates were extracted. There were 2594 patients diagnosed with HS: 1405 ( 54.2 %) incision and drainage , 1017 ( 39.2 %) debridement , 31 ( 1.2 %) skin graft , and 141 ( 5.4 %) flap reconstruction. There were significant differences in transfusion rates and operation time among the four procedures. Skin graft and flap reconstruction had the highest complications and longest operation time. Bleeding requiring preoperative transfusion and a number of comorbidities were significant risk factors for postoperative complications. Flap reconstructions by plastic surgeons compared to general surgeons had significantly shorter operation times ( 134.89 versus 209.82 min , P = 0.022) and lower transfusion rates ( 2.2 % versus 12.8 % , P = 0.024). The management of HS can be complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach. Bleeding requiring preoperative transfusion and other baseline comorbidities are independent risk factors that should be addressed when definitive surgical treatment of hidradenitis is planned. Appropriate surgical specialty involvement may better optimize the surgical outcomes for HS.
