  The Dimensional Metrology Group ( DMG) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST) is performing research to support the development of documentary standards within ASTM E57 committee. This committee is addressing the point-to-point performance evaluation of a subclass of 3D imaging systems called Terrestrial Laser Scanners ( TLSs) which are laser-based and use spherical coordinate system. This paper discusses the usage of sphere targets for this effort and methods to minimize the errors due to the determination of their centers. The key contributions of this paper include the methods to segment sphere data from TLS point cloud and the study of some of the factors that influence the determination of sphere centers.
