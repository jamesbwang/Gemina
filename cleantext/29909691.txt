  In order to characterize the pharmacokinetics , tissue distribution , bioavailability , and excretion of nuciferine , a reliable gradient LC/MS/MS-based method was developed and validated. Sprague-Dawley rats were intravenously injected with a bolus of nuciferine ( 0.2 mg/kg) and orally given a single dose of nuciferine ( 10.0 mg/kg). Blood samples were withdrawn via the ocular vein at specific times. Organs , including the liver , kidney , brain , lung , heart , and spleen , were collected at specific times after oral administration of 10.0 mg/kg nuciferine. The plasma and tissue samples were assayed by LC/MS/MS. The results indicated that nuciferine had rapid distribution and poor absorption into systemic circulation. The value of absolute bioavailability was only 1.9 Â± 0.8 % after administration of 10.0 mg/kg nuciferine by oral and administration of 0.2 mg/kg nuciferine intravenously ( IV) to rats. The AUC This study may provide a meaningful basis for clinical application of such a bioactive compound of herbal medicines.
