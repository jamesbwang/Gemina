  We studied the effect of myosin inhibitors , N-benzyl-p-toluenesulfonamide ( BTS) , blebbistatin , and butanedione monoxime ( BDM) on X-ray diffraction patterns from rabbit psoas fibers under relaxing and contracting conditions. The first two inhibitors suppressed the contractile force almost completely at a 100 Î¼M concentration , and a similar effect was obtained at 50 mM for BDM. However , still substantial changes were observed in the diffraction patterns upon calcium-activation of inhibited muscle fibers. ( 1) The 2nd actin layer-line reflection was enhanced normally , indicating that calcium binding to troponin and the subsequent movement of tropomyosin are not inhibited , ( 2) the myosin layer-line reflections became much weaker , and ( 3) the 1,1/ 1,0 intensity ratio of the equatorial reflections was increased. The observations ( 2) and ( 3) indicate that , even in the presence of the inhibitors at a saturating concentration , myosin heads leave the helix on the thick filaments and approach the thin filaments. Interestingly , the
