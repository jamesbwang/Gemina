  To analyze the status and variation trend of eggs food intake among Chinese residents. Multi-stage cluster randomization sampling method was used to collect data about eggs food intake among residents in 150 surveillance sites of China National Nutrition and Health Survey in 31 provinces of China from 2010 to 2012. Food frequency questionnaire and 24-hours recall for three consecutive days were used to collect information on eggs food consumption of the participants. The eggs food intake per standard people were calculated based on the China Food Composition. The proportion of residents reporting the frequency of 1 or more times per day for eggs food were 31. 3 % in the children and 25. 8 % in the adult and the estimated daily eggs food was24. 3 grams for all the residents. The estimated daily eggs food for the residents of urban ( 29. 5 g) was higher than that of rural ( 19. 4 g) ( T = 47. 86 , P < 0. 0001). The eggs food consumption frequency and intake showed a decreasing trend for the residents with different residential regions in an order of big cities , small and medium-sized cities , common rural area , and poverty rural area. In past 30 years , the eggs food intake was increased substantial in the residents from 1982 to 2002. Althought the total the eggs food intake was increased gradually for all residents from 2002 to 2010-2012 , the eggs food intake was decreased slightly for both the residents in urban and rural areas during the period. The consumption frequency and intake of eggs food among Chinese residents are still at a low level and exist regional differences. Some measures should be taken to guide reasonable eggs food consumption behavior among Chinese residents.
