  Breastfeeding constitutes a priority in Public Health due to the multiple benefits it offers. The decision to breastfeed is usually made before pregnancy , and therefore it is important to include adolescents in breastfeeding promotion programs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme to improve knowledge and attitudes toward breastfeeding among teenager. Pretest-posttest randomized controlled study , carried out in 2008 in Tenerife. 970 teenagers participated ( 14,6 ± 0.9 years) , 506 experimental group ( EG) and 524 control group ( CG). Before the intervention and 4 weeks after , students completed a questionnaire to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding. The performed intervention consisted of: a talk , video projection , informative leaflets , narrative short stories and role-play activities. Chi-square test , student 's t-test , Cronbach 's alpha coefficient , repeated measures variance analysis and covariance analysis were used. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding knowledge ( EG: 3.9 ± 1.5 , CG: 3.8 ± 1.5) or attitudes towards breastfeeding , before the intervention. The same applies when compared by gender , school year , parents ' occupation and type of school. The post-intervention questionnaire showed a significant increase in the level of knowledge of students from EG ( EG: 6.9 ± 1.5 , CG: 4.4 ± 1.8; p < 0.001) as well as a higher percentage of positive attitudes towards breastfeeding ( GE: 71.13 ± 28.5 , GC: 54.27 ± 28.9 , p < 0,001). Covariance analysis showed a significant effect ( p < 0,05) on attitudes towards breastfeeding of the variables gender and previous contact with breastfeeding. The educational program carried out is effective as a method to improve knowledge and attitudes toward breastfeeding among teenagers.
