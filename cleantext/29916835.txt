  Despite many advances in the management of critically ill patients , cardiogenic shock<symptom> remains a challenge because it is associated with high mortality. Even if there is no universally accepted definition of cardiogenic shock<symptom> , end-perfusion organ dysfunction is an obligatory and major criterion of its definition.Organ dysfunction is an indicator that cardiogenic shock<symptom> is already at an advanced stage and is undergoing a rapid self-aggravating evolution. The aim of the review is to highlight the importance to diagnose and to manage the organ dysfunction occurring in the cardiogenic shock<symptom> patients by providing the best literature published this year. The first step is to diagnose the organ dysfunction and to assess their severity. Echo has an important and increasing place regarding the assessment of end-organ impairment whereas no new biomarker popped up. In this review , we aimed to highlight for intensivists and cardiologists managing cardiogenic shock<symptom> , the recent advances in the care of end-organ dysfunctions associated with cardiogenic shock<symptom>. The management of organ dysfunction is based on the improvement of the cardiac function by etiologic therapy , inotropes and assist devices but will often necessitate organ supports in hospitals with the right level of equipment and multidisciplinary expertise.
