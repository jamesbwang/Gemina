  To evaluate changes in urethral mobility and configuration after prolapse repair. This is a retrospective study on 92 patients before and after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse ( POP) without incontinence surgery between 2005 and 2016. All were assessed with an interview , POP-Q and translabial 4D ultrasound. Urethral mobility was evaluated using the urethral motion profile ( UMP) where x and y coordinates of 6 equidistant points along the length of urethra were determined both at rest and on Valsalva , relative to the posteroinferior margin of the pubis. Urethral kinking was measured by placing tangents distal and proximal to any visually identified change in urethral axis. Imaging data obtained before and after prolapse surgery were compared using paired-t test and Wilcoxon Rank Test. Mean age was 58 years , mean follow-up 5.8 months. Prolapse symptoms had resolved in 85 % of patients. A highly significant reduction in urethral mobility and urethral kinking was seen after surgery ( all p < = 0.001). Similar changes were observed after anterior +/- apical repair without concomitant posterior repair ( n = 23 , all p < 0.05). POP surgery was significantly associated with ` straightening ' of the urethra and reduction in urethral mobility. The effect seems to be largely due to cystocele repair.
