  Current strategies aimed to cure HIV<pathogen> infection are based on combined efforts to reactivate the virus from latency and improve immune effector cell function to clear infected cells. These strategies are primarily focused on CD8 + T cells and approaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV<pathogen> antigen production from infected cells and poor HIV-specific CD8 + T cells. γδ T cells represent a unique subset of effector T cells that can traffic to tissues , and selectively target cancer or virally infected cells without requiring MHC presentation. We analyzed whether γδ T cells represent a complementary/alternative immunotherapeutic approach towards HIV<pathogen> cure strategies. γδ T cells from HIV-infected virologically suppressed donors were expanded with bisphosphonate pamidronate ( PAM) and cells were used in autologous cellular systems ex vivo. These cells ( a) are potent cytotoxic effectors able to efficiently inhibit HIV<pathogen> replication ex vivo , ( b) degranulate in the presence of autologous infected CD4 + T cells , and ( c) specifically clear latently infected cells after latency reversal with vorinostat. This is the first proof of concept to our knowledge showing that γδ T cells target and clear autologous HIV<pathogen> reservoirs upon latency reversal. Our results open potentially new insights into the immunotherapeutic use of γδ T cells for current interventions in HIV<pathogen> eradication strategies.
