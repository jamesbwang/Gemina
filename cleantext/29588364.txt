  Microbes respond to antibiotics by initiating a suite of defense mechanisms , including the production of small-molecule effectors. However , it is not well-known how these defenses vary according to the particular effector or antibiotic and bacterial state , due in part to the challenges of monitoring small molecules in complex environments. A new study uses state-of-the-art imaging techniques to track the location of secreted small molecules produced by a bacterial swarm in response to different antibiotics , providing unexpected insights into the spatial heterogeneity of bacterial stress responses.
