  Analyzing the situation and risk factors associated with using new psychoactive substances ( NPS) is essential for preventing and controlling health consequences. This study explored the prevalence and associated factors of NPS use in the Thai population. This descriptive study was conducted in participants ( N = 30,411 , mean age = 42.4 Â± 13.4 years , range = 15-64 years , 50.3 % women) from urban and rural areas of Thailand. The participants were chosen using multistage sampling for large populations. The data were collected in July-December 2016 and analyzed using frequency , percentage , mean , standard deviation , chi-square , multiple logistic regression , and odds ratio with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). The prevalence of lifetime NPS use was 49.7 % ( 95 % CI , 49.1-51.3) , past-year use was 31.3 % ( 95 % CI , 30.8-31.8) , and current ( past-month) use was 14.9 % ( 95 % CI , 14.5-15.3). Among current users , 29.5 % were habitual users ( over 20 days). The factors associated with current NPS use were sex ( male/female) ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 1.145; 95 % CI , 1.075-1.221; p < 0.001) , age group ( 25-64/15- 24 years) ( AOR = 1.126; 95 % CI , 1.090-1.358; p < 0.001) , educational attainment ( elementary or secondary education and higher) ( AOR = 1.634; 95 % CI , 1.529-1.747; p < 0.001) , and employment status ( AOR = 1.842; 95 % CI , 1.683-2.016; p < 0.001). The prevalence of NPS use in Thailand is high , which reflects abuse behavior that could potentially harm users. Understanding the prevalence and risk factors of NPS use could benefit policymakers.
