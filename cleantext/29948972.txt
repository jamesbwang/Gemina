  Detecting different molecular markers in primary tumors and metastases may provide therapeutic information. Here we investigated differences between primary tumors and four metastatic sites of lung adenocarcinoma in the biomarkers ' features and discussed potential therapeutic implications. A total of 228 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed for EGFR , KRAS , BRAF and PIK3CA mutations detected by xTAG liquidchip technology ( xTAG-LCT) , as well as ERCC1 , TYMS , RRM1 , TUBB3 , STMN1 , TOP2A and VEGFR1-3 mRNA expression detected by branched DNA-liquidchip technology ( bDNA-LCT). Higher rates of low ERCC1 ( 35.6 vs. 20.3 % , P = 0.0105) , RRM1 ( 23.3 vs. 13.0 % , P = 0.0437) , STMN1 ( 72.2 vs. 42.8 % , P = 0.0000) and high VEGFR2 ( 34.4 vs. 18.8 % , P = 0.0078) mRNA expression were found in EGFR-mutated tumors , suggesting possible benefit from platinum , gemcitabine , taxanes or VEGFR2 inhibitors. Primary lesions<symptom> showed low ERCC1 ( 31.6 vs. 18.5 % , P = 0.0271) , TYMS ( 17.6 vs. 7.6 % , P = 0.0300) , TUBB3 ( 16.9 vs. 7.6 % , P = 0.0415) , STMN1 ( 62.1 vs. 42.9 % , P = 0.0065) and high TOP2A ( 48.7 vs. 33.1 % , P = 0.0262) mRNA expression and higher KRAS mutations ( 25.7 vs. 14.1 % , P = 0.0350) , suggesting platinum , taxanes , pemetrexed , anti-TOP2A agents and resistant to anti-EGFR therapies. Liver metastases showed absence of low TYMS expression , indicating insensitivity to pemetrexed-based regimen. Pleura metastases harbored higher rates of high VEGFR2 expression ( 50.0 vs. 19.1 % , P = 0.0127). Lymph node metastases presented higher rates of high VEGFR2 expression ( 37.5 vs. 19.1 % , P = 0.0253) and EGFR mutations ( 59.4 vs. 34.4 % , P = 0.0011) , suggesting use of anti-VEGFR2 and anti-EGFR therapies. Molecular profiling of 228 lung adenocarcinomas determined a significant difference between biomarkers such as EGFR and KRAS subtypes at primary and metastatic sites. Our results serve as a reference for individual treatment based on different potential targets in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma directed by molecular profiling.
