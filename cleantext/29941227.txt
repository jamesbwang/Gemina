  The 8th edition of AJCC gastric cancer pathological staging system ( AJCC8) derived from the IGCA database needs an external validated in cohorts with higher proportion of advanced disease. A total of 5386 gastric cancer patients treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ( CGMH) and Veteran General Hospital in Taipei ( TVGH) were enrolled. Clinicopathological data of the IGCA series and the CGMH/TVGH cohort were compared. Cumulative survival curves of the CGMH/TVGH cohort as stratified by the AJCC7 and the AJCC8 were compared. Lymph node ratio ( LNR) was analyzed in patients with N3b disease. Patients in the CGMH/TVGH cohort were older and had more advanced tumor stage ( stage III , 49 % versus 26 % , p < 0.001) than those in the IGCA cohort. The median survival of stages IIIA , IIIB , and IIIC as defined by the AJCC 8 were 49 , 27 and 15 months , respectively , with narrower 95 % confidence intervals , in comparison with 62 , 30 and 18 months , respectively , as defined by the AJCC7. The AJCC8 exhibited better homogeneity within stages and discriminatory ability between stages , compared to the AJCC7. Six hundred and four patients with N3b disease were stratified by LNR into three subgroups , and their median survival were 31 , 17 , and 11 months , respectively ( p < 0.001). LNR further appeared as a powerful outcome predictor of N3b disease ( HR , 3.1). The AJCC8 performs well in patients with high proportion of advanced gastric cancer. We recommend that LNR is a supplementary prognostic indicator for N3b disease.
