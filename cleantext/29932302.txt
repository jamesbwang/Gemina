  There has been a paradigm shift from steroids to propranolol for the pharmacologic treatment of infantile hemangiomas ( IH); however , the outcomes for ulcerated IH are not well studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of steroids and propranolol specifically for ulcerated IH. A retrospective review was conducted on patients with ulcerated IH treated with propranolol or steroids at a single tertiary care institution between 2007 and 2014. Patient characteristics , hemangioma features , and outcomes , including time to heal and medication complications , were compared between propranolol and steroid patients. There were 29 patients treated with propranolol and 23 with steroids. There were no significant differences in the two treatment groups including age , race , sex , size , or insurance status. There were more head/neck IH in the steroid group. There was no significant difference in the percentage of healed lesions<symptom> ( 93 vs. 74 % , P = 0.12) or the median time to heal ( 80 vs. 126 days , p = 0.21) between groups. Overall complication rates also did not vary between medications ( 24 vs. 44 % , P = 0.14). Propranolol is noninferior to steroids for the treatment of ulcerated IH; however , healing time is lengthy regardless of treatment. While side effect profiles differed between medications , the overall complication rate was similar.
