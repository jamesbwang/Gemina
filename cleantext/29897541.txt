  The authors devised a comparative prospective study to determine the in vitro microbicidal efficacy of skin preparation solutions in the concentrations and temperatures used in the burns theatre against common bacterial and fungal microorganisms. A panel of 10 microorganisms Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , streptococcus<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> , enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> , escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> were assembled comprising 8 common strains of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( including methicillin resistant staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA)) , S.<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> , E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , B.<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> , and multi-drug resistant Klebsiella<pathogen> and Acinetobacter<pathogen>. These were cultured in the following formulations: 1) povidone iodine ( PVP-iodine) 10 % stored at room temperature ( 250C) , 2) PVP-iodine stored at 40 to 420C , 3) chlorhexidine digluconate stored at room temperature diluted with warmed saline to concentrations of 4 % , 2 % , 1 % , 0.8 % , and 0.5 %. All 3 formulations met DIN EN ( Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung) ( European Standards) requirements for antiseptics. Both antiseptics showed the same high bactericidal and fungicidal efficacy ( P = < 0.05). For chlorhexidine , all minimum inhibitory concentrations at both 24 and 48 hours were very low ( < 0.5 mg/L) , but for PVP-iodine the minimum inhibitory concentrations were much higher and ranged from 64 to 512 mg/L. All concentrations of chlorhexidine tested were superior to PVP-iodine with no bacterial growth. There was a small amount of growth in some of the PVP-iodine treated groups , but this was not clinically significant.
