  Peritoneal metastasis ( PM) is the most frequent form of metastasis in gastric cancer ( GC). The sensitivity of detecting PM by pre-operative imaging modalities is low. Utility of positron emission tomography ( PET) with The key eligibility criteria were as follows; ( i) histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma; ( ii) evident PM detected by CT performed within 4 weeks prior to registration; ( iii) no prior treatment of PM within 4 weeks before registration. ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT was performed at National Cancer Center Hospital , and ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Safety assessments were carried out before and after ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT. The primary end point was the detection sensitivity of PM. A total of 19 eligible patients were analyzed , of which 15 ( 78.9 %) had diffuse-type histology. Detection sensitivity of PM , primary lesion<symptom> , and lymph node metastasis were 73.7 % ( maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax): 1.697-13.21) , 100 % ( SUVmax: 2.71-22.01) , and 72.7 % ( SUVmax: 2.079-12.61) , respectively. No patients experienced adverse events during or after ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT. This proof-of-concept study shows that ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT is a sensitive method for detecting PM in GC , and paves the way for future studies investigating the clinical utility of this approach for the detection of clinically non-evident PM in GC. Advances in knowledge: This proof-of-concept study found that ( F-18) FLT-PET/CT is a sensitive method for detecting peritoneal metastases in GC.
