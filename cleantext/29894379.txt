  The objective was to determine self-adjusted output response and speech intelligibility index ( SII) in individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss and to measure the effects of prior hearing aid experience. Thirteen hearing aid users and 13 nonusers , with similar group-mean pure-tone thresholds , listened to prerecorded and preprocessed sentences spoken by a man. Starting with a generic level and spectrum , participants adjusted ( 1) overall level , ( 2) high-frequency boost , and ( 3) low-frequency cut. Participants took a speech perception test after an initial adjustment before making a final adjustment. The three self-selected parameters , along with individual thresholds and real-ear-to-coupler differences , were used to compute output levels and SIIs for the starting and two self-adjusted conditions. The values were compared with an NAL second nonlinear threshold-based prescription ( NAL-NL2) and , for the hearing aid users , performance of their existing hearing aids. All participants were able to complete the self-adjustment process. The generic starting condition provided outputs ( between 2 and 8 kHz) and SIIs that were significantly below those prescribed by NAL-NL2. Both groups increased SII to values that were not significantly different from prescription. The hearing aid users , but not the nonusers , increased high-frequency output and SII significantly after taking the speech perception test. Seventeen of the 26 participants ( 65 %) met an SII criterion of 60 % under the generic starting condition. The proportion increased to 23 out of 26 ( 88 %) after the final self-adjustment. Of the 13 hearing aid users , 8 ( 62 %) met the 60 % criterion with their existing hearing aids. With the final self-adjustment , 12 out of 13 ( 92 %) met this criterion. The findings support the conclusion that user self-adjustment of basic amplification characteristics can be both feasible and effective with or without prior hearing aid experience.
