  There are as many as 18 theories for the possible functions of the stripes of zebras , one of which is to cool the animal. We performed field experiments and thermographic measurements to investigate whether thermoregulation might work for zebra-striped bodies. A zebra body was modelled by water-filled metal barrels covered with horse , cattle and zebra hides and with various black , white , grey and striped patterns. The barrels were installed in the open air for four months while their core temperature was measured continuously. Using thermography , the temperature distributions of the barrel surfaces were compared to those of living zebras. The sunlit zebra-striped barrels reproduced well the surface temperature characteristics of sunlit zebras. We found that there were no significant core temperature differences between the striped and grey barrels , even on many hot days , independent of the air temperature and wind speed. The average core temperature of the barrels increased as follows: white cattle , grey cattle , real zebra , artificial zebra , grey horse , black cattle. Consequently , we demonstrate that zebra-striped coats do not keep the body cooler than grey coats challenging the hypothesis of a thermoregulatory role of zebra stripes.
