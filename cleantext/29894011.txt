  The design and construction of polymeric compartmentalized structures in water have been intensively explored for controllable catalysis , but there is still the challenge of setting up catalytic compartments in organic media. Here , we designed a simple block copolymer , PCL-b-PEG-b-PCL , to construct a stable and multi-compartmentalized emulsion in an organic solvent by hand-shaking. This gentle emulsion preparation allowed a successful encapsulation of vulnerable biocatalysts such as benzaldehyde lyase ( BAL) and alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH). The compartmentalization provided the emulsion with an exceptionally large interfacial area that could enhance BAL activity up to 225 times as compared to the traditional biphasic system. Moreover , the system could be easily scaled up due to its facile preparation with low cost. Therefore , our results pave the way for developing compartmentalized structures in solvents for biocatalysis in large-scale synthetic chemistry.
