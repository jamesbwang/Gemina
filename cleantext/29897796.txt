  Infections due to multidrug-resistant ( MDR) bacteria are burdened by high mortality rates. The development of new compounds to face the global threat of resistance is urgently needed. Combination regimens including `` old '' high-dose antimicrobials are currently limited by the risk of toxicity , resistance selection , and reduced efficacy. Following the Infectious Diseases Society of America call to develop 10 new antibacterials by 2020 , new molecules are currently under development or have become available for use in clinical practice. Areas covered: We have reviewed safety characteristics and tolerability of old antimicrobials that are currently employed in combination regimens as well as new antimicrobials , including beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors , new cephalosporins , quinolones , and aminoglycosides. Expert opinion: The availability of new compounds that show in vitro efficacy against MDR represents a unique opportunity to face the threat of resistance and to optimize the current use of antimicrobials , potentially reducing toxicity. Agents that are potentially active against MDR Gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam , new carbapenems and cephalosporins , the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime , and plazomicin. Further data from clinical trials and post-marketing studies for drugs targeting MDR pathogens are crucial to confirm their efficacy and safety.
