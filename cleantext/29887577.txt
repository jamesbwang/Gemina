  Accurate risk stratification of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI) patients is important due to great variability in mortality risk , but , to date , no prediction model has been available. The aim of this study was therefore to establish a risk score to predict in-hospital mortality risk in NSTEMI patients.Methods and Results: We enrolled 5,775 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI from the China Acute Myocardial Infarction ( CAMI) registry and extracted relevant data. Patients were divided into a derivation cohort ( n = 4,332) to develop a multivariable logistic regression risk prediction model , and a validation cohort ( n = 1,443) to test the model. Eleven variables independently predicted in-hospital mortality and were included in the model: age , body mass index , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , Killip classification , cardiac arrest , electrocardiogram ST-segment depression<symptom> , serum creatinine , white blood cells , smoking status , previous angina , and previous percutaneous coronary intervention. In the derivation cohort , the area under curve ( AUC) for the CAMI-NSTEMI risk model and score was 0.81 and 0.79 , respectively. In the validation cohort , the score also showed good discrimination ( AUC , 0.86). Diagnostic performance of CAMI-NSTEMI risk score was superior to that of the GRACE risk score ( AUC , 0.81 vs. 0.72; P < 0.01). The CAMI-NSTEMI score is able to accurately predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in NSTEMI patients.
