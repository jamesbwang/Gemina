  Agriculture is the largest global consumer of freshwater. As the volume of international trade continues to rise , so does the understanding that trade of water-intensive crops from areas with high precipitation , to arid regions can help mitigate water scarcity , highlighting the importance of crop water accounting. Virtual-Water , or Water-Footprint ( WF) of agricultural crops , is a powerful indicator for assessing the extent of water use by plants , contamination of water bodies by agricultural practices and trade between countries , which underlies any international trade of crops. Most available studies of virtual-water flows by import/export of agricultural commodities were based on global databases , which are considered to be of limited accuracy. The present study analyzes the WF of crop production , import , and export on a country level , using Israel as a case study , comparing data from two high-resolution local databases and two global datasets. Results for local datasets demonstrate a WF of ~ 1200Million Cubic Meters ( MCM)/ year) for total crop production , ~ 1000MCM/year for import and ~ 250MCM/year for export. Fruits and vegetables comprise ~ 80 % of Export WF ( ~ 200MCM/year) , ~ 50 % of crop production and only ~ 20 % of the imports. Economic Water Productivity ( EWP) ( $/ m
