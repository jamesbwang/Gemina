  Throughout life , actions and language are inherent to social interactions. A long-standing research question in cognitive neuroscience concerns the interrelation between verbal and non-verbal forms of social interactions , that is , language and action. Perceiving how actions are performed and why they are performed in a certain way is crucial for the observer to anticipate the actor 's goal and to prepare an appropriate response. It is suggested that predicting upcoming events in a given action sequence can be compared to the way we process the language information flow. Goal-directed actions can be sequenced in small units , which are organized according to a hierarchical plan , resembling the hierarchical organization of language. Research on adults suggests that manipulating the action structure ( i.e. , action syntax) leads to analogous cortical signatures as a similar manipulation of a sentence structure ( i.e. , language syntax). Whereas in adults language and action knowledge are based on life-time experience , in infants both domains are still developing. The current study examined the neural processing of structural violations of observed goal-directed action sequences in infants at 6-7 months , using event-related potentials ( ERPs). Results showed that a structural violation of the action sequence elicited bilateral frontal positivity effects. This suggests that infants capture structural regularities , and it adds a crucial element to the understanding of general syntactic regularities and their violation from an ontogenetic perspective.
