  The purpose of this study was to measure the prevalence of intimate partner and family violence amongst a population of Australian female nurses , doctors and allied health professionals. We conducted a descriptive , cross-sectional survey in a large Australian tertiary maternity hospital with 471 participating female health professionals ( 45.0 % response rate). The primary outcome measures were 12 month and lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence ( Composite Abuse Scale) and family violence. In the last 12 months , one in ten ( 43 , 11.5 %) participants reported intimate partner violence: 4.2 % ( 16) combined physical , emotional and/or sexual abuse; 6.7 % ( 25) emotional abuse and/or harassment; 5.1 % ( 22) were afraid of their partner; and 1.7 % ( 7) had been raped by their partner. Since the age of sixteen , one third ( 125 , 29.7 %) of participants reported intimate partner violence: 18.3 % ( 77) had experienced combined physical , emotional and/or sexual abuse; 8.1 % ( 34) emotional abuse and/or harassment; 25.6 % ( 111) had been afraid of their partner; and 12.1 % ( 51) had been raped by their partner. Overall , 45.2 % ( 212) of participants reported violence by a partner and/or family member during their lifetime , with 12.8 % ( 60) reporting both. Intimate partner and family violence may be common traumas in the lives of female health professionals , and this should be considered in health workplace policies and protocols , as health professionals are increasingly urged to work with patients who have experienced intimate partner and family violence. Implications include the need for workplace manager training , special leave provision , counselling services and other resources for staff.
