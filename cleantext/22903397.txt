  ALS patients exhibit dyslipidemia , hypermetabolism and weight<symptom> loss<symptom>; in addition , cellular energetics deficits have been detected prior to denervation. Although evidence that metabolism is altered in ALS is compelling , the mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and the contribution of altered metabolic pathways to disease remain poorly understood. Here we use a
