  The study was designed to investigate the effect of heart rate and pacing mode on QRS fragmentation ( f-QRS). Moreover , the usefulness of f-QRS in distinguishing patients with impaired left ventricular ejection function ( EF) and ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) from patients with normal EF was assessed. Three hundred and six recipients , with dual-chamber device , with intrinsic narrow or wide QRS complex and preserved atrioventricular conduction were grouped into normal-EF or impaired-EF VT.. We analyzed intrinsic narrow f-QRS and wide f-QRS as well as ventricular-paced f-QRS following different heart rates ( baseline , 100 bpm) and pacing modes. In the baseline state , overall , patients with impaired-EF VT ( 35 Â± 9 %) , compared to those with normal-EF , had more f-QRS ( 56 % vs 27 % , Increased heart rate or/and ventricular pacing uncover QRS fragmentations. Detection of ventricular-paced f-QRS adds value toward noninvasive identification of patients with impaired-EF VT..
