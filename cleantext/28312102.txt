  Spatial patterns of trait variation across a species ' range have implications for population success and evolutionary change potential , particularly in range-expanding and weedy species that encounter distinct selective pressures at large and small spatial scales simultaneously. We investigated intraspecific trait variation in a common garden experiment with giant ragweed (
