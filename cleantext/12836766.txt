  A single-pixel compressively sensed architecture is exploited to simultaneously achieve a 10 Ã— reduction in acquired data compared with the Nyquist rate , while alleviating limitations faced by conventional widefield temporal focusing microscopes due to scattering of the fluorescence signal. Additionally , we demonstrate an adaptive sampling scheme that further improves the compression and speed of our approach.
