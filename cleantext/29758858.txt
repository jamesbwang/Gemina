  In many urban catchments , the discharge of effluents from wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) , as well as untreated wastewaters ( UWWs) , presents a major challenge for the maintenance of river sediment and water quality. The discharge of these effluents can not only increase the concentration of metals , nutrients and organic compounds in fluvial ecosystems , but also alter the abundance , structure and function of river bacterial communities. Here , we present data on chemical and biological quality parameters in wastewater-impacted and non-impacted river surface sediment and water samples. Overall , the concentration of nutrients ( inorganic nitrogen) and some heavy metals ( Zn , Ni and Cr) was positively correlated with the
