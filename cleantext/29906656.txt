  The phenolic phytochemicals of winter-dormant Salix pyrolifolia were determined from the vegetative buds , and the bark and wood of different-aged twigs by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-QTOF-MS analyses. All the plant parts were composed of salicylate glucosides and the other Salix-specific , simple phenolic glucosides as well as of phenolic acids , flavonoids and the high molecular-weight condensed tannins. The flavonoid composition was most diverse in buds and they also contained a large amount of chlorogenic acid ( 5-caffeoylquinic acid IUPAC) , while salicylate glucosides and simple phenolic glucosides predominated in bark. The wooden interior part of the twigs contained fewer components and the lowest concentrations of compounds. Salicortin was the main compound in winter-dormant S. pyrolifolia ( over 10 % of bark biomass) , but the concentrations of picein , salireposide , isosalipurposide , catechin and condensed tannins were also high. The flavonoid composition was highly naringenin- and quercetin-biassed. The composition of phytochemicals was organ-specific and remained relatively similar between different-aged trees. However , there were compound-specific fluctuations in the concentrations of phytochemicals with the age of the trees and within plant parts. Generally , the one-year-old plants differed from the older trees in their high concentration of condensed tannins in all the plant parts studied and in the highest concentration of isosalipurposide in bark , while the total amounts of salicylate glucosides in plant parts , and of naringenin glucosides in buds , tended to be highest in 20 year-old-trees.
