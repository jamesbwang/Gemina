  1-Deoxynojirimycin ( DNJ) is the main bioactive compound of Morus alba L.. DNJ has pharmacological effects , including blood sugar level regulation and antiviral activity. In this study , the mulberry lysine decarboxylase gene ( MaLDC) , which is involved in the biosynthesis of DNJ alkaloids , was cloned , expressed , and functionally verified. MaLDC was induced and expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21 ( DE3). The recombinant soluble MaLDC protein had a relative molecular mass of 24.0 kDa. The protein was purified by Ni-NTA separation. The results showed that MaLDC protein could catalyze lysine decarboxylation to produce cadaverine. The K
