  Systematic assessment and documentation of extensive livestock production systems are necessary to design or review breeding programs , extension services , and policies. This study therefore examined management practices and challenges concerning village chicken production in the Upper River Region of the Gambia. The data gathered with 45-variable semi-structured questionnaires were analyzed based on the household head 's education status and gender. Illiteracy level was high , and only 38 % indicated that they attended certain schools. There was a significant relationship ( p < 0.05) and phi coefficient of 0.35 between household heads ' education status and record keeping. None of the examined management practices had a statistically significant relationship ( p > 0.05) with household heads ' gender. Children ( 10-14 years) were mostly responsible for providing care to the chickens. Foundation and replacement stocks were mainly acquired through purchase ( 78 %). Many households ( 74 %) indicated supplementary feeding of their flocks but only 34 % provided separate houses apart from the household dwellings. Newcastle ( 68 %) was the most common disease. Sick birds were recognized by restlessness ( 34 %) and diarrhea<disease> ( 28 %). External parasites were mainly controlled through local practices ( 52 %) while the most common way to dispose dead birds was to throw them away ( 88 %). Up to 90 % indicated no formal training on disease management and access to extension agents was also low ( 20 %). Control of chicken movement was occasionally done to protect birds from predators ( 60 %) and then , to avoid contagious diseases ( 38 %). Individual farmers and their associations need to be supported by stakeholders to access relevant information and uptake improved management techniques.
