  Diagnosing thyroid eye disease-compressive optic neuropathy ( TED-CON) is challenging , particularly in cases lacking a relative afferent pupillary defect. Large case series of TED-CON patients and accessible diagnostic tools are lacking in the current literature. This study aims to create a mathematical formula that accurately predicts the presence or absence of CON based on the most salient clinical measures of optic neuropathy. A retrospective case series compares 108 patients ( 216 orbits) with either unilateral or bilateral TED-CON and 41 age-matched patients ( 82 orbits) with noncompressive TED. Utilizing clinical variables assessing optic nerve function and/or risk of compressive disease , and with the aid of generalized linear regression modeling , the authors create a mathematical formula that weighs the relative contribution of each clinical variable in the overall prediction of CON. Data from 213 orbits in 110 patients derived the formula: y = -0.69 + 2.58 × ( afferent pupillary defect)- 0.31 × ( summed limitation of ductions)- 0.2 × ( mean deviation on Humphrey visual field testing)- 0.02 × ( % color plates). This accurately predicted the presence of CON ( y > 0) versus non-CON ( y < 0) in 82 % of cases with 83 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity. When there was no relative afferent pupillary defect , which was the case in 63 % of CON orbits , the formula correctly predicted CON in 78 % of orbits with 73 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity. The authors developed a mathematical formula , the Columbia TED-CON Diagnostic Formula ( CTD Formula) , that can help guide clinicians in accurately diagnosing TED-CON , particularly in the presence of bilateral disease and when no relative afferent pupillary defect is present.
