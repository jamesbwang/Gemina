  Mounting evidence suggests that measures of phonemic fluency and semantic fluency are differentially associated with other cognitive and health phenotypes , but few studies have examined their shared and unique variance , especially using genetically-informative designs. In this study , 1464 middle-aged twins completed six fluency subtests at up to two time-points ( mean age 56 and 62 years). Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor solution: a General Fluency latent factor explained variation in all six subtests and a Semantic-Specific factor accounted for additional variance in semantic subtests. Both factors were explained primarily by genetic influences at both waves ( a
