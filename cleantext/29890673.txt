  The relationship between microstructure and flow behaviour has attracted attention from many researchers for the past decades , whilst the influences of dislocation and recrystallization on flow stress have not been well understood , which led to failure in flow stress prediction at high temperature compressions. In this work , we tried to provide a novel explanation of the relationship between microstructure evolutions and flow behaviour , and the influence of dislocation and recrystallization on flow stress was investigated. A dislocation based flow stress model was proposed and applied for 300M steel at the strain rate of 0.01 ‚Åª 10 s
