  Failure to address the functional aortic annulus during bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV) repair has led to early repair failures. The pathology of regurgitant BAV involves annular dilatation , which is more pronounced anteriorly and deep toward the muscular interventricular septum. In this study , we assessed the results of BAV repair using a strategy of deep circumferential annular support involving the septum in patients with a dilated annulus ( > 26 mm) and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation ( AR). Between February 1999 and June 2015 , 100 patients with regurgitant ( ≥ 2 +) BAV and a dilated ventriculoaortic junction ( VAJ) ( ≥ 26 mm) underwent repair with an adjunctive circumferential annuloplasty ( reimplantation procedure or ring). External root dissection to accommodate the annuloplasty was carried deep onto the anterior aspect of the interventricular septum. Follow up was complete in 96 patients , with a median follow-up of 31 months and a total of 362 patient-years. Cox regression analysis was used to predict recurrence of AR. The mean VAJ diameter was 30 ± 4 mm. Seventy-nine patients exhibited delayed prolapse of the anterior leaflet ( conjoined right and left cusps in Siever type 1 or anterior cusp in Siever type 0) , and 93 patients underwent reimplantation. In the entire study group , there were no in-hospital deaths , and only 1 patient had 2 + AR on discharge. There was 1 late noncardiac death. At 8 years , freedom from AR ≥ 2 + was 96.4 % and freedom from reoperation was 96.8 %. Higher preoperative AR grade , small graft size , and use of a ring were predictive of recurrent AR. Regurgitant BAVs with a dilated annulus display anterior cusp prolapse toward the septum. A deep circumferential annuloplasty may help maintain repair durability.
