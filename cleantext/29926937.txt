  This narrative review determines the effects of occlusal trauma and excessive occlusal forces on the periodontium , including the initiation and progression of periodontitis<disease> , abfraction , and gingival recession. Case definitions , diagnostic considerations , and the effects of occlusal therapy are also reviewed and discussed. The role of occlusal trauma in the initiation and progression of periodontitis<disease> remains a controversial subject in periodontology. Because occlusal trauma can only be confirmed histologically , its clinical diagnosis depends on clinical and radiographic surrogate indicators which make clinical trials difficult. Investigations have generally agreed that occlusal trauma and excessive occlusal forces do not initiate periodontitis<disease> or loss of connective tissue attachment. When plaque-induced periodontitis<disease> and occlusal trauma are present at the same time , there is weak evidence that the occlusal trauma may increase the rate of connective tissue loss. Occlusal therapy is indicated as part of periodontal therapy to reduce mobility and increase patient comfort and masticatory function. Existing data do not support the existence of abfraction as a cause for gingival recession. Occlusal trauma does not initiate periodontitis<disease> , and there is weak evidence that it alters the progression of the disease. There is no credible evidence to support the existence of abfraction or implicate it as a cause of gingival recession. Reduction of tooth mobility may enhance the effect of periodontal therapy.
