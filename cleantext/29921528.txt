  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD) is a well known genetic risk factor for pulmonary disease and is the most frequent hereditary disease diagnosed in adults. Despite being one of the most common hereditary diseases , AATD remains under-diagnosed because of its variable clinical presentation and the poor knowledge of this disease by physicians. With the aim of identifying clinical differences that could influence early diagnosis , we compared two groups of six AATD Pi * ZZ patients with different lung function severity and clinical expression at diagnosis. On comparing the two groups , we observed a younger mean age at diagnosis and more exacerbations in the severe group , but the percentage of smokers did not statistically differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that AATD continues being a disease suspected on younger patients with a worse lung function. In addition these findings confirm the clinical variability of the disease and that there are still unknown factors that contribute to its development. Therefore , early diagnosis may modify the prognosis of this disease.
