  Lithium sulfur batteries have been restricted on their major technical problem of shuttling soluble polysulfides between electrodes , resulting in serious capacity fading. For purpose of develop a high-performance lithium-sulfur battery , we first time utilize a simple growth method to introduce a Prussian blue modified Celgard separator as an ion selective membrane in lithium sulfur batteries. The unique structure of Prussian blue could effectively suppress the shuttle of polysulfides but scarcely affect the transfer ability of lithium ions , which is beneficial to achieve high sulfur conversion efficiency and capacity retention. The lithium sulfur battery with Prussian blue modified Celgard separator reveals an average capacity decaying of only 0.03 % per cycle at 1C after 1000 cycles.
