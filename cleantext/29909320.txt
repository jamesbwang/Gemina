  A systematic method in hydrophilic interaction chromatography ( HILIC) was developed for the separation of four monophosphate nucleotides using design of experiment ( DOE) approaches. Three HPLC parameters , the buffer concentration ( ammonium acetate concentration) , gradient time , and temperature , were evaluated within the quality design framework , and the effects on chromatographic parameters were investigated. Four zwitterionic columns ( ZIC-HILIC , ZIC-cHILIC , NUCLEODUR HILIC , and PC HILIC) were used to separate four nucleotides , and the HPLC conditions for each column were successfully optimized , although PC HILIC did not give peaks that were suitable for optimization. In addition , it was proved that optimized HPLC conditions differed from column to column even when the same types of zwitterionic sulfobetaine-functionalized columns were applied. This tendency was explained by differences in the separation characteristics of each column , the thickness of the water-enriched layer on the surface of the silica supports , and the pH. DOE for development of the HPLC method provides an effective explanation of the interactions among the variable parameters , especially in HILIC mode. Finally , a robust analytical method could be established by setting the optimum parameters. Among the employed columns , ZIC-cHILIC provided the widest range of suitable analytical conditions. NUCLEODUR HILIC was difficult to build a robust analytical method since the elution order of cytidine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate was reversed.
