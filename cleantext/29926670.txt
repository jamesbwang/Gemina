  To investigate the role of autophagy inhibitor chloroquine ( CQ) in acute ethanol-induced liver injury and its mechenism. Twenty-one C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group , ethanol group , CQ + ethanol group ( Compared with control group , ethanol induced liver injury proved by accumulation of hepatic lipids , TG levels , AST and ALT activities were significantly increased by ethanol , protein expression of LC3-Ⅱ was also markedly increased by ethanol. Compared with ethanol group , addition of CQ increased furtherthe level of LC3-Ⅱexpression , and TG amount , serum AST and ALT activities , and the expression of NF-κB p65 , TNF-αand IL-6. Acute ethanol-intake could induce liver steatosis and inflammation<symptom> , and autophagy inhibitor CQ exacerbatedethanol-induced liver injury , suggested that autophagy might be protective effect in acute ethanol-induced liver disease.
