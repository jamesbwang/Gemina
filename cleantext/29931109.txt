  Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone ( AMH) helps maintain the ovarian reserve by regulating primordial follicle activation and follicular selection in mammals , although its role within the avian ovary is unknown. In mammals , AMH is primarily produced in granulosa<pathogen> cells of preantral and early antral follicles. Similarly , in the hen , the granulosa<pathogen> cells of smaller follicles are the predominant source of AMH. The importance of AMH in mammalian ovarian dynamics suggests the protein and its specific Type II receptor , AMHRII , may have conserved functions in the hen. AMHRII mRNA expression is highest ( P < 0.01) in small follicles of the hen and decreases as follicle size increases. Similarly , expression of AMHRII and AMH is highest in granulosa<pathogen> cells from small follicles as compared to larger follicles. Dissection of 3-5 mm follicles into ooplasm and granulosa<pathogen> components shows that AMHRII mRNA levels are greater in ooplasm than granulosa<pathogen> cells. Furthermore , immunohistochemistry also revealed AMHRII staining in the oocyte and granulosa<pathogen> cells. AMH expression in mammals is elevated during periods of reproductive dormancy , possibly protecting the ovarian reserve. AMHRII and AMH mRNA were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in non-laying ovaries of broiler hens. In molting layer hens , AMHRII mRNA was significantly greater ( P < 0.05) compared to non-molting hen ovaries. These results suggest AMH may have a direct effect on the oocyte and thereby , contribute to bidirectional communication between oocyte and granulosa<pathogen> cells. Enhanced expression of AMHRII and AMH during reproductive quiescence supports a potential role of AMH in protecting the ovarian reserve in hens.
