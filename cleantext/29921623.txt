  We assessed whether receipt of coupons-via direct mail or e-mail-was prospectively related to trajectories of smoking behaviours. Data were from a cohort of US adults ( n = 26447) who participated in wave 1 ( 2013-2014) and wave 2 ( 2014-2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Participants reported receipt of tobacco direct mail/email coupons in the past 6 months in wave 1 and their smoking status in both waves. Weighted multiple logistic regressions were used to examine demographic correlates of receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 and to examine the prospective effect of receiving tobacco coupons on trajectories of smoking behaviours. At wave 1 , 10.7 % of never smokers , 13.9 % of experimental smokers , 37.1 % of current smokers and 16.5 % of former smokers reported receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons. Lower education and higher poverty adults and non-Hispanic white current smokers were more likely to have received these coupons ( p < 0.05). Receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons at wave 1 was associated with increased odds of smoking initiation among never smokers ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 2.28 , 95 % CI 1.36 to 3.83) , becoming established smokers among experimenters ( AOR = 1.62 , 95 % CI 1.29 to 2.04) , becoming daily smokers among non-daily smokers ( AOR = 1.56 , 95 % CI 1.23 to 1.99) and smoking relapse among former smokers between waves ( AOR = 1.91 , 95 % CI 1.39 to 2.65). Receiving these coupons at wave 1 was associated with reduced odds of smoking cessation â‰¥ 6 months among current smokers ( AOR = 0.71 , 95 % CI 0.58 to 0.88). Tobacco direct mail/email coupons encourage and sustain smoking and disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic populations.
