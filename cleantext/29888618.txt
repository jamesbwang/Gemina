  Bioinformatics indicate that miR-223 regulates many genes associated with cholesterol metabolism , and it could also control high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C) uptake. As reported in previous study , miR-223 was found to be upregulated from human subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia , however , it remains to be determined using a larger group of coronary heart disease ( CHD) patients. Moreover , whether it correlates with severity of atherogenesis , has never been elucidated before. We aim to further explore the association between circulating miR-223 content and severity of CHD. Sample was collected from 300 CHD patients and 100 subjects with angiographic exclusion of CHD. MiR-223 content was detected using quantitative real-time PCR. Gensini score was used to evaluate the severity of coronary stenotic lesions<symptom>. Expression of miR-223 was identified on basis of the quartiles of the Gensini score , and association between the miRNA and CHD was analyzed. Diagnostic potential of miR-223 of CHD was performed by ROC analysis. CHD patients had higher miR-223 level ( 13.23 , 9.29-17.59 vs. 4.05 , 3.06-6.11 , p < .001) , and the miRNA content significantly elevated following increasing Gensini score ( p < .001). Gensini score was significantly associated with miR-223 expression ( r = .7289 , p < .001). The optimal cut-off value of miR-223 was with a sensitivity of 86.0 % and specificity of 91.3 %. The AUC of miR-223 was 0.933 ( 95 % CI , 0.905-0.961). These preliminary results suggest that the expression of miR-223 may be associated with atherogenesis. The level of circulating miR-223 in predicting the severity of coronary atherosclerosis may have a relatively certain value.
