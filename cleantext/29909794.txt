  The present study aimed to compare the anti-biofilm activities of four commonly available antiseptic eardrops against biofilms from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> in vitro. The anti-biofilm activities of 50 per cent Burow 's solution , vinegar with water ( 1:1) , 2 per cent acetic acid solution , and 4 per cent boric acid solution were evaluated using biofilm assays. Additionally , the anti-biofilm activities of the four antiseptic solutions against tympanostomy tube biofilms were compared using a scanning electron microscope. The inhibition of biofilm formation from methicillin-resistant S aureus<pathogen> and quinolone-resistant P aeruginosa<pathogen> occurred after treatment with 4 per cent boric acid solution , 2 per cent acetic acid solution , and vinegar with water ( 1:1). However , 50 per cent Burow 's solution did not exhibit effective anti-biofilm activity. The results indicate that 4 per cent boric acid solution and vinegar with water ( 1:1) are potent inhibitors of biofilms from methicillin-resistant S aureus<pathogen> and quinolone-resistant P aeruginosa<pathogen> , and provide safe pH levels for avoiding ototoxicity.
