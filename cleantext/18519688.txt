  Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The high frequency of recurrence and metastasis is the main reason for poor prognosis. Liver cancer stem cells ( CSCs) have unlimited self-renewal , differentiation , and tumor-regenerating capacities. The maintenance of CSCs may account for the refractory features of liver cancer. Despite extensive investigations , the underlying regulatory mechanisms of liver CSCs remain elusive. miRNA and lncRNA , two major classes of the ncRNA family , can exert important roles in various biological processes , and their diverse regulatory mechanisms in CSC maintenance have acquired increasing attention. However , to the best of our knowledge , there is a lack of reviews summarizing these findings. Therefore , we systematically recapitulated the latest studies on miRNAs and lncRNAs in sustaining liver CSCs. Moreover , we highlighted the potential clinical application of these dysregulated ncRNAs as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review not only sheds new light to fully understand liver CSCs but also provides valuable clues on targeting ncRNAs to block or eradicate CSCs in cancer treatment.
