  Eicosanoids are bioactive lipids that play crucial roles in various pathophysiological conditions , including inflammation<symptom> and cancer. They include both the COX-derived prostaglandins and the LOX-derived leukotrienes. Furthermore , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) pathways family of receptor tyrosine kinases also are known to play a central role in the tumorigenesis. Various antitumor modalities have been approved cancer treatments that target therapeutically the COX-2 and EGFR pathways; these include selective COX-2 inhibitors and EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Research has shown that the COX-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways actively interact with each other in order to orchestrate carcinogenesis. This has been used to justify a targeted combinatorial approach aimed at these two pathways. Although combined therapies have been found to have a greater antitumor effect than the administration of single agent , this does not exempt them from the possible fatal cardiac effects that are associated with COX-2 inhibition. In this review , we delineate the contribution of HB-EGF , an important EGFR ligand , to the cardiac dysfunction related to decreased shedding of HB-EGF after COX-2/ PGE2 inhibition. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these cardiac side effects will make possible more effective regimens that use the dual-targeting approach.
