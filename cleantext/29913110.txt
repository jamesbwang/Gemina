  We performed a systematic review to evaluate factors affecting uptake of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine amongst physicians , parents and health system. We identified 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria from 790 screened studies published between Jan 2005 to Jan 2016. Perceived severity of rotavirus<pathogen> disease , efficacy of vaccine and recommendation by health authorities positively influenced uptake of vaccine amongst health care providers. Routine and timely vaccination with routine vaccines and availability of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine in public health programme facilitated uptake. Family income , parental education and employment status positively influenced the decision to vaccinate by parents. Concerns about safety , high cost , additional workload and logistic problems in acquiring vaccine stocks were perceived as barriers. Improved awareness regarding the rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination amongst public and scientific community and strengthening of public health system for better and timely immunisation coverage are important factors to maximize uptake of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine in India.
