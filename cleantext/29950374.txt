  Spontaneous bilateral perirenal haematoma , as well as splenic haematoma , are rare occasions in polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN). We report a case of a young man , who suffered from various typical and atypical manifestations of PAN since childhood. The diagnosis was delayed due to symptoms mimicking with other clinical conditions. Finally , the diagnosis was confirmed when presented with perirenal and splenic haematoma and was managed successfully.
