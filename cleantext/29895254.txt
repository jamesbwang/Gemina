  Studies have shown that newly diagnosed diabetic patients need a lot of information about medical examinations , checkups , tests and precautions for its control besides its disastrous effects on heart , kidneys , eyes , foot and nerves etc.. Patients in Saudi Arabia are generally not aware of most of the information they may need which is one the major reasons of its increasing number of patients. Past studies conducted are based on clinical data of hospitals and health care centers only discussed its effects. Present research was conducted through a survey questionnaire in Arabic language from Type 1 and Type 2 patients to establish if they knew about this disease and its criticality in day to day activities and were they being provided sufficient information about its requirements. Data for checkups , tests , management by food and nutrition and physical activity education were collected for this purpose. Approximately 25 % female and 33 % male patients reported that diabetes affected their day to day activities. Analysis of results showed that awareness of importance of tests including blood glucose level test HbA1c was only among 50 % patients , 51 % Type 1 did not have cholesterol test , 31 % Type 1 and 16 % Type 2 % never had eye test , 97 % Type 1 and 60 % Type 2 were unaware of bare foot examination , 34 % Type 1 and 70 % Type 2 never went to a dietician to ascertain their nutrition needs , 24 % Type 2 did not know importance of exercise for diabetes control. It was concluded that Saudi patients suffering from diabetes seriously lacked information about its monitoring , control and treatment in form of tests to be conducted and requirements of diet control and physical activities. Therefore a national level awareness campaign for providing this information could be considered as a key requirement.
