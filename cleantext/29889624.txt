  Children with alleged child sexual abuse ( CSA) need to be assessed systematically. The use of validated instruments during the assessment , like the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory ( CSBI) , could add diagnostic value. We aim to assess the diagnostic utility of the CSBI to differentiate between sexually abused and non-abused children. We conducted a systematic review. We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE and PsychInfo for studies comparing CSBI scores in sexually abused children and non-abused children ( 2-12 years old). Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. We included 7 ( out of 1048) articles. The CSBI total scores were significantly higher in CSA-victims compared with non-abused children ( in case-control settings). However , in children with suspected CSA , the results were ambiguous. One study reported significant differences. Another study reported weak diagnostic ability for the CSBI-3 in children with suspected CSA ( a sensitivity and specificity of 0.50 , with a positive predictive value of 0.28 , and a negative predictive value of 0.72). Research on the diagnostic utility of the CSBI for suspected CSA is limited and shows disappointing results. Until more research is done , the CSBI should not be used on its own to differentiate between sexually abused and non-abused children.
