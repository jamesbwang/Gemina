  This study aimed to identify cardiotocography patterns that discriminate fetal acidemia newborns by comprehensively evaluating the parameters obtained from Holter monitoring during delivery. Between June 1 , 2015 , and August 1 , 2016 , a prospective observational study of 85 patients was conducted using fetal Holter monitoring at the Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital , Capital Medical University , China. Umbilical cord blood was sampled immediately after delivery and fetal acidemia was defined as umbilical cord arterial blood pH < 7.20. Fetal electrocardiogram- ( FECG-) derived parameters , including basal fetal heart rate ( BFHR) , short-term variation ( STV) , large acceleration ( LA) , deceleration capacity ( DC) , acceleration capacity ( AC) , proportion of episodes of high variation ( PEHV) , and proportion of episodes of low variation ( PELV) , were compared between 16 fetuses with acidemia and 47 without. The areas under the curve ( AUC) of receiver operating characteristics ( ROC) were calculated. Although all the computerized parameters showed predictive values for acidemia ( all AUC > 0.50) , STV ( AUC = 0.84 ,
