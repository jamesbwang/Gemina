  To explores emotional intelligence ( EI) among Saudi children in basic education programs. A cross-sectional study design was utilized. A convenience sample of students ( n = 684) from 10 schools in Saudi Arabia completed the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory-Youth Version. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Most students ( mean 83.2) showed poor emotional and social skills ( p less than 90 EI). Region , income , failing grades , father 's educational level , and working status correlated positively ( p less than 0.05) with EI. Living with parents , mother 's educational level , grade point average , and a lack of health problems were significant predictors of EI. Conclusions. Basic education teachers and families face challenges in incorporating strategies to enhance children 's emotional and social functioning.
