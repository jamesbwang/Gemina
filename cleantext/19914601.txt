  The amygdala plays a major role in the processing of physiologic and behavioral responses to stress and is characterized by gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)- mediated high inhibitory tone under resting state. Human and animal studies showed that stress lead to a hyperactivity of amygdala , which was accompanied by the removal of inhibitory control. However , the contribution of hyperactivity of amygdala to stress-induced neuropsychiatric diseases , such as anxiety<symptom> and mood disorders , is still dubious. In this review , we will summarize stress-induced various structural and functional alterations in amygdala , including the GABA receptors expression , GABAergic transmission and synaptic plasticity. It may provide new insight on the neuropathologic and neurophysiological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric diseases.
