  Synovial analysis of joint aspirates is a key diagnostic tool; all major diagnostic algorithms include cell count ( CC) and polymorphonuclear percentage ( PMN %) as important criteria to make the diagnosis. In this context , we conducted this study to analyze the overall accuracy of CC and PMN %. A single-center retrospective analysis was performed with clinical data of included patients , with a total of 524 preoperative joint aspirations ( 255 hips , 269 knees). From the aspirated synovial fluid , we tested the leukocyte esterase activity , leukocyte CC , and PMN % , and sent specimens for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture. Depending on the clinical results in accordance with the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria for prosthetic joint infection ( PJI) , 203 patients were then admitted for aseptic revision and 134 patients for septic exchange. In 337 cases ( 64.3 % of the study patients) , it was possible to measure the CC. The best cutoff level for PJI of all study patients was 2582 leukocytes/μL ( sensitivity ( SE) 80.6 % , specificity ( SP) 85.2 %) and a PMN % of 66.1 % ( SE 80.6 % , SP 83.3 %). The chosen cutoff levels for PJI of total knee and total hip arthroplasty were 1630 leukocytes/μL ( SE 83.6 % , SP 82.2 %) and a PMN % of 60.5 % ( SE 80.3 % , SP 77.1 %) and 3063 leukocytes/μL ( SE 78.1 % , SP 80.0 %) and a PMN % of 66.1 % ( SE 82.2 % , SP 82.4 %) , respectively. CC and PMN % are sensitive methods for diagnosing PJI of total hip and total knee arthroplasty. However , there are differences in cutoff levels between knees and hips. International guidelines and diagnostic criteria need revisions in terms of these parameters.
