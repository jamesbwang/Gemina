  From image stacks to computational models , processing digital representations of neuronal morphologies is essential to neuroscientific research. Workflows involve various techniques and tools , leading in certain cases to convoluted and fragmented pipelines. The existence of an integrated , extensible and free framework for processing , analysis and visualization of those morphologies is a challenge that is still largely unfulfilled. We present NeuroMorphoVis , an interactive , extensible and cross-platform framework for building , visualizing and analyzing digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology skeletons extracted from microscopy stacks. Our framework is capable of detecting and repairing tracing artifacts , allowing the generation of high fidelity surface meshes and high resolution volumetric models for simulation and in silico imaging studies. The applicability of NeuroMorphoVis is demonstrated with two case studies. The first simulates the construction of three-dimensional profiles of neuronal somata and the other highlights how the framework is leveraged to create volumetric models of neuronal circuits for simulating different types of in vitro imaging experiments. The source code and documentation are freely available on https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis under the GNU public license. The morphological analysis , visualization and surface meshing are implemented as an extensible Python API ( Application Programming Interface) based on Blender , and the volume reconstruction and analysis code is written in C++ and parallelized using OpenMP. The framework features are accessible from a user-friendly GUI ( Graphical User Interface) and a rich CLI ( Command Line Interface). Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
