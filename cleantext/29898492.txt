  Following the publication of the new US guidelines , especially the new classifications of hypertension and the general reduction in treatment targets were discussed worldwide. Applying the US guidelines to a recent German cohort study would in practice lead to a significant increase in the diagnosis of `` hypertension '' in untreated patients. The number of under-adjusted patients would also increase sharply , increasing more than those predicted in the US Guidelines. Affected by an intensified antihypertensive therapy would be particularly elderly patients , in which adverse drug reactions but also occur more frequently. It seems doubtful whether the massive increase in the diagnosis `` hypertension '' can improve the supply situation: the opposite effect of avoiding therapists and patients could occur. Determining the individual risk with suitable , evaluated instruments certainly makes sense to treat more targeted patients. More important than new blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> limits is a more accurate classification of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Repeated self-measurements and ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurement lead to a better selection of patients benefiting from a therapy.
