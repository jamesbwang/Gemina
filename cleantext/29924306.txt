  Genotype has been implicated in the outcome of ovarian stimulation. The analysis of patient-specific genotypes might lead to an individualized pharmacogenomic approach to controlled ovarian stimulation ( COS). However , the validity of such an approach remains to be established. To define the impact of specific genotype profiles of follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone and their receptors ( FSHR , LHR and LHCGR) on ovarian stimulation outcome. Specifically , our aim was to identify polymorphisms that could be useful in clinical practice , and those that need further clinical investigation. A systematic review followed by a meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines without time restriction. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , SCOPUS and EMBASE databases to identify all relevant studies published before January 2017. Only clinical trials published as full-text articles in peer-reviewed journals were included. The primary outcome was the number of oocytes retrieved. Fifty-seven studies were assessed for eligibility , 33 of which were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Data were independently extracted using quality indicators. COS outcomes related to seven polymorphisms ( FSHR ( rs6165) , FSHR ( rs6166) , FSHR ( rs1394205) , LHB ( rs1800447) , LHB ( rs1056917) , LHCGR ( rs2293275) and LHCGR ( rs13405728)) were evaluated. More oocytes were retrieved from FSHR ( rs6165) AA homozygotes ( five studies , 677 patients , weighted mean difference ( WMD): 1.85 , 95 % CI: 0.85-2.85 , P < 0.001; I2 = 0 %) than from GG homozygotes and AG heterozygotes ( four studies , 630 patients , WMD: 1.62 , 95 % CI: 0.28-2.95 , P = 0.020; I2 = 56 %). Moreover , stimulation duration was shorter in FSHR ( rs6165) AA homozygotes than in AG carriers ( three studies , 588 patients , WMD -0.48 , 95 % CI: -0.87 to -0.10 , P = 0.010 , I2 = 44 %). A higher number of oocytes ( 21 studies , 2632 patients WMD: 0.84 , 95 % CI: 0.19 to 1.49 , P = 0.01 , I2 = 76 %) and metaphase II oocytes ( five studies , 608 patients , WMD: 1.03 , 95 % CI: 0.01-2.05 , P = 0.050 , I2 = 0 %) was observed in AA than in GG homozygote carriers. FSH consumption was significantly lower in FSHR ( rs1394205) GG homozygotes ( three studies , 411 patients , WMD: -1294.61 IU , 95 % CI: -593.08 to -1996.14 IU , P = 0.0003 , I2 = 99 %) and AG heterozygotes ( three studies , 367 patients , WMD: -1014.36 IU , 95 % CI: -364.11 to -1664.61 IU , P = 0.002 , I2 = 99 %) than in AA homozygotes. These results support the clinical relevance of specific genotype profiles on reproductive outcome. Further studies are required to determine their application in a pharmacogenomic approach to ovarian stimulation.
