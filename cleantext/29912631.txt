  Police agencies increasingly implement training programs to protect mental health. The Road to Mental Readiness ( R2MR) program was designed by the Canadian military to increase mental health resilience. A version of R2MR was adapted for municipal police by the Mental Health Commission of Canada ( MHCC). The current research was designed to assess the R2MR program , as adapted and delivered by the MHCC , in a municipal police sample. Participants were 147 Canadian police agency employees ( 57 % women) who received a single R2MR training session. Participants completed pre- and post-training self-report questionnaires , and follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. The questionnaires assessed mental health symptoms , work engagement , resiliency , mental health knowledge , and stigma. Multilevel modeling analyses assessed for within-participant changes over time. The results were consistent with other single session interventions; specifically , there were no significant changes in mental health symptoms , resilience , or work engagement ( p > .05). There were small , but significant ( p < .05) , reductions in stigma at post-training that may facilitate help-seeking among police; relatedly , in open-ended response fields , participants commonly described the training as helpful for changing attitudes and improving communication. More engagement with the material may produce larger , sustained gains , but more published research is critically needed.
