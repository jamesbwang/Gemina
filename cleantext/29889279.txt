  Location data are becoming easier to obtain and are now bundled with other metadata in a variety of biomedical research applications. At the same time , the level of sophistication required to protect patient privacy is also increasing. In this article , we provide guidance for institutional review boards ( IRBs) to make informed decisions about privacy protections in protocols involving location data. We provide an overview of some of the major categories of technical algorithms and medical-legal tools at the disposal of investigators , as well as the shortcomings of each. Although there is no `` one size fits all '' approach to privacy protection , this article attempts to describe a set of practical considerations that can be used by investigators , journal editors , and IRBs.
