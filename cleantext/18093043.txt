  We develop a quantitative methodology to characterize vulnerability among 132 U.S. urban centers ( ` cities ') to terrorist events , applying a place-based vulnerability index to a database of terrorist incidents and related human casualties. A centered autologistic regression model is employed to relate urban vulnerability to terrorist outcomes and also to adjust for autocorrelation in the geospatial data. Risk-analytic ` benchmark ' techniques are then incorporated into the modeling framework , wherein levels of high and low urban vulnerability to terrorism are identified. This new , translational adaptation of the risk-benchmark approach , including its ability to account for geospatial autocorrelation , is seen to operate quite flexibly in this socio-geographic setting.
