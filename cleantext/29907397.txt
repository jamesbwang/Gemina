  The use of prophylactic indomethacin in very preterm infants is controversial. The last randomized controlled trial ( RCT) to study this therapy enrolled infants over 20 years ago. More recently , observational studies have investigated the association between exposure to prophylactic indomethacin and neonatal morbidities and mortality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies for the outcomes of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD). Two observational studies involving a total of 11,289 very preterm infants were suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that prophylactic indomethacin was not associated with higher or lower risk-adjusted odds of death or BPD ( 0.93 , 95 % CI: 0.76-1.13) and of BPD among survivors ( 0.94 , 95 % CI: 0.78-1.12). However , there was a weak association between indomethacin prophylaxis and decreased risk-adjusted odds of mortality ( 0.81 , 95 % CI: 0.66-0.98). It is unknown whether this finding resulted from unmeasured confounding , chance , or represents a true benefit. To confirm the hypothesis that prophylactic indomethacin has a small effect on mortality in the current era , a contemporary RCT would need to enroll over 3500 very immature infants at high risk of death.
