  Despite the abundance , ubiquity and impact of environmental viruses , their inherent genomic plasticity and extreme diversity pose significant challenges for the examination of bacteriophages on Earth. Viral metagenomic studies have offered insight into broader aspects of phage ecology and repeatedly uncover genes to which we are currently unable to assign function. A combined effort of phage isolation and metagenomic survey of Chicago & rsquo; s nearshore waters of Lake Michigan revealed the presence of Pbunaviruses , relatives of the
