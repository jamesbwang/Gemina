  As a dioxygenase , Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 ( TET2) catalyzes subsequent steps of 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC) oxidation. TET2 plays a critical role in the self-renewal , proliferation , and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells , but its impact on mature hematopoietic cells is not well-characterized. Here we show that Tet2 plays an essential role in osteoclastogenesis. Deletion of Tet2 impairs the differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells ( macrophages) and their maturation into bone-resorbing osteoclasts in vitro. Furthermore , Tet2
