  Wound dressings that use biosynthetic cellulose may be a good alternative to dressings currently used to treat chronic and acute ulcers<disease> because their nanostructure is similar to collagen. The objective of this study was to evaluate a wound<disease> dressing created with a new material that is composed of a fibrillary network of biosynthetic cellulose. A case series of 8 patients in primary healthcare centers in Östergötland county council , Sweden , with chronic and acute lower limb wounds<disease> were treated with a wound<disease> dressing based on eiratex ( S2Medical AB , Linköping , Sweden). The dressing was applied to traumatic ( n = 5) and venous ulcers<disease> ( n = 3). All ulcers<disease> were considered healed at the end of the treatment. The wounds<disease> were examined at regular intervals by a physician to determine healing time , number of dressing changes , and number of visits. Mean healing time was 43 ± 6 days after the first application of the dressing. The mean number of visits was 5.7 ± 0.6 , and the mean number of dressings used per patient was 1.7 ± 0.2. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a wound<disease> dressing made of eiratex to heal chronic and acute ulcers<disease>. The data show that the number of dressings used and dressing changes needed to heal the ulcers<disease> are lower than what have been reported in the literature for other dressing materials.
