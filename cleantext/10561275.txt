  The pharmacodynamic interactions among trifluoperazine ( TFP) , gemcitabine ( GEM) , and paclitaxel ( PTX) were assessed in pancreatic cancer cells ( PANC-1). The phenothiazine TFP was chosen for its potential activity on cancer stem cells , while GEM and PTX cause apoptosis. Effects of each drug alone and in various combinations on cell growth inhibition of PANC-1 cells were studied in vitro to determine the drug-specific parameters and assess the nature of drug interactions. Joint inhibition ( JI) and competitive inhibition ( CI) equations were applied with a Ïˆ interaction term. TFP fully inhibited growth of cells ( I
