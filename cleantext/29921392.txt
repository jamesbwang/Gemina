  In this study , primary investigations of selected cultivar of purslane named as Tall Green<symptom> under articular salinity stress were evaluated to understand the basic concept of different mechanisms of physiological attributes which will play an important role for molecular and proteomic level research. The evaluation of morphological and physiological attributes under 0 mM ( without salt addition) 100 mM and 200 mM salt stress changed dramatically. The results showed high salt stress at 200 mM significantly decreasing the morphological attributes and performance of leaves , stems , and roots. At moderate salt stress levels , 100 mM , the ratio of Fv/Fm slightly increased compared to high stress. In addition , salt stress significantly decreased the total chlorophyll content ( chl a + b) at 200 mM. The relative water content percentage was high at 0 mM. Moreover , the electrolyte leakage ( EL) significantly increased with increasing salinity stress compared to control 0 mM.
