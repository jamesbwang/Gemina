  Coeliac artery stenosis ( CAS) is rarely of consequence owing to rich collateral supply from the superior mesenteric artery via the pancreatic head. Pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD) in CAS disrupts these collaterals , and places the liver , stomach and spleen at risk of ischaemia. A 56-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography revealed an operable periampullary tumour with CAS due to compression by the median arcuate ligament with multiple collaterals in the pancreatic head and a prominent gastroduodenal artery ( GDA). Following unsuccessful coeliac axis endovascular stenting , a PD was performed. Intraoperative median arcuate ligament release failed to restore good flow in the common hepatic artery ( CHA) and splenic artery ( SpA) A decision was made to use the left gastric artery ( LGA) for arterial reconstruction , disconnect it from the stomach with its origin intact and anastomose it to the supracoeliac aorta. Doppler ultrasonography with a GDA clamp confirmed good filling of the CHA and SpA via the LGA. The GDA was ligated and the PD completed. The patient had an uneventful recovery except for a biochemical pancreatic leak and was discharged on day 10. CAS during PD ( confirmed by a decrease in CHA flow with a GDA clamp) requires an additional procedure to restore blood flow to the liver , stomach and spleen. Anastomosing the LGA to the supracoeliac aorta is a simple reconstruction technique for achieving this.
