  Five new iridal-type triterpenoids , named as spirioiridoconfal A-C ( 1-3) , isobelamcandal ( 4) and 17-hydroxyl-27-ene-iridal ( 5) , along with one known compound ( 6) were isolated from the whole plant of Iris confusa<pathogen>. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 3 and 6 showed moderate activity against HBV DNA replication in vitro with the IC
