  2D nanomaterials are finding numerous applications in next-generation electronics , consumer goods , energy generation and storage , and healthcare. The rapid rise of utility and applications for 2D nanomaterials necessitates developing means for their mass production. This study details a new compressible flow exfoliation method for producing 2D nanomaterials using a multiphase flow of 2D layered materials suspended in a high-pressure gas undergoing expansion. The expanded gas-solid mixture is sprayed in a suitable solvent , where a significant portion ( up to 10 % yield) of the initial hexagonal boron nitride material is found to be exfoliated with a mean thickness of 4.2 nm. The exfoliation is attributed to the high shear rates ( γ˙ > 10
