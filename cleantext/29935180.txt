  Ophiopogonin D ( OPD) is the chief pharmacological active component of the traditional Chinese herbal prescription drug-Shenmai injection ( SMI) , which has been used to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. In the present study , we investigated whether OPD protectively relieve cardiac hypertrophy against inflammation<symptom> via inhibiting the expression of NF-κB and examined whether cytochrome P450 2J3 ( CYP2J3) was involved in this pathway. H9c2 cells were treated with Angiotensin II ( Ang II). Hypertrophy in rat was induced by administration of Ang II infusion. To evaluate the effect of OPD on disease progression and the role of CYP2J3 in this way , inflammatory mediators ( NF-κB) , specific hypertrophic factors and pathological change were determined in this experiment. In addition , Ang II induced hypertrophy with the elevated expression of specific hypertrophy genes and NF-κB signaling molecules. However , these inductive effects were reversed by OPD in conjunction with Ang II. Overexpression of CYP2J3 prevented the excessive expression of NF-κB. In vivo , some pathological cardiac hypertrophy injuries were relieved after OPD treatment. OPD exerts a positive effect on alleviating cardiac hypertrophy. The mechanism is probably inhibiting the expression of NF-κB by upregulating CYP2J3 to suppressing
