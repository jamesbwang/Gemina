  Early detection of disease is a pivotal factor for determining prognosis and clinical outcome of patients with cancer. As cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) is currently difficult to detect and most cases of such cancer present with late-stage disease at the time of initial diagnosis , we employed proteomic analysis of the bile to identify potential candidate biomarkers for Opisthorchis viverrini ( OV)- associated CCA. Proteins in pooled bile samples from patients with CCA and OV infection , with CCA without OV infection , with OV infection but no CCA , and with neither OV infection nor CCA were separated by 15 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , in-gel trypsin digestion and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. According to our analysis , three proteins , namely aristaless-like homeobox1 isoform X1 ( ALX1) , major histocompatibility complex polypeptide-related sequence A ( MICA) , and uncharacterized protein C14orf105 isoform X12 were found to be potential markers for OV infection , as they were predominantly found in all OV-infected groups. Although these proteins were detected in both OV-infected patients with and without CCA , their abundance was 2.90- , 7.06-and 3.65-fold higher , respectively , in those with CCA. In patients with CCA , potential novel biomarkers wre immunoglobulin heavy chain , translocated in liposarcoma ( TLS) , visual system homeobox 2 ( VSX2) and an unnamed protein product. We provided novel information regarding potential biomarkers for OV infection and CCA. These two protein profiles could benefit diagnosis as well as monitoring of CCA.
