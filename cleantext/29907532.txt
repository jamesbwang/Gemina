  To compare antiretroviral adherence ( measured as the proportion of days covered ( PDC)) and change in viral load in insured , HIV-infected , adult outpatients enrolled and not enrolled in a medication synchronization program. This was a multicenter , retrospective , pilot cohort study. Fifty-eight insured , HIV-infected , outpatients at least 18 years of age receiving antiretroviral therapy ( ART) for at least 3 months as of August 2015 were included. PDC , viral load , PDC dichotomized into adherent or nonadherent , and viral load dichotomized into detectable or undetectable were collected for each patient. Study data were compared in those with ( enrolled) and without ( not enrolled or control) medication synchronization. The study end points were analyzed between the 2 groups retrospectively after 3 months. PDC in patients undergoing medication synchronization was significantly higher than in control patients: mean ± SD 96 ± 9 % versus 71 ± 27 % , respectively ( P < 0.0001). The medication synchronization group was also more likely to be adherent to ART than the control group ( odds ratio 10.67 , 95 % confidence interval 2.63-43.31). In the medication synchronization group , 75.9 % of patients had an undetectable baseline viral load , and 83.3 % had an undetectable viral load at study completion. In the control group , 62.1 % and 64.7 % had an undetectable viral load at baseline and completion , respectively. No statistically significant change in viral load was observed between groups ( P = 0.34). In insured , HIV-infected , adult outpatients , implementation of a medication synchronization program was associated with improved ART adherence. Future studies are needed to better assess the impact of medication synchronization on clinical outcomes.
