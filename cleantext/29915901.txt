  The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between community-level social capital and physical abuse towards children , and the mediating effect of parental psychological distress by multilevel mediation analyses. We analyzed data from a population-based study of first-grade elementary school children ( 6-7 years old) in Adachi City , Tokyo , Japan. The caregivers of first-grade students from all elementary schools in Adachi City ( N = 5355) were asked to respond to a questionnaire assessing parents ' self-reported physical abuse ( beating and hitting) and neighborhood social capital. Among them , 4291 parents returned valid responses ( response rate 80.1 %). We performed multilevel analyses to determine the relationships between community-level parental social capital and physical abuse , and further multilevel mediation analyses were performed to determine whether parental psychological distress mediated the association. Low community-level social capital was positively associated with physical abuse ( both beating and hitting) after adjustment for other individual covariates ( beating: middle , OR = 1.54 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.13; low , OR = 1.33 , 95 % CI 0.94-1.88; and hitting: middle , OR = 1.35 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.80; low , OR = 1.16 , 95 % CI 0.86-1.57). Multilevel mediation analyses revealed that community-level parental psychological distress did not mediate the association ( indirect effect ß = 0.10 , 95 % CI- 0.10 to 0.29 , p = 0.34 for beating; ß = 0.03 , 95 % CI- 0.16 to 0.23 , p = 0.74 for hitting). Fostering community-level social capital might be important for developing a strategy to prevent child maltreatment , which may have a direct impact on abusive behavior towards children.
