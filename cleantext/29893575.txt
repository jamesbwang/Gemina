  Scalable production of high-quality heteroatom-modified graphene is critical for microscale supercapacitors but remains a great challenge. Herein , we demonstrate a scalable , single-step electrochemical exfoliation of graphite into highly solution-processable fluorine-modified graphene ( FG) , achieved in an aqueous fluorine-containing neutral electrolyte , for flexible and high-energy-density ionogel-based microsupercapacitors ( FG-MSCs). The electrochemically exfoliated FG nanosheets are characterized by atomic thinness , large lateral size ( up to 12 μm) , a high yield of > 70 % with ≤ 3 layers , and a fluorine doping of 3 at % , allowing for large-scale production of FG-MSCs. Our ionogel-based FG-MSCs deliver high energy density of 56 mWh cm
