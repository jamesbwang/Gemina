  The present study examined the effects of psychiatric label ( thought and perceptual dysregulation vs. schizophrenia) , symptom manifestation ( positive vs. negative symptoms) , and gender ( male vs. female) of a vignette character with psychosis on the general public 's cognitive attributions , affective reactions , and behavioral responses. A 2 × 2 × 2 vignette-based telephone survey was conducted based on 533 Chinese adults from 18 to 60 years of age. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that compared with the label of thought and perceptual dysregulation , the public accorded the label of schizophrenia with greater levels of intentionality and controllability. A male character predicted greater intentionality , controllability , and social rejection than did a female character. Positive symptoms predicted greater controllability , contempt , and social rejection than did negative symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications on the findings were discussed.
