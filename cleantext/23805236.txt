  The third plague pandemic originated from Yunnan Province , China in the middle of the 19th century. The last human plague epidemic in Yunnan occurred from 1986-2005. On June 6 , 2016 , a case of human plague was reported in the Xishuangbanna Prefecture , Yunnan. The patient suffered from primary septicemic plague after exposure to a dead house rat ( Rattus<pathogen> flavipectus) , which has been identified as the main plague reservoir in the local epizootic area. Moreover , a retrospective investigation identified another bubonic plague case in this area. Based on these data , human plague reemerged after a silent period of ten years. In this study , three molecular typing methods , including a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) analysis , different region analysis ( DFR) , and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis ( MLVA) , were used to illustrate the molecular characteristics of Yersinia<pathogen> pestis<pathogen> ( Y.<pathogen> pestis<pathogen>) strains isolated in Yunnan. The DFR profiles of the strains isolated in Yunnan in 2016 were the same as the strains that had previously been isolated in this Rattus<pathogen> flavipectus plague focus. The c3 spacer present in the previously isolated strains was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc CRISPR loci of the strains isolated in 2016. The MLVA analysis using MLVA ( 14 +12) showed that the strains isolated from the human plague case and host animal plague infection in 2016 in Yunnan displayed different molecular patterns than the strains that had previously been isolated from Yunnan and adjacent provinces.
