  A facile and efficient protocol for rhodium-catalyzed amination of quinoline N-oxides at the C-8 position using simple and commercially available trifluoroacetamide as the amino source has been developed , which proceeds with perfect regioselectivity at room temperature and short reaction times. This catalytic system is highly convenient on a gram scale. The desired products feature diverse functional group tolerance with good to excellent yields.
