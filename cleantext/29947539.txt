  Endothelin-1 ( ET-1) induces pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. Given that endothelial cells are the main source of ET-1 and ET-1 from other cells may encounter difficulty penetrating vascular compartments , we hypothesize that endothelial-derived ET-1 promotes vascular remodeling secondary to pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. We used vascular endothelial ET-1 knock-out ( VEETKO) and Wild type mice for this research. They were given intratracheal bleomycin and euthanized at day 28. We quantified pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , measured lung ET-1 and its receptors ' expression , and assessed pulmonary vascular remodeling by calculating medial wall index , muscularization index , adventitial collagen and adventitial fibroblast and macrophage accumulation. Right ventricle remodeling was also assessed. Both VEETKO and Wild type mice developed comparable pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> and similar fibrosis-related gene expression. Compared to Wild type mice , bleomycin-induced VEETKO mice had lower ET-1 peptide levels ( 15.4 pg/mg vs. 31.2 pg/mg , p < 0.01). Expression of both ET-1 receptors mRNAs were increased in fibrosis<disease> models. Bleomycin-induced fibrosis<disease> VEETKO mice had significantly less muscularized arterioles , lower muscularization index and attenuated adventitial collagen , fibroblast and macrophage accumulation as compared to that of Wild type mice. Right ventricular pressure , hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease> did not increase both in VEETKO and Wild type mice despite the more enhanced vascular remodeling in Wild type. In conclusion , endothelial-derived endothelin-1 promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling secondary to bleomycin-induced
