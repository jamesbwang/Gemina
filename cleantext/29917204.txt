  Oxidative injury is an essential part of the pathological changes of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Sestrin2 ( Sesn2) , a conserved antioxidant protein , is activated under stress to protect cells against oxidative stress. This study mainly explored the function and mechanism of Sesn2 during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation ( OGD/R) model of primary neurons was established. MTS and LDH ( lactate dehydrogenase) kit were used to detect cell viability and cell damage by colorimetric method. The superoxide dismutase ( SOD) kit and malondialdehyde ( MDA) kit were used to access the level of SOD and MDA in neurons. To establish a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) in adult male Sprague-Dawley ( SD) rats , the process of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in animals was simulated. Western blot and immunofluorescence were utilized to further examine the relationship between the expression of Sesn2 and Nrf2 ( nuclear factor E2 related factor 2). Sesn2 aggravated neuronal damage and enhanced cell viability in OGD/R model. Intraventricular injection of Sesn2 siRNA lentivirus aggravated nerve function damage in MCAO model , increased cerebral infarction area and water content. Sesn2 overexpression resulted in the increase of total , nuclear levels of Nrf2 , as well as the downstream proteins of Nrf2 , sulfiredoxin1 ( Srx1) and thioredoxin1 ( Trx1). On the contrary , after knockdown of Sesn2 , we obtained the opposite result. Knockdown of Sesn2 reduced Nrf2 , Srx1 and Trx1 levels in rat cerebral cortex in MCAO model. Sesn2 promoted the transfer of nuclear Nrf2 to the cytoplasm , it decreased the expressions of Nrf2 and its downstream proteins , Srx1 and Trx1. Meanwhile , it increased the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by changing the distribution of Nrf2.
