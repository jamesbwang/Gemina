  Salimabromide is an antibiotic polyketide that was previously isolated from the obligate marine myxobacterium Enhygromyxa salina , and its densely functionalized and conformationally rigid tetracyclic framework is unprecedented in nature. Herein we report the first chemical synthesis of the target structure by employing a series of well-orchestrated , robust transformations , highlighted by an acid-promoted , powerful Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement/Friedel-Crafts cyclization sequence to forge the two adjacent quaternary carbon centers embedded in the tetrahydronaphthalene. A high-yielding ketiminium mediated ( 2 +2)- cycloaddition was also utilized for the simultaneous construction of the remaining three stereocenters.
