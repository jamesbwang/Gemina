 : Carmine is a widely used `` natural '' food additive that has been reported to provoke both an immediate hypersensitivity<disease> and a delayed systemic response with cutaneous expression. Systemic contact dermatitis<disease> describes the hypersensitivity<disease> reaction following systemic re-exposure of the inciting allergen in previously sensitized individuals. In individuals with recalcitrant dermatitis<disease> and a positive carmine intolerance history and/or patch test , it is important to consider a trial topical and dietary elimination of carmine-associated products and foods.
