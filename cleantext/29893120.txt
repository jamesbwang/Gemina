  Here we present a new method that integrates atomic force microscopy ( AFM) with analytical tools such as high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) with diode-array ultraviolet-visible ( UV) absorbance , and mass spectrometry ( MS) along with synthetic chemistry. This allows the detection , identification , and quantification of novel polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH) in complex molecular mixtures. This multidisciplinary methodology is employed to characterize the supercritical pyrolysis products of n-decane , a model fuel. The pyrolysis experiments result in a complex mixture of both unsubstituted as well as highly methylated PAH. We demonstrate the AFM-driven discovery of a novel compound , benz ( l) indeno ( 1,2,3- cd) pyrene , with the chemical structure assignment serving as input for the chemical synthesis of such molecule. The synthesis is verified by AFM , and the synthesized compound is used as a reference standard in analytical measurements , establishing the first-ever unequivocal identification and quantification of this PAH as a fuel product. Moreover , the high-resolution AFM analysis detected several five- to eight-ring PAH , which represents novel fuel pyrolysis and/or combustion products. This work provides a route to develop new analytical standards by symbiotically using AFM , chemical synthesis , and modern analytical tools.
