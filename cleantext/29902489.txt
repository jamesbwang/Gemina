  Numerous proteins require iron‑sulfur ( Fe-S) clusters as cofactors for their function. Their biogenesis is a multi-step process occurring in the cytosol and mitochondria of all eukaryotes and additionally in plastids of photosynthetic eukaryotes. A basic model of Fe-S protein maturation in mitochondria has been obtained based on studies achieved in mammals and yeast , yet some molecular details , especially of the late steps , still require investigation. In particular , the late-acting biogenesis factors in plant mitochondria are poorly understood. In this study , we expressed the factors belonging to NFU , BOLA , SUFA/ISCA and IBA57 families in the respective yeast mutant strains. Expression of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial orthologs was usually sufficient to rescue the growth defects observed on specific media and/or to restore the abundance or activity of the defective Fe-S or lipoic acid-dependent enzymes. These data demonstrate that the plant mitochondrial counterparts , including duplicated isoforms , likely retained their ancestral functions. In contrast , the SUFA1 and IBA57 .2 plastidial isoforms can not rescue the lysine and glutamate auxotrophies of the respective isa1-isa2Δ and iba57Δ strains or of the isa1-isa2-iba57Δ triple mutant when expressed in combination. This suggests a specialization of the yeast mitochondrial and plant plastidial factors in these late steps of Fe-S protein biogenesis , possibly reflecting substrate-specific interactions in these different compartments.
