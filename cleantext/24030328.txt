  The aim of the study was to explore whether and how emerging adults talk about their romantic relationships with their close others , especially their parents and friends , also considering gender differences. Data were collected via eight single-sex focus groups conducted with 50 Italian emerging adults ( aged 18-25) , and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two main themes emerged. The first was labeled `` to seek advice '' , which was divided into three subthemes: `` I look for different points of view , '' `` I treasure other people 's words , '' and `` I listen and then do it my own way. '' The second theme was `` to not seek advice , '' which was divided into two subthemes: `` I do not need comparison '' and `` I need to choose on my own. '' The findings revealed that close friends , more than parents , are important interlocutors for discussions on romantic relationships , and few gender differences were found. Furthermore , we can speculate that emerging adults ' reasons for seeking advice or not could relate to their autonomy and relatedness needs.
