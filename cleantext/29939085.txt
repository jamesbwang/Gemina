  Fifteen million people each year receive post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP) to prevent rabies<pathogen> , yet the disease remains neglected and highly under-reported. Areas covered: In this systematic literature review , we assessed the immunogenicity , efficacy , and safety of a purified chick embryo cell-culture rabies<pathogen> vaccine ( PCECV) for PEP against rabies<pathogen> by intramuscular ( IM) or intradermal ( ID) administration. We performed meta-analyses to compare immunogenicity according to the route of vaccine administration , study population , and PEP regimen , such as number of doses , and concomitant rabies<pathogen> immunoglobulin. Expert commentary: There were 54 estimates of immune responses to vaccination , which showed that in the overall population , after starting PEP with PCECV by the IM or ID route ( ≥ 2.5 IU per dose) , almost all individuals had rabies<pathogen> virus neutralizing antibody ( RVNA) titers above the World Health Organization ( WHO) recommended serological threshold for an adequate immune response to vaccination ( RVNA ≥ 0.5 IU/ml by day 14). In the overall population , PCECV had an acceptable safety profile. However , given that there are 59,000 human rabies<pathogen> deaths reported annually , the challenge is to improve access to PCECV for PEP against human
