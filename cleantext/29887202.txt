  Microcystins/Nodularins ( MCs/NODs) are potent hepatotoxic cyanotoxins produced by harmful algal blooms ( HABs) that occur frequently in the upper basin of the St. Johns River ( SJR) , Jacksonville , FL , USA. Areas downstream of bloom locations provide critical habitat for an estuarine population of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus). Since 2010 , approximately 30 of these dolphins have stranded and died within this impaired watershed; the cause of death was inconclusive for a majority of these individuals. For the current study , environmental exposure to MCs/NODs was investigated as a potential cause of dolphin mortality. Stranded dolphins from 2013 to 2017 were categorized into estuarine ( n = 17) and coastal ( n = 10) populations. Because estuarine dolphins inhabit areas with frequent or recurring cyanoblooms , they were considered as a comparatively high-risk group for cyanotoxin exposure in relation to coastal animals. All available liver samples from estuarine dolphins were tested regardless of stranding date , and samples from coastal individuals that stranded outside of the known cyanotoxin bloom season were assessed as controls. The MMPB ( 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutiric acid) technique was used to determine total ( bound and free) concentrations of MCs/NODS in liver tissues. Free MCs/NODs extractions were conducted and analyzed using ELISA and LC-MS/MS on MMPB-positive samples to compare test results. MMPB testing resulted in low-level total MCs/NODs detection in some specimens. The Adda ELISA produced high test values that were not supported by concurrent LC-MS/MS analyses , indicative of false positives. Our results indicate that both estuarine and coastal dolphins are exposed to MCs/NODs , with potential toxic and immune health impacts.
