  The cerebellum is a brain structure involved in motor and cognitive functions. The development of the cerebellar cortex ( the external part of the cerebellum) is under the control of numerous factors. Among these factors , neuropeptides including PACAP or somatostatin modulate the survival , migration and/or differentiation of cerebellar granule cells. Interestingly , such peptides contributing to cerebellar ontogenesis usually exhibit a specific transient expression profile with a low abundance at birth , a high expression level during the developmental processes , which take place within the first two postnatal weeks in rodents , and a gradual decline toward adulthood. Thus , to identify new peptides transiently expressed in the cerebellum during development , rat cerebella were sampled from birth to adulthood , and analyzed by a semi-quantitative peptidomic approach. A total of 33 peptides were found to be expressed in the cerebellum. Among these 33 peptides , 8 had a clear differential expression pattern during development , 4 of them i.e. cerebellin 2 , nociceptin , somatostatin and VGF ( 353-372) , exhibiting a high expression level during the first two postnatal weeks followed by a significative decrease at adulthood. A focus by a genomic approach on nociceptin , confirmed that its precursor mRNA is transiently expressed during the first week of life in granule neurons within the internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum , and showed that the nociceptin receptor is also actively expressed between P8 and P16 by the same neurons. Finally , functional studies revealed a new role for nociceptin , acting as a neurotrophic peptide able to promote the survival and differentiation of developing cerebellar granule neurons.
