  Deliberative pedagogy encourages productive science communication and learning through engagement and discussion of socio-scientific issues ( SSI). This article examines a two-day deliberation module on gene editing that took place in an introductory nonmajors biology course , furthering research on integrating deliberative discussion into the biology classroom. The results demonstrate the benefits of a single , episodic deliberation in the classroom , which can positively encourage active discussion and critical awareness of connections between biology and real-world issues , thus contributing to the development of scientific citizenship. Additionally , the findings show that gene editing is an apt SSI topic for the deliberative process because it encourages productive communication practices of scientific citizenship , including discussion , perspective taking , questioning , and consideration of different types of evidence when coming to a decision.
