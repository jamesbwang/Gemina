  Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful components , many of which exert toxic effects on reproductive organs , including the ovaries , and their development. In this study , we investigated the effects of cigarette smoke extract ( CSE) on cell proliferation , apoptosis and oxidative stress in the SKOV3 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell lines. A water soluble tetrazolium ( WST) assay revealed that the cell proliferation of both ovarian cells was significantly inhibited by three types of CSE in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that the inhibition of cell proliferation was related to regulation of cell cycle-related protein expression. To determine the effects of cigarette smoke on the death of ovarian cells , we conducted a TUNEL assay , which revealed a time-dependent increase in TUNEL-stained cells in response to CSE exposure. Moreover , the protein expression of the Bcl-2 family signaling pathway observed upon Western blot analysis were consistent with the results of the TUNEL assay. We also examined the reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation in two ovarian cell lines using DCF-DA ( 5 ( 6)- Carboxy-2 ' ,7 '- dichlorofluorescein diacetate) assay and ROS-Glo â„¢ H
