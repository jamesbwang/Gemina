  Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) replication between mosquito and human hosts is hypothesized to be associated with viral determinants that interact in a differential manner between hosts. However , the understanding of inter-host viral determinants that drive DENV<pathogen> replication and growth between hosts is limited. Through the use of clinical isolates , we identified an amino acid variation of Ala , Met and Val at position 116 of DENV-1 NS4B. While the proportion of virus with the NS4B-116V variant remained constantly high in serial passages in a mosquito cell line , populations of the NS4B-116M and NS4B-116A variants became dominant after serial passages in mammalian cell lines. Using recombinant DENV-1 viruses , the Val to Ala or Met alteration at position NS4B-116 ( rDENV-1-NS4B-116A and rDENV-1-NS4B-116M) resulted in enhanced virus growth in human cells in comparison to the clone with Val at NS4B-116 ( rDENV-1-NS4B-116V). However , the reverse phenomenon was observed in a mosquito cell line. Additionally , in a human cell line , differential levels of IFN-α/β and IFN-stimulated gene expressions ( IFIT3 , IFI44L , OAS1) suggested that the enhanced viral growth was dependent on the ability of the NS4B protein to hamper host IFN response during the early phase of infection. Overall , we identified a novel and critical viral determinant at the pTMD3 of NS4B region that displayed differential effects on DENV<pathogen> replication and fitness in human and mosquito cell lines. Taken together , the results suggest the importance of the NS4B protein in virus replication and adaptation between hosts.
