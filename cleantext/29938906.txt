  Anorexia<symptom> nervosa is an eating disorder often associated with intestinal disorders. To explore the underlying mechanisms of these disorders , the colonic proteome was evaluated during activity-based anorexia<symptom> Female C57Bl/6 mice were randomized into three groups: Control , Limited Food Access ( LFA) and Activity-Based Anorexia<symptom> ( ABA). LFA and ABA mice had a progressive limited access to food but only ABA mice had access to an activity wheel. On colonic mucosal protein extracts , a 2D PAGE-based comparative proteomic analysis was then performed and differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Twenty-seven nonredundant proteins that were differentially expressed between Control , LFA , and ABA groups were identified. ABA mice exhibited alteration of several mitochondrial proteins involved in energy metabolism such as dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In addition , a downregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway was observed leading , on the one hand , to the inhibition of protein synthesis , evaluated by puromycin incorporation and mediated by the increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 , and on the other hand , to the activation of autophagy , assessed by the increase of the marker of autophagy , form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate/Cytosolic form of Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 ( LC3II/LC3I) ratio. Colonic mucosal proteome is altered during ABA suggesting a downregulation of energy metabolism. A decrease of protein synthesis and an activation of autophagy were also observed mediated by mTOR pathway.
