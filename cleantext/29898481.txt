  An 11-year-old female Sheltie was presented with inappetence and a progressive increase in abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom>. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large cystic mass in the midabdomen and cystic lesions<symptom> in the right liver lobe and in the caudal pole of the left kidney. Histopathologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a myelolipoma of the spleen , dispersed splenic tissue in the liver and dispersed uterine and salpinx tissues in the kidney. This report describes the clinical , ultrasonographic and computed tomographic features and the results of histopathology. In addition to the abnormally large and cystic myelolipoma of the spleen , the great number of choristomas is remarkable , which has not previously been documented in a dog.
