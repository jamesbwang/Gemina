  Combined nanovaccine can generate robust and persistent antigen-specific immune responses. A combined nanovaccine was developed based on antigen-loaded genipin-cross-linked-polyethyleneimine-antigen nanoparticles and in vivo multispectral fluorescence imaging tracked the antigen delivery of combined nanovaccine. The inner layer antigen nanoparticles carried abundant antigens by self-cross-linking for persistent immune response , whereas the outer antigen on the surface of antigen nanoparticles provided the initial antigen exposure. The delivery of combined nanovaccine was tracked dynamically and objectively by the separation of inner genipin cross-linked antigen nanoparticle and the outer fluorescent antigen. The immune responses of the combined nanovaccine were evaluated including antigen-specific CD4
