  We report the case of a 90-year old woman who presented with septic pulmonary emboli due to suppurative thrombophlebitis at an old peripheral intravenous site. After unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics , the patient was taken to the operating room for excision and drainage of the purulent superficial vein. We review the literature and discuss the presentation , risk factors , treatment options , and complications of this often-overlooked disease entity. Suppurative thrombophlebitis is a rare but morbid disease that requires a high level of clinical suspicion to diagnose.
