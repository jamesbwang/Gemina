  A 3-yr-old spayed female coyote ( Canis<pathogen> latrans) developed clinical signs of exertional myopathy after fighting with a conspecific. A diagnosis of exertional myopathy was made based on physical examination findings , probable myoglobinuria , and elevations in serum creatinine kinase activity , alanine aminotransferase activity , and potassium concentration. Dantrolene , a hydantoin analog , as well as supportive and symptomatic therapies , was used to successfully treat exertional myopathy. This is the first reported use of dantrolene in wildlife or zoo animals.
