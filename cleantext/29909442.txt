  The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the water quality of the Karoon river , which is a main river in Iran country. For this purpose , hydrochemical analyses of a database that maintained by the Water Resources Authority of Khuzestan Province , Iran 's Ministry of Energy , were carried out. These data were compared with the maximum permissible limit values recommended by World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization water standards for drinking and agricultural purposes , respectively. Also in this regard , multiple indices of water quality were utilized. However , not all indices gave similar rankings for water quality. According to the USSL diagram and Kelly ratio , Karoon 's water quality is not suitable for irrigation purposes due to high salinity and moderate alkalinity. However , the results of the magnesium hazard analysis suggested that water quality for irrigation is acceptable. A Piper diagram illustrated that the most dominant water types during the 15 years of the study were Na-Cl and Na-SO
