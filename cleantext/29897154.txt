  To determine the factors associated with discontinuing or not starting oral anticoagulation ( OA) therapy in older patients with non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF). A prospective , multicenter cohort study was carried out of patients aged > 75 years with NVAF hospitalized in internal medicine departments in Spain. For each patient , we recorded creatinine , hemoglobin and platelets levels , as well as CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. We measured the ability to carry out basic activities of daily life with the Barthel Index , and the cognitive state with the Short Portable Mental<symptom> Status<symptom> questionnaire. We included 723 patients with NVAF , with a mean age of 84.8 years ( SD 5.2 years); 390 ( 53.9 %) of the patients were women. Before admission , 375 ( 51.9 %) patients were treated with OA. Previously diagnosed NVAF ( OR 4.099 , 95 % CI 1.824-9.211 , P = 0.001) , the number of errors in the Short Portable Mental<symptom> Status<symptom> questionnaire ( OR 1.180 , 95 % CI 1.020-1.365 , P = 0.026) , peripheral arterial disease ( OR 0.285 , 95 % CI 0.114-0.711 , P = 0.007) and hemoglobin levels ( OR 0.812 , 95 % CI 0.682-0.966 , P = 0.019) were independently associated with not starting OA therapy at discharge. Of the 375 patients treated with OA at admission , 87 ( 23.2 %) had their OA discontinued at discharge. The HAS-BLED score ( OR 1.516 , 95 % CI 1.211-1.897 , P < 0.001) and previous acute myocardial infarction ( OR 0.327 , 95 % CI 0.121-0.883 , P = 0.027) were associated with the discontinuation of OA. There are factors associated with discontinuing or not starting OA in older patients with NVAF , which often have no clinical justification. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; • •: • •- • •.
