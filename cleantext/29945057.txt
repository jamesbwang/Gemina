  Evaluate possible association between BPE and breast cancer tumor type/prognostic markers. IRB approved retrospective study from 1/2010- 1/2014 identified 328 patients who had breast MRI and available clinical/pathology data. BPE was categorized according to BI-RADS. The association between BPE and breast cancer molecular subtype/prognostic factors was evaluated. No significant association was present between high BPE and the following: HER2 + tumors , basal tumors , tumors with axillary nodal disease , high nuclear grade tumors , high Ki-67 index tumors or larger tumors. Patients with high BPE may be at increased risk for breast cancer but not necessarily for those cancer subtypes with a poor prognosis.
