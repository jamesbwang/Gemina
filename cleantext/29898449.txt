  A meta-analysis was performed to determine the likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis suppression following short-term cutaneous treatment of atopic dermatitis<disease> with topical corticosteroids ( TCS) in pediatric patients. All published pediatric clinical trials evaluating TCS use with pre- and post-treatment HPA axis assessment by cosyntropin stimulation testing were included. Of 128 eligible trials , 12 were selected for meta-analysis with a total of 522 participants. There were 20 observed cases of HPA axis suppression ( 3.8 % , 95 % CI 2.4-5.8). The percentage of HPA axis suppression with low- ( classes 6-7) , medium- ( classes 3-5) and high-potency ( classes 1-2) TCS use was 2 % ( 3 of 148 patients , 95 % CI 0.7-5.8) , 3.1 % ( 7 of 223 patients , 95 % CI 1.5-6.3) , and 6.6 % ( 10 of 151 patients , 95 % CI 3.6-11.8) , respectively. There is a low rate of reversible HPA axis suppression with the use of mid- to low-potency TCS compared to more potent formulations. In pediatric clinical practice , the limited use of mid- to low-potency TCS is rarely associated with clinically significant adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis. In the absence of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency , there is little need to test the HPA axis of these patients.
