  Portal images have a unique feature among the imaging modalities used in radiotherapy: they provide direct visualization of the irradiated volumes. However , contrast and spatial resolution are strongly limited due to the high energy of the radiation sources. Because of this , imaging modalities using x-ray energy beams have gained importance in the verification of patient positioning , replacing portal imaging. The purpose of this work was to develop a method for the enhancement of local contrast in portal images. The method operates in the sub-bands of a wavelet decomposition of the image , re-scaling them in such a way that coefficients in the high and medium resolution sub-bands are amplified-an approach totally different from those operating on the image histogram , widely used nowadays. Portal images of an anthropomorphic phantom were acquired in an electronic portal imaging device. Then , different re-scaling strategies were investigated , studying the effects of the scaling parameters on the enhanced images. Also , the effect of using different types of transform was studied. Finally , the implemented methods were combined with histogram equalization methods like the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization , and these combinations were compared. Uniform amplification of the detail sub-bands shows the best results in contrast enhancement. On the other hand , linear re-escalation of the high resolution sub-bands increases the visibility of fine detail in the images , at the expense of an increase in noise levels. Also , since processing is applied only to detail sub-bands , not to the approximation , the mean gray level of the image is minimally modified and no further display adjustments are required. It is shown that re-escalation of the detail sub-bands of portal images can be used as an efficient method for the enhancement of both the local contrast and the resolution of these images.
