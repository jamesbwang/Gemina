  For high-water content hydrogels in compression , the water inside of hydrogels contributes to the response of hydrogels to external loads directly , but part of the water is expelled from hydrogels in the meantime to change the volume of the hydrogel and reduce the contribution. In order to consider the contribution of the water in the constitution equation , PVA ( polyvinyl alcohol) hydrogels with high-water content were used as examples , and compressive experiments were carried out to measure both the stress-strain relation and the change of the volume in the meantime. By considering the effect of the difference of the contribution of water in different directions of the hydrogel , we deduced a new constitutive equation , which can pretty well depict the stress-strain of hydrogels with different water contents. The results showed that the contribution of water to the total stress increases with the compression strain and even exceed that of the polymer , although the expelled water reduces the contribution at the early loading stage , which well explains the difference of elastic moduli of hydrogels in compression and tension.
