  Chinese Gaofen-3 ( GF-3) , a vital satellite for high-resolution earth observation , was the first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) launched in China with a resolution of up to one meter. Polarimetric SAR can obtain the complete physical scattering mechanisms of targets , thereby having the potential to differentiate objects. In this paper , several classification methods are briefly summarized and the types of features that should be chosen during classification are discussed. A pre-classification step is introduced to reduce the workload of precise labeling. The Random Forest<disease> classifier , which performs well for many other classification tasks , is used for the initial land cover classification. Then , based on a polarimetric constant false-alarm rate ( CFAR) edge detector , a fast super-pixel generation method for polarimetric SAR image is proposed , which does not require the adjustment of parameters in advance. Following that , majority vote is conducted on the initial classification result based on the super-pixels , so that the classification result can be optimized to better meet the mapping requirements. The experimental results based on GF-3 polarimetric SAR data verify the effectiveness of proposed procedure and demonstrate that GF-3 data has excellent performance in land cover classification.
