  Chimerism occurs naturaly throughout gestation and can also occur as a consequence of transfusion and transplantation therapy. It consists of the acquisition and long-term persistence of a genetically distinct population of allogenic cells inside another organism. Previous reports have suggested that feto-maternal microchimerism could exert a beneficial effect on the treatment of hematological and solid tumors in patients treated by PBSCT. In this review we report the mechanism of transplacental fetal stem cell trafficking during pregnancy and the effect of their long-term persistence on autoimmunity , GVHD , PBSCT , cancer and stem cell treatment.
