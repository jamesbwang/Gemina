  Capturing and incorporating patient-centered factors into 30-day readmission risk prediction after hospitalized heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) could improve the modest performance of current models. Using a mixed-methods approach , we developed a patient-centered survey and evaluated the additional predictive utility of the survey compared to a traditional readmission risk model ( the Krumholz et al. model). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic quantified the performance of both models. We measured the amount of model improvement with the addition of patient-centered factors to the Krumholz et al. model with the integrated discrimination improvement ( IDI). In an exploratory analysis , we used hierarchical clustering algorithms to identify groups with similar survey responses and tested for differences between clusters using standard descriptive statistics. From 3/24/2014 to 3/12/2015 , 183 patients hospitalized with HF were enrolled from an urban , academic health system and followed for 30days after discharge. The Krumholz et al. plus patient-centered factors model had similar-to-slightly lower performance ( AUC ( 95 % CI): 0.62 ( 0.52 , 0.71); goodness-of-fit P = .10) than the Krumholz et al. model ( AUC ( 95 % CI): 0.66 ( 0.57 , 0.76); goodness-of-fit P = .19). The IDI ( 95 % CI) was 0.003 ( -0.014,0.020). We identified three patient clusters based on patient-centered survey responses. The clusters differed with respect to gender , self-rated health , employment status , and prior hospitalization frequency ( all P < .05). The addition of patient-centered factors did not improve 30-day readmission model performance. Rather than designing interventions based on predicted readmission risk , tailoring interventions to all patients , based on their characteristics , could inform the design of targeted , readmission reduction strategies.
