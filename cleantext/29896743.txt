  To investigate effects of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms on serum lipid and apopoprotein levels in healthy normolipidemic and endogenous hypertriglyceridemic subjects. Two hundred and thirty-seven healthy normolipidemic and 102 endogenous hypertriglyceridemic subjects from a population of Chinese Han nationality in Chengdu area were studied using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). Serum lipids were measured by enzymatic kits and apolipoproteins AⅠ , AⅡ , B100 , CⅡ , CⅢ and E were measured by the RID kits. The non-null and null genotype frequencies for GSTM1 site were 39.2 % and 60.8 % in the control group , respectively , and 47.6 % and 52.4 % in the HTG group , respectively. The non-null and null genotype frequencies for GSTT1 site were 51.5 % and 48.5 % in the control group , respectively , and 57.3 % and 42.7 % in the HTG group , respectively. The GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype frequencies in HTG subjects were not different from those in the controls , respectively ( P > 0.05). However , in control group subjects with both null genotypes ( GSTT1- and GSTM1-) showed the lowest plasma HDL-C levels ( 1.29 ± 0.30 mmol/L) , whereas those with each of the other three genotype combinations showed relatively higher HDL-C levels. There was significant difference of HDL-C levels between subjects with GSTT1-/ GSTM1-and those with GSTT1 +/ GSTM1- ( P < 0.05). Similar result was not observed in HTG group. No significant changes of lipid and lipoprotein levels were observed in either GSTM1 or GSTT1 polymorphism alone in control or HTG group. The present study provides an evidence that the presence of double deletion genotypes is associated with low HDL-cholesterol levels in normal Chinese subjects. However , these polymorphisms are not associated with lipid levels in endogenous hypertriglyceridemia in Chinese population of Chengdu area.
