  The aetiology of femoral trochlear dysplasia is unknown. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe trochlear development in a newborn population during the first six years of life. In an earlier study , the femoral trochlea was examined by ultrasound in 174 newborns. A dysplastic trochlea was defined with a sulcus angle ( SA) above 159 °. Two groups were defined , one group of 15 knees with SA > 159 ° ( dysplastic group) , and one group of 101 knees with SA < 159 ° ( non-dysplastic group). In the present follow-up study , the children were further examined at six , 18 and 72 months. There was a statistically significant difference in the SA between the dysplastic and the non-dysplastic group at all follow-ups ( p < 0.001). A small but statistically significant change in the SA between 0 to 72 months was detected for the dysplastic knees ( p = 0.032) and for the controls ( p < 0.001). Only minor changes in the anatomy of the femoral trochlea from newborn to age six years were found. A dysplastic trochlea at birth remains shallow and the anatomy does not change from normal to dysplastic during the same time span. II.
