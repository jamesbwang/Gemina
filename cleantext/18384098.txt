  As the major active component of turmeric ( Curcuma longa) , curcumin is widely used as a spice and food coloring agent , and also possesses multiple biological activities and therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases. To answer the paradox between curcumin 's biological activities and poor systemic bioavailability , we proposed that degradation products of curcumin may make important contributions to its biological activities , which needs to be verified. In addition , curcumin is usually heated or boiled used as a spice , it is necessary to explore whether boiled curcumin , which degrades readily , is still biologically active. Thus , in the present study we investigated the protective effects of curcumin and boiled curcumin mixture on H2O2-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells , a widely used model for neurons. Results showed that in spite of high degradation rates , boiled curcumin mixture still possessed similar protective activities like parent curcumin , and could effectively rescue PC12 cells against H2O2-induced damage , via decreasing production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde , reducing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities. Moreover , curcumin 's degradation products including ferulic acid , vanillin and vanillic acid could also improve PC12 cells survival rate. Our findings indicated that boiled curcumin mixtures still possessed protective activity for PC12 cells , and supported the contribution of degradation products to biological activities of curcumin.
