  Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( ES/PNET) typically occurs in long or flat bones , soft tissues , or less often , solid organs. Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor arising from the adrenal gland is extremely rare , especially in children , and only limited cases are reported previously. Herein , we review a case of a 22-month-old girl who presented to our department with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , bulging of the left flank , and a nonfunctioning adrenal lesion<symptom> which was found to be an adrenal ES/PNET. The patient was successfully treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Since delayed diagnosis may result in metastatic lesions<symptom> , this case underscores the importance of considering ES/PNET in the differential diagnosis of large adrenal masses.
