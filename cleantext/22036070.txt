  The commonest site of primary dissection involving the visceral vessels is renal arteries; however , spontaneous bilateral renal artery dissection is an extremely rare entity. Spontaneous renal artery dissection ( SRAD) is rarely a cause of renovascular hypertension. Segmental arterial mediolysis is a rare arteriopathy of unknown etiology which is a nonatherosclerotic and noninflammatory condition. We report a case of a 51-year-old male patient with spontaneous dissection of bilateral renal arteries with clinical , laboratory , and angiographic findings consistent with segmental artery mediolysis. Early diagnosis and treatment of this condition will decrease morbidity and mortality.
