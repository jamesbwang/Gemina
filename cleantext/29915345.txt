  Marine plankton populate 70 % of Earth 's surface , providing the energy that fuels ocean food webs and contributing to global biogeochemical cycles. Plankton communities are extremely diverse and geographically variable , and are overwhelmingly composed of low-abundance species. The role of this rare biosphere and its ecological underpinnings are however still unclear. Here , we analyse the extensive dataset generated by the Tara Oceans expedition for marine microbial eukaryotes ( protists) and use an adaptive algorithm to explore how metabarcoding-based abundance distributions vary across plankton communities in the global ocean. We show that the decay in abundance of non-dominant operational taxonomic units , which comprise over 99 % of local richness , is commonly governed by a power-law. Despite the high spatial turnover in species composition , the power-law exponent varies by less than 10 % across locations and shows no biogeographical signature , but is weakly modulated by cell size. Such striking regularity suggests that the assembly of plankton communities in the dynamic and highly variable ocean environment is governed by large-scale ubiquitous processes. Understanding their origin and impact on plankton ecology will be important for evaluating the resilience of marine biodiversity in a changing ocean.
