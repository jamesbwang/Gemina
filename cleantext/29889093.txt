  The limited amount of information available on Asian Americans with different types of disability in vocational rehabilitation ( VR) system has been a major obstacle to developing appropriate policies and practices. Using the Rehabilitation Service Administration data ( RSA-911) , this study investigated the associations between demographic characteristics , VR service patterns , and employment outcomes of Asian Americans. Whether the relationships differed by type of disabilities ( i.e. , sensory/communicative , physical , cognitive , and psychiatric disabilities) among Asian Americans was also examined. A series of chi-squared tests , one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) , and logistic regression were conducted to examine the associations and differences among demographic characteristics , service patterns , and employment outcomes across four major disability groups. Each disability group showed different service patterns that indicate unique consumer needs , individualized services and supports to be delivered in a culturally sensitive manner. Along with the demographic profiles of Asian Americans , factors significantly associated with competitive employment in each group were identified. This explorative study 's finding implies VR practitioners ' need to understand individual needs by disability type as well as characteristics of Asian culture , and need to develop and implement effective strategies and services to assist this population.
