  Over the years of rigorous of military service , military personnel may experience cervical spondylosis and radiculopathy. Given the frequency of this occurrence , the capacity to return to unrestricted full duty in the military after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF) is worthy of analysis. To identify the rate of return to full , unrestricted active duty after single and 2-level anterior cervical discectomy , and fusion surgery in military personnel. A retrospective chart review was performed at a tertiary care military treatment facility for all active duty personnel who underwent a single or 2-level ACDF over a 4-yr period. Patient and procedural data were collected to include single or 2-level fusion , indication for surgery , fusion level , tobacco use , age , and military rank. Fischer 's Exact and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to identify statistically significant differences in the rate of return to active duty. A total of 132 anterior cervical discectomy and fusions were analyzed. One hundred sixteen patients ( 88 %) were able to return to unrestricted full active duty , while the remaining 16 required separation from the military for continued pain or disability. The return to active duty rate was significantly higher in service members with a rank of E7 or above ( 99 %) than those E6 and below ( 73 %). There was a strong association between the presence of a pseudoarthrosis and the capacity to return to full duty ( P = .013). Both single and 2-level ACDFs have high overall success with an 88 % rate of return to full duty.
