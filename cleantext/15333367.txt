  In forensic clinical anatomy computed tomography ( CT) is used in post-mortem radiological investigation as an objective nondestructive documentation of the body surface and of the interior of the body. This technique is applied also in paleopathology , in particular in mummy studies , with the aim of providing a permanent record of the mummy 's features , investigating the embalming procedure employed and analyzing the extent of the preservation in detail. For the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy , the mortal remains of Saint Leopold Mandic and Saint Pio da Pietralcina , as examples of Mercy known by everyone , have been brought to Rome in February 2016. During the survey that preceded the preparation for transport to Rome , a whole-body CT was performed on the mummified corpse of Leopold Mandic , Capuchin Saint of Padova , Italy. The CT examination demonstrated the presence of osteoarthritis at the level of the vertebral column , of the left knee and of the left hand. Moreover , CT showed the preservation of skeleton and partial preservation of the some viscera , such as remnants of the brain , heart , oesophagus , urinary bladder , plexuses and spinal nerves , ear ossicles , major arterial vessels ( aorta and carotid arteries). It is to emphasize the fact that Saint Leopold was not subjected before the CT to any conservative treatment. Computed tomography demonstrated to be a non-destructive method to investigate Saint Leopold , in order to maintain the integrity of the body and to acquire data on his pathologies and on his preservation. CT allows not only the acquisition of sectional images but also , thanks to dedicated software , the post-processing and reconstruction of three-dimensional models , that can be used also for public displays.
