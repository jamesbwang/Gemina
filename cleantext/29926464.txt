  Tissue engineering has the potential to overcome the limitations of tracheal reconstruction. To tissue-engineer a tracheal cartilage , auricular chondrocytes were encapsulated in a photocurable poly ( ethylene glycol)/ poly ( Îµ-caprolactone) ( PEG/PCL) hydrogel. Chondrogenic genes , including Sox9 , Acan and Col2a1 , were up-regulated in auricular chondrocytes after 2 weeks of in vitro cultivation in the PEG/PCL hydrogel. Co-cultivation of 70 % auricular chondrocytes and 30 % bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) accelerated the chondrogenic genes ' expression in the PEG/PCL hydrogel. Cartilaginous matrix markers , including proteoglycans and collagen type II , were detected in the chondrocytes-encapsulated PEG/PCL hydrogel after 4 weeks of in vitro cultivation. The higher expression level of cartilaginous matrix markers was observed in the PEG/PCL hydrogel with co-cultivation of 70 % chondrocytes and 30 % BMSCs. After 4 weeks of ectopic cultivation in rabbits , the cylindrical PEG/PCL structure was sustained with the use of a luminal silicon stent. However , without the stent , the construct collapsed under a compression force. No fibrosis<disease> or vessel ingrowth were found in the PEG/PCL hydrogel after 4 weeks of ectopic cultivation , whereas the auricular chondrocytes showed proteoglycans ' accumulation and collagen type II production. Rabbit auricular chondrocytes could survive and retain chondrogenic ability in the PEG/PCL hydrogel under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. While the PEG/PCL hydrogel did not show sufficient mechanical properties for supporting the cylindrical shape of the construct , the high chondrogenesis level of chondrocytes in the PEG/PCL hydrogel displayed the potential of this material for tracheal tissue engineering.
