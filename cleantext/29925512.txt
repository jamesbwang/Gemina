  To describe the genetic characteristics of the cohort enrolled in the international multicentre progression of Stargardt disease 1 ( STGD1) studies ( ProgStar) and to determine geographic differences based on the allele frequency. 345 participants with a clinical diagnosis of STGD1 and harbouring at least one disease-causing ABCA4 variant were enrolled from 9 centres in the USA and Europe. All variants were reviewed and 211 likely pathogenic variants were identified in the total cohort , including missense ( 63 %) , splice site alteration ( 18 %) , stop ( 9 %) and others. 50 variants were novel. Exclusively missense variants were detected in 139 ( 50 %) of 279 patients with multiple pathogenic variants. The three most prevalent variants of these patients with multiple pathogenic variants were p.G1961E ( 15 %) , p.G863A ( 7 %) and c.5461-10 T > C ( 5 %). Subgroup analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the four recruiting nations in the allele frequency of nine variants. There is a large spectrum of ABCA4 sequence variants , including 50 novel variants , in a well-characterised cohort thereby further adding to the unique allelic heterogeneity in STGD1. Approximately half of the cohort harbours missense variants only , indicating a relatively mild phenotype of the ProgStar cohort. There are significant differences in allele frequencies between nations , although the three most prevalent variants are shared as frequent variants.
