  Imago dispersal by the West<disease> Indian drywood termite , Cryptotermes brevis ( Walker) ( Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) potentially initiates or expands structural infestations by the establishment of incipient colonies. The prevention of drywood termite colonization in structures is difficult , but a substantial reduction may be obtainable. In this experiment , seasonal dispersal of C. brevis imagos commenced from infested wood in a laboratory building. A bioassay was developed to determine the efficacy of 100 , 50 , and 10 % label rate applications of a borate ( Tim-Bor) and silica ( CimeXa) dust or solution against C. brevis colony establishment under these simulated field conditions. All treatments prevented colony establishment at label rate applications , whereas Tim-bor significantly reduced colonization at all exposure rates.
