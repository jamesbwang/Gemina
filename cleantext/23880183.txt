  This paper proposes a novel non-invasive method for assessing the vascular endothelial function of lower-limb arteries based on the dilation rate of air-cuff plethysmograms measured using the oscillometric approach. The principle of evaluating vascular endothelial function involves flow-mediated dilation. In the study conducted , blood flow in the dorsal pedis<disease> artery was first monitored while lower-limb cuff pressure was applied using the proposed system. The results showed blood flow was interrupted when the level of pressure was at least 50 mmHg higher than the subject 's lower-limb systolic arterial pressure and that blood flow velocity increased after cuff release. Next , values of the proposed index , % ezFMD
