  Venom-gland transcriptomics is a key tool in the study of the evolution , ecology , function , and pharmacology of animal venoms. In particular , gene-expression variation and coding sequences gained through transcriptomics provide key information for explaining functional venom variation over both ecological and evolutionary timescales. The accuracy and usefulness of inferences made through transcriptomics , however , is limited by the accuracy of the transcriptome assembly , which is a bioinformatic problem with several possible solutions. Several methods have been employed to assemble venom-gland transcriptomes , with the Trinity assembler being the most commonly applied among them. Although previous evidence of variation in performance among assembly software exists , particularly regarding recovery of difficult-to-assemble multigene families such as snake venom metalloproteinases , much work to date still employs a single assembly method. We evaluated the performance of several commonly used de novo assembly methods for the recovery of both nontoxin transcripts and complete , high-quality venom-gene transcripts across eleven snake and four scorpion transcriptomes. We varied
