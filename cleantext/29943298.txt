  Since the discovery of mouse hybridoma technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 , significant progress has been made in monoclonal antibody production. Advances in B cell immortalization and phage display technologies have generated a myriad of valuable monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis and treatment. Technological breakthroughs in various fields of ` omics have shed crucial insights into cellular heterogeneity of a biological system in which the functional individuality of a single cell must be considered. Based on this important concept , remarkable discoveries in single-cell analysis have made in identifying and isolating functional B cells that produce beneficial therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. In this review , we will discuss three traditional methods of antibody discovery. Recent technological platforms for single-cell antibody discovery will be reviewed. We will discuss the application of the single-cell analysis in finding therapeutic antibodies for human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> and emerging Zika arbovirus.
