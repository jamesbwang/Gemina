  The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of reentry programs designed to reduce recidivism and ensure successful reintegration among adult , male offenders. Studies were included if they ( a) evaluated a reentry program incorporating elements dealing with the transition from prison to community for adult , male offenders; ( b) utilized a randomized controlled design; and ( c) measured recidivism as a primary outcome. In addition , secondary outcomes measures of reintegration were also included. The systematic search of 8,179 titles revealed nine randomized controlled evaluations that fulfilled eligibility criteria. The random-effects meta-analysis for rearrest revealed a statistically nonsignificant effect favoring the intervention ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.89 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( 0.74 , 1.07)). Similar results were found for reconviction ( OR = 0.94 , 95 % CI ( 0.77 , 1.12)) and reincarceration ( OR = 0.90 , 95 % CI ( 0.78 , 1.05)). Studies reported mixed results of secondary outcomes of reintegration. The results of this review reflect the variability of findings on reducing recidivism. The challenges faced in conducting this review highlight a need for further research and theory development around reentry programs.
