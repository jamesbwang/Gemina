  Advances in direct acting anti-viral treatment of HCV have reinvigorated public health initiatives aimed at identifying affected individuals. We evaluated the possible impact of only diagnosed and linked-to-care individuals on overall HCV burden estimates and identified a possible strategy to achieve the WHO targets by 2030. Using a modelling approach grounded in Italian real-life data of diagnosed and treated patients , different linkage-to-care scenarios were built to evaluate potential strategies in achieving the HCV elimination goals. Under the 40 % linked-to-care scenario , viremic burden would decline ( 60 %); however eligible patients to treat will be depleted by 2025. Increased case finding through a targeted screening strategy in 1948-1978 birth cohorts could supplement the pool of diagnosed patients by finding 75 % of F0-F3 cases. Under the 60 % linked-to-care scenario , viremic infections would decline by 70 % by 2030 but the patients eligible for treatment will run out by 2028. If treatment is to be maintained , a screening strategy focusing on 1958-1978 birth cohorts could capture 55 % of F0-F3 individuals. Under the 80 % linked-to-care scenario , screening limited in 1968-1978 birth cohorts could sustain treatment at levels required to achieve the HCV elimination goals. In Italy , which is an HCV endemic country , the eligible pool of patients to treat will run out between 2025 and 2028. To maintain the treatment rate and achieve the HCV elimination goals , increased case finding in targeted , high prevalence groups is required. This article is protected by copyright.
