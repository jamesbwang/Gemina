  Mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. The objective of our study is to identify the mechanisms of renal mitochondrial oxidative stress , focusing on Sirt3 , which is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD Renal mitochondrial oxidative stress and Sirt3 activity , using Zucker diabetic fatty rats ( ZDFRs) and cultured proximal tubular cells under high-glucose condition were evaluated. At 28 weeks of age , ZDFRs exhibited the increased urinary albumin/liver-type fatty acid-binding protein ( L-FABP)/ 8-hydroxy-2 '- deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG) excretion , histological tubular cell damage , compared to non-diabetic Zucker Lean rats. In renal mitochondria , acetylated isocitrate dehydrogenase2 ( IDH2) and superoxide dismutase2 ( SOD2) , accompanied with mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial morphologic alterations , were increased in ZDFRs , indicating inactivation of Sirt3. Additionally , expression of the NAD-degrading enzyme , CD38 , was increased , and the NAD Enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney was mediated by the reduction of Sirt3 activity. CD38 overexpression may be related to a reduction in the NAD
