  Non-thermal plasma treatment could increase the bond strength of resin cements to zirconia , but studies are lacking. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate zirconia bond strength , surface roughness , and contact angle and to measure the infrared spectrum after different surface treatments. Yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ( Y-TZP; n = 9) blocks were sectioned into 36 slices ( 12 × 11 × 3 mm) and divided ( n = 4) into surface treatment groups as follows: 2 control groups , consisting of airborne-particle abrasion plus primer ( APP) and 10 % hydrofluoric acid etching plus primer ( HFP) , and 3 experimental groups consisting of a nonthermal plasma ( NP) application; a nonthermal plasma plus primer application ( NPP); and a 10 % hydrofluoric acid etching plus nonthermal plasma plus primer ( HFNPP) application. Each zirconia disk was cemented to a prepolymerized resin block. After cementation , the specimens were sectioned for microtensile strength testing and for surface roughness analysis and contact angle analysis. Results were submitted to analysis of variance and Tukey tests ( α = .05). Results showed no statistically significant differences between the APP and HFNPP groups , but these 2 groups showed statistically better bonding than those of HFP , NP , and NPP. Airborne-particle abrasion resulted in a significant increase in surface roughness compared with the other groups. After nonthermal plasma treatment , the contact angle of the zirconia surface decreased within 48 hours. Nonthermal plasma application for surface treatment of zirconia showed no significant difference in bond strength when compared with airborne-particle abrasion.
