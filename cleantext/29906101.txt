  The preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is responsible for the motor impairment associated with Parkinson 's disease. Dopamine is a highly reactive molecule , which is usually stored inside synaptic vesicles where it is stabilized by the ambient low pH. However , free cytosolic dopamine can auto-oxidize , generating reactive oxygen species , and lead to the formation of toxic quinones. In the present work , we have analyzed the mechanisms through which the dysfunction of dopamine homeostasis could induce cell toxicity , by focusing in particular on the damage induced by dopamine oxidation products at the mitochondrial level. Our results indicate that dopamine derivatives affect mitochondrial morphology and induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization , leading to a reduction of ATP synthesis. Moreover , our results suggest that opening of the mitochondrial transition pore induced by dopamine-derived quinones may contribute to the specific Parkinson 's disease-associated vulnerability of dopamine containing neurons.
