  To investigate the effect of exercise intervention on the relationship between KCNJ11 gene polymorphism and glycolipid metabolism in pre-diabetic population. From January 2017 to March 2017 , 5 communities were selected by stratified cluster random sampling method in Liaocheng City , Shandong Province , and 46 cases of pre-diabetes ` data were collected through public welfare physical examination activities. The exercise intervention was performed for 8 weeks with their consent and cooperation. The polymorphism of KCNJ11 gene and the index of glucose and lipid metabolism were detected before and after exercise intervention , and the correlation between them was also discussed. After 8 weeks of exercise intervention , 2 h postprandial blood glucose , fasting glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin and four indicators of blood lipids were significantly improved in pre-diabetes populations ( P < 0. 05). KCNJ11 gene polymorphism analysis showed that the TG , TC and HDL-C lipid metabolism indexes of CC genotype in rs5219 locus were more significant than those of TT and CT genotypes ( t = 2. 635 , 3. 213 and 2. 048 , P = 0. 012 , 0. 003 and 0. 048) after exercise intervention , the changes of FPG and HbA lc glucose metabolism indexes in GG genotype population of rs2285676 locus were more significant than those in AA and AG genotypes ( t = 2. 236 and 2. 062 , P = 0. 034 and 0. 049). The CC genotype of the KCNJ11 gene rs5219 site and the GG genotype of rs2285676 site can be used as the dominant gene to evaluate the change of glucose lipid metabolism in the early stage of diabetes intervention.
