  The endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor , the unfolded protein response ( UPR) , regulates intracellular protein homeostasis. While transient activation of the reactive UPR by unfolded protein is protective , prolonged and sustained activation of the reactive UPR triggers CHOP-mediated apoptosis. In the recently characterized , evolutionarily conserved anticipatory UPR , mitogenic hormones and other effectors pre-activate the UPR; how strong and sustained activation of the anticipatory UPR induces cell death was unknown. To characterize this cell death pathway , we used BHPI , a small molecule that activates the anticipatory UPR through estrogen receptor α ( ERα) and induces death of ERα
