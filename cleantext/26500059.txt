  Tumor formation is a multistep process during which cells acquire genetic and epigenetic changes until they reach a fully transformed state. We show that CDK6 contributes to tumor formation by regulating transcriptional responses in a stage-specific manner. In early stages , the CDK6 kinase induces a complex transcriptional program to block p53 in hematopoietic cells. Cells lacking CDK6 kinase function are required to mutate
