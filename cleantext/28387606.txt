  Over the years , pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives have been recognized as having antimicrobial activities. Recently , we reported different synthetic methods to prepare pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as anticancer and antimicrobial agents. The studies showed that our previously reported 5-aminopyrazoles The objective of this study was to describe the direct new method for preparation of novel pyrazolo ( 1,5- Pyrazolo ( 1,5- The structures of the new compounds were characterized according to their mass spectroscopy , About twenty two novel pyrazolo ( 1,5-
