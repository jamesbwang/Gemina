  The combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia ( osteosarcopenia) defines a diagnostic subset of individuals at higher risk of falls , fractures and institutionalization. In this study we aimed to assess the potential role of high serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH) in osteosarcopenia. We hypothesized that a high PTH level is one of the major determinants of this syndrome<disease>. Cross-sectional study in 400 subjects ( mean age = 79 , 65 % women) assessed between 2009 and 2014 at the Falls and Fractures Clinic , Nepean Hospital ( Penrith , Australia). Medical history , physical examination , bone densitometry , body composition , posturography , grip strength , gait parameters , and blood tests for nutrition and secondary causes of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Patients were assigned to one of four groups: 1) osteopenic/osteoporotic; 2) sarcopenic; 3) osteosarcopenic; or 4) non-sarcopenic/non-osteopenic. Patients with abnormal corrected calcium levels were excluded from analysis. Between-group differences were assessed using one-way analysis of variance and chi-squared tests. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between the groups and PTH levels adjusted for age , vitamin D , renal function and albumin. 24 % of the subjects had a high serum PTH level with normal corrected calcium level. These subjects were older , reported more falls per year , and had lower grip strength , limits of stability , BMD , and gait velocity. Subjects with high PTH levels were more likely to be in the osteosarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenic/non-osteopenic group ( OR 6.88; CI: 1.9-9.2). We reported an independent association between high PTH levels and osteosarcopenia. Our results suggest an important role of PTH in osteosarcopenia that deserves further exploration.
