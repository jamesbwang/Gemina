  Complete stereocontrol on the transition-metal-free hydroboration of the distal double bond of allenamides can be achieved when allenamides contain acyl substituents , providing exclusively the Z-isomer. The consecutive Pd-catalyzed cross coupling reaction allowed the straightforward formation of tri-substituted enamides , with total control on the stereoselectivity.
