  We derive a theoretical expression of the second harmonic scattering signal in diluted electrolytes compared with bulk water. We show that the enhancement of the signal with respect to pure water observed recently for electrolytes at very low dilution in the micromolar range is a mere manifestation of the Debye screening that makes the infinite-range dipole-dipole solvent correlations in 1/ r
