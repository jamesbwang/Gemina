  In the present study , thermogravimetric analysis of Musa balbisiana flower petal was carried out to study the degradation behaviour and the kinetics in the pyrolytic reaction. The pyrolysis was carried out in the temperature range of 35-900 °C at different heating rates of 5 , 10 and 20 °C/ min. The kinetics was investigated using different models like Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose ( KAS) , Flynn-Ozawa-Wall ( FOW) , Friedman and Broido 's plot. The average E
