J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purpose of the present review is to provide a quantification of the specific game 's activities performed by elite water polo players and a comprehensive overview of the physiological requirements reflecting physical and tactical on-court demands in water polo. Game analysis demonstrates that various swimming movements occur throughout a match play , although approximately 50 % of these are recorded in horizontal body position. The various offensive and defensive tactical actions transiently modify the playing intensity , which overall corresponds to the players ' lactate threshold. Even play corresponds to 60 % of total game actions , whereas the respective percentage of power-play and counterattacks may exceed 30 %. The ability to perform high-intensity activities with short recovery periods is critical for water polo players. Elite water polo players present a high level of aerobic power and endurance as indicated by their maximal oxygen uptake and speed at the lactate threshold. Depending on the positional roles , outfield players are characterized as centers or peripherals. The overall physiological load seems to be similar between players at various positions , despite that centers execute more dynamic body contacts , whereas peripherals more swimming bouts. Despite limitations concerning the experimental setting , the current findings indicate that the incidence of fatigue<symptom> deteriorates playing intensity and performance. Nonetheless , data from the reviewed studies should be cautiously interpreted because in some of the studies , players ' substitutions were not allowed. A high conditioning level is essential for water polo , as it is associated with superior technical and tactical efficacy and lower decline of physical or technical performance within the game.
