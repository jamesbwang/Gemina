  Although curcumin was widely applied as a functional food for different diseases , it was found to reduce serum testosterone level and fertility in male animals by unknown molecular mechanisms. Here in our study , we investigated the possible mechanisms of curcumin-suppressed testosterone production in Leydig cells. Our enzyme immunoassay results showed that curcumin cell-autonomously suppressed ovine luteinizing hormone-stimulated testosterone production in primary Leydig cells and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( 8-br-cAMP)- induced progesterone production in MA-10 cells. Furthermore , our real-time PCR , Western blot , and 22R-OHC/pregnenolone supplementing experiment data demonstrated that curcumin suppressed 8-br-cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in Leydig cells by inhibiting the expression of StAR and Cyp11a1. Interestingly , our Western blot data showed that although curcumin suppressed PKA activity , it did not alter the 8-br-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB. On the contrary , the real-time PCR results showed that curcumin suppressed 8-br-cAMP-induced expression of Nr5a1 and Fos , which are crucial for cAMP-stimulated StAR and Cyp11a1 expression in Leydig cells. Collectively , our data demonstrated that curcumin may suppress cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells by down-regulating Nr5a1/Fos-controlled StAR and Cyp11a1 expression independently of the PKA-CREB signaling pathway.
