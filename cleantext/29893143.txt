  The impact of a hands-on foods course on undergraduate students ' food skills was examined at the University of Guelph. For a convenience sample , first- and second-year students ( n = 47 , 87 % female) registered in the `` Understanding Foods '' course were recruited to participate in a survey administered on Qualtrics at the beginning of the semester and again at the end of the semester. Participants were asked questions related to demographics and food habits; additional questions on food skills , in Likert-scale format , included confidence in food preparation , food safety knowledge , and grocery shopping habits. Subscales were combined for an overall Food Skills Questions ( FSQ) score and differences were determined by paired t tests. Overall , significant ( P < 0.05) improvements were observed related to students ' confidence and food safety knowledge scores as well as the overall FSQ score. Students , however , rated their personal eating habits more poorly ( P < 0.05) at the end of the semester. As a lack of food skills is often considered a barrier for healthy eating among students , these results signify the importance of a hands-on introductory cooking course at the undergraduate level.
