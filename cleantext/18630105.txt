  Data sourcesPubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database ( LILACS) , the Brazilian Library in Dentistry ( BBO) , Cochrane Library and grey literature.Study selectionTwo reviewers selected randomised clinical trials ( RCTs) that compared the efficacy of SDF application with other active treatments or placebo in arresting carious lesions.Data extraction and synthesisThree authors extracted data using customised extraction forms , and risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed on studies classified at ` low ' or ` unclear ' risk of bias , where similar outcomes were recorded in primary teeth , and that compared SDF to active treatments.ResultsEleven studies were included; five studies were at ` low ' , two at ` unclear ' and four studies at ` high ' risk of bias. Eight were conducted with primary teeth , two with permanent first molars and one conducted on both. Six studies used 38 % SDF , two 30 % SDF , one 12 % SDF , one compared 38 % SDF to 12 % SDF and one used Nano Silver Fluoride ( NSF). ConclusionsSDF is more effective than active treatments or placebo for carious lesion<symptom> arrest in primary teeth. The body of evidence was of high quality for primary teeth. However , there was not enough high quality evidence to draw conclusions about carious lesion<symptom> arrest in first permanent molars.
