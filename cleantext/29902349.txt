  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAF) , derived from stroma of cancer tissues , interact with cancer cells and play an important role in cancer initiation , growth , and metastasis. Nab-paclitaxel ( nab-PTX) is a 130 nm albumin-binding paclitaxel and recommended for many types of cancer chemotherapy. The nab-PTX stromal-disrupting effect during pancreatic cancer treatment has been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of nab-PTX in cancer cells and CAF interaction. Cancer cells ( MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1) were cocultured with CAF or treated with CAF conditioned medium , after which their migration and invasion ability , epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT)- related marker expression and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 ( CXCL10) expression and secretion were detected. Nab-PTX treatment was carried out during the coculture system or during preparation of CAF conditioned medium. Then cancer cell migration and invasion ability , EMT-related marker expression , CXCL10 expression and secretion , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) expression and secretion by CAF were checked After coculture with CAF , migration and invasion ability of cancer cells increased. CAF also downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression in cancer cells. During coculture or stimulation with cancer cell-cultured medium , CAF significantly increased IL-6 expression and secretion. However , nab-PTX in the coculture system canceled CAF-induced migration and invasion promotion and EMT-related gene changes. Moreover , nab-PTX increased CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocked CAF IL-6 expression and secretion. Nab-PTX treatment could increase CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocks CAF cancer cell migration and invasion-promoting effect by inhibiting IL-6 expression.
