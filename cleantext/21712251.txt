  Single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) markers and high-density genetic maps are important resources for marker-assisted selection , mapping of quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) and genome structure analysis. Although linkage maps in certain catfish species have been obtained , high-density maps remain unavailable in the economically important southern catfish (
