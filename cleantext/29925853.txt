  Recent researches have reported that long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA) five prime to Xist ( FTX) plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of cancers. In the current study , the clinical significance and functional roles of lncRNA FTX in colorectal cancer ( CRC) progression were investigated. A significant increase of lncRNA FTX expression in CRC tissue and cell lines was observed. Overexpression of lncRNA FTX was significantly associated with the bigger tumor diameter , the advanced TNM stage , the lymph node , and distant metastasis , and also predicted poor prognosis of patients with CRC. Functional analyses demonstrated that knockdown of lncRNA FTX markedly inhibited CRC cell proliferation , migration , and invasion in vitro. Mechanistically , FTX directly interacted with miR-215 and suppressed miR-215 expression. FTX also bind to vimentin and reduced its phosphorylation level on Ser83 in CRC cells. Finally , using siRNAs against lncRNA FTX could dramatically inhibit CRC growth and distant metastasis in vivo. Taken together , our data demonstrated an oncogenic role of lncRNA FTX in CRC tumorigenesis and progression via interaction with miR-215 and vimentin. Then , a promising therapeutic target for CRC was provided.
