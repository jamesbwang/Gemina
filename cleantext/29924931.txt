  A series of nipecotic acid derivatives with new azo benzene based photoswitchable N-substituents was synthesized and characterized in their ( E)- and ( Z)- form for their functional inhibitory activity at γ-aminobutyric acid transporters subtype 1 ( GAT1) , the most common γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) transporter subtype in the central nervous system ( CNS). This led to the identification of the first photoswitchable ligands exhibiting a moderate uptake inhibition of GABA in their ( E)- but distinctive higher inhibitory potency in their ( Z)- form resulting from photoirradiation. For the most efficient photoactivatable nipecotic acid derivative displaying an N-but-3-yn-1-yl linker with a terminal diphenyldiazene unit , an inhibitory potency of 4.65 ± 0.05 ( pIC
