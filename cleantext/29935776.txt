  Metabolic syndrome<disease> is today a worldwide epidemic. First line interventions consist of a profound change in life style , particularly in diet , with a recommended moderate and balanced consumption of macronutrients associated with a caloric restriction. However , in the last few years , several studies have proposed diets with a more intense restriction of some macronutrients that can have some advantages for weight control and for metabolic risk factor control. In the present paper , we will review the evidence available until the present moment about that subject that is a very difficult problem to address and control in clinical practice.
