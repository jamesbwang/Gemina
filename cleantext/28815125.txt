  The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium ( CDISC) is a global non-profit standards development organization that creates consensus-based standards for clinical and translational research. Several of these standards are now required by regulators for electronic submissions of regulated clinical trials ' data and by government funding agencies. These standards are free and open , available for download on the CDISC Website as PDFs. While these documents are human readable , they are not amenable to ready use by electronic systems. CDISC launched the CDISC Shared Health And Research Electronic library ( SHARE) to provide the standards metadata in machine-readable formats to facilitate the automated management and implementation of the standards. This paper describes how CDISC SHARE 'S standards can facilitate collecting , aggregating and analyzing standardized data from early design to end analysis; and its role as a central resource providing information systems with metadata that drives process automation including study setup and data pipelining.
