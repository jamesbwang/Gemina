  An efficient electrophilic persulfuration reaction leading to unsymmetrical disulfides and polysulfides has been developed. Various nucleophiles , including aryl boronic acids , Î²-keto esters , and thiols , can be used as substrates. The notable features of this method include very simple and practical conditions , general scope , and inexpensive copper catalysts.
