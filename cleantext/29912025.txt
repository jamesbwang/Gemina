  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among older adults in the United States. Health systems target readmission rates for quality improvement and cost reduction. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> core measure ( CM) scores at our medical center were lower than the national average , and methods for capturing the appropriate documentation on HF patients to ensure CM compliance were not clear. An interdisciplinary team determined barriers to increasing CM scores , gathered baseline data , and identified gaps in the existing process. The team implemented an accurate reporting system and error-proofing process , redesigned the process for identifying patients admitted with a HF diagnosis , and developed a patient appointment section before discharge in the electronic medical record. There was a decrease in readmissions within 30 days of implementation from 12 % to 8 % , and HF CM compliance score increased from 88 % to 100 %. The percentage of HF patients not identified during hospitalization decreased from 17 % to 0 %. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients discharged with a 7-day follow-up appointment increased from 88 % to 98 %. Through implementation of an interdisciplinary-led process improvement and lean methodologies , metrics and CMs were achieved.
