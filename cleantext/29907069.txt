  In this work , we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the electronic properties of three hydrated zwitterionic amino acids , namely proline , hydroxyproline , and alanine , the former two forming an important constituent of collagen. In all three systems , we find a substantial amount of charge transfer between the amino acids and surrounding solvent , which , rather surprisingly , also involves the reorganization of electron density near the hydrophobic non-polar groups. Water around proline appears to be slightly more polarized , as reflected by the enhanced water dipole moment in its hydration shell. This observation is also complemented by an examination of the IR spectra of the three systems where there is a subtle red and blue shift in the O-H stretch and bend regions , respectively , for proline. We show that polarizability of these amino acids as revealed by a dipole moment analysis involves a significant enhancement from the solvent and that this also involves non-polar groups. Our results suggest that quantum mechanical effects are likely to be important in understanding the coupling between biomolecules and water in general and in hydrophobic interactions.
