  The earliest step in the mRNA degradation process is deadenylation , a progressive shortening of the mRNA poly ( A) tail by deadenylases. The question of when deadenylation takes place remains open. MYC mRNA is one of the rare examples for which it was proposed a shortening of the poly ( A) tail during ongoing translation. In this study , we analyzed the poly ( A) tail length distribution of various mRNAs , including MYC mRNA. The mRNAs were isolated from the polysomal fractions of polysome profiling experiments and analyzed using ligase-mediated poly ( A) test analysis. We show that , for all the mRNAs tested with the only exception of MYC , the poly ( A) tail length distribution does not change in accordance with the number of ribosomes carried by the mRNA. Conversely , for MYC mRNA , we observed a poly ( A) tail length decrease in the fractions containing the largest polysomes. Because the fractions with the highest number of ribosomes are also those for which translation termination is more frequent , we analyzed the poly ( A) tail length distribution in polysomal fractions of cells depleted in translation termination factor eRF3. Our results show that the shortening of MYC mRNA poly ( A) tail is alleviated by the silencing of translation termination factor eRF3. These findings suggest that MYC mRNA is co-translationally deadenylated and that the deadenylation process requires translation termination to proceed.
