  N-acetylneuraminic acid ( NeuAc) is widely used as a nutraceutical for facilitating infant brain development , maintaining brain health , and enhancing immunity. Currently , NeuAc is mainly produced by extraction from egg yolk and milk , or via chemical synthesis. However , its low concentration in natural resources and its non-ecofriendly chemical synthesis result in insufficient NeuAc production and environmental pollution , respectively. In this study , improved NeuAc production was attained via modular pathway engineering of the supply pathways of two key precursors-N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc) and phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP)- and by balancing NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth in engineered Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> Specifically , we used a previously constructed GlcNAc-producing B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> as the initial host for NeuAc biosynthesis. First , we constructed a de novo NeuAc biosynthetic pathway utilizing glucose by coexpressing glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyl-transferase ( GNA1) , N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase ( AGE) , and N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase ( NeuB) , resulting in 0.33 g/l NeuAc production. Next , to balance the supply of the two key precursors for NeuAc biosynthesis , modular pathway engineering was performed. The optimal strategy for balancing the GlcNAc module and PEP supply module involved the use of an engineered , unique glucose and malate coutilization pathway in B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , supplied with both glucose ( for the GlcNAc moiety) and malate ( for the PEP moiety) at high strength. This led to 1.65 g/L NeuAc production , representing a 5.0-fold improvement over the existing methods. Furthermore , to enhance the NeuAc yield on cell , glucose and malate coutilization pathways were engineered to balance NeuAc biosynthesis and cell growth via the blocking of glycolysis , the introduction of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway , and the overexpression of the malic enzyme YtsJ. NeuAc titer reached 2.18 g/L , with 0.38 g/g dry cell weight NeuAc yield on cell , which represented a 1.32-fold and 2.64-fold improvement over the existing methods , respectively. The strategy of modular pathway engineering of key carbon precursor supply pathways via engineering of the unique glucose-malate coutilization pathway in B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> should be generically applicable for engineering of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> for the production of other important biomolecules. Our study also provides a good starting point for further metabolic engineering to achieve industrial production of NeuAc by a Generally Regarded As Safe bacterial strain.
