  Destruction of cancer cells by therapeutic antibodies occurs , at least in part , through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC) , and this can be mediated by various Fc-receptor-expressing immune cells , including neutrophils. However , the mechanism ( s) by which neutrophils kill antibody-opsonized cancer cells has not been established. Here , we demonstrate that neutrophils can exert a mode of destruction of cancer cells , which involves antibody-mediated trogocytosis by neutrophils. Intimately associated with this is an active mechanical disruption of the cancer cell plasma membrane , leading to a lytic ( i.e. , necrotic) type of cancer cell death. Furthermore , this mode of destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells by neutrophils is potentiated by CD47-SIRPα checkpoint blockade. Collectively , these findings show that neutrophil ADCC toward cancer cells occurs by a mechanism of cytotoxicity called trogoptosis , which can be further improved by targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions.
