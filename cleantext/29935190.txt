  Human models demonstrate that experimental activation of the innate immune system has profound effects on brain activation and behavior , inducing fatigue<symptom> , worsened mood and pain sensitivity. It has been proposed that inflammation<symptom> is a mechanism involved in the etiology and maintenance of depression<symptom> , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and long-term fatigue<symptom>. These diseases show a strong female overrepresentation , suggesting that a better understanding of sex differences in how inflammation<symptom> drives behavior could help the development of individualized treatment interventions. For this purpose , we here review sex differences in studies using experimental inflammatory models to investigate changes in brain activity and behavior. We suggest a model in which inflammation<symptom> accentuates sex differences in brain networks and pre-existing vulnerability factors. This effect could render women more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of immune-to-brain communication over time. We call for systematic and large scale investigations of vulnerability factors for women in the behavioral response to
