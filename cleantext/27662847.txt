  Surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot ( ToF) in childhood is associated with generally good outcomes , and almost all children can be expected to survive until adulthood. However , significant pulmonary regurgitation leading to progressive right ventricular dilatation is common in teenagers or young adults because of the nature of the surgical intervention. In patients whose repair included placement of a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit , it has been possible to place a stented valve within the conduit to treat this. Pulmonary regurgitation after repair of ToF via a transannular patch technique has historically involved repeat surgery as the dimensions of the right ventricular outflow tract have been too large for commercially available valves. This review summarises the novel transcatheter valves available for management of pulmonary regurgitation after surgical repair of ToF in patients in whom the dimensions of the right ventricular outflow tract have previously been considered too large for transcatheter valve implantation.
