  Accurate and efficient demonstrations of protein localizations to the vacuole or tonoplast remain strict prerequisites to decipher the role of vacuoles in the whole plant cell biology and notably in defence processes. In this chapter , we describe a reliable procedure of protein subcellular localization study through transient transformations of Catharanthus roseus or onion cells and expression of fusions with fluorescent proteins allowing minimizing artefacts of targeting.
