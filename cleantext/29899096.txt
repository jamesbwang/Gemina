  Reporter viruses provide a powerful tool to study infection , yet incorporating a non-essential gene often results in virus attenuation and genetic instability. Here , we used directed evolution of a luciferase-expressing pandemic H1N1<pathogen> ( pH1N1) 2009 influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> in mice to restore replication kinetics and virulence , increase the bioluminescence signal , and maintain reporter gene expression. An unadapted pH1N1 virus with
