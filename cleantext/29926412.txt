  Because chemical fixatives like aldehydes do not work on most lipid molecules in the membrane , small-scale lipid distribution can not be identified by immunoelectron microscopy in cells fixed by conventional methods. Here we describe a method for physically stabilizing membranes<symptom> through quick-freezing and freeze-fracture replica formation and for specifically labeling gangliosides for electron microscopy. This method enables the ultrahigh-resolution mapping of membrane lipids including gangliosides within the two-dimensional plane of
