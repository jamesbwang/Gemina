  Intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR) and consumption of a high saturated fat diet ( HFD) increase the risk of hypercholesterolemia , a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The mechanism through which the cumulative impact of IUGR and in utero exposure to a maternal HFD increase cholesterol levels remains unknown. Cholesterol 7Î± hydroxylase ( Cyp7a1) initiates catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids for elimination from the body , and is regulated by microRNA-122 ( miR-122). We hypothesized that IUGR rats exposed to a maternal HFD would have increased cholesterol and decreased Cyp7a1 protein levels in juvenile rats , findings which would be normalized by administration of a miR-122 inhibitor. To test our hypothesis we used a rat model of surgically induced IUGR and fed the dams a regular diet or a HFD from prior to conception through lactation. At the time of weaning , IUGR female rats exposed to a maternal HFD had increased hepatic cholesterol , decreased hepatic Cyp7a1 protein and hepatic bile acids , and increased hepatic miR-122 compared to non-IUGR rats exposed to the same HFD.
