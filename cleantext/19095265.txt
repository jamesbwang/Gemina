  To evaluate the utility of hydroureter ( HU) to identify high-grade vesico-ureteric reflux ( VUR) in patients with high-grade postnatal hydronephrosis ( PH). We retrospectively reviewed patients ' charts that had antenatal hydronephrosis from 2008 to 2014. Patients were excluded if they presented with febrile urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( fUTI) , neurogenic bladder , posterior urethral valve , multi-cystic dysplastic kidney , and multiple congenital malformations. We reviewed postnatal ultrasonography images and patients with Society of Fetal Urology ( SFU) Grades 3 and 4 hydronephrosis with a renal pelvic antero-posterior diameter of ≥ 10 mm were included. The ureter was assessed and considered dilated if the ureteric diameter was ≥ 4 mm. The voiding cystourethrogram ( VCUG) studies , fUTI incidence , and surgical reports were reviewed. Of the 654 patients reviewed , we included 148 patients ( 164 renal units) of whom 113 ( 76.4 %) were male and 35 ( 23.6 %) female. SFU Grade 3 PH was identified in 49 % of the renal units , with the remaining 51 % being SFU Grade 4. HU was found in 50/164 renal units and was not detected in the remaining 114 units. VUR was diagnosed in four units ( 3.5 %) without HU ( low-grade VUR); whilst it was detected in 19 units ( 38 %) with HU ( 72.7 % were high-grade VUR) ( Low-grade uncomplicated VUR was diagnosed in 3.5 % of renal units without HU. Our results support limiting the use of VCUG to renal units with PH if associated with HU.
