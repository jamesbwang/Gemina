  To assess the corneal topometric parameters that can be predictive for better visual gain after intracorneal ring segment ( ICRS) implantation in eyes with keratoconus. A total of 42 eyes of 32 patients who underwent ICRS implantation at Dokuz Eylul University , Deparment of Ophthalmology , Cornea Divison were included. Changes in uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA) , corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA) , refractive errors , and corneal topometric indices measured using Scheimpflug topography ( Pentacam , Oculus) were evaluated retrospectively. After creation of intrastromal tunnels of 5.01 ± 0.03 mm inner diameter , 5.71 ± 0.03 mm outer diameter and at 384.21 ± 34.12 μm depth , 1 or 2 ICRS of 150 to 350 µm thickness and 90 to 210 ° arc length were implanted. Preoperative UDVA of 0.09 ± 0.10 and CDVA of 0.29 ± 0.14 Snellen lines improved postoperatively to 0.42 ± 0.26 and 0.62 ± 0.24 , respectively ( P < 0.001 for both). Preoperative spherical equivalent of -6.35 ± 4.58 D and refractive astigmatism of -5.89 ± 2.40 D decreased to -3.59 ± 3.86 and -2.25 ± 1.66 D , retrospectively ( P < 0.001 for both). Strong negative correlations were detected between preoperative mean simulated keratometry ( SimKavg)/ index of surface variance ( ISV) and changes in UDVA/CDVA ( P < 0.01 , for all). Postoperative change in ISV was positively correlated with thicknesses of implanted rings. Change in topographical keratoconus classification was positively and change in index of vertical asymmetry was negatively correlated with number of implanted rings ( P < 0.05 for all). Preoperative ISV value seems to be beneficial in predicting visual gain after ICRS implantation , in addition to SimKavg. Future work on new nomograms for ICRS selection that include ISV , besides refractive , topographic , and cone location data , is warranted.
