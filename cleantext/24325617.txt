  Many smokers use e-cigarettes and licensed nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT) , often in an attempt to reduce their cigarette consumption. We estimated how far changes in prevalence of e-cigarette and NRT use while smoking were accompanied by changes in cigarette consumption at the population level. Repeated representative cross-sectional population surveys of adults aged 16 + years in England. We used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogeneous Input ( ARIMAX) modelling of monthly data between 2006 and 2016 from the Smoking Toolkit Study. Prevalence of e-cigarette use and NRT use in current smokers , and specifically for smoking reduction and temporary abstinence , were input variables. Mean daily cigarette consumption was the dependent variable. Analyses involved adjustment for mass media expenditure and tobacco-control policies. No statistically significant associations were found between changes in use of e-cigarettes ( β -0.012 , 95 % CI -0.026 to 0.002) or NRT ( β 0.015 , 95 % CI -0.026 to 0.055) while smoking and daily cigarette consumption. Neither did we find clear evidence for an association between e-cigarette use ( β -0.010 , 95 % CI -0.025 to 0.005 and β 0.011 , 95 % -0.027 to 0.004) or NRT use ( β 0.006 , 95 % -0.030 to 0.043 and β 0.022 , 95 % -0.020 to 0.063) specifically for smoking reduction and temporary abstinence , respectively , and changes in daily cigarette consumption. If use of e-cigarettes and licensed NRT while smoking acted to reduce cigarette consumption in England between 2006 and 2016 , the effect was likely very small at a population level.
