  Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic process that is essential for cellular housekeeping and nutrient homeostasis. Recently , we provided evidence that thyroid hormone ( TH) is a major inducer of autophagy in mammalian cells. Here , we describe a method for detecting TH-induced autophagic flux in hepatic , muscle , and brown adipocyte cells using lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 ( BafA1) and conventional Western blot techniques.
