  Coherent fiber bundle ( CFB)- based endoscopes enable optical keyhole access in applications such as biophotonics. In conjunction with objective lenses , CFBs allow imaging of intensity patterns. In contrast , digital optical phase conjugation enables lensless holographic endoscopes for the generation of pixelation-free arbitrary light patterns. For real-world applications , however , this requires a non-invasive in situ calibration of the complex optical transfer function of the CFB with only single-sided access. We show that after an initial calibration in a forward direction , a differential phase measurement of the back-reflected light allows for tracking and compensating of bending-induced phase distortions. Furthermore , we present a novel in situ calibration procedure based on a programmable guide star , which requires access to only one side of the fiber.
