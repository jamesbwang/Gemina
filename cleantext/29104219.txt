  It is knotty for current routing protocols to meet the needs of reliable data diffusion during the Internet of Things ( IoT) deployments. Due to the random placement , limited resources and unattended features of existing sensor nodes , the wireless transmissions are easily exposed to unauthorized users , which becomes a vulnerable area for various malicious attacks , such as wormhole and Sybil attacks. However , the scheme based on geographic location is a suitable candidate to defend against them. This paper is inspired to propose a smart collaborative routing protocol , Geographic energy aware routing and Inspecting Node ( GIN) , for guaranteeing the reliability of data exchanging. The proposed protocol integrates the directed diffusion routing , Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing ( GPSR) , and the inspecting node mechanism. We first discuss current wireless routing protocols from three diverse perspectives ( improving transmission rate , shortening transmission range and reducing transmission consumption). Then , the details of GIN , including the model establishment and implementation processes , are presented by means of the theoretical analysis. Through leveraging the game theory , the inspecting node is elected to monitor the network behaviors. Thirdly , we evaluate the network performances , in terms of transmission delay , packet loss ratio , and throughput , between GIN and three traditional schemes ( i.e. , Flooding , GPSR , and GEAR). The simulation results illustrate that the proposed protocol is able to outperform the others.
