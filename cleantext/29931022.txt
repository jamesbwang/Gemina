  Successful bone healing depends significantly on the structure of blood clots and the functional responses of blood cells. Despite the importance of blood clots in osteogenesis , few studies have investigated the effects of blood clots during material-mediated bone regeneration. In this study , we implanted the bone graft substitute hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate ( HA/TCP) subcutaneously , with or without blood prefabrication , to evaluate the effects of blood clots on material-mediated bone formation. We observed that blood prefabricated HA/TCP induced ectopic vascularized bone-like structures , implying that blood prefabrication can induce a microenvironment sufficient for HA/TCP-mediated bone formation. The possible mechanisms were related to ( 1) modification of the fibrin network , which facilitates MSCs recruitment and differentiation , ( 2) modulation of the early osteoimmune environment with the upregulation of osteogenic factor BMP2 , and ( 3) improved expression of VEGF and the enhancement of angiogenesis. These results demonstrate the multifaceted effects of blood clots in regulating osteogenesis , osteoclastogenesis , immune responses , and angiogenesis. Therefore , blood prefabrication can serve as a valuable strategy to improve the osteogenic capacity of materials , and prefabricating materials with blood clots prior to implantation should be encouraged. New generation bone substitute materials could target the modulation of a favorable blood clot response for improved bone regeneration.
