  There continues to be an increase in the number of learners who participate in international health electives ( IHEs). However , not all learners enter IHEs with the same level of knowledge , attitude , and previous experience , which puts undue burden on host supervisors and poses risks to student and patient safety. The Multiple Mini-Interview ( MMI) is a technique that has become a popular method for undergraduate and postgraduate-level health science admissions programs. This paper describes the MMI process used by our program to screen first-year medical students applying for pre-clinical IHEs. Two country-specific cases were developed to assess non-cognitive skills. One hundred percent ( 100 %) of the students ( n = 48) and interviewers ( n = 10) who participated in MMIs completed anonymous surveys on their experience. The majority of students rated the scenarios as realistic ( > 90 %); 96 % found the MMI format fair and balanced; 96 % of students felt that they were able to clearly articulate their thoughts; 75 % of students stated that they had a general understanding of how the MMIs worked; only 33 % of students would have preferred a traditional one-to-one interview. Feedback from both interviewers and students was positive toward the MMI experience , and no students were identified as unfit for participation. Ultimately , 43 students participated in pre-clinical IHEs in 2016. In this paper , we will outline our MMI process , detail shortcomings , and discuss our next steps to screen medical students for IHEs.
