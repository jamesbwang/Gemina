  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) is a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs that , unlike linear RNAs , form covalently closed continuous loops and have recently shown huge capabilities as gene regulators in mammals. However , little is known about their roles in cancer initiation and progression , such as glioma. In this study , we determined the expression level of circRNA ITCH ( cir-ITCH) in glioma specimens and further investigated its functional role in glioma cells. By performing Taq-man based RT-qPCR , we identified that cir-ITCH was downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Receiver operating curve analysis suggested cir-ITCH showed a relatively high diagnostic accuracy. Kaplan-Meier assay revealed that decreased cir-ITCH level was associated with poor survival of glioma patients. The functional relevance of cir-ITCH was further examined by biological assays. Cir-ITCH significantly promoted the capacities of cell proliferation , migration and invasion of glioma cells. The linear isomer of cir-ITCH , ITCH gene was then identified as the down stream target. Subsequently , RNA immunoprecipitation clearly showed that cir-ITCH sponged miR-214 , which further promoted the ITCH expression. Finally , the gain and loss functional assays indicate that cir-ITCH plays an anti-oncogenic role through sponging miR-214 and regulating ITCH-Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. These results suggest that cir-ITCH is a tumor-suppressor gene in glioma and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for glioma patients. Therefore , restoration of cir-ITCH expression could be a future direction to develop a novel treatment strategy.
