  The physical fitness of male conscripts has decreased , and body mass increased during the last few decades , especially in Nordic countries. However , limited research-based reports are available concerning the physical fitness profiles of female recruits. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to investigate changes in physical fitness and body composition of female recruits entering voluntary Finnish military service between the years 2005 and 2015. Data were collected from the initial fitness tests performed in military units during the first 2 weeks of military service. A total of 3,875 healthy female recruits ( 19.9 ± 2.1 year) participated in the fitness tests. Fitness tests consisted 12-minute running test and muscle fitness tests , which were sit-ups , push-ups , and standing long jump. Increases in mean body mass ( 4.2 % , p ≤ 0.01) and body mass index ( 3.8 % , p < 0.01) were observed between 2005 and 2015. In addition , the proportion of overweight and obese female recruits increased by 12 % ( p ≤ 0.001). Mean endurance performance and overall muscle fitness remained unaltered during the study period , except for a decline in push-ups performance. However , the proportion of female recruits with poor endurance performance increased from 19.6 % to 27.8 % ( p ≤ 0.001) between 2005 and 2015. Body mass was inversely associated with 12-minute running test distance ( r = -0.35 , p ≤ 0.001) and muscle fitness index ( r = -0.25 , p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion , the present study revealed that an increasing proportion of female recruits are overweight and/or have poor endurance performance , which are known risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries and premature discharge from military service. Therefore , specialized training programs should be designed specifically for female recruits with lower levels of fitness prior to military service.
