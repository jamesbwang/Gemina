  CAR T-cell therapies hold great promise for treating a range of malignancies but are however challenged by the complexity of their production and by the adverse events related to their activity. Here we report the development of the CubiCAR , a tri-functional CAR architecture that enables CAR T-cell detection , purification and on-demand depletion by the FDA-approved antibody Rituximab. This novel architecture has the potential to streamline the manufacturing of CAR T-cells , allow their tracking and improve their overall safety.
