  Data from colon , breast and prostate cancers suggest that aspirin users have reduced mortality. While the direct mechanism remains uncertain , aspirin can suppress the COX-dependent and independent pathways involved in tumor progression. We hypothesized that aspirin users with clear cell ovarian cancer would have improved survival outcomes. We performed a retrospective review of patients with clear cell ovarian cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010 , and followed outcomes through 2016. Patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Aspirin use was defined by medication documentation in two records more than six months apart. Statistical tests included Fisher 's exact , Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Seventy-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients ( 70 %) had stage I-II disease. Thirteen patients ( 17 %) used aspirin. Aspirin users had a statistically longer disease-free survival compared to non-users ( HR 0.13 ,
