  Micromixing of an o-xylene solution of C60 with N-N-dimethylformamide ( DMF) at room temperature under continuous flow in a vortex fluidic device ( VFD) results in the formation of symmetrical right cones in high yield with diameters 0.5 to 2.5 μm , pitch angle 25 ° to 55 ° and wall thickness 120 to 310 nm. Their formation is in the absence of surfactants and any other reagents , and is scalable. The cones are formed at specific operating parameters of the VFD , including rotational speed , flow rate and concentration , and varying these results in other structures such as grooved fractals. Other aromatic solvents in place of o-xylene results in the formation of rods , spicules and prisms , respectively for m-xylene , p-xylene and mesitylene.
