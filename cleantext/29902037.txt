  Although depression<symptom> is a major contributor to the global burden of disease , services remain scarce in many low- and middle-income countries. In Vietnam , depression<symptom> services are limited , and the government has recently prioritized primary care and community-based service integration. We conducted a pilot study in 2 districts of Hanoi to test the feasibility of ( a) introducing a supported self-management ( SSM) intervention for adult depression<symptom> in primary care in Vietnam , and ( b) conducting a randomized controlled trial ( RCT) to test the effectiveness of the intervention. We conducted focus groups with providers ( n = 16) and community members ( n = 32) to assess the appropriateness of an Antidepressant Skills Workbook for use in Vietnam. We trained providers ( n = 23) to screen patients using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 ( SRQ-20) depression<symptom> scale and to deliver SSM for a 2-month period. A total of 71 patients were eligible to participate in the study , with depression<symptom> ( SRQ-20) and disability ( World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0) scores assessed at baseline and 1 and 2 months. Study results demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in Vietnam and suggest that SSM is an appropriate care model for the Vietnamese context. There was a statistically significant decrease in depression<symptom> symptoms on the SRQ-20 and in functional disability in all domains for the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.). Feasibility study results suggested that a full RCT was warranted. An unanticipated outcome of the study was the uptake of the model by the Ministry of Labor , Invalids , and Social Affairs in 2 additional provinces. ( PsycINFO Database Record
