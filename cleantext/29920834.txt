  The objective was to determine the impact of the HEART Pathway on health care utilization and safety outcomes at 1 year in patients with acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Adult emergency department ( ED) patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( N = 282) were randomized to the HEART Pathway or usual care. In the HEART Pathway arm , ED providers used the HEART score and troponin measures ( 0 and 3 hours) to risk stratify patients. Usual care was based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Major adverse cardiac events ( MACE-cardiac death , myocardial infarction ( MI) , or coronary revascularization) , objective testing ( stress testing or coronary angiography) , and cardiac hospitalizations and ED visits were assessed at 1 year. Randomization arm outcomes were compared using Fisher 's exact tests. A total of 282 patients were enrolled , with 141 randomized to each arm. MACE at 1 year occurred in 10.6 % ( 30/282): 9.9 % in the HEART Pathway arm ( 14/141; 10 MIs , four revascularizations without MI) versus 11.3 % in usual care ( 16/141; one cardiac death , 13 MIs , two revascularizations without MI; p = 0.85). Among low-risk HEART Pathway patients , 0 % ( 0/66) had MACE , with a negative predictive value ( NPV) of 100 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 93 % -100 %). Objective testing through 1 year occurred in 63.1 % ( 89/141) of HEART Pathway patients compared to 71.6 % ( 101/141) in usual care ( p = 0.16). Nonindex cardiac-related hospitalizations and ED visits occurred in 14.9 % ( 21/141) and 21.3 % ( 30/141) of patients in the HEART Pathway versus 10.6 % ( 15/141) and 16.3 % ( 23/141) in usual care ( p = 0.37 , p = 0.36). The HEART Pathway had a 100 % NPV for 1-year safety outcomes ( MACE) without increasing downstream hospitalizations or ED visits. Reduction in 1-year objective testing was not significant.
