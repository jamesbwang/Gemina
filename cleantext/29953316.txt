  To investigate the change in nationwide incidence of endophthalmitis<disease> following cataract surgery in Korea from 2002 to 2013. From a national sample cohort ( n = 1 025 340) , cases of postoperative endophthalmitis<disease> between 2002 and 2013 were identified. From 70,719 cases of cataract surgery , 49 incidents of endophthalmitis<disease> were reported , yielding an incidence of 0.069 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.051-0.092 %). Overall , the endophthalmitis<disease> incidence decreased from 0.103 % in 2002-2005 to 0.045 % in 2010-2013 , corresponding to an annually decreasing time-trend ( 0.902 , 95 % CI , 0.827-0.984). In diabetic patients , however , the incidence was 0.128 % and did not change ( time trend , 1.015; 95 % CI , 0.828-1.245). This study revealed the incidence of endophthalmitis<disease> decreased during a 12-year period , but remained constant in diabetic patients.
