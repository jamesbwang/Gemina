  To summarize the clinical characteristics , diagnosis , treatment and prognosis among 152 children with annular pancreas ( AP). A retrospective review of 152 patients with AP who were treated with surgical repair between January 2009 and August 2017 was performed at our pediatric surgical units. Presenting symptoms , birth weight , radiological findings , associated anomalies , the type of surgery performed were analyzed. ( 1) 152 patients were identified , out of which 82 were males , and 70 were females; ( 2) the average birth weight of children with AP was less than that of healthy newborns. The birth weights of 5.4 % premature infants were less than 1500 g; the birth weight of 17 % full-term infants , 69 % premature infants and 50 % post-term infants were less than 2500 g. ( 3) 100 ( 66 %) patients presented symptoms during neonatal period and 43 ( 28 %) patients had duodenal obstruction diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound scan. ( 4) All cases were managed surgically by open laparotomy , and all patients were duly discharged. AP most commonly presents symptoms in early neonatal period. Infants with AP are associated with a higher rate of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , and it was because swallowed amniotic fluid could not be absorbed and impaired insulin secretion caused by abnormal pancreas. Ultrasonography , abdominal plain film and upper gastrointestinal series ( UGI) are helpful , but can not make the diagnosis , and surgery is the only effective way to diagnose and treat AP.
