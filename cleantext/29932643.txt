  Many oxidation-reduction ( redox) enzymes , particularly oxygenases , have roles in reactions that make and break C-C bonds. The list includes cytochrome P450 and other heme-based monooxygenases , heme-based dioxygenases , nonheme iron mono- and dioxygenases , flavoproteins , radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes , copper enzymes , and peroxidases. Reactions involve steroids , intermediary metabolism , secondary natural products , drugs , and industrial and agricultural chemicals. Many C-C bonds are formed via either ( i) coupling of diradicals or ( ii) generation of unstable products that rearrange. C-C cleavage reactions involve several themes: ( i) rearrangement of unstable oxidized products produced by the enzymes , ( ii) oxidation and collapse of radicals or cations via rearrangement , ( iii) oxygenation to yield products that are readily hydrolyzed by other enzymes , and ( iv) activation of O
