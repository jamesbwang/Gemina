  Lung fibroblasts play critical roles in fibrotic procedures and contribute to lung<disease> fibrosis<disease>. Several studies indicated that thrombin , a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 ( ADAM17) , and connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) participate in the formation of pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. In this study , we examined the involvement of the ADAM17/epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) pathway in thrombin-stimulated CTGF manifestation in human lung fibroblasts ( WI-38). We found that cells treated with thrombin significantly increased ADAM17 expression , ADAM17 and c-Jun phosphorylation in time-dependent manners. Thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression , ERK and c-Jun phosphorylation were inhibited by TAPI-0 ( an ADAM17 inhibitor). Moreover , U0126 ( an ERK inhibitor) inhibited thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression and c-Jun phosphorylation. Cells transfected with small interfering RNA of the EGFR attenuated thrombin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation , c-Jun phosphorylation , and CTGF expression. Thus , these results suggested that ADAM17/EGFR-dependent ERK activation mediated thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts.
