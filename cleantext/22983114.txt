  Saliva , which contains biological information , is considered a valuable diagnostic tool for local and systemic<disease> diseases<disease> and conditions because , similar to blood , it contains important molecules like DNA , RNA , and proteins. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles 30-100 nm in diameter with substantial biological functions , including intracellular communication and signalling. These vesicles , which are present in bodily fluids , including saliva , are released upon fusion of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs) with the cellular plasma membrane. Salivary diagnosis has notable advantages , which include noninvasiveness , ease of collection , absence of coagulation , and a similar content as plasma , as well as increased patient compliance compared to other diagnostic approaches. However , investigation of the roles of salivary exosomes is still in its early years. In this review , we first describe the characteristics of endocytosis and secretion of salivary exosomes , as well as database and bioinformatics analysis of exosomes. Then , we describe strategies for the isolation of exosomes from human saliva and the emerging role of salivary exosomes as potential biomarkers of oral and other systemic<disease> diseases<disease>. Given the ever-growing role of salivary exosomes , defining their functions and understanding their specific mechanisms will provide novel insights into possible applications of salivary exosomes in the diagnosis and treatment of
