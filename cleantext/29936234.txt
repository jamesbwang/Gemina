  Management of levodopa-induced dyskinesias ( LID) is one of the main challenges in the treatment of Parkinson 's disease patients. Mechanisms involved in the appearance of these involuntary<symptom> movements<symptom> are not well known but modifications in the activity of different neurotransmitter pathways seem to play an important role. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the expression levels of the endocannabinoid system ( ECS) elements that would support a role in LID. The basal ganglia nuclei , putamen , external segment of the globus pallidus ( GPe) , internal segment of the globus pallidus ( GPi) , subthalamic nucleus ( STN) and substantia nigra ( SN) were dissected out from cryostat sections obtained from two groups of parkinsonian monkeys treated with levodopa to induce dyskinesias. One group of dyskinetic animals was sacrificed under the effect of levodopa , during the active phase of LID , and the other group 24 h after the last levodopa dose ( OFF levodopa). Biochemical analysis by real-time PCR for ECS elements was performed. CB
