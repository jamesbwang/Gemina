  To determine whether the BikeSafe on-bicycle curriculum affects children 's bicycle safety knowledge and collect cross-sectional data on cycling beliefs and attitudes. The University of Miami 's BikeSafe program collected surveys from 286 participants , ages 7-15 , in 10 Miami-Dade County Parks , Recreation , and Open Spaces summer camps from June to August 2015. Pre- and post-knowledge assessments were analyzed for 83 intervention group and 57 control group participants. Post-testing occurred immediately following program implementation and 2-4 weeks post-implementation. Intervention group participants demonstrated significant differences ( p < 0.05) in knowledge gain between testing points , while control group participants did not. Participants ( n = 286) were more likely to be encouraged to ride a bicycle by parents/guardians ( 61.2 %) than by friends ( 38.1 %) or schools ( 19.6 %). Older respondents reported lower intentions of helmet use as compared to the younger age group , X Children 's bicycle safety knowledge increased following implementation of the BikeSafe on-bicycle curriculum. This study confirmed previous research on the decrease in helmet use as children get older and provided insight into how children view their parents ' beliefs and attitudes relating to cycling. The findings of this study can be used to effectively target future educational and encouragement initiatives.
