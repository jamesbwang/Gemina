  Salmonellosis due to multi-drug resistant Antibiotic susceptibility testing of The highest antimicrobial resistance was detected against chloramphenicol ( 52.17 %) , followed by furazolidone ( 26.08 %) , and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( 21.73 %). All isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin ( 100 %) , followed by gentamicin , imipenem ( 95.65 %) , and cefixime ( 91.30 %). Most of the isolates ( 78.26 %) were able to produce weak biofilm. LAA and EGCG inhibited the growth of None
