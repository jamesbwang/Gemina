  Rape is prevalent on American college campuses. Rape survivors often disclose their experience to their peers in hope of receiving support and obtaining justice ( i.e. , the intended consequences of disclosure). Yet , rape disclosures may also lead to unintended consequences , such as stigma. How peers react to survivors ' disclosures of rape greatly influences survivors ' recovery and their decision to press charges against their perpetrators. In this article , we explore gender differences in responses to rape disclosures. Using an experimental design ( N = 391) , we investigate reactions to stigmatizing ( versus nonstigmatizing) rape disclosures. We find that , when controlling for the experimental condition , college men stigmatize the rape survivor more than college women. However , in response to a stigmatizing ( versus nonstigmatizing) rape disclosure , college women who have been in college longer , compared with college men , have more stigmatizing reactions toward the person disclosing that information. Their reactions then predict increased social distance between the recipient of the disclosure and rape survivors.
