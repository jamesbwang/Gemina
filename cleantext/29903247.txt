  To explore the relationship of diabetes in older Han adults with leptin receptor gene rs1137100 and rs1137101 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP). A total of 511 older Han adults were selected for this study and divided into diabetes and control groups , with 241 and 270 people in each group. The genotypes of rs1137100 and rs1137101 and the allele frequency were determined by Taqman method. The correlations between genotypes of leptin receptor gene SNPs with diabetes wereanalyzed. Blood concentrations of lipids , fasting serum glucose ( FBG) , leptin and insulin were also measured. The distribution of GG , GA and AA genotypes in rs1137100 in the diabetes group and the healthy group was 73. 0 % , 24. 5 % , 2. 5 % and 68. 9 % , 28. 9 % , 2. 2 % , respectively. The difference was not significant between the two groups ( χ ~ 2 = 1. 27 , P = 0. 53). There was no significance in the difference of the frequency of `` A `` allele in rs1137100 in the two groups , with 14. 7 % and 16. 7 % in each group ( χ ~ 2 = 0. 72 , P = 0. 40). In rs1137101 , the distribution of GG , GA and AA genotypes in the diabetes group and the healthy group was 77. 6 % , 21. 2 % , 1. 2 % and 77. 8 % , 21. 1 % , 1. 1 % , respectively. The difference was not significant between the two groups ( χ ~ 2 = 0. 02 , P = 0. 99). There was no significance in the difference of the frequency of `` A `` allele in rs1137101 in the two groups , with 11. 8 % 11. 7 % in each group ( χ ~ 2 = 0. 01 , P = 0. 94. The Logistic analysis showed that GA and AA genotypes carriers in rs1137100 had similar risk for diabetes when comparing with the GG genotypes ( OR = 1. 06 , 95 % CI 0. 34-3. 34 , OR = 0. 80 , 95 % CI 0. 54-1. 19). The GA and AA genotypes carriers in rs1137101 had similar risk for diabetes when comparing with the GG genotypes , and the OR values were 1. 12 ( 95 % CI 0. 22-5. 63) and 1. 01 ( 95 % CI0. 66-1. 54) , respectively. The rs1137100 and rs1137101 polymorphism are not significantly associated with the prevalence of diabetes in older Han adults.
