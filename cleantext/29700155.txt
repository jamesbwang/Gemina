  Currently considered an excellent candidate source of novel chemical diversity , the existence of marine myxobacteria was in question less than 20 years ago. This review aims to serve as a roll call for marine myxobacteria and to summarize their unique features when compared to better-known terrestrial myxobacteria. Characteristics for discrimination between obligate halophilic , marine myxobacteria and halotolerant , terrestrial myxobacteria are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting the need for continued discovery and exploration of marine myxobacteria as producers of novel natural products.
