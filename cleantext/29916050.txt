  Drugs may cause serotonin toxicity by a number of different mechanisms including inhibition of serotonin uptake and metabolism , increased serotonin synthesis and release , activation of serotonin receptors , and inhibition of cytochrome P450 oxidases. Some drug interactions involving opioids can increase intrasynaptic levels of serotonin , and opioid analgesic drugs are now recognized as being involved in some cases of serotonin toxicity especially if administered in conjunction with other serotonergic medications including monoamine oxidase inhibitors , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , and tricyclic antidepressants. In March 2016 , the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication concerning the association of the entire class of opioid pain medicines with serotonin toxicity. Reports of the involvement of individual opioids particularly tramadol , tapentadol , meperidine , methadone , oxycodone , fentanyl , and dextromethorphan are reviewed. While relevance to human serotonin toxicity of animal models , including many studies on rat brain synaptosomes , is questionable , important insights have recently been forthcoming from research utilizing 5-HT receptors , serotonin transporter ( SERT) , and knockout mice. In studies with human SERT-transfected human HEK293 cells , the synthetic opioids tramadol , meperidine , methadone , tapentadol , and dextromethorphan inhibited SERT , but fentanyl and a number of phenanthrenes including morphine and hydromorphone did not. Receptor ligand-binding assays revealed interaction of fentanyl with 5-HT
