  This study examined the physical and mental health of Cree adults , as well as the personal , clinical , and environmental factors associated with the presence of lifetime anxiety<symptom> and mood disorders. Mental health was assessed using the computerised version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule ( CDIS-IV) , and standardised instruments were used to assess physical health , addiction severity , and psychological distress in 506 randomly selected participants from 4 Northern Cree communities in Quebec. Overall , 46.1 % of participants reported chronic medical problems , 42.1 % were current smokers and 34.5 % met the DSM-IV criteria for an anxiety<symptom> or mood disorder. Individuals with an anxiety<symptom> or mood disorder were younger , predominantly female , and with higher educational levels , and a large proportion ( 47.7 %) met the lifetime criteria for substance dependence. Hierarchical regression determined that anxiety<symptom> or mood disorders were associated with serious problems getting along with parents , a history of physical and sexual abuse , and a lifetime diagnosis of substance dependence. Overall , 29.7 % of Cree adults reported sexual abuse , 47.1 % physical abuse , and 52.9 % emotional abuse. This study highlights the high rates of physical and mental health problems in Cree communities and the association among parental history of psychological problems , history of abuse , and psychological distress. Participants expressed a desire for additional medical and psychological treatments to address the patterns of abuse , trauma , and mental disorders that are burdening the Cree communities in Northern Quebec.
