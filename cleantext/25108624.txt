  This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging ( ME-NBI) and determine its value for invasion depth staging in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We searched the PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library databases and found relevant studies published up to December 2016. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. We calculated sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative likelihood values from forest<disease> plots and determined summary receiver operating characteristic ( sROC) curves for ME-NBI diagnostic accuracy analysis. Ten studies met our criteria and were selected for this meta-analysis. A total of 1,033 patients underwent ME-NBI , and 207 of these patients received a diagnosis of staging mucosal or submucosal invasion. The pooled sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative likelihood values of ME-NBI for the diagnostic rate were 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.71-0.97) , 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.80-0.95) , 6.74 ( 95 % CI , 3.52-712.89) , and 0.20 ( 95 % CI , 0.10-0.42) , respectively. The area under the curve ( AUC) was 0.95 for all studies. ME-NBI provides a high diagnostic rate in evaluating the esophagus to diagnose squamous cell carcinoma. In the differentiation for invasion depth staging , ME-NBI was demonstrated to be superior to white light endoscopy and had a similar diagnostic rate compared with HF-EUS. However , HF-EUS had high positive likelihood values for invasion depth staging , suggesting that HF-EUS is a reliable method for confirming invasion depth staging.
