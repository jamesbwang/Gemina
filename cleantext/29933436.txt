  Tobacco smoking strongly increases risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and moderately increases risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. How smoking cessation influences esophageal cancer risk across histological subtypes , time latencies , and geographic regions is not clear. Studies were systematically searched on Medline , Embase , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , and ClinicalTrials.gov. Pooled estimates of risk ratios ( RRs) were derived using a random effects model. Cochran 's Q test and I2 statistic were used to detect heterogeneity. Among 15009 studies , 52 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Using nonsmokers as a reference , risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was lower among former smokers ( RR = 2.05 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.71 to 2.45) than among current smokers ( RR = 4.18 , 95 % CI = 3.42 to 5.12). Compared with current smokers , a strong risk reduction was evident after five or more years ( RR = 0.59 , 95 % CI = 0.47 to 0.75) , and became stronger after 10 or more years ( RR = 0.42 , 95 % CI = 0.34 to 0.51) and 20 or more years ( RR = 0.34 , 95 % CI = 0.25 to 0.47) following smoking cessation. The risk reduction was strong in Western populations , while weak in Asian populations. Using nonsmokers as reference , the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was only slightly lower among former smokers ( RR = 1.66 , 95 % CI = 1.48 to 1.85) than among current smokers ( RR = 2.34 , 95 % CI = 2.04 to 2.69). The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma did not show any clear reduction over time after smoking cessation , with a risk ratio of 0.72 ( 95 % CI = 0.52 to 1.01) 20 or more years after smoking cessation , compared with current smokers. Smoking cessation time-dependently decreases risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , particularly in Western populations , while it has limited influence on the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
