  Nutrition is a modifiable factor affecting the quality of life and independence of older people. The physiological , psychological and social changes during aging affect their dietary choices. Many older adults have inadequate energy and protein intake. Carbohydrate intake and intake of total lipids , in terms of contribution to total energy intake , generally are within the recommended levels , but a decline in overall energy intake as well as the limited variety of micronutrient-dense foods that older people tend to consume result in an inadequate intake of several micronutrients. Adherence to healthy dietary patterns has been described as only moderate among older adults. Health-care practitioners should educate older people and promote healthy diets , in particular adequate energy and protein intake.
