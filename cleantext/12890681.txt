  To explore potential biomarkers in a meniscectomy-induced knee osteoarthritis model , at forty years after meniscectomy. We carried out a forty-year study of 53 patients who , as adolescents , underwent open total meniscectomy and assessed two potential synovial and serum biomarkers , namely glycosaminoglycan ( GAG) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 ( MMP-3). Of the 30 patients available for review , 8 had contralateral knee operations and were excluded. Of the remaining 22 patients , 17 had successful operated knee synovial fluid aspirations and 8 also had successful contralateral control knee aspirations. GAG and MMP3 levels in the synovial fluid and peripheral serum was measured using Alcian blue precipitation and ELISA quantification , respectively. Patients also had their knee radiographs assessed and their radiographic osteoarthritis classified as per the Kellgren-Lawrence and Ahlb”ìck systems. At forty years after meniscectomy , synovial MMP-3 levels remain increased ( p = 0.0132) while GAG levels were reduced ( p = 0.0487) when compared to controls and these two levels correlate inversely. Furthermore , levels of synovial MMP-3 significantly correlated ( p = 0.0032 , r = 0.7734; p = 0.0256 , r = 0.5552) and GAG levels significantly inversely correlated ( p = 0.0308 , r =- 0.6220; p = 0.0135 , r =- 0.6024) , respectively , with both radiological scoring systems. Interestingly , we found that the levels of serum MMP-3 correlated only with the synovial fluid levels of MMP-3 in the operated knee and not with the non-operated joint ( p = 0.0252 , r = 0.7706 vs. p = 0.0764 , r = 0.6576). Multiple regression analysis for patient 's quality of life based on these biomarkers revealed an almost perfect result with an R2 of 0.9998 and a p value = 0.0087. Our results suggest that serum levels of MMP3 could be used as a potential biomarker for knee osteoarthritis , using a simple blood test. Larger cohorts are desirable in order to prove or disprove this finding.
