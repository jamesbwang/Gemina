  Diabetes mellitus occurs either due to an autoimmune destruction of Î² cells ( Type 1) or resistance to insulin effects ( Type 2). Diverse conventional medications are used for treatment of diabetes , which is associated with long term complications such as kidney failure , blindness<symptom> , and stroke. We recently showed the potential of human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs) in 95 patients with type 2 diabetes. In the present study , we use the microarray and miRNA studies to prove why hESCs are effective in diabetes. Three samples of hESCs were cultured and microarray technology was used for the analysis of diabetic pathways. The gene targets for miRNA were analyzed using gene ontology ( GO) and DAVID database. Genes involved in the diabetic pathways were classified in accordance with GO analysis. Pathways for these genes were determined using Reactome and Panther databases. The up and down-regulation of all the genes involved were confirmed with the significant
