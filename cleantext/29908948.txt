  All-optical registration of neuronal and astrocytic activities within the intact mammalian brain has improved significantly with recent advances in optical sensors and biophotonics. However , relating single-synapse release events and local astroglial responses to sensory stimuli in an intact animal has not hitherto been feasible. Here , we present a multiplexed multiphoton excitation imaging approach for assessing the relationship between presynaptic Ca
