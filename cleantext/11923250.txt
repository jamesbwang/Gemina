  Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP) resulting in progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) and optic nerve degeneration , leading to blindness<symptom>. New therapeutic approaches that better preserve the visual field by promoting survival and health of RGCs are highly needed since RGC death occurs despite good IOP control in glaucoma patients. We have developed a novel approach to reliably induce chronic IOP elevation in mouse using a photopolymerizable biomatrix , hyaluronic acid glycidyl methacrylate. This is achieved by rapid in vivo crosslinking of the biomatrix at the iridocorneal angle by a flash of ultraviolet A ( UVA) light to impede the aqueous outflow pathway with a controllable manner. Sustained IOP elevation was induced after a single manipulation and was maintained at ~ 45 % above baseline for > 4 weeks. Significant thinning of the inner retina and ~ 35 % reduction in RGCs and axons was noted within one month of IOP elevation. Optic nerve degeneration showed positive correlation with cumulative IOP elevation. Activation of astrocytes and microglia appeared to be an early event in response to IOP elevation preceding detectable RGC and axon loss. Attenuated glial reactivity was noted at later stage where significant RGC/axon loss had occurred suggesting astrocytes and microglia may play different roles over the course of glaucomatous degeneration. This novel murine glaucoma model is reproducible and displays cellular changes that recapitulate several pathophysiological features of glaucoma.
