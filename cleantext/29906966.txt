  Deterioration in dynamical activities may come up naturally or due to environmental influences in a massive portion of biological and physical systems. Such dynamical degradation may have outright effect on the substantive network performance. This requires us to provide some proper prescriptions to overcome undesired circumstances. In this paper , we present a scheme based on external feedback that can efficiently revive dynamism in damaged networks of active and inactive oscillators and thus enhance the network survivability. Both numerical and analytical investigations are performed in order to verify our claim. We also provide a comparative study on the effectiveness of this mechanism for feedbacks to the inactive group or to the active group only. Most importantly , resurrection of dynamical activity is realized even in time-delayed damaged networks , which are considered to be less persistent against deterioration in the form of inactivity in the oscillators. Furthermore , prominence in our approach is substantiated by providing evidence of enhanced network persistence in complex network topologies taking small-world and scale-free architectures , which makes the proposed remedy quite general. Besides the study in the network of Stuart-Landau oscillators , affirmative influence of external feedback has been justified in the network of chaotic RÃ¶ssler systems as well.
