  Pancreas outcomes in pancreas after kidney transplantation ( PAK) patients have been reported as being inferior to those of patients who receive simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation ( SPK). The influence of the kidney donor ( i.e. living versus deceased) has never been previously addressed. We retrospectively analysed all pancreas transplants performed in a single centre since 2007 and compared the outcomes between those patients who had previously received a living-donor kidney transplant ( pancreas transplantation after living-donor kidney transplantation , PAldK; n = 18) or a deceased-donor kidney transplant ( pancreas transplantation after deceased-donor kidney transplantation , PAddK; n = 28) , using SPK ( n = 139) recipients as a reference. Pancreas survival was similar between all groups , but inferior for PAldK when including only those with a functioning graft at day 90 post-transplantation ( P = 0.004). Pancreas acute rejection was significantly increased in PAldK ( 67 %; 1.8 Â± 1.4 episodes/graft) when compared with PAddK ( 25 %) and SPK ( 32 %) ( P < 0.05) patients. In a multivariate Cox regression model including known risk factors for pancreas rejection , PAldK was the only predictor of acute rejection ( hazard ratio 6.82 , 95 % confidence interval 1.51-30.70 , P < 0.05). No association was found between donor-recipient HLA mismatches and graft rejection. Repeated HLA mismatches between kidney and pancreas donors ( 0 versus 1-6) did not correlate with pancreas graft rejection or survival in either PAK transplantation group ( P > 0.05). Pancreas graft outcomes are worse for PAldK when compared with PAddK and SPK patients.
