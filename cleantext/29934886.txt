  Molecular descriptors capture diverse parts of the structural information of molecules and they are the support of many contemporary computer-assisted toxicological and chemical applications. After briefly introducing some fundamental concepts of structure-activity applications ( e.g. , molecular descriptor dimensionality , classical vs. fingerprint description , and activity landscapes) , this chapter guides the readers through a step-by-step explanation of molecular descriptors rationale and application. To this end , the chapter illustrates a case study of a recently published application of molecular descriptors for modeling the activity on cytochrome P450.
