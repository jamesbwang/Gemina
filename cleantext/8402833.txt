  Visual motion detection in sighted animals is essential to guide behavioral actions ensuring their survival. In Drosophila , motion direction is first detected by T4/T5 neurons. Their axons innervate one of the four lobula plate layers. How T4/T5 neurons with layer-specific representation of motion-direction preferences are specified during development is unknown. We show that diffusible Wingless ( Wg) between adjacent neuroepithelia induces its own expression to form secondary signaling centers. These activate Decapentaplegic ( Dpp) signaling in adjacent lateral tertiary neuroepithelial domains dedicated to producing layer 3/4-specific T4/T5 neurons. T4/T5 neurons derived from the core domain devoid of Dpp signaling adopt the default layer 1/2 fate. Dpp signaling induces the expression of the T-box transcription factor Optomotor-blind ( Omb) , serving as a relay to postmitotic neurons. Omb-mediated repression of Dachshund transforms layer 1/2- into layer 3/4-specific neurons. Hence , spatio-temporal relay mechanisms , bridging the distances between neuroepithelial domains and their postmitotic progeny , implement T4/T5 neuron-subtype identity.
