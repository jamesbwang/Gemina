  Achieving host immune tolerance of allogeneic transplants represents the ultimate challenge in clinical transplantation. It has become clear that different cells and mechanisms participate in acquisition versus maintenance of allograft tolerance. Indeed , manipulations which prevent tolerance induction often fail to abrogate tolerance once it has been established. Hence , elucidation of the immunological mechanisms underlying maintenance of T cell tolerance to alloantigens is essential for the development of novel interventions that preserve a robust and long lasting state of allograft tolerance that relies on T cell deletion in addition to intra-graft suppression of inflammatory immune responses. In this review , we discuss some essential elements of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of naturally occurring or experimentally induced allograft tolerance , including the newly described role of antigen cross-dressing mediated by extracellular vesicles.
