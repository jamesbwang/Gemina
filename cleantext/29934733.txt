  Risk of dementia is increased in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). We aimed to study associations between relevant comorbidities and prevalent as well as incident dementia in AF patients. Study population included all adults ( n = 12,283) â‰¥ 45 years diagnosed with AF at 75 primary care centers in Sweden 2001-2007. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios ( OR) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI) for associations between comorbidities and prevalent dementia. In a subsample ( n = 12,096) , ( excluding patients with dementia diagnosed before AF onset) , Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios ( HR) with 95 % CIs for association between comorbidities , and incident dementia , after adjustment for age , socioeconomic factors and anticoagulant treatment. Totally 937 patients ( 7.6 %) , 388 men ( 5.8 %) and 549 women ( 9.7 %) , were diagnosed with dementia. After adjustments , prevalent dementia was more common in ( ORs , 95 % CI) men with congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , stroke , and depression<symptom> in women with CHF and depression<symptom> , and among women > 75 years with stroke , but less common in women with hypertension. During a 5.6-year follow-up ( standard deviation 2.5) , 750 patients ( 6.2 %; 322 men , 4.9 % , and 428 women , 7.8 %) were diagnosed with incident dementia. An increased risk of incident dementia was found among men with diabetes and depression<symptom> a decreased risk among men and women with CHF , and among women with hypertension , myocardial infarction cerebrovascular diseases. The findings regarding incident dementia need to be interpreted with great caution , as they may have been subject to survival bias.
