  Urine cytokeratin 20 ( CK20) has been reported as a novel diagnostic biomarker for bladder cancer ( BC). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of urine CK20 for BC. A systematic search for literatures was performed till March 31 , 2018. Sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio ( PLR) , negative likelihood ratio ( NLR) , diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR) and the area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve ( AUC) were analyzed. Twenty-seven studies from 22 articles met the eligible criteria. The pooled estimates were as follows: sensitivity , 0.79; specificity , 0.90; PLR , 8.17; NLR , 0.23; DOR , 35.29 and; AUC , 0.90. CK20 was more sensitive for the diagnosis of bladder urothelial carcinoma ( BUC) than all types of BC ( 0.83 vs 0.75). For Tis/Ta tumors , the values were inferior to T1 and ≥ T2 stage tumors , that is , the sensitivity ( 0.74 vs 0.81 vs 0.86) , PLR ( 7.95 vs 9.97 vs 10.75) and DOR ( 27.81 vs 47.09 vs 69.63). For grade 1 tumors , the values were inferior to grade 2 and ≥ grade 3 tumors , that is , the sensitivity ( 0.70 vs 0.82 vs 0.87) , PLR ( 11.86 vs 13.63 vs 14.26) and DOR ( 36.63 vs 72.00 vs 101.71). RT-PCR or PCR showed superior sensitivity and specificity ( 0.80 vs 0.76 , 0.91 vs 0.89) than immunostaining in detection of urine CK20 for BC. Urine CK20 might be a potential noninvasive biomarker for BC , especially for BUC. The diagnostic accuracy of urine CK20 is improved with the progression of tumor stage and grade. In addition , RT-PCR or PCR shows better diagnostic performance in detecting urine CK20 than immunostaining.
