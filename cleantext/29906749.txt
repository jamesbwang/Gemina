  Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is one of leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) has been identified to modulate the tumorigenesis of NSCLC. However , the precise molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in the course is still unclear. Results showed that LINC00339 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissue and cells , which indicated the poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Loss-of-function experiments showed that LINC00339 silencing inhibited the proliferation and invasion , accelerated the apoptosis , and suppressed the tumor growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP) revealed that LINC00339 promoted the NSCLC progression via FOXM1 via targeting miR-145. In conclusion , our results identify the important role of the LINC00339/miR -145/ FOXM1 axis in the NSCLC tumorigenesis , providing neoteric mechanism for the NSCLC tumorigenesis.
