  SF3B1 , SRSF2 and U2AF1 are the most frequently mutated splicing factor genes in the myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS). We have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis to determine the impact of these commonly mutated splicing factors on pre-mRNA splicing in the bone<disease> marrow stem/progenitor cells and in the erythroid and myeloid precursors in splicing factor mutant MDS. Using RNA-seq , we determined the aberrantly spliced genes and dysregulated pathways in CD34
