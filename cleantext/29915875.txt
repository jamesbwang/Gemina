  In order to improve the production and quality of Chinese cashmere , the research of hair follicle development has aroused more and more attention; the regulation mechanism of miRNA in hair follicle development has become a hot spot. A survey of transcriptome profiling screened 10 hair follicle-related miRNAs that were differentially expressed , including miR-let7a. In this study , the expression of miR-let7a was lower in anagen of hair follicle of cashmere goats than that in catagen of hair follicle of cashmere goats ( p < 0.01). Results were in accordance with transcriptome data. The expression patterns of miR-let7a target genes ( IGF-1R , C-myc , and FGF5) were verified by qRT-PCR , which were consistent with the results of Western blot and showed a downward trend. The dual-luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify the correlation between the expression of miR-let7a and its target genes , and it showed that miR-let7a negatively correlates with C-myc and FGF5. Present study offers new information on miRNAs and their related target genes in the regulation of hair follicle development mechanism.
