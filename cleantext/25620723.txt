  Our objective was to characterize physical properties and semivolatile harmful and potentially harmful constituent yields in the mainstream smoke ( MSS) of 4 popular little cigars compared to the 3R4F reference cigarette. We used the ISO and Canadian Intense Regimen protocols to generate MSS for Cheyenne ( Full Flavor and Menthol) and Swisher Sweets ( Original and Sweet Cherry) little cigars; and the 3R4F. We examined physical properties such as length , tobacco filler mass , pressure drop , and ventilation for each product. Nicotine , benzo ( a) pyrene , and tobacco-specific nitrosamine ( TSNA) yields were determined in the MSS. Little cigars were longer ( ~ 15 mm) , contained more tobacco filler ( 100-200 mg) , and had a higher pressure drop ( ~ 1.3 X) compared to the 3R4F. Ventilation holes were found only on the filter paper of the 3R4F. Nicotine transmitted to the MSS was similar for all products under the intense smoking protocol. The highest yields of TSNAs and benzo ( a) pyrene were measured for the little cigars. Little cigars may deliver similar levels of nicotine but higher levels of carcinogens to the MSS compared to cigarettes. Thus , previous reports on the toxicity of tobacco smoke based on cigarettes might not apply to little cigar products.
