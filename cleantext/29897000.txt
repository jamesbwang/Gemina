  Deficits in hippocampal-mediated pattern separation are one aspect of cognitive function affected in schizophrenia ( SZ) or Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). To develop novel therapies , it is beneficial to explore this specific aspect of cognition preclinically. The location discrimination reversal ( LDR) task is a hippocampal-dependent operant paradigm that evaluates spatial learning and cognitive flexibility using touchscreens. Here we assessed baseline performance as well as multimodal disease-relevant manipulations in mice. Mice were trained to discriminate between the locations of two images where the degree of separation impacted performance. Administration of putative pro-cognitive agents was unable to improve performance at narrow separation. Furthermore , a range of disease-relevant manipulations were characterized to assess whether performance could be impaired and restored. Pertinent to the cholinergic loss in AD , scopolamine ( 0.1 mg/kg) produced a disruption in LDR , which was attenuated by donepezil ( 1 mg/kg). Consistent with NMDA hypofunction in cognitive impairment associated with SZ , MK-801 ( 0.1 mg/kg) also disrupted performance; however , this deficit was not modified by rolipram. Microdeletion of genes associated with SZ ( 22q11) resulted in impaired performance , which was restored by rolipram ( 0.032 mg/kg). Since aging and inflammation<symptom> affect cognition and are risk factors for AD , these aspects were also evaluated. Aged mice were slower to acquire the task than young mice and did not reach the same level of performance. A systemic inflammatory challenge ( lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , 1 mg/kg) produced prolonged ( 7 days) deficits in the LDR task. These data suggest that LDR task is a valuable platform for evaluating disease-relevant deficits in pattern separation and offers potential for identifying novel therapies.
