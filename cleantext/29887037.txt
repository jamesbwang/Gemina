  The need for surgery can be a decisive factor for long-term smoking cessation. On the other hand , situations that precipitate stress could precipitate smoking relapse. The authors decided to study the impact of a surgery on the patient 's effort to cease smoking for , at least , 24h before hospital admission and possible relapse on the last 24h before hospital admission for ex-smokers. Smoker , ex-smokers and non-smokers adults , either from pre-anesthetic clinic or recently hospital admitted for scheduled elective surgeries that were , at most , 6h inside the hospital buildings were included in the study. The patients answered a questionnaire at the ward or at the entrance of the operating room ( Admitted group) or at the beginning of the first pre-anesthetic consultation ( Clinic group) and performed CO measurements. 241 patients were included , being 52 ex-smokers and 109 never smokers and 80 non-smokers. Smokers had higher levels of expired carbon monoxide than non-smokers and ex-smokers ( 9.97 ± 6.50 vs. 2.26 ± 1.65 vs. 2.98 ± 2.69; p = 0.02). Among the smokers , the Clinic group had CO levels not statistically different of those on the Admitted group ( 10.93 ± 7.5 vs. 8.65 ± 4.56; p = 0.21). The ex-smokers presented with no significant differences for the carbon monoxide levels between the Clinic and Admitted groups ( 2.9 ± 2.3 vs. 2.82 ± 2.15; p = 0.45). A medical condition , such as a surgery , without proper assistance is unlikely to be enough for a patient to stop smoking for , at least , 24h prior to admission. The proximity of a surgery was not associated with smoking relapse 24h before the procedure.
