  The kinetic resolution of amino acid esters ( AAEs) is a useful synthetic strategy for the preparation of single-enantiomer amino acids. The development of an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution ( DKR) process for AAEs , which would give a theoretical yield of 100 % of the enantiopure product , would require an amino acid ester racemase ( AAER); however , no such enzyme has been described. We have identified low AAER activity of 15 U mg
