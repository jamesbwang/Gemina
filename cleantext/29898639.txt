  Six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD) is a widely used surrogate for exercise capacity in patients both pre- and post-lung transplant. Multiple factors have been suggested to influence exercise capacity. This study sought to determine the change in exercise capacity over time and factors that influence long-term exercise capacity. Data were collected prospectively on lung transplant recipients from 1 center. The 6MWD was measured preoperatively and at the 6- and 12-month clinic visits postoperatively. The Enright equation was used to calculate patients ' percentage predicted 6MWD. The change in 6MWD over time was calculated , and multiple factors affecting 6MWD were analyzed , including predictors of 6MWD at 6 and 12 months posttransplant. Sixty lung transplant recipients were enrolled. Significant improvement in 6MWD was found between pretransplant and hospital discharge and between hospital discharge and 6 months posttransplant. The percentage predicted 6MWD improved significantly from pretransplant to 6 months and to 12 months posttransplant. Factors associated with 6MWD were sex , diagnosis , graft type , and age. Factors predicting long-term exercise capacity included 6MWD at referral , pretransplant , and hospital discharge; pulmonary diagnosis; and type of transplant. The 6MWD provided useful information about patients ' exercise capacity during phases of lung transplantation. The percentage predicted for each patient was found to be a more valuable measure than absolute 6MWD. Intensive , individualized training posttransplant is essential to optimize exercise capacity for this population.
