  The recent advances in next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technologies have enabled the development of effective high-throughput noninvasive prenatal screening ( NIPS) assays for fetal genetic abnormalities using maternal circulating cell-free DNA ( ccfDNA). An important NIPS quality assurance is quantifying the fetal proportion of the sampled ccfDNA. For methods using allelic read count ratios from targeted sequencing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) , systematic biases and errors may reduce accuracy and diminish assay performance. We collected ccfDNA NIPS MiSeq sequencing data from an amplicon-based 92 SNP panel along with complementary low-depth whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) on 243 normal male fetus pregnancies along with additional 144 nonpregnant female donor samples. Using fetal fraction estimates based on X and Y chromosome WGS coverage as gold standard , we compared an existing SNP-based approach , FetalQuant , to a more flexible Bayesian hierarchical modeling strategy that borrows information across interrogated SNPs to character SNP-level error rates and biases to improve fetal fraction estimates. Posterior distributions for SNP-level model parameters indicate most SNPs exhibited modest to moderate extrabinomial variation and a consistent underrepresentation of fetal alleles , with some extreme outliers in both regards. Fetal fraction estimates using FetalQuant , naive to these SNP properties , were relatively poor ( R
