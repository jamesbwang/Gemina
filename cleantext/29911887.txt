 - Whole-slide imaging has ushered in a new era of technology that has fostered the use of computational image analysis for diagnostic support and has begun to transfer the act of analyzing a slide to computer monitors. Due to the overwhelming amount of detail available in whole-slide images , analytic procedures-whether computational or visual-often operate at magnifications lower than the magnification at which the image was acquired. As a result , a corresponding reduction in image resolution occurs. It is unclear how much information is lost when magnification is reduced , and whether the rich color attributes of histologic slides can aid in reconstructing some of that information.- To examine the correspondence between the color and spatial properties of whole-slide images to elucidate the impact of resolution reduction on the histologic attributes of the slide.- We simulated image resolution reduction and modeled its effect on classification of the underlying histologic structure. By harnessing measured histologic features and the intrinsic spatial relationships between histologic structures , we developed a predictive model to estimate the histologic composition of tissue in a manner that exceeds the resolution of the image.- Reduction in resolution resulted in a significant loss of the ability to accurately characterize histologic components at magnifications less than Ã— 10. By utilizing pixel color , this ability was improved at all magnifications.- Multiscale analysis of histologic images requires an adequate understanding of the limitations imposed by image resolution. Our findings suggest that some of these limitations may be overcome with computational modeling.
