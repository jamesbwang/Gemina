  The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate dimensional changes following immediate placement of a fixed ovate pontic provisional restoration into an intact extraction socket without grafting. The mean buccolingual dimensional change at 1 month was 0.51 ± 0.48 mm and 0.93 ± 0.55 mm at 3 months. The mean incisoapical dimensional change at 1 month was 0.68 mm ± 0.19 mm , and at 3 months , 1.64 ± 1.35 mm. The dental literature reports dimensional change of 3 to 5 mm in width and 1 to 4 mm in height for ridges with no treatment following extraction. This study provides validation for the use of ovate pontics in the preservation of tissue contour. Further research is needed to determine whether placing a graft into the socket with placement of an ovate pontic will decrease dimensional changes after extraction.
