  The use of adhesive drapes has decreased the incidence of surgical-site infections. Despite the obvious benefits of the proper use of drapes , there remain many potential risks. A 66-year-old man with a history of left knee osteoarthritis and varus deformity underwent total knee arthroplasty at our hospital , upon removal of the adhesive drape by delicate peeling and warm saline lavage , a large area of the skin avulsion happened. A standardized set of care measures were applied to the wound<disease> to avoid wound<disease> infection<disease> After 6 weeks of treatment , the avulsed wound<disease> showed no signs of infection and had undergone re-epithelialization. Individuals with high-risk skin avulsion injuries should be provided with preventive measures and the necessity of continuous application of adhesive drapes should be further studied.
