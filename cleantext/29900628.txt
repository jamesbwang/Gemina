  Three linear peptides incorporating d-Phe-2-Abz as the turn motif are reported. Peptide 1 , a hydrophobic β-hairpin , served as a proof of principle for the design strategy with both NMR and CD spectra strongly suggesting a β-hairpin conformation. Peptides 2 and 3 , designed as amphipathic antimicrobials , exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity , with potency in the nanomolar range against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> Both compounds possess a high degree of selectivity , proving non-haemolytic at concentrations 500 to 800 times higher than their respective minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Peptide 2 induced cell membrane and cell wall disintegration in both S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> as observed by transmission electron microscopy. Peptide 2 also demonstrated moderate antifungal activity against Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> with an MIC of 50 μM. Synergism was observed with sub-MIC levels of amphotericin B ( AmB) , leading to nanomolar MICs against C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> for peptide 2. Based on circular dichroism spectra , both peptides 2 and 3 appear to exist as a mixture of conformers with the β-hairpin as a minor conformer in aqueous solution , and a slight increase in hairpin population in 50 % trifluoroethanol , which was more pronounced for peptide 3.
