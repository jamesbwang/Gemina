  The purpose of this work is to evaluate whether human microRNA-3129 ( hsa-miR-3129) may functionally regulate cancer development , possibly through downstream target CD44 in human epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC). Direct targeting of hsa-miR-3129 on human CD44 transcript was evaluated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Gene expression of hsa-miR-3129 in immortal EOC cell lines was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Lentivirus-mediated hsa-miR-3129 upregulation or downregulation was conducted in SK-OV-3 and CAOV-3 cells , in which endogenous hsa-miR-3129 and CD44 expressions were then measured. In hsa-miR-3129 upregulated or downregulated EOC cells , functional assays were applied to evaluate EOC proliferation , bufalin chemoresistance in vitro , or xenotransplantation in vivo. Moreover , CD44 was ectopically overexposed in hsa-miR-3129 upregulated EOC cells to functionally evaluate the correlation between hsa-miR-3129 and CD44 in EOC. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed hsa-miR-3129 directly binds CD44. QRT-PCR revealed that hsa-miR-3129 was substantially downregulated in EOC cell lines. In SK-OV-3 and CAOV-3 cells , lentivirus-induced hsa-miR-3129 upregulation downregulated CD44 whereas hsa-miR-3129 downregulation did not affect CD44 expression. Hsa-miR-3129 upregulation had significant anti-cancer effects by inhibiting EOC proliferation , increasing bufalin chemoresistance , and suppressing xenotransplantation. On the other hand , overexpressing CD44 reversed the anti-cancer functions by hsa-miR-3129 upregulation in EOC cells. In conclusion , Has-miR-3129 is a functional regulator , possibly through reverse targeting on CD44 , in EOC.
