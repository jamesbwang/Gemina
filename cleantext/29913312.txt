  The Udoteaceae family ( Bryopsidales , Chlorophyta) is known to be highly diverse morphologically in the Caribbean region , but only few studies have studied its genetic diversity. Using an integrative taxonomic approach , this study aimed at ( 1) exploring the Udoteaceae species diversity using a combination of five DNA-based species delimitation methods and morpho-anatomical data for confirmation; ( 2) estimating the discriminatory power of traditional diagnostic characters using a morphology-based clustering method and statistical analyses focused on the genus Udotea; and ( 3) reconstructing the phylogeny of the family based on a multilocus analysis ( tufA , rbcL , 18S rDNA). Our results revealed strong congruence between species hypotheses across delimitation methods and markers. Morpho-anatomical characters proved essential to validate these hypotheses , to assign species names and to unveil new species. Morphological analyses led to relevant results for accurately discriminating Udotea morphospecies. Siphon features and cortication were key characters to define supra-specific groups and to revise the taxonomy of the genus Udotea. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the polyphyly of Udotea , Rhipocephalus and Penicillus , which led us to propose a revised definition of Udotea sensu stricto based on both genetic and morphological data. Finally , our study emphasizes the importance of combining genetic and morphological data for the taxonomic revision of the Udoteaceae , but stresses the need of including more taxa from other geographical regions to better resolve taxonomic issues.
