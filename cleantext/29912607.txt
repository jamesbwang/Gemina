  Cancer and its treatment have an influence on health-related quality of life ( HRQOL). Normative data could help to interpret HRQOL among cancer patients. Our aim was to generate longitudinal normative data based on sex , age and morbidity for the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 and the Self-administered Comorbidity Questionnaire were administered to a representative panel of the Dutch-speaking population in the Netherlands in 2009 ( n = 1743) , 2010 ( n = 2050) , 2011 ( n = 2040) , 2012 ( n = 2194) and 2013 ( n = 2333). Regarding sex , at baseline , women scored statistically significant and clinically relevant worse on fatigue<symptom> , pain and insomnia compared to men. Regarding age groups and sex , HRQoL was lower among the older age groups in men and women. For men , at baseline , significant and clinically relevant age differences were found on physical , role and cognitive functioning , global QOL scale , fatigue<symptom> , pain and dyspnea<symptom>. The change over 5 years was larger for older age groups. For women , at baseline , significant and clinically relevant age differences were found on physical functioning , role functioning , nausea/vomiting , pain , dyspnea<symptom> and insomnia. Those without self-reported morbidities reported a better HRQoL compared to those with morbidities. Among those who completed five assessments , the summary scale scores were stable over time , were higher in men than in women , and higher in younger compared to older age groups. Although HRQoL remains relatively stable over time , HRQoL data needs to be interpreted with care as many confounding factors can have an impact on HRQOL. Our data ( which is freely available) can aid in the interpretation of QLQ-C30 scores and can help increase our understanding of the influence of age , sex , time and morbid conditions on HRQoL among cancer patients.
