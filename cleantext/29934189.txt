  Understanding the mechanism of interaction between food proteins and bioactives constitutes the preliminary step to design food grade nanocarriers. We investigated the interaction between cyanidin-3-O-glucoside ( C3G) , and 20nm-sized sodium caseinate nanoparticles ( NaCas) at pH 7 and pH 2 by fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The characterization of the C3G-NaCas interaction indicated that the fluorescence quenching mechanism was predominantly static. C3G interacted with two sets of binding sites with association constants Ka of 10
