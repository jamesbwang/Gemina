  The search of high performance organic redox-active materials for non-aqueous redox-flow batteries remains a key challenge. Organic radicals and aromatic imides are two promising classes of redox-active materials with complementary advantages , such as in specific capacity , operating voltage and stability , et al.. Herein , we report two stable bifunctional radicals synthesized from the C-C coupling of redox-active phenoxyl radicals and perylene diimides ( PDIs , 1 *) or ben ( ghi) perylene triimides ( BPTIs , 2 *). The incorporation of electron-deficient PDIs or BPTIs into phenoxyl radicals is objective to not only increase the number of redox-active groups per molecule and thus improve their specific capacities , but also increases the redox potential and stability of phenoxyl radicals and thus enhances their battery voltages and cycle lives. When served as the redox-active species in the catholyte of a non-aqueous static redox-flow battery , both radicals 1 * and 2 * exhibited a cooperatively enhanced performance with an unprecedented initial discharge voltage of up to 3.12 V vs. Li +/ Li , which is the hitherto most presentable potential for imide and radical based energy storage materials in redox-flow batteries.
