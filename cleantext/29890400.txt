  Cross-linked enzyme aggregate ( CLEA) methodology has been applied to immobilize cytochrome P450 BM3 variants ( F87A and 21B3) with peroxygenase activity. Several Ru ( II)- diimine complexes were found to be suitable cross-linking agents , surpassing the traditional glutaraldehyde and dextran aldehyde. They offer modular numbers of aldehyde functionalities and a more rigid framework than their organic counterparts. The F87A CLEAs display significant activity loss compared to the protein in solution. Meanwhile , for the 21B3 CLEAs , high activity recovery ( up to 95 %) is obtained. In order to minimize enzyme leaching from the CLEA , sodium cyanoborohydride was used to reduce the CLEAs imine bonds. The reduced CLEAs were active for several rounds of reactions leading to an overall increase in protein activity of 170 % compared to the free protein in solution.
