  To investigate the prevalence and correlates of high screen time ( ST) among students in Zhejiang , China. Cross-sectional study. School-based adolescent health survey in Zhejiang Province , China. 23 543 students in grades 7-12 from 442 different schools. High ST. The mean age of the students was 15.6 years and 49.7 % of them were girls. The prevalence of high ST ( screen viewing ≥ 2 hours per day) was 42.4 % ( 95 % CI 40.2 % to 44.5 %) , higher in boys than in girls ( 45.4 % ( 95 % CI 42.8 % to 48.0 %) vs 39.1 % ( 95 % CI 36.6 % to 41.7 %)). No statistically significant difference was found between urban and rural areas ( 43.0 % ( 95 % CI 37.2 % to 48.7 %) vs 42.1 % ( 95 % CI 39.6 % to 44.6 %)). The prevalence of high ST among middle school , academic high school and vocational high school students was 35.3 % , 30.0 % and 73.5 % , respectively. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that older age , attendance at vocational high school , non-intact family , poor academic performance , bad self-reported health status , loneliness and drinking carbonated beverages ≥ 3 times every day were positively associated with high ST. Attendance at academic high school , higher parental education and being physically active were negatively associated with high ST.
