  Three new lanostane-type triterpenes ( compounds 1-3) , 1 new abietane-type diterpene ( compound 4) , and 10 known compounds ( 5-14) were isolated from sclerotia of Inonotus obliquus. Their structures were elucidated through a combination of spectrometric techniques , including infrared , 1-dimensional , and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry. In in vitro assays , compounds 2 and 4-12 showed hepatoprotective effects against D-galactosamine-induced damage in WB-F344 cells , with inhibitory effects from 35.4 % to 83.8 %. Compounds 3 , 13 , and 14 exhibited selective cytotoxicity against Bel-7402 , A-549 , or KB cell lines. Compounds 13 and 14 showed inhibitory effects against protein tyrosine kinases , with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 23.8 and 7.4 Î¼mol/L , respectively.
