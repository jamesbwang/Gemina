  The aim of our study was to assess the results of antegrade percutaneous intramedullary Kirschner wire ( K-wire) fixation , for the treatment of unstable displaced metacarpal fractures in a large number of cases , in order to support the usage of this mini-invasive technique in the largest variety of fractures as possible. Every patient meeting the inclusion criteria was treated with closed reduction and antegrade intramedullary fixation with 1 or 2 K-wire from January 2013. A total of 150 patients with 165 metacarpal fractures were evaluated until February 2016. Average follow-up duration was 10 weeks. The clinical outcome was assessed by the total active motion of the digit , presence of rotational deformity , Quick Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder , and Hand ( Q-DASH) score , and Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation ( PRWHE) score. The radiographic outcome was assessed by evaluating the dorsal angulation and shortening of the metacarpal , comparing the postoperative radiography and the first radiography showing fracture healing. Comparing the injured and contralateral digit average total active motion after 10 weeks from surgery , no statistical significance emerged. No patient developed extensor tendon irritation , so that there was no need to perform tenolysis , ever. The average Quick Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder , and Hand score was 12.3 ( range , 0 to 37). The average Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation score was 19 ( range , 0 to 41). Fracture union was steadily achieved. Radiographic assessment showed a nonsignificant postoperative loss of reduction. Antegrade intramedullary K-wire fixation technique is valid , reproducible , cheap , and perfectly suited to the treatment of metacarpal fractures requiring surgery , providing immediate mobilization and excellent outcomes for a very wide variety of fractures.
