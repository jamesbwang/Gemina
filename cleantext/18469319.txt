  Change management studies have emphasized the significance of an organization 's readiness for change and transformation and have recommended strategies to affect change. Organizational readiness for change is a multi-faceted , multi-level , and multi-dimensional activity; its most important aspect is organizational members ' willingness to accept and implement change because ignoring the human factors may result in resistance and failure. Through its National Transformation Program 2020 , the Saudi Arabian government is attempting to effect radical changes in the structure and function of its health-care system to achieve quality care and effective service delivery. The aim of the present review is to discuss the Saudi health-care system 's readiness to change that Saudi Arabia intends to implement by 2020 , based on extensive review of different reports , documents , and empirical studies in the field of organizational readiness for change. The study concludes that if organizational readiness for change is high , resources are available , and situational factors are aligned , members of organizations will take the initiative to change , exert optimal effort , demonstrate greater determination , and engage in more cooperative behavior that may lead to efficient and effective implementation of the Saudi health-care transformational plan with fewer complications and less resistance.
