  Major concerns of pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus are an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome. The objective of this study was to analyse the rate of fetal distress during labor in women with type 1 , type 2 and gestational diabetes compared to control women. A retrospective case-cohort study was conducted at the VU University Medical Center , Amsterdam; a tertiary care hospital. 117 women with type 1 diabetes , 59 women with type 2 diabetes , 303 women with gestational diabetes and 15,260 control women were included , who delivered between March 2004 and February 2014. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to compare maternal and pregnancy characteristics. Risk of fetal distress and perinatal asphyxia was assessed by multiple regression analyses , adjusted for confounding factors as age , smoking , parity , previous cesarean section , hypertensive disorder , pre-eclampsia , prematurity , induction of labor and macrosomia. Main outcome measure was fetal distress , defined either as clinical indication for instrumental or cesarean delivery; or low umbilical artery pH ( UA pH) , or admission to neonatal unit ( NU). The indication for instrumental or cesarean delivery in women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus was more frequently based on fetal distress as compared to controls ( adjusted OR 2.76 CI 1.74-4.40 and adjusted OR 2.31 CI 1.19-4.51 , respectively). In comparison with the control group , infants of women with type 1 diabetes had an increased risk of UA pH < 7.20 ( adjusted OR 1.88 CI 1.23-2.87) or UA pH < 7.10 ( adjusted OR 3.35 CI 1.79-6.27). Also , infants of women with type 1 diabetes were at increased risk for admission to NU as compared to infants of control women ( OR 8.07 CI 4.75-13.70). Women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of fetal distress during labor as compared to controls.
