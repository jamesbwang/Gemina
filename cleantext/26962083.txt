  Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> are one of the most common infections in humans. Here we tested the utility of urinary cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) to comprehensively monitor host and pathogen dynamics in bacterial and viral urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease>. We isolated cfDNA from 141 urine samples from a cohort of 82 kidney transplant recipients and performed next-generation sequencing. We found that urinary cfDNA is highly informative about bacterial and viral composition of the microbiome , antimicrobial susceptibility , bacterial growth dynamics , kidney allograft injury , and host response to infection. These different layers of information are accessible from a single assay and individually agree with corresponding clinical tests based on quantitative PCR , conventional bacterial culture , and urinalysis. In addition , cfDNA reveals the frequent occurrence of pathologies that remain undiagnosed with conventional diagnostic protocols. Our work identifies urinary cfDNA as a highly versatile analyte to monitor infections of the urinary tract.
