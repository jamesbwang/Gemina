  When we acquire tactile information about an object 's surface , we actively move our hands. Past studies have shown a correlation between participants ' ( i.e. , touchers ') hand motion in tactile exploration and the evaluated tactile attributes of the object , which suggests that tactile perception can be estimated from statistical analysis of touchers ' hand motion. Though it has been reported that the statistical analysis of hand motion can indeed estimate tactile perception , whether humans can estimate tactile perception by observing the hand motion of others remains unclear. To investigate this , we conducted experiments wherein observers watched point-light moving hands of touchers in tactile exploration and evaluated the material being touched. Our results show that , although observers ' estimation of touchers ' perception was not accurate , observers extracted information from touchers ' hand motion for estimation , and the correlations within observers ' estimation were high. These results suggest that human observers can estimate tactile perception through visual observation of the hand motion of others by adopting common strategies about the relationships between touchers ' hand motion and tactile perception.
