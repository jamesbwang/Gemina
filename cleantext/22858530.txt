  The number of service visits of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) patients is different from each other and their visit time intervals are non-uniform. Although the literature has revealed many approaches in disease progression modeling , they fail to leverage these time-relevant part of patients ' medical records in predicting disease 's future status. This paper investigates how to predict the AD progression for a patient 's next medical visit through leveraging heterogeneous medical data. Data provided by the National Alzheimer 's Coordinating Center includes 5432 patients with probable AD from August 31 , 2005 to May 25 , 2017. Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks ( RNN) are adopted. The approach relies on an enhanced `` many-to-one '' RNN architecture to support the shift of time steps. Hence , the approach can deal with patients ' various numbers of visits and uneven time intervals. The results show that the proposed approach can be utilized to predict patients ' AD progressions on their next visits with over 99 % accuracy , significantly outperforming classic baseline methods. This study confirms that RNN can effectively solve the AD progression prediction problem by fully leveraging the inherent temporal and medical patterns derived from patients ' historical visits. More promisingly , the approach can be customarily applied to other chronic<disease> disease<disease> progression problems.
