  The Great<pathogen> Bustard is the heaviest bird capable of flight and an iconic species of the Eurasian steppe. Populations of both currently recognized subspecies are highly fragmented and critically small in Asia. We used DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the mitochondrial control region to estimate the degree of mitochondrial differentiation and rates of female gene flow between the subspecies. We obtained genetic samples from 51 individuals of Otis tarda<pathogen> dybowskii representing multiple populations , including the first samples from Kazakhstan and Mongolia and samples from near the Altai Mountains , the proposed geographic divide between the subspecies , allowing for better characterization of the boundary between the two subspecies. We compared these with existing sequence data ( n = 66) from O. t. tarda<pathogen>. Our results suggest , though do not conclusively prove , that O. t. dybowskii and O. t. tarda<pathogen> may be distinct species. The geographic distribution of haplotypes , phylogenetic analysis , analyses of molecular variance , and coalescent estimation of divergence time and female migration rates indicate that O. t. tarda<pathogen> and O. t. dybowskii are highly differentiated in the mitochondrial genome , have been isolated for approximately 1.4 million years , and exchange much less than one female migrant per generation. Our findings indicate that the two forms should at least be recognized and managed as separate evolutionary units. Populations in Xinjiang , China and Khövsgöl and Bulgan , Mongolia exhibited the highest levels of genetic diversity and should be prioritized in conservation planning.
