  Kabuki syndrome<disease> is characterized by distinctive facial features and varying degrees of growth retardation. It leads to malformations in skeletal , urogenital and cardiac structures; moreover , endocrine conditions such as premature thelarche , precocious puberty , growth hormone deficiency , diabetes insipidus , thyroid dysfunction and obesity have been reported. Kabuki syndrome<disease> is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A genes. An 11-year-old girl with the typical facial features of Kabuki syndrome<disease> visited our hospital due to her short stature. She was found to have the de novo heterozygous mutation of c. 8200C > T , p ( Arg2734 *) in exon 32 of the KMT2D gene and was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome<disease>. The patient also exhibited endocrine abnormalities such as a constitutional delay of puberty , transiently congenial hypothyroidism , obesity and growth hormone deficiency. This is a case of a mutation in the KMT2D gene in a girl with Kabuki syndrome<disease> who presented with endocrine symptoms ( constitutional delay of puberty , hypothyroidism , obesity and growth hormone deficiency).
