  Despite the high quantities of tablets produced daily , many tableting processes are still operated at sub-optimal settings and hence lack the necessary flexibility to mitigate for possible process deviations. However , to ensure this flexibility on tableting throughput it is important to select the most robust feed frame design and settings regarding die-filling. In this research study , four paddle designs for a two-compartment forced feeder ( equipped with a metering and a feeding paddle wheel) were evaluated at a wide range of process-settings ( i.e. tableting speed , paddle speed , overfill level) and feed frame features ( i.e. deaeration) for their impact on the die-filling step of a poorly flowing model formulation ( i.e. MCC 101) using a quality-by-design approach. No benefit on die-filling was observed when using higher speeds of the metering paddle wheel compared to the feeding paddle wheel , and no convincing arguments were obtained to use the feed frame deaeration opening. Some combinations of paddle design and process-settings significantly increased the risk for inconsistent die-filling ( i.e. high tablet weight variability) which can therefore limit the efficiency of the tableting process. The approach used in this study enabled to compare the paddle designs for their die-filling performance in function of varying tableting speeds , eventually resulting in the selection of a feed frame design that is most robust and therefore will provide a uniform die-filling over a wide range of throughputs. Selection of the most robust parameters is an important prerequisite for the ability of using the rotary tablet press as an agile unit-operation.
