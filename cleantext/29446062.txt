  At a time when immunology seeks to progress ever more rapidly from characterization of a microbial or tumour antigen to the immune correlates that may define protective T-cell immunity , there is a need for robust tools to enable accurate predictions of peptide-major histocompatibility complex ( pMHC) and peptide-MHC-T-cell receptor binding. Improvements in the curation of data sets from high throughput pMHC analysis , such as the NIH Immune Epitope Database ( IEDB) , and the associated developments of predictive tools rooted in machine-learning approaches , are having significant impact. When such approaches are linked to the powerful empirical immunopeptidome data sets from peptide MHC elution and mass spectrometry , there is considerable potential for rapid translation to T-cell therapies and vaccines.
