  Measurement is an integral part of many disciplines , ranging from the social , healthcare/medical , to management sciences. The field of psychometrics has had a wide-ranging impact in the varied disciplines housed within psychology ( e.g. , clinical , developmental , etc.) as researchers and test developers aim to construct , refine , and modify their instruments. Given that test validation is a key component in furnishing evidence of validity , the intent of this nontechnical article is to reinforce ( or serve as a reminder) for the applied audience the necessary efforts in optimizing the psychometric properties of their measurement tool. This article will be couched as a `` lessons learned '' document , primarily covering construct and criterion validity , but also , reliability estimation , and then finally , a comment about the confluence of null hypothesis significance testing , sample size and effect size and its relationship to psychometric testing.
