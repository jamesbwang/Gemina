  Modern molecular techniques have highlighted the presence of inflammation<symptom> throughout the spectrum of tendinopathy. Previous studies have suggested that excessive inflammation<symptom> in the tendon is a major factor leading to poor clinical treatment. Furthermore , the NLRP3 inflammasome , as a new term , is closely associated with the pathogenesis of many diseases. In the present study , we examined whether the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the development of tendinitis and whether cyclic stretching plays a prominent role in inflammation<symptom> in the tendon. In the present study , we showed that hydrogen peroxide ( H
