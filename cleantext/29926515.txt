  The objective of this study is to review the morbidity and mortality associated with mitral valve repair versus replacement in infective endocarditis<disease> patients. A comprehensive search was undertaken among the four major databases ( PubMed , Embase , Scopus , and Ovid) to identify all available data comparing mitral valve repair or replacement in infective endocarditis<disease> Databases were evaluated and assessed to March 2017. Data were analyzed using meta-analytical techniques including odds ratio and mean weighted difference. A total of 8978 patients were analyzed in a total of 14 articles. The average age of the cohort was 53 years. Results revealed a shorter CPB time in the mitral valve ( MV) repair compared to replacement group ( P = 0.05). Postoperative outcomes ( 30 days/in hospital events) such as bleeding ( P = 0.0047) and recurrence of infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) ( P = 0.004) were significantly lower in the MV repair group. Beyond 30 days , recurrence of IE was higher in the MV replacement than the repair group ( P < 0.0001). Additionally , there were significantly less reoperations in the repair group ( P = 0.0021). The MV repair group had significantly better survival at 1 and 5 years postop ( P < 0.0001 , P < 0.0001). This meta-analysis shows that mitral valve repair has good clinical outcomes both in-hospital and at 1 and 5 years of follow-up. Mitral valve repair should be attempted in those patients in whom sufficient valve tissue is present for reconstruction after all infectious tissue has been resected.
