  CLIP-seq ( crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing) is widely used to map the binding sites of a protein of interest on the transcriptome , and generally employs UV to induce the covalent bonds between protein and RNA , which allows stringent washing. However , dsRNA is inefficiently crosslinked by UV , making it difficult to study the interactions between dsRNA binding proteins and their substrates. A dsRNA endoribonuclease DROSHA initiates the maturation of microRNA ( miRNA) by cleaving primary miRNA ( pri-miRNA). Despite the importance of DROSHA in miRNA maturation and sequence determination , accurate mapping of DROSHA cleavage sites has not been feasible due to rapid processing , modification , and degradation of the cleaved products in cells. Here , we present a high-throughput sequencing method that allows the mapping of in vivo DROSHA cleavage sites at single nucleotide resolution , termed formaldehyde crosslinking , immunoprecipitation , and sequencing ( fCLIP-seq). The fCLIP-seq protocol has been improved significantly over the standard CLIP-seq methods by ( 1) using formaldehyde for efficient and reversible crosslinking , ( 2) employing polyethylene glycol and adaptors with randomized sequences to enhance ligation efficiency and minimize bias , and ( 3) performing ligation after elution , which exposes the RNA termini for efficient ligation. fCLIP-seq successfully captures the nascent products of DROSHA , which allows precise mapping of the DROSHA processing sites. Moreover , from the analysis of the distinctive cleavage pattern , we discover previously unknown substrates of DROSHA. fCLIP-seq is a useful tool to obtain transcriptome-wide information on DROSHA activity and can be applied further to investigate other dsRNA-protein interactions.
