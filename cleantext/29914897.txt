  We present the case of a 65-year-old man with severe<symptom> headaches<symptom> and unilateral facial<symptom> weakness<symptom> , seen in consultation by the dermatology service to rule out primary cutaneous melanoma after brain imaging identified an enlarging mass within the right trigeminal ( Meckel 's) cave. Examination revealed only a pair of erythematous papules on the scalp , for which biopsy demonstrated metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Further evaluation and subsequent thyroidectomy confirmed the origin of widespread internal disease , followed by definitive excision of scalp lesions<symptom> and multimodal management of systemic involvement. Whereas presentation of metastasis to the skin is highly variable , a low threshold for biopsy may allow for histological identification of internal disease not otherwise considered in the clinical differential.
