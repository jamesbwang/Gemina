  To develop and validate a Taiwanese version of the Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile ( HELP-T) for community-dwelling older Taiwanese adults ( â‰¥ 55 years). The original Health Enhancement Lifestyle Profile ( HELP) is a 56-item self-report questionnaire measuring various aspects of health-related lifestyles in older adults. The standard cultural-adaptation procedure was used for questionnaire translation and modification. A field test was conducted for culturally specific item selection , rating-scale analysis , and psychometric validation of the HELP-T in a sample of 274 community-dwelling older adults via classical test theory. The 59-item HELP-T is culturally adapted from the original 56-item HELP. The original 6-point rating scale was modified to a 3-point scale for easy use by Taiwanese older adults. The HELP-T had good internal consistency ( Cronbach 's alpha = 0.82). The test-retest reliability for the total score was high ( 0.92) , and moderate to high ( range: 0.57-0.92) for subscales. The construct validity was supported by the significant correlations between each subscale and the total score ( Spearman 's rho = 0.41-0.67 , p < 0.0001) and by the ability of the scores to significantly discriminate between participants with different levels of self-rated health ( p = 0.0001). The HELP-T is a suitable clinical tool for assessing and monitoring lifestyle risk factors , establishing client-centered lifestyle intervention goals , and determining the outcomes of lifestyle interventions.
