  Chronic wasting disease ( CWD) is a relatively new and burgeoning prion epidemic of deer , elk , reindeer , and moose , which are members of the cervid family. While the disease was first described in captive deer , its subsequent discovery in various species of free-ranging animals makes it the only currently recognized prion disorder of both wild and farmed animals. In addition to its expanding range of host species , CWD continues to spread from North<pathogen> America to new geographic areas , including South Korea , and most recently Norway , marking the first time this disease was detected in Europe. Its unparalleled efficiency of contagious transmission , combined with high densities of deer in certain areas , complicates strategies for controlling CWD , raising concerns about its potential for spread to new species. Because there is a high prevalence of CWD in deer and elk , which are commonly hunted and consumed by humans , and since prions from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy have been transmitted to humans causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , the possibility of zoonotic transmission of CWD is particularly concerning. Here we review the clinical and pathologic features of CWD and its disturbing epidemiology , and discuss features that affect its transmission , including genetic susceptibility , pathogenesis , and agent strain variability. Finally , we discuss evidence that speaks to the potential for zoonotic transmission of this emerging disease.
