  Newborns with lung immaturity often require continuous monitoring and treatment of their lung ventilation in intensive care units , especially if born preterm. Recent studies indicate that electrical impedance tomography ( EIT) is feasible in newborn infants and children , and can quantitatively identify changes in regional lung aeration and ventilation following alterations to respiratory conditions. Information on the patient-specific shape of the torso and its role in minimizing the artefacts in the reconstructed images can improve the accuracy of the clinical parameters obtained from EIT. Currently , only idealized models or those segmented from CT scans are usually adopted. This study presents and compares two methodologies that can detect the patient-specific torso shape by means of wearable devices based on ( 1) previously reported bend sensor technology , and ( 2) a novel approach based on the use of accelerometers. The reconstruction of different phantoms , taking into account anatomical asymmetries and different sizes , are produced for comparison. As a result , the accelerometers are more versatile than bend sensors , which can not be used on bigger cross-sections. The computational study estimates the optimal number of accelerometers required in order to generate an image reconstruction comparable to the use of a CT scan as the forward model. Furthermore , since the patient position is crucial to monitoring lung ventilation , the orientation of the phantoms is automatically detected by the accelerometer-based method.
