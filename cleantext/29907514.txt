  Clinical concern remains regarding the relationship between consecutive ( QD) versus nonconsecutive ( QoD) lung stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT) treatment schedules and outcomes for clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). We examined a multi-institutional series of patients receiving 5-fraction lung SBRT to compare the local failure rates and overall survival between patients receiving QD versus QoD treatment. Lung SBRT databases from 2 high-volume institutions were combined , and patients receiving 5-fraction SBRT for a solitary stage I NSCLC were identified. QD treatment was defined as completing SBRT in â‰¤ 7 days , whereas QoD treatment was defined as completing treatment in > 7 days. To control for patient characteristics between the 2 institutions , a 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify variables independently associated with local failure , and Cox proportional hazards modeling to identify variables independently associated with increased mortality. From 2005 through 2016 , 245 clinical stage I NSCLC patients receiving 5-fraction SBRT were identified. A total of 117 ( 47.8 %) patients received QD treatment and 128 ( 52.2 %) patients received QoD treatment. On propensity-matched analysis , no association was seen between QD treatment and local failure ( odds ratio ( OR) for QD treatment , 0.48; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.12-1.99; P = .5). On multivariable logistic regression , central tumors were independently associated with increased likelihood of local recurrence ( OR , 5.2; 95 % CI , 1.11-24.2; P = .04). Kaplan-Meier analysis identified no difference in median overall survival between QD versus QoD treatments ( 38.0 vs 38.0 months , log-rank P = .7) , respectively. QD treatment was not associated with an increased mortality hazard ( hazard ratio , 1.08; 95 % CI , 0.67-1.75; P = .75). This analysis demonstrated no association between QD versus QoD treatment scheduling and local control or overall survival for early-stage NSCLC.
