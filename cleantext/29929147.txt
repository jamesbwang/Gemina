  Antibiotics are widely used in human medicine and veterinary production. Residues of these compounds reach the water sources through waste or direct application ( e.g. aquaculture). The constant input of the parent drugs and their transformation products into the environment leads these pharmaceuticals to be considered as emerging pollutants. For some molecules , the pathway of degradation and formation in products is less known. To assess the impact of these substances in the environment and in the human health , it is necessary to elucidate the transformation products and their kinetic of degradation to evaluate the possible risks. In the present report , the characterization and the degradation kinetic of two widely used Î²-lactams antibiotics- amoxicillin and ampicillin- was evaluated. Surface water samples containing these antibiotics were submitted to photolysis and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with Orbitrap detection in order to establish the profile of degradation and the formation of transformation products. Results showed that the degradation of amoxicillin and ampicillin is almost complete and reach their maximum at 48 h in river water. Moreover , a database containing > 65 transformation products of amoxicillin and ampicillin was build and real samples of industrial wastewater were analyzed to investigate the occurrence of amoxicillin , ampicillin and their transformation products.
