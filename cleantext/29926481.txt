  In Phase II clinical development of a new drug , the two most important deliverables are proof of concept ( PoC) and dose ranging. Traditionally , a PoC study is designed as the first Phase II clinical trial. In this PoC , there are two treatment groups-a high dose of the study medication , against the placebo control. After the concept is proven , the next Phase II study is a dose-ranging design with many test doses. This paper proposes a two-stage design with the first stage attempting to generate an early signal of efficacy. If successful , the second stage will adopt a `` Go Fast '' plan to expand the current study and add lower study doses of the test drug to explore the efficacy dose range. Otherwise , a `` Go Slow<symptom> '' strategy is triggered , and the study will stop at a reduced sample size with high dose and placebo only.
