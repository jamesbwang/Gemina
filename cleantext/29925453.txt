  Although there is substantial literature on the impact of smoking laws , the number of studies that investigate the impact of such policies on college campuses is sparse. Using a rich data set from various waves of the American College Health Association National College Health Assessment survey for a mid-sized public university in the southern United States , we investigate a possible causal link between a limited smoking policy and smoking behaviours , health and academic outcomes among college students. We employ propensity score matching methods to control for endogeneity of unobservable characteristics. Our results show a significant reduction in the propensity to smoke cigarettes and cigars following the introduction of the policy. Further , we find that the policy has increased academic outcomes; however , it has no significant effect on student health. These findings have important policy implications for schools that are considering instituting comprehensive smoking bans on college.
