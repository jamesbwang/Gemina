  Gout commonly affects peripheral joints and is rarely found in axial joints , such as the spine and sacroiliac joints. We report a case of a patient that presented with quadriparesis who was empirically treated for spinal gout and a review of relevant literature. A 77-year-old male presented with new-onset quadriparesis that developed over 3 days. MRI imaging was suggestive of tophaceous gout of the cervical spine , but our patient refused a spinal biopsy. He was empirically treated with high-dose steroids and his upper and lower extremities weakness<symptom> started improving within 3 days and resolved completely. Although spinal gout is uncommon , this case indirectly suggests that gout should be kept as a differential diagnosis when faced with back pain or quadriparesis. This case implies that empiric treatment should be considered when radiographic evidence is suggestive of tophaceous gout of the spine.
