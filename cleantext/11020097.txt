  Previous research shows that endurance performance can be enhanced by placebo ergogenic aids. This study investigates the ergogenic placebo response , which we define as an increase in objective and physiological effort without an increase in subjective effort , in competitive cyclists. The primary objective of this study is to explore the role of supplement salience in the ergogenic placebo response , while the secondary aim is to assess whether believing to have taken an inactive placebo supplement attenuates the desired ergogenic effect. We employed a double-blind placebo-controlled study design and compared a high salience ( pudding) to a low salience ( capsules) ergogenic placebo supplement and to a no treatment control group. Thirty-four male athletes ( 30.0 Â± 5.7 years) performed two self-regulated time trials on an isokinetic cycling ergometer , one without intervention serving as a baseline and one with intervention according to group assignment. At both time trials , power output ( objective effort) , blood lactate ( physiological effort) and the rating of perceived exertion ( subjective effort) were measured. Receiving a high salience supplement can increase physiological and objective effort without a proportional rise in subjective effort , suggesting a decoupling of perceived exertion and endurance performance. Low salience and control group both showed no such ergogenic placebo response. Athletes ' belief concerning the true nature of the ergogenic aid ( inactive placebo vs. ergogenic supplement) did not influence the ergogenic placebo response. High salience placebo ergogenic aids can elicit enhanced performance without the athlete noticing ( exertion) , and deception of athletes seems unnecessary as even believing to have received an inactive placebo supplement maintains the ergogenic placebo response.
