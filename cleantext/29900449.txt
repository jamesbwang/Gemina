  Exploring new liquid electrolyte materials is a fundamental target for developing new high-performance lithium-ion batteries. In contrast to solid materials , disordered liquid solution properties have been less studied by data-driven information techniques. Here , we examined the estimation accuracy and efficiency of three information techniques , multiple linear regression ( MLR) , least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO) , and exhaustive search with linear regression ( ES-LiR) , by using coordination energy and melting point as test liquid properties. We then confirmed that ES-LiR gives the most accurate estimation among the techniques. We also found that ES-LiR can provide the relationship between the `` prediction accuracy '' and `` calculation cost '' of the properties via a weight diagram of descriptors. This technique makes it possible to choose the balance<symptom> of the `` accuracy '' and `` cost '' when the search of a huge amount of new materials was carried out.
