  We report accurate phase stabilization of an interlocking pair of Kerr-microresonator frequency combs. The two combs , one based on silicon nitride and one on silica , feature nearly harmonic repetition frequencies and can be generated with one laser. The silicon-nitride comb supports an ultrafast-laser regime with three-optical-cycle , 1-picosecond-period soliton pulses and a total dispersive-wave-enhanced bandwidth of 170 THz , while providing a stable phase-link between optical and microwave frequencies. We demonstrate nanofabrication control of the silicon-nitride comb 's carrier-envelope offset frequency and spectral profile. The phase-locked combs coherently reproduce their clock with a fractional precision of < 6 Ã— 10
