  Temporary circulatory support ( TCS) with short-term mechanical circulatory support ( MCS) devices is increasingly used as a salvage therapy for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock<symptom>. This article provides an overview of current devices , their indications and management , and discusses results of recent case series and trials. Percutaneous active MCS devices ( Impella , TandemHeart...) and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( VA-ECMO) are utilized as a bridge to ` decision ' that includes weaning after cardiac function recovery , transplantation , long-term MCS and withdrawal in case of futility. VA-ECMO is considered the first-line TCS since it allows rapid improvement in oxygenation , is less expensive , and is also suitable for patients with biventricular failure. Combining Impella or intra-aortic balloon pump support with ECMO might decrease left ventricular pressure and improve outcomes. Sepsis-associated cardiomyopathy , massive pulmonary embolism , arrhythmic storm and Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy are among emerging indications for TCS. TCS have become the cornerstone of the management of patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> , although the evidence supporting their efficacy is limited. VA-ECMO is considered the first-line option , with a growing number of accepted and emerging indications. Randomized clinical trials are now needed to determine the respective place of different MCS devices in cardiogenic shock<symptom> treatment strategies.
