  This study aimed to assess the number and profiles of patients initializing peritoneal dialysis form the Henan Peritoneal Dialysis Registry , a provincial database in central China. All patients aged 18 years and greater , initializing peritoneal dialysis within the province during 2007 to 2014 were included. Demographic characteristics were collected and clinical parameters included the type of renal diagnosis ( primary glomerular , secondary glomerular , and others) and recorded major comorbidities in the neural , cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , and endocrine systems. Laboratory measurements at treatment including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were also determined. Differences , as a temporal trend over the period , were analyzed using a nonparametric test for trend across ordered groups. A total of 2540 patients were included. The number of patients increased rapidly by 8-fold from 2007 ( n = 70) to 2014 ( n = 592). Overall , 40 % were 55 years and older , and 60 % were females. Forty-five percent of the patients were diagnosed with primary glomerular disease; 40 % , secondary glomerular disease; and 15 % , other kidney diseases. Half of the patients had comorbid conditions in cardiovascular system , followed by conditions in of the endocrine ( 15 %) and neural ( 5 %) systems. Over the study period , trends were in favor of more proportions of younger patients , female patients , and patients with secondary glomerular disease. Peritoneal dialysis care increased rapidly in central region of China , with more younger and female patients over the study period.
