  Interfragmental ischaemia is a prerequisite for the initiation of the inflammatory and immunological response to fracturing of bone.Intrafragmental ischaemia is inevitable: the extent of the initial ischaemic insult does not , however , directly relate to the outcome for healing of the fracture zones and avascular necrosis<symptom> of the humeral head. The survival of distal regions of fragments with critical perfusion may be the result of a type of inosculation ( blood vessel contact) , which establishes reperfusion before either revascularization or neo-angiogenesis has occurred.Periosteum has a poorly defined role in fracture healing in the proximal humerus. The metaphyseal periosteal perfusion may have a profound effect , as yet undefined , on the healing of most metaphyseal fractures of the proximal humerus , and may be disturbed further by inadvertent surgical manipulation.The metaphysis can be considered as a ` torus ' or ring of bone , its surface covered by periosteum antero- and posterolaterally , through which the tuberosity segments gain perfusion and capsular reflections antero- and posteromedially , through which the humeral head ( articular) fragment gains perfusion.The torus is broken in relatively simple primary patterns: a fracture line at the upper surface of the torus is an anatomical ` neck ' fracture; a fracture line at the lower surface of the torus is the surgical ` neck ' fracture. Secondary fragmentation ( through compression and/or distraction) of the torus itself creates complexity for analysis ( classification) , alters the capacity and outcome for healing ( by variable interruption of the fragmental blood supply) and influences interfragmental stability.
