  The number of migrants has increased globally. This phenomenon has contributed to increasing health problems amongst migrants in high-income countries , including vulnerability for HIV<pathogen> acquisition and other sexual health issues. Adaptation processes in destination countries can present difficulties for migrants to seek help from and gain access to health services. This study examined migrants & rsquo; from sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA) and South East Asia ( SEA) sexual health help-seeking behavior in high-income countries with universal health coverage. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. Several databases were searched from 2000 to 2017. Of 2824 studies , 15 met the inclusion criteria. These consisted of 12 qualitative and three quantitative studies conducted in Australia , Spain , the United Kingdom , Belgium , Scotland , Ireland , and Sweden. Migrants experienced a range of difficulties accessing health services , specifically those related to sexual health , in high-income countries. Few studies described sources of sexual health help-seeking or facilitators to help-seeking. Barriers to access were numerous , including: stigma , direct and indirect costs , difficulty navigating health systems in destination countries and lack of cultural competency within health services. More culturally secure health services , increased health service literacy and policy support to mitigate costs , will improve health service access for migrants from SSA and SEA. Addressing the structural drivers for stigma and discrimination remains an ongoing and critical challenge.
