  Perioperative shivering during cesarean sections ( CSs) under neuraxial anesthesia ( NA) is clinically common but often under-treated. It may prominently increase oxygen consumption , which can be catastrophic for parturients with ischemic cardiovascular disease. Thus , the prevention and treatment of shivering may be of great significance in parturients. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of several drugs on shivering prevention and treatment during CSs under NA. A literature search was carried out using PubMed , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies. After literature screening and information extraction , a systematic review was performed. Eighteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine effectively reduced shivering , but effectiveness depended on the dose administered. Intrathecal fentanyl , intrathecal sufentanil , intrathecal meperidine , intravenous ketamine and intravenous tramadol were beneficial for reducing shivering during CSs under NA. MgSO4 administered intrathecally resulted in transient alleviation of shivering , and the effect did not persist. Two trials investigated the antishivering effect of intravenous ondansetron. The medication appeared to be effective in one trial , but ineffective in the other. Appropriate use of dexmedetomidine , fentanyl , sufentanil , ketamine , meperidine , tramadol and MgSO4 may effectively reduce the incidence and severity of shivering during CSs under NA , while trials on the effect of intravenous ondansetron reached inconclusive results.
