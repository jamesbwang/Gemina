  In metazoan cells , only a limited number of mini chromosome maintenance ( MCM) complexes are fired during S phase , while the majority remain dormant. Several methods have been used to map replication origins , but such methods can not identify dormant origins. Herein , we determined MCM7-binding sites in human cells using ChIP-Seq , classified them into firing and dormant origins using origin data and analysed their association with various chromatin signatures. Firing origins , but not dormant origins , were well correlated with open chromatin regions and were enriched upstream of transcription start sites ( TSSs) of transcribed genes. Aggregation plots of MCM7 signals revealed minimal difference in the efficacy of MCM loading between firing and dormant origins. We also analysed common fragile sites ( CFSs) and found a low density of origins at these sites. Nevertheless , firing origins were enriched upstream of the TSSs. Based on the results , we propose a model in which excessive MCMs are actively loaded in a genome-wide manner , irrespective of chromatin status , but only a fraction are passively fired in chromatin areas with an accessible open structure , such as regions upstream of TSSs of transcribed genes. This plasticity in the specification of replication origins may minimize collisions between replication and transcription.
