  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) are a major component of the colorectal cancer ( CRC) tumor microenvironment. CAFs play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis , partly through the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) signaling pathway. We investigated whether the TGF-β family co-receptor endoglin is involved in CAF-mediated invasion and metastasis. CAF-specific endoglin expression was studied in CRC resection specimens using immunohistochemistry and related to metastases-free survival. Endoglin-mediated invasion was assessed in vitro by transwell invasion , using primary CRC-derived CAFs. Effects of CAF-specific endoglin expression on tumor cell invasion were investigated in a CRC zebrafish model , while liver metastases were assessed in a mouse model. CAFs specifically at invasive borders of CRC express endoglin and increased expression intensity correlated with increased disease stage. Endoglin-expressing CAFs were also detected in lymph node and liver metastases , suggesting a role in CRC metastasis formation. In stage-II CRC , CAF-specific endoglin expression at invasive borders correlated with poor metastasis-free survival. In vitro experiments revealed that endoglin is indispensable for bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) -9-induced signaling and CAF survival. Targeting endoglin using the neutralizing antibody TRC105 inhibited CAF invasion in vitro. In zebrafish , endoglin-expressing fibroblasts enhanced colorectal tumor cell infiltration into the liver and decreased survival. Finally , CAF-specific endoglin targeting with TRC105 decreased metastatic spread of CRC cells to the mouse liver. Endoglin-expressing CAFs contribute to CRC progression and metastasis. TRC105 Treatment inhibits CAF invasion and tumor metastasis , indicating an additional target beyond the angiogenic endothelium , possibly contributing to beneficial effects reported during clinical evaluations.
