  Pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( PF) , characterized by the destruction of lung tissue architecture and the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix ( ECM) proteins , currently has no satisfactory treatment. The role of microRNA ( miR) -21 in PF has been reported; the current study attempted to investigate a novel molecular mechanism by which miR-21 exerted its function. Consistent with previous studies , miR-21 inhibition reduced ECM protein levels in bleomycin ( BLM)- induced mouse model of PF. In human pulmonary fibroblast ( IMR-90) , miR-21 inhibition reduced transforming growth factor β1 ( TGFβ1)- induced ECM protein expression. Regarding a novel molecular mechanism , TGFβ1 combined with TGFβ1 receptor 1 ( TGFβ1RI) to activate SMAD2/3 , promote SMAD4 nucleus transformation , and thus regulate miR-21 expression and ECM. SMAD3 and SMADs complex could bind to the promoter region of miR-21 to promote miR-21 expression. In conclusion , miR-21 exerts promotive effects on BLM-induced PF and TGFβ1-induced ECM in IMR-90; TGFβ1 combines with TGFβ1RI to activate SMAD2/3 , promote SMAD4 nucleus transformation , promote miR-21 expression , and thus to promote BLM-induced PF and TGFβ1-induced ECM in IMR-90 cells.
