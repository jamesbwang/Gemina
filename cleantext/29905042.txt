  To evaluate the long-term efficacy and influencing factors of cervical artificial disc replacement ( CADR) for patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy ( CSR). The data of 29 CSR patients who underwent Bryan artificial disc replacement between December 2003 and December 2007 and followed up more than 10 years were retrospectively analysed. There were 16 males and 13 females with an average age of 54.1 years ( range , 40-70 years). The disease duration was 2-144 months ( mean , 19.2 months). CT and MRI were performed before operation to identify the compression segments ( C All patients were followed up 121-153 months ( mean , 130 months). The results of radiographic evaluation indexes showed that within group comparison , except that the Cobb angle of the operated level was significantly decreased ( CADR has satisfied long-term efficacy in treating CSR. The maintenance of segmental mobility was better in patients with disc herniation than in patients with disc herniation and osteophyte.
