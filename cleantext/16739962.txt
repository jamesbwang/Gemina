  The marine sponge Explants were cultured in four long-term experiments ( 19 and 31 months at ca. 2.5 m depth) , to determine the suitability of new culture techniques by testing substrata and seeding time ( season) , and monitoring survival and growth. Explants were excised and grown in an experimental plant close to the wild donor sponge population. Percentage growth rate ( GR %) was measured in terms of surface cover area , and explant survival was monitored Explant survival was high throughout the trial , ranging from 78.57 % to 92.85 % on travertine tiles and from 50 % to 71.42 % on oyster shells. A few instances of sponge regression were observed. Explant cover area correlated positively with season on two substrata , i.e. , tiles and shells. The surface cover area and GR % of explants were measured in the starting phase and monitored up to the end of the trial. High GR % values were observed both on tiles ( > 21 %) and on oyster shells ( > 15 %). The data on the behaviour and life-style of cultured fragments , together with an increase > 2,400 % in cover area , demonstrate that
