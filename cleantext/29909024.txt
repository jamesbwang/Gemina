  The study aim was to describe the feasibility of conducting a coaching training intervention on use of level of assistance strategies for Certified Nursing Assistants ( CNAs) in nursing homes. CNAs received either traditional or coaching training. Feasibility of coaching training was evaluated by determining: acceptability , through use of a Post-Intervention Evaluation Form; fidelity , by adherence to protocol; recruitment and retention , by ease of obtaining the sample and retention rates; and ability to randomize within each home without contamination. CNAs ' mean satisfaction score of the coach training was high ( 4.5 out of 5). Eighteen of 22 comments on the evaluation form were positive. At least six dyads were recruited within the 60-day benchmark in each home. CNA and resident retention rates were 89.47 % and 85 % , respectively. Eighty-nine percent of intervention group CNAs shared study information , demonstrating contamination. The coaching training intervention is feasible. Findings revealed areas to improve the intervention.
