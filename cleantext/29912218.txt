  The term `` dual diagnosis '' ( DD) has been used in clinical practice for years. However , there is confusion<symptom> about these medical cases , which consist in the presence of both a psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse disorder ( in this case , alcohol). There are evidences that in the alcohol use disorder ( AUD) population , 50.3 % of patients had a psychiatric comorbidity during their lifetime. Nevertheless , to these days there are not any thorough guidelines for the management of these patients. A precise nosography would prevent delay in diagnosis and treatment and all the self-evident negative outcomes of those delays. A literature search was performed in PubMed , Web of Science , and Scopus , including studies published between 1980 and 2015. Search terms were: `` guidelines '' , `` treatment '' , `` comorbidity '' , `` substance abuse '' , `` alcohol '' , `` dual-diagnosis '' , `` etiopathogenesis '' , `` outpatient '' , `` inpatient '' , `` unit '' , `` diagnosis ''. Out of 1045 titles , 43 studies were included in this article for their relevance on definition and nosography of DD. Taking into account the state of art available in the literature , we contributed to clarify the definition of DD in the alcohol addiction field. Clinical data confirm high prevalence of DD , and allow to better describe and understand the complex relationship between alcohol dependence and other psychiatric diseases. We believe that a clear nosographic framework and a precise diagnostic process are essential for a timely management of every case , using specific guidelines to standardize and improve clinical practice. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5) , which introduces dimensional approach , could be a useful tool to improve diagnostic accuracy.
