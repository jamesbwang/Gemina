  Dislocation imaging using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) has been an invaluable tool for characterizing crystallographic defects in metals. Compared to conventional TEM imaging , diffraction contrast imaging scanning transmission electron microscopy ( DCI STEM) with appropriate setting can provide better defect contrast with almost negligible bend contour artifacts , enabling more effective analysis of dislocation structures. Here , we investigated why STEM can suppresses bend contour , and how dislocation contrast behaves along with different STEM imaging parameters. Using a body-centered cubic HT-9 ferritic/martensitic alloy as an example , a simple procedure and operational theory are described at the beginning to help set up DCI STEM experiments. Comparing with conventional TEM and the STEM strictly complying with the principle of reciprocity , we found that a pair of STEM convergence and collection semi-angles , Î±
