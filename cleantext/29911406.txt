  For centuries , philosophers and social theorists have wondered why people submit voluntarily to tyrannical leaders and oppressive regimes. In this article , we speculate on the evolutionary origins of system justification , that is , the ways in which people are motivated ( often nonconsciously) to defend and justify existing social , economic , and political systems. After briefly recounting the logic of system justification theory and some of the most pertinent empirical evidence , we consider parallels between the social behaviors of humans and other animals concerning the acceptance versus rejection of hierarchy and dominance. Next , we summarize research in human neuroscience suggesting that specific brain regions , such as the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex , may be linked to individual differences in ideological preferences concerning ( in) equality and social stability as well as the successful navigation of complex , hierarchical social systems. Finally , we consider some of the implications of a system justification perspective for the study of evolutionary psychology , political behavior , and social change.
