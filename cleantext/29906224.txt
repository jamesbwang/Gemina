  The goal of this study was to examine the effect of 1-week of high salt ( HS) intake and the role of oxidative stress in changing the mechanisms of flow-induced dilation ( FID) in isolated pressurized middle cerebral arteries ( MCA) of male Sprague-Dawley rats ( N = 15-16/ per group). Reduced FID in the HS group was restored by intake of the superoxide scavenger TEMPOL ( HS+TEMPOL in vivo group). Nitric oxide synthases ( NOS) inhibitor N
