  This paper examined measurement invariance ( MI) , both across gender and over time , of the Satisfaction With Life Scale adapted for Children ( SWLS-C). Adapted from the adult SWLS , the SWLS-C is a self-report measure for children and adolescents to assess their life satisfaction. The sample comprised elementary school students in British Columbia , Canada ( n = 4,026) who responded to the SWLS-C in Grade 4 ( M ( age) = 9.3 , SD = 0.6; 48.9 % girls) and approximately 3 years later in Grade 7. We examined MI regarding gender , time , and both gender and time ( i.e. , interactional invariance) using Clustered Repeated Measures Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis with a mean- and variance-adjusted weighted least squares ( WLSMV) estimation. Residual invariance by gender was supported at Grades 4 and 7; scalar invariance was supported longitudinally for each gender and overall. In the `` interactional '' model , including gender and time , analyses indicated scalar MI , but not residual MI. Analyses of latent factor means indicated that SWLS-C scores significantly decreased for both girls and boys from Grade 4 to Grade 7. The decrease was more pronounced for girls , but gender differences at either age were not significant. The pattern of observed mean scores differed , as it indicated no significant decrease for boys ' SWLS-C scores , but significant gender differences at both time points. However , given the lack of residual invariance , comparisons of observed SWLS-C mean scores across gender and over time may be compromised. The different results for latent and observed mean SWLS-C scores highlight the importance of routinely conducting MI analyses for group comparisons. ( PsycINFO Database Record
