  Spontaneous brain activity is characterized in part by a balanced asynchronous chaotic state. Cortical recordings show that excitatory ( E) and inhibitory ( I) drivings in the E-I balanced state are substantially larger than the overall input. We show that such a state arises naturally in fully adapting networks which are deterministic , autonomously active and not subject to stochastic external or internal drivings. Temporary imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory inputs lead to large but short-lived activity bursts that stabilize irregular dynamics. We simulate autonomous networks of rate-encoding neurons for which all synaptic weights are plastic and subject to a Hebbian plasticity rule , the flux rule , that can be derived from the stationarity principle of statistical learning. Moreover , the average firing rate is regulated individually via a standard homeostatic adaption of the bias of each neuron 's input-output non-linear function. Additionally , networks with and without short-term plasticity are considered. E-I balance<symptom> may arise only when the mean excitatory and inhibitory weights are themselves balanced , modulo the overall activity level. We show that synaptic weight balance<symptom> , which has been considered hitherto as given , naturally arises in autonomous neural networks when the here considered self-limiting Hebbian synaptic plasticity rule is continuously active.
