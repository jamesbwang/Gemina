  LIM kinases are involved in various pathophysiological processes that depend on actin organization. Alteration of microtubule dynamics by LIMK dysregulation is in fact related to tumor progression and metastasis , viral<disease> infection<disease> , and ocular diseases , such as glaucoma. As a consequence , many efforts have been done in recent years to rationally design small molecules able to inhibit LIMK activity selectively , without affecting other kinases. As a result , compounds optimized in terms of binding affinity and pharmacokinetic parameters have been discovered , that however failed to access clinical trials. In this review , a comprehensive survey of recent LIMK inhibitors is reported , together with SAR considerations and optimization processes.
