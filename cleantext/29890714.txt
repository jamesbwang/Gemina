  In wireless powered communication networks ( WPCNs) , the harvested energy varies greatly among user nodes ( UNs) , resulting in throughput unfairness. Since the harvested energy is limited , each UN must strategically allocate the energy used for forwarding the other nodes & rsquo; information and for transmitting its own information , which further aggravates the global unfairness in terms of throughput. In this paper , we leverage user cooperation in multi-hop transmission to improve the throughput fairness. We formulate the fairness problem as the max-min throughput with resource allocation , which is NP-hard. We design an approximate algorithm to address this problem. The theoretical proof and the simulation results both show that the proposed algorithm provides tight upper and lower bounds for the optimal solution. Compared with the benchmark methods , our proposed method significantly enhances the throughput fairness for WPCNs.
