  The purpose of this study was to evaluate ceramic dental implants using different esthetic scores. A total of 53 ceramic dental implants were evaluated using the Pink Esthetic Score ( PES) , White Esthetic Score ( WES) , and Peri-Implant and Crown Index ( PICI). Prosthodontists , orthodontists , oral surgeons , and dentistry students independently performed assessments. The mean value of combined PES + WES was 17.4 points , and the PICI was 523.2 points. Orthodontists assessed a significantly lower result in both indices compared to all other assessor groups ( P â‰¤ .05). Patient satisfaction was very high. The esthetic scores around ceramic implants were considerably higher than the suggested threshold of clinical acceptability.
