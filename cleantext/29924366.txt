  Preparation for age-related changes is a central task in midlife and older age and a determinant of functioning and well-being in later life. If and how people prepare is influenced by societal and institutional circumstances and also by beliefs about aging and the future. We assessed domain-specific preparation for age-related changes in samples from three countries with high population aging but different premises regarding preparation , and analyzed data from N = 1,830 individuals aged 35-85 years from urban regions in Germany , the USA , as well as China ( Hong Kong). Preparation was universally low in Hong Kong , but the amount of differences between countries varied depending on life domain. While we found pronounced differences between all three countries for domains related to public provision ( such as health care , work , and finances) , East-West differences in preparation emerged for domains regarding social relations and end-of-life concerns. The concreteness of time perspective and future self-views mediated country differences in preparation. Our results speak for the culture-specificity of preparing for old age and we deliver evidence on psychological variables that might explain these differences.
