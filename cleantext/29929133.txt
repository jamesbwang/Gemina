  Recently we found that direct exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) to multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) might induce toxicological responses through the modulation of ER stress gene expression , but whether this signal could be transferred from other cells to endothelial cells ( ECs) is unknown. This study investigated the toxicity of pristine and carboxylated MWCNTs to HUVECs and alveolar-endothelial co-culture , the later of which could mimic the possible signaling communications between ECs and MWCNT exposed alveolar cells. The results showed that direct contact with high levels of MWCNTs induced cytotoxicity and modulated expression of genes associated with ER stress ( HSPA5 , DDIT3 and XBP-1s) and autophagy ( BECN1 and ATG12) both in A549-THP-1 macrophages cultured in the upper chambers as well as HUVECs. However , most of these responses were minimal or negligible in HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers. Moreover , significantly increased cytokine release ( interleukin-6 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was only observed in MWCNT exposed HUVECs ( p < 0.01) but not HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers ( p > 0.05). The minimal or even absent response was likely due to relatively low translocation of MWCNTs from upper chambers to lower chambers , whereas A549-macrophages cultured in the upper chambers internalized large amount MWCNTs. The results indicated that ER stress-autophagy signaling might not be able to transfer from alveolar cells to endothelial cells unless sufficient MWCNTs are translocated.
