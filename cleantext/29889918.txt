  To accurately assess the long-term performance of anodized-surface implants , more data monitoring is needed outside of clinical evaluations. This retrospective study evaluated long-term implant survival and bone remodeling after up to 12 years of function. Data from 195 implants placed in 60 patients over a follow-up period ranging from 0.6 to 12.1 years were included. The implant-level survival rate was 99.0 %. Marginal bone loss remained low across all follow-up cohorts. The data show that anodized-surface implants are a safe , reliable option with high implant survival rates and low levels of bone loss.
