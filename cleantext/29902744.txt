  Since ultraviolet light emitting diodes ( UV-LEDs) have emerged as an alternative light source for UV disinfection systems , enhancement of reactor performance is a demanding challenge to promote its practical application in water treatment process. This study explored the underlying mechanism of the inefficiency observed in flow-through mode UV disinfection tests to improve the light utilization of UV-LED applications. In particular , the disinfection performance of UV-LED reactors was evaluated using two different flow channel types , reservoir and pathway systems , in order to elucidate the impact of physical circumstances on germicidal efficiency as the light profile was adjusted. Overall , a significant reduction in germicidal efficiency was observed when exposure time was prolonged or a mixing chamber was integrated. Zeta analysis revealed that the repulsion rate between microorganisms decreased with UV fluence transfer , and that change might cause the shielding effect of UV delivery to target microorganisms. In line with the above findings , the reduction in efficiency intensified when opportunities for microbial collision increased. Thus , UV induced microbial aggregation was implicated as being a disinfection hindering factor , exerting its effect through uneven UV illumination. Ultimately , the results refuted the prevailing belief that UV has a cumulative effect. We found that the reservoir system achieved worse performance than the pathway system despite it providing 15 times higher UV fluence: the differences in germicidal efficiency were 1-log , 1.4-log and 1.7-log in the cases of P.aeruginosa , E.coli and S.aureus , respectively.
