  Injuries of the central nervous system ( CNS) can cause serious and permanent disability due to limited regeneration ability of the CNS. Presently available therapies are focused on lesion<symptom> spreading inhibition rather than on tissue regeneration. Recent investigations in the field of neural tissue engineering indicate extremely promising properties of novel injectable and non-injectable hydrogels which are tailored to serve as biodegradable scaffolds for CNS regeneration. This review discusses the state-of-the-art and barriers in application of novel polymer-based hydrogels without and with nanoparticles for CNS regeneration. Pure hydrogels suffer from lack of similarities to natural neural tissue. Many of the biological studies indicated nano-additives in hydrogels may improve their topography , mechanical properties , electroconductivity and biological functions. The most promising biomaterials which meet the requirements of CNS tissue engineering seem to be injectable thermosensitive hydrogels loaded with specific micro-and nanoparticles. We highlight injectable hydrogels with various micro-and nanoparticles , because of novelty and attractiveness of this type of materials for CNS regeneration and future development perspectives.
