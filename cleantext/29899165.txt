  Osteosarcoma is a disease prone to recurrence and metastasis , and adenovirus<pathogen> expression vector is frequently studied as a therapeutic target of osteosarcoma in recent year. This study attempts to explore the effect of adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA ( siRNA) targeting ezrin on the proliferation , migration , invasion and apoptosis of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line was selected for construction of recombinant adenovirus<pathogen> vector. The mRNA and protein levels of ezrin , Bcl2-associated X protein ( Bax) , B cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2) , p21 , p53 , Caspase-3 , matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2) and MMP-9 , Cyclin D1 , and cyclin-dependent kinase 4a ( CDK4a) were determined. Through ELISA , the levels of Caspase-3 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 were examined. Finally , human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell viability , growth , invasion , migration , and apoptosis were detected. Initially , adenovirus<pathogen> expression vector of ezrin was constructed by ezrin 2 siRNA sequence. Adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting ezrin reduced expression of ezrin in MG-63 cells. The results revealed that adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting ezrin elevated expression levels of Bax , P21 , P53 , and Caspase-3 , Cyclin D1 , and CDK4a and reduced expression levels of Bcl-2 , MMP-2 , and MMP-9. Furthermore , adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting ezrin inhibited human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell viability , growth , invasion , and migration , and promoted apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting ezrin can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation , migration and invasion of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells.
