  Suicide is a major public health problem and is the second leading cause of death in young people worldwide. Indicating a lack of adequate treatment approaches , recent data suggest a rising suicide rate. Current approaches to suicide prevention do not sufficiently account for the specific needs of young people or the ways in which they engage with the health system , nor are they adequately theory-driven. In this paper , we review an empirically-supported theoretical model of suicide together with the latest evidence in treating young people who are at risk. We discuss the potential efficacy of social-media-based online interventions , with a particular focus on how they may be uniquely placed to target interpersonal risk factors for suicide. We highlight the risks associated with such interventions , including the potential for contagion to occur. Based on prominent theoretical models and gaps in existing treatment approaches , we propose a newly-developed , theory-driven , online social-networking-based intervention for suicide prevention in young people.
