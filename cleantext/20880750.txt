  Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , often experienced as more debilitating for patients and caregivers than motor problems. Therefore , a deeper understanding of the course of cognitive decline and the identification of valid progression markers for Parkinson 's disease dementia ( PDD) is essential. This systematic review summarizes the current state of knowledge on cognitive decline over time by reporting effect sizes of cognitive changes in neuropsychological tests. 1368 studies were identified by a PubMed database search and 25 studies by additionally scanning previous literature. After screening all records , including 69 full-text article reviews , 12 longitudinal studies on the progression of cognitive decline in PD met our criteria ( e.g. , sample size â‰¥ 50 patients). Only a few studies monitored cognitive decline over a longer period ( > 4 years). Most studies focused on the evaluation of change in global cognitive state by use of the Mini-Mental State Examination , whereas the use of neuropsychological tests was highly heterogenic among studies. Only one study evaluated patients ' cognitive performance in all specified domains ( executive function , attention & working memory , memory , language , and visual-spatial function) allowing for diagnosis of cognitive impairment according to consensus guidelines. Medium to strong effect sizes could only be observed in studies with follow-up intervals of four years or longer. The results emphasize the need for the assessment of larger PD cohorts over longer periods of follow-up with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.
