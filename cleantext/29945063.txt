  Tiny calcified structures may be occasionally recovered during excavation of human skeletal remains. Since taphonomic processes may displace these structures from their topographical relation with neighbouring organs or bones , differential diagnoses may pose a major challenge to the archeologist and/or anthropologist. Enteroliths , kidney stones or gallstones , phleboliths , calcified ganglia , or sesamoid bones account for most of such calcified tiny structures. In addition to their pure medical/paleopathological interest , some remains may be related to diet , to chronic haemolytic conditions , and/or to infections or chronic intestinal diseases. We here describe the technical procedures carried out to confirm or refute the identification of a sesamoid bone. The object in question was a small ( 5 × 3 × 2 mm) calcified structure that appeared over the right coxal bone of an 18
