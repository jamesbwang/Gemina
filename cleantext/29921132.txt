  Point-of-care ( POC) testing is becoming increasingly valuable in health care delivery , and it is important that the devices used meet the same quality criteria as main laboratory analyzers. While external quality assessment ( EQA) provides a great tool for assessing quality , many POC devices are not enrolled in these schemes and standard laboratory evaluations are needed to assess performance. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI) protocols EP-5 and EP-9 were applied to investigate imprecision , accuracy and bias. We assessed bias using the mean of 4 certified secondary reference measurement procedures ( SRMPs). The Afinion2 ™ and the Quo-Lab had CVs of ≤ 1.7 and ≤ 2.4 % respectively in IFCC SI units ( ≤ 1.2 and ≤ 1.7 % NGSP) and a bias ≤ 2 mmol/mol ( ≤ 0.2 % NGSP) at 48 and 75 mmol/mol ( 6.5 and 9.0 % NGSP). Sigma for the Afinion2 was 5.8 and for the Quo-Lab 4.0. Both methods passed the NGSP criteria with 2 instruments when compared with 4 individual SRMPs. The HbA1c 501 had a CV of 3.4 % and 2.7 % in IFCC SI units ( 2.1 % and 1.7 % NGSP) and a bias ≤ 2.4 mmol/mol ( ≤ 0.2 % NGSP) and passed the NGSP criteria with 2 instruments compared with 4 individual SRMPs except for instrument 2 compared with the Tosoh G8. Sigma was 2.1. The A1Care had a sigma of 1.4 and failed all criteria mainly due to a high CV ( 6.2 % and 4.1 % in IFCC SI units ( 4.1 % and 2.9 % NGSP) at 48 and 75 mmol/mol ( 6.5 and 9.0 % NGSP)). The analytical performance was excellent for the Afinion2 and the Quo-Lab , acceptable for the HbA1c 501 and unacceptable for the A1Care according to different used criteria , demonstrating that whilst performance is improving there are still areas for considerable improvement.
