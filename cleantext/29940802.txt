  Owing to improvements in clinical care and systemic therapy , more patients are being diagnosed with , and living longer with , spinal metastases ( SM). In parallel , tremendous technological progress has been made in the field of radiation oncology. Advances in both software and hardware are able to integrate three- ( and four-) dimensional body imaging with spatially accurate treatment delivery methods. This leads to improved efficacy , shortened treatment schedule , and potentially reduced treatment-related toxicity. Areas covered: In this review , we will look at the progress made by stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT) in the management of SM. We will review the technological factors which have enabled the widespread use of SBRT. The efficacy of SBRT , in various clinical scenarios , and associated toxicities will be reviewed. Lastly , we will discuss about patient selection and provide a five-year roadmap. Expert commentary: Spine SBRT is a safe and efficacious treatment option. Practice guidelines recommend the use of SBRT in oligometastatic patients especially those with radio-resistant cancer types , and in scenarios involving re-irradiation. SBRT offers patients dose-intensification over a short schedule which may allow less time off systemic therapy. The results of the phase III trials are eagerly awaited.
