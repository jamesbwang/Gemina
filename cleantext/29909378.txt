  A middle-aged patient with an internal carotid-posterior communicating artery aneurysm<disease> and basilar artery tip aneurysm<disease> was treated by stent-assisted coiling. One ischemic infarction and two transient ischemic attacks occurred with the same symptoms ( inability to walk unassisted and tendency to fall to the left) during the first 2 years post-treatment. The ischemic infarction was found in the right side of the pons , consistent with the vascular territory of the stent-containing vessel. The cause of the delayed ischemic stroke was investigated on DSA and cone beam CT , which revealed that the proximal end of the stent , one marker band , was just covering a small perforating artery of the basilar artery trunk. The present case suggests that marker band occlusion can induce delayed ischemic stroke. To prevent this complication , it is important to evaluate the perforating vessels preoperatively and carefully deploy a stent for the marker band to avoid occlusion of large perforating vessels. Post-treatment evaluation is also important because dual antiplatelet therapy will be required for a longer period if an artery is occluded by a marker band.
