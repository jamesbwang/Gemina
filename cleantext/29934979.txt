  A novel ferrocene-linked organic-inorganic hybrid porous polymer has been successfully prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction of octavinylsilsesquioxane and ferrocene. The relationship of structure/property was investigated by FTIR , NMR , XRD , BET et.al. The obtained porous polymer exhibits a high surface area of 1015 m2 g-1 and a hierarchical pore structure. It could be well applied to wastewater treatment with the adsorption capacity up to 1683 mg g-1 for Congo red ( CR) , 1083 mg g-1 for Crystal violet ( CV) , 1003 mg g-1 for Rhodamine B ( RB) , 441 mg g-1 for Methylene blue ( MB) , 191 mg g-1 for Hg2 + and 328 mg g-1 for Pb2 + , respectively. Remarkably , it could be easily regenerated and the removal efficiency remains almost constant even after six cycles.
