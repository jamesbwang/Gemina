  Vestibular schwannomas ( VSs) can cause serious neurological defects including hearing loss and facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. The aim of this study is to identify whether Hippo signaling could be potential targetable pathway for clinical treatment in VSs. Gene expression profiling was performed in ten sporadic VSs and four normal nerves to identify aberrant genes expression of the Hippo pathway. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were both used to examine the expression of Hippo core components in twenty VS samples. NF2 gene sequencing were also performed in all tumors using sanger sequencing. Verteporfin , inhibitor of YAP-TEAD , was used to assess the effect of proliferation inhibition in human primary VS cells and RT4-D6P2T cell line. We found fifty-one differentially expressed genes of Hippo pathway between VSs and normal controls. Unsupervised analysis identified the two molecular variants that significantly related with distinct NF2 mutation status. The phosphorylation levels of LAST1 and YAP were significantly decreased in NF2-mutated VSs compared with wild-type VSs and normal nerves. Immunohistochemical staining showed that increased nuclear YAP expression in VSs was positively correlated with high Ki-67 index and low Merlin expression. Verteporfin reduced viability of primary VS cells and RT4-D6P2T cells. Our findings implicate that deregulation of the Hippo pathway as a molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in human VSs , and suggest inhibition of this pathway as a potential treatment strategy.
