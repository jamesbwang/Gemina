  Although at first glance the diversity of the immunoglobulin repertoire appears random , there are a number of mechanisms that act to constrain diversity. For example , key mechanisms controlling the diversity of the third complementarity determining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( CDR-H3) include natural selection of germline diversity ( D
