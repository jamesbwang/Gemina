  Since the borderline changes suspicious for acute T-cell-mediated rejection ( BL) category was broadened , there has been a debate regarding the right threshold for tubulitis ( t) and interstitial inflammation<symptom> ( i) scores. We studied a first cohort of 111 patients with BL found on an indication biopsy between 2006 and 2016 and compared those with scores of t1i0 ( BLt1i0) to those with higher scores ( BL ≥ t1i1). A second cohort of 56 patients with BL was used for external validation. We used a composite endpoint of death-censored graft failure or doubling of the serum creatinine level postbiopsy. In the first cohort , sixty-eight percent ( 75/111) of the BL cases fell in the BLt1i0 group. The occurrence of the composite endpoint was 5 % and 14 % for BLt1i0 and BL ≥ t1i1 , respectively. In contrast , the endpoint occurred in 5 % of nonrejectors and 21 % of patients with T-cell-mediated rejection ( TCMR). In the validation cohort , 8 % versus 36 % of BLt1i0 and BL ≥ t1i1 reached the endpoint , respectively. Multivariable Cox modeling revealed that BLt1i0 patients had a prognosis similar to that of nonrejectors ( adjusted hazard ratio , HR 0.6 , 95 % confidence interval 0.1 to 2.2 , P = 0.40) but better than that of patients with BL ≥ t1i1 ( HR 3.8 , 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 11.5 , P = 0.02). Sensitivity analyses restricted to death-censored graft loss or using time post transplant as the time of reference provided similar results. In summary , patients with BLt1i0 have a different prognosis to that of BL ≥ t1i1 patients , which brings into question the current diagnostic thresholds.
