  The frequency of breakfast intake has been reported to be inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular events; however , it is uncertain what the impact of the energy and nutrient intakes from breakfast are. We assessed the association between these intakes from breakfast and the risk of stroke prospectively. In a baseline survey of four Japanese communities between 1981 and 1990 , we enrolled 3 248 residents ( 1 662 men and 1 586 women) aged 40-59 years who were free from stroke and heart disease and who responded to the 24-hour dietary recall survey. We assessed the dietary intake at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and other times separately. During the median 25-year follow-up , 230 individuals ( 147 men and 83 women) developed stroke. After adjustment for age , community , other dietary intakes , and lifestyle and physiological factors , the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals) of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> for the highest versus lowest quartiles of energy intake from breakfast were 0.38 ( 0.15-0.99) in men and 1.36 ( 0.36-5.10) in women. For the major nutrients , a higher saturated or monounsaturated fat intake at breakfast was associated with a reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> in men , and remained statistically significant after further adjustment for intake of other major nutrients from breakfast. A higher intake of energy from breakfast , primarily saturated or monounsaturated fat , was associated with a reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> in Japanese men.
