  Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs) play critical roles in gastric cancer ( GC) progression and are potential targets for novel molecular-targeted agents or photo-immunotherapies. During patient selection , targeted biopsy is the first step. However , heterogeneous expression of RTKs based on the macroscopic appearance in GC has not been extensively addressed. Accordingly , in this study , we evaluated differences in RTK expression associated with macroscopic appearance in GC. In total , 375 consecutive patients who had undergone gastrectomy at the National Cancer Center Hospital East and who had histologically proven adenocarcinoma , available archived tumor sample , and no history of chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. For these cases , tissue microarray ( TMA) samples were examined using immunohistochemistry ( IHC). Based on the results of IHC , cases were selected for detailed examination. We re-evaluated IHC scores in more than three tumor blocks per case and comparatively evaluated differences in IHC expression in RTKs between the mucosal portion ( MuP) and invasive portion ( InP). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2)- , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)- , and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( c-MET)- positive rates were 6 , 9 , and 20 % , respectively. Twenty-two cases were then analyzed to assess differences in IHC expression levels in the same lesion<symptom>. Concordance rates of positive staining of HER2 , EGFR , and MET between MuP and whole tumor were 100 , 40 , and 56 % and those with InP were 46 , 100 , and 56 %. To avoid underestimating expression status , biopsies must be taken from MuP for HER2 , InP for EGFR , and both proportions for c-MET.
