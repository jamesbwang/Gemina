  To compare reverse left ventricular ( LV) remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) between patients with bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV) and tricuspid aortic valve ( TAV). We retrospectively reviewed data of patients with at least two serial echocardiographic follow-ups ( 1 , 3 , 6 months and 1 year) post-TAVR. A total of 116 patients were identified. BAV morphology was documented in 67 patients. LV mass index ( LVMi) at baseline was not significantly different between the TAV and BAV group ( 178.0 ± 6.9 vs. 166.3 ± 6.4 g/m
