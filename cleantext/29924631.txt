  Poor<symptom> prenatal development followed by rapid childhood growth conveys greater cardiometabolic risk in later life. Microswine offspring exposed to perinatal maternal protein restriction ( MPR; `` low protein offspring '' , LPO) grow poorly in late-fetal/neonatal stages. After weaning to ad libitum ( AL) diet , LPO-AL exhibit accelerated growth and fat deposition rates with low adiponectin mRNA despite low-normal body fat and small intra-abdominal adipocytes. We examined effects of caloric restriction ( CR) on growth and metabolic status in LPO and normal protein offspring ( NPO) randomized to AL or CR diets from weaning. CR transiently reduced growth in both LPO and NPO , delaying recovery in female LPO-CR. Over 7.5-12.5 wks , linear growth rates in LPO-CR were slower than LPO-AL ( P < 0.001) but exceeded NPO-AL; body<symptom> weight ( BWt) growth rates fell but were lower in LPO-CR vs. NPO-CR. Linear acceleration ceased after 12 wks. At 16 wks , percent catch-up in LPO-CR was reduced vs LPO-AL ( P < 0.001). Plasma growth hormone was low in LPO ( P < 0.02). CR normalized fat deposition rate , yet adiponectin mRNA remained low in LPO-CR ( P < 0.001); plasma adiponectin was low in all LPO-AL and in female LPO-CR. Insulin sensitivity improved during CR. We conclude that , in LPO offspring: 1) CR delays onset of- but does not abolish- accelerated linear growth despite low growth hormone; 2) CR yields stunting via delayed onset plus a finite window for linear-growth acceleration; 3) MPR lowers adiponectin mRNA independently of growth , adiposity , or adipocyte size; and 4) MPR reduces circulating adiponectin in LPO-AL and female LPO-CR , potentially enhancing cardiometabolic risk.
