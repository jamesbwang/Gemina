  Over the past decade , the incidence of revision arthroplasty has increased substantially. One of the main reasons for revision arthroplasty is periprosthetic joint infection , often resulting in multiple surgical interventions with variable success and poor clinical outcome. Intraoperative wound<disease> irrigation has been proposed to reduce bacterial contamination and thus the risk of periprosthetic infection. However , there is currently no widely accepted recommendation for the use of topical antiseptics within the operative setting for primary implantation. We performed a systematic review of studies pertaining to the use of intraoperative topical antiseptics and their effectiveness in preventing infection of orthopaedic implants. A comprehensive literature search including MEDLINE ( PubMed) , Cochrane Library , and Current Contents Medicine ( CCMED-Medpilot) was performed according to a standardised protocol. Overall , 1905 articles were initially assessed. Four studies met the inclusion criteria and remained for further analysis , comprising two prospective cohort studies using retrospective control groups ( evidence level II- III) and two randomised controlled trials ( evidence level I). 0.35 % Povidone-iodine ( PVP-I) was used in three of these studies and a solution of 6.25 % PVP-I and 6.25 %- hydrogen peroxide ( H Although no clear regimen can be recommended , the available literature indicates that the use of intraoperative topical antiseptics is of clinical relevance in preventing infection of orthopaedic implants. Further randomised controlled trials are recommended.
