  To investigate the temporal trends of postoperative radiotherapy ( RT) administration and the effects of omitting postoperative RT on breast cancer-specific survival ( BCSS) in women aged ≥ 65 years with tubular carcinoma ( TC) of the breast who received breast-conserving surgery ( BCS). We included women aged Before PSM , a total of 1,475 patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm , node-negative disease , and estrogen receptor-positive disease were identified , including 927 ( 62.8 %) underwent postoperative RT and 548 ( 37.2 %) had postoperative omission of RT.. The administration of postoperative RT steadily declined over the study period. Patients with younger age , larger tumor size , and other race/ethnicity were more likely to receive postoperative RT.. The median follow-up duration was 85.0 months , the 5- and 10-year BCSS rates were 98.7 and 97.9 % , respectively. The median BCSS was 161.9 and 165.0 months for patients with and without postoperative RT , respectively , and the corresponding 5-year BCSS rates were 98.5 and 98.8 % , respectively ( The incidence of breast cancer-related death is probably sufficiently low to avoid postoperative RT in women aged ≥ 65 years with TC of the breast after BCS.
