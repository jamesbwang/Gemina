  Facile synthesis of C-terminal thioesters is integral to native chemical ligation ( NCL) strategies for chemical protein synthesis. Here we introduce a new method of mild peptide activation , which leverages SPPS on an established resin linker and a classical heterocyclic chemistry to convert C-terminal peptide hydrazides to their corresponding thioesters via an acyl pyrazole intermediate. Peptide hydrazides , synthesized on established trityl chloride resins , can be activated in solution with stoichiometric acetyl acetone ( acac) , readily proceed to the peptide acyl-pyrazole. Acyl pyrazoles are mild acylating agents and are efficiently exchanged with an aryl thiol , that can then be directly utilized in NCL. The mild , chemoselective , and stoichiometric activating conditions allow this method to be utilized through multiple sequential ligations without intermediate purification steps.
