  This study aims to analyze human leukocyte antigen A ( HLA-A) , human leukocyte antigen B ( HLA-B) , human leukocyte antigen C ( HLA-C) , HLA-DRB1 * , HLA-DRB3 * , HLA-DRB4 * , HLA-DRB5 * , HLA-DQB1 * loci expression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated from peripheral blood of 48 RA patients ( 22 males , 26 females; mean age 36 years; range 2 to 63 years) and 104 healthy control individuals ( 52 males , 52 females; mean age 43 years; range 2 to 76 years). Deoxyribonucleic acid samples were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers and sequence specific oligonucleotides methods. The most frequent allelic groups in RA patients were HLA-DRB1 * 01 ( odds ratio = 2.795; 95 % confidence interval: 1.441-5.421; p = 0.004) and HLA-DRB1 * 04 ( odds ratio = 2.573; 95 % confidence interval: 1.214-5.453; p = 0.023). Among RA patients , the most frequent genotype for the allelic group HLA-DRB1 * , in the light of the common epitopes theory , was observed for DRB1 * 01/DRB1 * 13. This genotype indicates an increased incidence and relative risk ( odds ratio = 11.09). The most common genotype in our RA patients was DRB1 * 01/DRB1 * 13 , which showed increased frequency and a high relative risk. This genotype variant may be considered a predisposing factor for the development of RA.
