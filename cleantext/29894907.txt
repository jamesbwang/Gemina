  This study explored how parks within the home neighborhood contribute to total physical activity ( PA) by isolating park-related PA.. Seattle-area adults ( n = 634) were observed using time-matched accelerometer , Global Positioning System ( GPS) , and travel diary instruments. Of the average 42.3 min of daily total PA , only 11 % was related to parks. Both home neighborhood park count and area were associated with park-based PA , but not with PA that occurred elsewhere , which comprised 89 % of total PA.. This study demonstrates clear benefits of neighborhood parks for contributing to park-based PA while helping explain why proximity to parks is rarely associated with overall PA..
