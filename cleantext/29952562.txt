  Coordination networks ( CNs) , such as , for instance , metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) , can turn into remarkable magnets , with various topologies of spin carriers and unique opportunities of cross-coupling to other functionalities. Alternatively , distinct inorganic subnetworks that are spatially segregated by organic ligands can lead to coexisting magnetic systems in a single bulk material. Here , we present a system of two CNs of general formula Mn ( H
