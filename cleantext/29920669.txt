  An essential suite of coral reef ecosystem engineers is coralline red algae<pathogen>. Among these , the smooth , encrusting Porolithon onkodes has historically been considered the most important and common reef building species worldwide. We assess P. onkodes biodiversity by performing a genomic analysis of the lectotype specimen collected in 1892 from the Tami Islands , Gulf of Huon , east of New Guinea. Comparisons of DNA sequences from the lectotype specimen to those deposited in GenBank and to newly generated sequences from both field-collected and historical specimens demonstrate that at least 20 distinct species are passing under P. onkodes. We hypothesize that there were multiple evolutionary drivers including eco-physiology , hydrodynamic regimes and biotic interactions , as well as historical biogeography , which resulted in this high diversity of smooth , encrusting Porolithon species throughout the tropics. Our results emphasize the need to document the biodiversity , eco-physiology , and habitats of these tropical , reef-building algae<pathogen> in light of climate change and ocean acidification.
