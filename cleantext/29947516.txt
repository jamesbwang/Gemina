  We investigate the formation of hybrid polyelectrolyte/protein nanoparticles by associations between aggregates of partially hydrolyzed poly ( 2-phenyl-2-oxazoline) ( HPPhOx) and bovine serum albumin ( BSA) in aqueous solutions. Light scattering experiments show that at conditions of low salt , BSA creates interaggregate bridges and increases the size of the HPPhOx nanoparticles. At high salt contents , breaking of aggregates leads to well-defined nanoparticles. The interior of the formed nanoparticles is probed by small-angle neutron scattering. At low salt , diffuse arrangements are observed , whereas at high salt concentration , scattering is dominated by well-defined hydrophobic domains enhanced by the incorporation of BSA. This system shows that the combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in random-amphiphilic-polyelectrolyte/protein complexes can be used to determine the properties of self-assembled hybrid multifunctional nanoparticles.
