  The Landolt paradigm is a visual scanning task intended to evoke reading-like eye-movements in the absence of orthographic or lexical information , thus allowing the dissociation of ( sub-) lexical vs. visual processing. To that end , all letters in real word sentences are exchanged for closed Landolt rings , with 0 , 1 , or 2 open Landolt rings as targets in each Landolt sentence. A preliminary fMRI block-design study ( Hillen et al. in Front Hum Neurosci 7:1-14 , 2013) demonstrated that the Landolt paradigm has a special neural signature , recruiting the right IPS and SPL as part of the endogenous attention network. However , in that analysis , the brain responses to target detection could not be separated from those involved in processing Landolt stimuli without targets. The present study presents two fMRI experiments testing the question whether targets or the Landolt stimuli per se , led to the right IPS/SPL activation. Experiment 1 was an event-related re-analysis of the Hillen et al. ( Front Hum Neurosci 7:1-14 , 2013) data. Experiment 2 was a replication study with a new sample and identical procedures. In both experiments , the right IPS/SPL were recruited in the Landolt condition as compared to orthographic stimuli even in the absence of any target in the stimulus , indicating that the properties of the Landolt task itself trigger this right parietal activation. These findings are discussed against the background of behavioural and neuroimaging studies of healthy reading as well as developmental and acquired dyslexia. Consequently , this neuroimaging evidence might encourage the use of the Landolt paradigm also in the context of examining reading disorders , as it taps into the orientation of visual attention during reading-like scanning of stimuli without interfering sub-lexical information.
