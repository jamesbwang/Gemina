  Each nucleated cell contains several hundreds of mitochondria , which are unique organelles in being under dual genome control. The mitochondria contain their own DNA , the mtDNA , but most of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes , including all the proteins required for replication , transcription , and repair of mtDNA. MtDNA replication is a continuous process that requires coordinated action of several enzymes that are part of the mtDNA replisome. It also requires constant supply of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs) and interaction with other mitochondria for mixing and unifying the mitochondrial compartment. MtDNA maintenance defects are a growing list of disorders caused by defects in nuclear genes involved in different aspects of mtDNA replication. As a result of defects in these genes , mtDNA depletion and/or multiple mtDNA deletions develop in affected tissues resulting in variable manifestations that range from adult-onset mild disease to lethal presentation early in life.
