  This randomized , phase 1 , single-dose , crossover study ( NCT02189304) compared the 12-hour pharmacokinetic ( PK) and safety profiles of budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate metered dose inhaler ( BGF MDI) 320/14 .4/ 10 μg and budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate ( BFF) MDI 320/10 μg ( both formulated using innovative co-suspension delivery technology) to an active comparator ( budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate dry powder inhaler ( BUD/FORM DPI) 320/9-μg delivered dose) in healthy adults. The potential for PK interaction between glycopyrronium and budesonide/formoterol within BGF MDI was assessed. Of 72 subjects randomized , 59 completed treatment. Systemic budesonide exposure ( primary objective) based on area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve 0-12 hours ( AUC
