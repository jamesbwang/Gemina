  Imaging parameters from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F-FDG PET) before and after chemoradiation therapy ( CRT) for anal canal cancer correlate with clinical outcomes. This prospective , hypothesis-generating pilot study investigates the relationship between interim PET imaging during CRT for anal canal cancer and clinical outcome. From June 2012 to August 2015 , 30 patients with anal canal cancer were enrolled in a prospective clinical study of PET prior to and during CRT after âˆ¼ 30 Gy. PET parameters of the primary site included maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax) , metabolic tumor volume ( MTV) , and total lesion<symptom> glycolysis ( TLG). MTV and TLG were calculated based on 40 % SUVmax ( MTV40 , TLG40) or SUV 2.5 ( MTV2 .5 , TLG2 .5) thresholds for pretreatment and interim images. Absolute and change in PET parameters were assessed for association with freedom from local and regional recurrence ( FFLR) using single-predictor Cox regression models. Local and regional recurrence were primary and nodal ( in-field) recurrences , respectively. Twenty-three patients were eligible for analysis. Patients were excluded with nonsquamous cell histology , recurrent anal cancer , and incomplete studies due to treatment toxicity or patient choice. Median follow-up was 2.5 years. Pretreatment MTV40 ( HR 1.4 ( 95 % CI 1.02-2.05)) , interim MTV2 .5 ( 1.4 ( 1.04-1.89)) , and interim TLG2 .5 ( 1.1 ( 1.01-1.21)) were associated with FFLR. In this prospective pilot study , interim PET parameters were associated with FFLR. These results warrant further investigation assessing the value of interim PET as a biomarker of response in the treatment of patients with anal cancer.
