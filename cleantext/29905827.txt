  Functional tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) associated with atrial septal defects ( ASDs) is frequently present due to right-sided volume-overload. Tricuspid valve ( TV) repair is often considered in candidates for surgical ASD closure , and percutaneous TV repair is currently under clinical investigation. In this study , we develop a prediction model to identify patients with residual moderate/severe TR after percutaneous ASD closure. In this observational study , 172 adult patients ( 26 % male , age 49 ± 17 years) with successful percutaneous ASD closure had pre- and post-procedural echocardiography. Right heart dimensions/function were measured. TR was assessed semi-quantitatively. A prediction model for 6-month post-procedural moderate/severe TR was derived from uni-and multi-variable logistic regression. Clinical follow-up ( FU) was updated and adverse events were defined as cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Pre-procedural TR was present in 130 ( 76 %) patients ( moderate/severe: n = 64) of which 72 ( 55 %) had ≥ 1 grade reduction post-closure. Independent predictors of post-procedural moderate/severe TR ( n = 36) were age ≥ 60 years ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.57; P = 0.095) , right atrial end-diastolic area ≥ 10cm2/m2 ( OR 3.36; P = 0.032) , right ventricular systolic pressure ≥ 44 mmHg ( OR 6.44; P = 0.001) , and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ≤ 2.3 cm ( OR 3.29; P = 0.037) , producing a model with optimism-corrected C-index = 0.82 ( P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis excluding baseline none/mild TR yielded similar results. Patients with moderate/severe TR at 6-month FU had higher adverse event rates ( hazard ratio = 6.2 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.5-26); log-rank P = 0.004) across a median of 45 ( 30-76) months clinical FU. This study shows that parallel to reduction of volume-overload and reverse remodelling after percutaneous ASD closure , TR improved substantially despite significant TR at baseline. Our proposed risk model helps identify ASD patients in whom TR regression is unlikely after successful percutaneous closure.
