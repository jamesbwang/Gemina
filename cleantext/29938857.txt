  Chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) is a relatively new contrast mechanism for MRI. CEST MRI exploits a specific MR frequency ( chemical shift) of a molecule while generating an image with good spatial resolution using standard MRI techniques , combining the specificity of MRS with the spatial resolution of MRI. Many CEST MRI acquisition methods have been developed to improve analyses of tumor metabolism. GluCEST , CrCEST , and LATEST can map glutamate , creatine , and lactate , which are important metabolites involved in tumor metabolism. GlucoCEST MRI tracks the pharmacokinetics of glucose transport and cell internalization within tumors. CatalyCEST MRI detects enzyme catalysis that changes a substrate CEST agent. AcidoCEST MRI measures extracellular pH of the tumor microenvironment by exploiting a ratio of two pH-dependent CEST signals. This review describes each technique , the technical issues involved with CEST MRI and each specific technique , and the merits and challenges associated with applying each CEST MRI technique to study tumor metabolism.
