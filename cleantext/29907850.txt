  The present study examined the association between 9/11-related adolescent behavioral problems on mental health outcomes in early adulthood. Data from enrollees of the World Trade Center Health Registry , who completed at least one adolescent ( 2006-2007 or 2011-2012) and adult survey ( 2011-2012 or 2015-2016) , were analyzed. Adolescent behavioral difficulties were assessed using the adolescent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ). Adult mental health outcomes included binge drinking , smoking status history , 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) , depression<symptom> , and the self-reported number of physician mental health diagnoses. Multivariable regression was used to estimate associations of SDQ scores with mental health outcomes. Of the 297 enrollees , 16.8 % ( n = 50) had abnormal/borderline SDQ scores as an adolescent. Binge drinking was not associated with adolescent SDQ scores. Enrollees with abnormal/borderline SDQ scores as an adolescent were more likely to be a consistent smoker ( odds ratio ( OR): 5.6 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.2-25.2) , have probable PTSD ( OR: 3.5 , 95 % CI: 1.3-9.8) , depression<symptom> ( OR: 6.2 , 95 % CI: 2.7-13.9) , and to have two or more self-reported physician-diagnosed mental health conditions as an adult ( OR 5.6 , 95 % CI: 2.0-12.5). The findings of this study underscore the need to intervene early with children exposed to traumatic events so as to avert later adolescent and adult problem behaviors.
