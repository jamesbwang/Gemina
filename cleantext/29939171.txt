  The incidence of complex metabolic diseases has increased as a result of a widespread transition towards lifestyles of increased caloric intake and lowered activity levels. These multifactorial diseases arise from a combination of genetic , environmental , and behavioral factors. One such complex<disease> disease<disease> is Metabolic Syndrome<disease> ( MetS) , which is a cluster of metabolic disorders , including hypertension , hyperglycemia , and abdominal obesity. Exercise and dietary intervention are the primary treatments recommended by doctors to mitigate obesity and its subsequent metabolic diseases. Exercise intervention , in particular aerobic interval training , stimulates favorable changes in the common risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM) , Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD) , and other conditions. With the influx of evidence describing the therapeutic effect exercise has on metabolic health , establishing a system that models exercise in a controlled setting provides a valuable tool for assessing the effects of exercise in an experimental context. Drosophila melanogaster is a great tool for investigating the physiological and molecular changes that result from exercise intervention. The flies have short lifespans and similar mechanisms of metabolizing nutrients when compared to humans. To induce exercise in Drosophila , we developed a machine called the TreadWheel , which utilizes the fly 's innate , negative geotaxis tendency to gently induce climbing. This enables researchers to perform experiments on large cohorts of genetically diverse flies to better understand the genotype-by-environment interactions underlying the effects of exercise on metabolic health.
