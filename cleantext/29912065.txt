  The activation of effector immune cells at the cervicovaginal mucosa ( CVM) might influence the cervical HIV<pathogen> load and thus the secondary transmission; however limited information is available about the innate effector cells at CVM during HIV<pathogen> infection. In this study we quantified and assessed the activation of the effector immune cells at the CVM of HIV<pathogen> infected women with different disease outcomes: non-progressive HIV<pathogen> disease ( LTNPs) and chronic HIV-infected ( CHI) and their relationship with cervical viral shedding. The phenotype and frequency of cytobrush derived effector immune cells like NK cells , T cells , and dendritic cells ( DCs) and their degranulation status ( CD107a expression as a surrogate marker of activation) was determined using flow cytometry in age matched HIV<pathogen>- infected and uninfected women and their association with cervical HIV<pathogen> load was determined. The frequencies of DCs , CD56 , CD56 NK cell subsets were similar in both the study groups and also within the HIV-infected women with and without progressive disease. The frequencies of CD56CD16 NK cells ( p = 0.04) and degranulating CD56 NK cells were significantly higher among HIV-infected women ( p < 0.05). Among HIV-infected women , LTNP women showed reduced degranulation of NK and CD8 T cells than seen in the CHI women which was also associated with lower cervical viral load ( p < 0.05). The present study showed that increased degranulation of NK and T cells is associated with higher HIV<pathogen> shedding at the CVM of HIV-infected women. Hence reduction of the local immune activation at CVM could be an effective strategy to reduce the cervical viral load.
