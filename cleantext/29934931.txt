  To introduce novel and easy techniques for 27-gauge silicone oil ( SO) infusion and removal. Consecutive patients treated with 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV) plus SO infusion ( Infusion Group) and scheduled to have SO removal ( Removal Group) were prospectively included , respectively. Patients in Infusion Group underwent 27-gauge PPV plus SO infusion. SO infusion was performed with a 24-gauge intravenous catheter connected with the SO syringe. Patients in Removal Group underwent machine-independent SO removal using a short section of infusion tube connected with a 10-mL syringe. Main outcomes were best-corrected visual acuity , intraocular pressure , surgical time and intra- and postoperative complications. There were thirty-five eyes ( 35 patients) and forty eyes ( 40 patients) included in Infusion and Removal Groups , respectively. Mean surgical time of complete SO infusion and removal was 5.5 ± 0.9 and 9.6 ± 2.1 min , respectively. In both groups , no patient experienced postoperative vision deterioration or hypotony. No obvious intra- and postoperative complications were observed. We recommend the use of the 24-gauge catheter method for 27-gauge silicone oil infusion when commercial infusion cannula is unavailable. The machine-independent method using easily available plastic infusion tube and syringe would be an ideal option when 27-gauge surgery is anticipated.
