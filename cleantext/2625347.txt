  Mental state monitoring is a critical component of current and future human-machine interfaces , including semi-autonomous driving and flying , air traffic control , decision aids , training systems , and will soon be integrated into ubiquitous products like cell phones and laptops. Current mental state assessment approaches supply quantitative measures , but their only frame of reference is generic population-level ranges. What is needed are physiological biometrics that are validated in the context of task performance of individuals. Using curated intake experiments , we are able to generate personalized models of three key biometrics as useful indicators of mental state; namely , mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , stress , and attention. We demonstrate improvements to existing approaches through the introduction of new features. Furthermore , addressing the current limitations in assessing the efficacy of biometrics for individual subjects , we propose and employ a multi-level validation scheme for the biometric models by means of
