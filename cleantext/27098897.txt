  The efficacy and safety of naldemedine ( a peripherally-acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist) for opioid-induced constipation<symptom> ( OIC) in subjects with cancer was demonstrated in the primary report of a phase 3 , double-blind study ( COMPOSE-4) and its open-label extension ( COMPOSE-5). The primary endpoint , the proportion of spontaneous bowel movement ( SBM) responders , was met. Here , we report results from secondary endpoints including quality of life ( QOL) assessments from these studies. In COMPOSE-4 , eligible adults with OIC and cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive once-daily oral naldemedine 0.2 mg ( n = 97) or placebo ( n = 96) for 2 weeks , and those who continued on to COMPOSE-5 received naldemedine for 12 weeks ( n = 131). Secondary assessments in COMPOSE-4 included the proportion of complete SBM ( CSBM) responders , SBM or CSBM responders by week , and subjects with ≥ 1 SBM or CSBM within 24 hours post-initial dose. Changes from baseline in the frequency of SBMs or CSBMs per week were assessed at Week 1 and Week 2. Time to the first SBM or CSBM post-initial dose was also evaluated. In both studies , QOL impact was evaluated by Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms ( PAC-SYM) and PAC-QOL questionnaires. Naldemedine improved bowel function for all secondary efficacy assessments vs placebo ( all P ≤ 0.0002). The timely onset of naldemedine activity vs placebo was evidenced by median time to the first SBM ( 4.7 vs 26.6 hours) and CSBM ( 24.0 vs 218.5 hours) post-initial dose ( all P < 0.0001). In COMPOSE-4 , significant differences between groups were observed with the PAC-SYM stool<symptom> domain ( P = 0.045) and PAC-QOL dissatisfaction domain ( P = 0.015). In COMPOSE-5 , naldemedine significantly improved overall and individual domain scores of PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL from baseline ( all P ≤ 0.03). Naldemedine provided effective and timely symptomatic relief from OIC and improved the QOL of subjects with OIC and cancer. www.ClinicalTrials.jp: JAPIC-CTI-132340 ( COMPOSE-4) and JAPIC-CTI-132342 ( COMPOSE-5).
