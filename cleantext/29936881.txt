  Although CT has been used widely , the role of preoperative CT findings including other factors in tympanoplasty has not been elucidated comprehensively. To evaluate relationship of CT findings with other factors and audiological results in type 1 tympanoplasty. A cohort of consecutive 175 patients with type 1 tympanoplasty was enrolled. Addition of mastoidectomy was based on the presence of soft tissue in antrum on CT.. Postoperative air-bone gap ( ABG) and reperforation rate were analyzed. Positive soft tissue in antrum on CT was found in 52 ( 29.7 %) patients and showed larger preoperative ABG than the negative group. Successful ABG closure ( ≤ 20 dB) was obtained in 97 % when preoperative ABG ≤ 20 dB , but it decreased as the preoperative ABG increased ( 83 % with preoperative ABG of 21-30 dB , and 0 % with preoperative ABG > 30 dB). Postoperative reperforation rate was positively related to the preoperative ABG , but not the presence of soft tissue in the antrum , the size , or locations of preoperative perforations. Our findings showed that temporal bone CT was helpful in determining addition of mastoidectomy and the presence of soft tissue in the antrum was associated with large ABG.
