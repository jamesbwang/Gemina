  Previous studies indicated a critical role of foxhead box D1 ( FOXD1) in human cancers. However , its expression pattern in colorectal cancer ( CRC) and the molecular mechanism of FOXD1 on cancer progression remain unknown. In this study , we found that FOXD1 was aberrantly overexpressed in human CRC tissues , and FOXD1 levels were correlated with tumor size , differentiation , TNM stage and lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Knockdown of FOXD1 attenuated CRC cell proliferation , migration and invasion. Overexpression of FOXD1 produced the opposite effects. These effects were mediated by activation of the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway , and inhibition of this pathway with a specific ERK 1/2 inhibitor ( U0126) could impair the tumor-promoting effects induced by overexpression of FOXD1. Taken together , these findings indicate that FOXD1 promotes tumorgenesis and progression of CRC by activating ERK 1/2 signaling pathway and may represent a potential clinical target.
