  The diabetics are prone to skin<disease> infections<disease> , especially with This study aims to explore the differential expression of toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2) and interleukin ( IL) -8 secretion by keratinocytes between controls and diabetic patients when challenged with HaCaT cells were cultured in high-glucose ( HG) Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM) and low-glucose ( LG) DMEM. Then , they were exposed to We found that the expression levels of both TLR2 and IL-8 increased and then decreased in the two groups. Notably , the IL-8 levels in the LG group were higher than those in the HG group at each time point ( These observations showed that TLR2 and IL-8 act on the keratinocytes interacting with
