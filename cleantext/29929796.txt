  The purpose of this article , co-authored by instructors and students , is to highlight student learning and a student-developed model of Community Development that occurred through a service-based clinical placement. As part of their clinical community practicum , a group of second year nursing students were partnered with a group of seniors living in an inner city community. By deconstructing and categorizing ongoing student involvement with this community , students were able to make linkages to the many concepts that together form a community development approach to care , leading to the creation of a model of community development ( the Community Health Advancement Model) to guide their evaluation. The process of evaluating nursing student progress from a community development perspective , and the subsequent creation of the model , highlighted several noted challenges of working within a service-learning model of care: the high level of self-direction and critical thinking required by students , and the lack of known outcomes. This article captures the students ' struggles with and subsequent mastery through growth in understanding of these concepts. The model of community development , an outcome of their learning , showcases their depth of understanding of the importance of nurturing partnerships as foundational to providing care at a community level. This model may be useful within education of undergraduate nursing education by providing a visual road map of the process of community development. This article is an exemplar of the capacity and depth of understanding that is possible when students learn through community partnership.
