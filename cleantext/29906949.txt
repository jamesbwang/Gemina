  Theoretical understanding of how a deep neural network ( DNN) extracts features from input images is still unclear , but it is widely believed that the extraction is performed hierarchically through a process of coarse graining. It reminds us of the basic renormalization group ( RG) concept in statistical physics. In order to explore possible relations between DNN and RG , we use the restricted Boltzmann machine ( RBM) applied to an Ising model and construct a flow of model parameters ( in particular , temperature) generated by the RBM. We show that the unsupervised RBM trained by spin configurations at various temperatures from T = 0 to T = 6 generates a flow along which the temperature approaches the critical value T _ ( c) = 2.27. This behavior is the opposite of the typical RG flow of the Ising model. By analyzing various properties of the weight matrices of the trained RBM , we discuss why it flows towards T _ ( c) and how the RBM learns to extract features of spin configurations.
