  To systematically review the published data on the culture yield of a repeat ( second) percutaneous image-guided biopsy after negative initial biopsy in suspected spondylodiscitis. A systematic search was performed of the PubMed/Medline and Embase databases. The methodological quality of the studies included was assessed. The proportions of positive cultures among all initial biopsies and second biopsies ( after a negative initial biopsy) were calculated for each study and assessed for heterogeneity ( defined as I Eight studies , comprising a total of 107 patients who underwent a second percutaneous image-guided biopsy after a culture-negative initial biopsy in suspected spondylodiscitis , were included. All eight studies were at risk of bias and were concerning with regard to applicability , particularly patient selection , flow of patients through the study , and timing of the biopsy. The proportions of positive cultures among all initial biopsies ranged from 10.3 to 52.5 % , and were subject to heterogeneity ( I Although a second percutaneous image-guided biopsy may have some value in patients with suspected spondylodiscitis , its exact value remains unclear , given the available poor-quality evidence. Future well-designed studies are needed to determine the role of a second percutaneous image-guided biopsy in this setting. Such studies should clearly describe the spectrum of patients that was selected for a second percutaneous image-guided biopsy , the method of biopsy , and differences compared with the first biopsy , if any.
