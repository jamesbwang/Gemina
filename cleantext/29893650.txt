  Purpose To identify risk factors for hippocampal calcifications and to investigate the association between hippocampal calcifications and cognitive function. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study , consecutive patients visiting a memory clinic at a Dutch general hospital between April 2009 and April 2015 were identified. All individuals underwent a standard diagnostic work-up including cognitive tests and brain CT.. The following vascular risk factors were assessed: hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , and smoking. Cognitive screening consisted of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination , which includes the Mini-Mental State Examination. CT scans were analyzed for the presence and severity ( absent , mild , moderate , severe) of hippocampal calcifications. One measure per patient , only the most severe score , was used. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for hippocampal calcifications , and linear regression was used for the association between hippocampal calcifications ( patient level) and cognitive function. Results A total of 1991 patients ( mean age , 78 years; range , 45-96 years) were included. The mean age of women was 79 years ( range , 47-96 years) , and the mean age of men was 77 years ( range , 45-95 years). Of the 1991 patients , 380 ( 19.1 %) had hippocampal calcifications. Older age ( odds ratio ( OR) per year , 1.05; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.03 , 1.06) , diabetes mellitus ( OR , 1.50; 95 % CI: 1.12 , 2.00) , and smoking ( OR , 1.49; 95 % CI: 1.05 , 2.10) were associated with the presence of hippocampal calcifications. No associations were found between presence and severity of hippocampal calcifications and cognitive function. Conclusion Older age , diabetes mellitus , and smoking were associated with an increased risk of hippocampal calcifications. A greater degree of hippocampal calcifications was not associated with lower cognitive function in patients with memory complaints.
