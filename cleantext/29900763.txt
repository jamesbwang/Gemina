  Health evaluations were conducted on individuals ( n = 62 , age < 1 to 11 yr) from a captive red panda ( Ailurus fulgens styani) population at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan Province , People 's Republic of China. Individuals were anesthetized using combinations of ketamine , dexmedetomidine , diazepam , isoflurane , and tiletamine/zolazepam. Whereas physical exams revealed no abnormalities for 40 % of red pandas , 24 % had dental abnormalities and 18 % had orthopedic abnormalities. As the red panda is the only member of the family Ailuridae , complete blood count and serum biochemistry samples were collected and used to develop reference intervals for this species. When hematologic and serum chemistry values of male and female red pandas were compared within this A. f. styani population , males had higher mean cell hemoglobin , mean cell hemoglobin concentration , and blood urea nitrogen concentrations , whereas females had higher alkaline phosphatase , cholesterol , and iron. Adult red pandas ( â‰¥ 2 yr) had higher lymphocyte<symptom> percentage , total protein , globulin , and chloride levels , whereas juveniles ( < 2 yr) had higher white blood cell concentrations , neutrophil percentage and absolute neutrophil values , alkaline phosphatase , creatine kinase , cholesterol , potassium , total and ionized calcium , and phosphorus levels. Reference values and expected age and sex differences will assist with health management of the captive A. f. styani population.
