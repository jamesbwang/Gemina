  Bullous pemphigoid ( BP) might be drug-induced. The present study evaluated the relationship between BP and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors ( DPP4Is). We recruited patients diagnosed with BP at Ogaki Municipal Hospital from 1 December 2009 through 31 December 2017. We retrospectively collected data from medical records and divided patients into two groups based on whether they received DPP4Is. Additionally , we determined the incidence of BP in patients who were first prescribed DPP4Is at our hospital during the study period. Of 168 patients diagnosed with BP , 133 ( 79.1 %) were positive for anti-BP180NC16a antibody. A total of 32 ( 19.0 %) patients had been prescribed a DPP4I , 21 of whom ( 65.6 %) were positive for anti-BP180NC16a antibody; this rate was lower than that in patients not receiving a DPP4I ( 82.3 %; P = 0.0360). A total of 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had not been prescribed a DPP4I; only one ( 6.3 %) was positive for anti-BP180NC16a antibody ( P = 0.0339). During the study period , 9,304 patients were prescribed DPP4Is , eight of whom developed BP; six ( 75.0 %) had non-inflammatory BP , and five of the six ( 83.3 %) were negative for anti-BP180NC16a antibody. The positive rate of anti-BP180NC16a antibody was lower in BP patients with DPP4I than without DPP4I , regardless of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The antibody titer was low in both the overall and type 2 diabetes mellitus populations. The prevalence of BP in 9,304 patients receiving DPP4Is was 0.0859 % , which is higher than that in the general population. As DPP4Is are common diabetes treatments , we must be aware of the risk of BP.
