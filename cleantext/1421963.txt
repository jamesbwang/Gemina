  Nurses should have cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) knowledge and skills to be able to implement effective interventions during in-hospital cardiac arrest. The aim of this descriptive study was to assess mortality impact after nurses ' CPR training with pre-CPR training data at our institute. Training regarding CPR was given to nurses , and CPR mortality 1-year before basic life support ( BLS) and advanced cardiac life support ( ACLS) training were collected and compared with post-training 1-year CPR mortality. A total of 632 adult patients suffering in-hospital cardiac arrest over the study period. CPR was attempted in 294 patients during the pre-BLS/ACLS training period and in 338 patients in the post-BLS/ACLS training period. In the pre-BLS/ACLS training period , 58 patients ( 19.7 %) had return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC) , while during the post-BLS/ACLS training period , 102 patients ( 30.1 %) had ROSC ( Training nurses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation resulted in a significant improvement in survival to hospital discharge after in-hospital cardiac arrest.
