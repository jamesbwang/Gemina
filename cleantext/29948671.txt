  Maize fields near Mae Tao Creek in Pha Te Village , Tak Province , Thailand are contaminated with Zn , Cd , and Pb. This research studied the interaction between levels of the metals contaminating the soil and maize development , heavy metal accumulation in the seeds , and the soil bacterial community structure. Our field experiment was carried out in five plots with metal contents that gradually decreased from a high level near the creek to a lower level further into the land: Zn 380-4883 mg kg
