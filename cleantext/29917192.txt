  The aim of the present study was to investigate clinical<disease> significances<disease> and biological roles of miR-4299 in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of miR-4299 in NSCLC tissues and matched non-tumor tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). The correlations between miR-4299 expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were also analyzed. MTT assay and Transwell assay were performed to determine the proliferation , migration and invasion. Western blotting was used to examine the expressing patterns of PTEN/AKT/PI3K signaling pathway-related proteins. We found that the expression level of miR-4299 was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Low miR-4299 expression was positively correlated with TNM stage ( p = 0.002) , histological grade ( p = 0.002) and lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.028). Moreover , Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the patients with low miR-4299 expression had shorter survival time than those with high miR-4299 expression ( p = 0.0011). More importantly , multivariate analysis suggested that decreased miR-4299 expression was a poor independent prognostic predictor for NSCLC patients ( p = 0.009). Functionally , overexpression of miR-4299 inhibited the proliferation , migration and invasion in A549 cells. Mechanistically , the results of Western blot showed that miR-4299 exhibited its tumor-suppressive role by modulating PTEN/AKT/PI3K signaling pathway. We firstly indicated that miR-4299 may be a candidate independent marker for NSCLC prognosis and suppressed the progression of NSCLC by modulating the activation of PTEN/AKT/PI3K signaling pathway , suggesting that miR-4299 could be a potential target for developing therapies in treating NSCLC.
