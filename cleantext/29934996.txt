  This paper outlines the inter-professional collaboration of the authors , a PhD student , his supervisor and an information professional , to systematically search the literature for an ill-defined concept. The research question posed for the scoping literature review indicated that the topic , the subjective socio-economic status and health of adults with intellectual disabilities , was rare. The need for a methodological search process was therefore identified and successfully carried out. The paper presents an analysis of the processes and the collaboration involved in developing a successful search strategy. The resulting transformative learning by the researcher of the professional practice of the information specialist illuminates their facilitating and supportive role in advancing health related research.
