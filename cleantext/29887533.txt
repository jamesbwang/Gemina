  Cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM) includes three technical methods , ( 1) rapid freezing for vitreous ice-embedding , ( 2) observation of frozen hydrated specimens , and ( 3) image processing for three-dimensional structural analysis. The three-dimensional structural analysis can be performed in three different ways. Electron crystallography can decipher the structure of membrane proteins at the highest resolution ( atomic level). Single particle analysis now allows the determiration of the structure of highly purified proteins and complexes ( non-crystalline biomolecules) in solution at the near-atomic level. Electron tomography can reveal the three-dimensional structure of an ultrathin-section of the cells and/or tissues. The resolution of the structure obtained by electron tomography is not very high ( nm level) , however it is possible to reveal the individual structures of biomolecular assemblies or cellular organelles , in close-to-native condition in the cell. A technical development for cryo-EM should be the introduction of a new CMOS camera for the direct detection of electrons. Using such camera , a short movie ( usually 2-3 seconds) , comprising numerous images with a few hundred milliseconds exposure each can be recorded. Such a movie has a demonstrated value , as it can compensate for the specimen motion induced by irradiation of electron beam. Improvements in image processing algorithms and computer programs are also essential for achieving three-dimensional structures at a better resolution.
