  The aim was to compare computed tomography ( CT) features in acute and chronic aortic dissections ( AADs and CADs) and determine if a certain combination of imaging features was reliably predictive of the acute versus chronic nature of disease in individual patients. Consecutive patients with aortic dissection and a chest CT scan were identified , and 120 CT scans corresponding to 105 patients were reviewed for a variety of imaging features. Statistical tests assessed for differences in the frequency of these features. A predictive model was created and tested on an additional 120 CT scans from 115 patients. Statistically significant features of AAD included periaortic confluent soft tissue opacity<symptom> , curved dissection flap , and highly mobile dissection flap , and features of CAD included thick dissection flap , false lumen ( FL) outer wall calcification , FL thrombus , dilated FL , and tear edges curling into the FL.. The model predicted the chronicity of a dissection with an area under the curve of 0.98 ( CI 0.98-1.00). AADs and CADs demonstrated significantly different CT imaging features.
