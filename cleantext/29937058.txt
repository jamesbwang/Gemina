  To explore novel cardiac myosin activator , a series of diphenylalkyl substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles have been prepared and tested for cardiac myosin ATPase activation in vitro. In all cases , three carbon spacer between the oxadiazole core and one of the phenyl ring was considered crucial. In case of 1,3,4-oxadiazole , zero to two carbon spacer between oxadiazole core and other phenyl ring are favorable. Phenyl ring can be replaced by cyclohexyl moiety. In case of 1,2,4-oxadiazole , zero or one carbon spacer between the oxadiazole and other phenyl ring are favorable. Introduction of hydrogen bonding donor ( NH) group at the 2
