  A native AV-fistula ( AVF) for access in hemodialysis ( HD) is preferable. Stenosis , a major hurdle , is associated with older age and diabetes mellitus. This case-control study aimed to clarify if any medical and/or laboratory factors , that can be altered , could be associated to AVF stenosis. 33 patients with a patent AVF without need of intervention during a two year period ( Controls) were matched by diagnosis and age with 33 patients ( Cases) , that had at least one radiological invasive examination/intervention due to suspected AVF malfunction ( case-control mode 2:1). Cases had higher weekly doses of Erythropoietin-Stimulating Agent ( ESA) than Controls both before intervention ( mean 8312 ± 7119 U/w versus 4348 ± 3790 , p = 0.005) and after the intervention ( 7656 ± 6795 , versus 4477 ± 3895 , p = 0.018). Before intervention serum phosphate was higher in Cases while there was no significant difference in blood hemoglobin , weekly standard Kt/V , parathyroid hormone , calcium , albumin , C-reactive protein , smoking habits , BMI or other medication. Higher doses of ESA were administered in patients with AVF stenosis. Since ESA may cause local hypertrophic effects on the vascular endothelium , we should prescribe lower doses of ESA in patients at risk. Further studies should clarify such connection.
