  Mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in DNA damage response ( DDR) and repair , such as C9orf72 and FUS ( Fused in Sarcoma<disease>) , are associated with neurodegenerative diseases and lead to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in NEK1 ( NIMA-related kinase 1) have also been recently found to cause ALS. NEK1 codes for a multifunctional protein , crucially involved in mitotic checkpoint control and DDR. To resolve pathological alterations associated with NEK1 mutation , we compared hiPSC-derived motoneurons carrying a NEK1 mutation with mutant C9orf72 and wild type neurons at basal level and after DNA damage induction. Motoneurons carrying a C9orf72 mutation exhibited cell specific signs of increased DNA damage. This phenotype was even more severe in NEK1
