  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides. They have important functions in cell development and metabolism , such as genetic markers , genome rearrangements , chromatin modifications , cell cycle regulation , transcription and translation. Their functions are generally closely related to their localization in the cell. Therefore , knowledge about their subcellular locations can provide very useful clues or preliminary insight into their biological functions. Although biochemical experiments could determine the localization of lncRNAs in a cell , they are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore , it is highly desirable to develop bioinformatics tools for fast and effective identification of their subcellular locations. We developed a sequence-based bioinformatics tool called `` iLoc-lncRNA '' to predict the subcellular locations of LncRNAs by incorporating the 8-tuple nucleotide features into the general PseKNC ( Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution approach. Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that the overall accuracy achieved by the new predictor on a stringent benchmark dataset is 86.72 % , which is over 20 % higher than that by the existing state-of-the-art predictor evaluated on the same tests. A user-friendly webserver has been established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iLoc-LncRNA , by which users can easily obtain their desired results. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
