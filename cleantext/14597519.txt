  Diabetic hyperreflective foci in the outer retinal layers are a clinically relevant finding on optical coherence tomography ( OCT) images , although their characteristics remain to be elucidated. Here we investigated the decorrelation signal around hyperreflective foci on OCT angiography ( OCTA) images in diabetic retinopathy ( DR). We retrospectively reviewed sufficient quality OCTA images from 102 eyes of 66 patients that were obtained using split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm. Most confluent hyperreflective foci were randomly deposited or appeared in a radiating array on the en-face structural OCT images in the inner nuclear layer ( INL) or Henle 's fiber layer ( HFL) , respectively. Within the INL , hyperreflective foci were not accompanied by decorrelation signals and attached to capillaries on OCTA images. Decorrelation signals were sometimes delineated in hyperreflective foci in the HFL and other times appeared to be pseudopod-like or wrapping around hyperreflective foci , referred to as reflectance-decorrelated foci. The decorrelation signal intensity of hyperreflective foci in the HFL was associated with logMAR VA ( R = 0.553 , P < 0.001) and central subfield thickness ( R = 0.408 , P < 0.001) but not with DR severity. These data suggest that reflectance-decorrelated foci on OCTA images are clinically relevant as well as shed lights on the properties in diabetic hyperreflective foci.
