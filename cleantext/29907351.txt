  The association of high sodium intake with risk of stroke has been accepted. But considering the proposed J/U-shaped association between sodium intake and risk of all-cause mortality , the shape of the dose-response relationship has not been determined yet. This study aimed to test the dose-response association of dietary sodium and sodium-to-potassium ratio with risk of stroke in adults aged 18 years or older. We performed a systematic search using PubMed and Scopus , from database inception up to October 2017. Prospective and retrospective observational studies reporting risk estimates of stroke for three or more quantitative categories of dietary sodium or sodium-to-potassium ratio were included. Studies that reported results as continuous were also included. Two independent authors extracted the information and assessed the quality of included studies. Pooled relative risk ( RR) was calculated using a random-effects model. Publication bias was tested. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were done. Of initial 20,412 studies identified , 14 prospective cohort studies , one case-cohort study , and one case-control study ( total n = 261,732) with 10,150 cases of stroke were included. The Pooled RRs of stroke were 1.06 ( 95 % CI: 1.02 , 1.10; I Higher sodium intake and higher dietary sodium-to-potassium ratio were associated with a higher risk of stroke. Reducing dietary sodium-to-potassium ratio can be considered as a supplementary approach in parallel with the decrease in sodium intake in order to decrease stroke risk. The interpretation of the results is limited by observational nature of studies examined.
