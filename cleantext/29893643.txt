  Purpose To investigate the pathophysiologic effects of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) on brain function in children with CKD by correlating cerebral blood flow ( CBF) with clinical and behavioral indexes. Materials and Methods In this prospective study , 73 pediatric patients with CKD ( mean age , 15.80 years ± 3.63; range , 9-25 years) and 57 control subjects ( mean age , 15.65 years ± 3.76; range , 9-25 years) were recruited. CBF measurements were acquired with an MRI arterial spin labeling scheme. Neurocognitive measurements were performed with traditional and computerized neurocognitive batteries. Clinical data were also collected. Group-level global and regional CBF differences between patients with CKD and control subjects were assessed. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations among regional CBF , clinical variables , and cognitive performance. Results Patients with CKD showed higher global CBF compared with control subjects that was attributable to reduced hematocrit level ( mean , 60.2 mL/100 g/min ± 9.0 vs 56.5 mL/100 g/min ± 8.0 , respectively). White matter CBF showed correlation with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( r = 0.244 , P = .039) , a finding suggestive of altered cerebrovascular autoregulation. Regional CBF differences between patients and control subjects included regions in the `` default mode '' network. In patients with CKD , positive extrema in the precuneus showed a strong correlation with executive function ( ρ = 0.608 , P = .001). Conclusion Systemic effects of estimated glomerular filtration rate , hematocrit level , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> on CBF and alterations in regional CBF may reflect impaired brain function underlying neurocognitive symptoms in CKD. These findings further characterize the nature of alterations in brain physiologic features in children , adolescents , and young adults with CKD.
