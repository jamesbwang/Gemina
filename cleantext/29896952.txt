  Wet-chemical discrimination of amino acids is still a challenge due to their structural similarity. Here , an optimized self-assembled eight-member sensor array is reported. The optimized sensor array stems from the combination of elements of different tongues , containing poly ( para-phenyleneethynylene) s ( PPE) and a supercharged green fluorescent protein ( GFP) variant. The responsivity of the sensor dyes ( PPEs and GFP) is enhanced in elements that contain adjuvants , such as metal salts but also cucurbit ( 7) uril ( CB ( 7)) and acridine orange; a suitable and robust eight element array discriminates all of the 20 natural amino acids in water at 25 mM concentration with 100 % accuracy. The results group well to the amino acid type , i.e. , hydrophobic , polar , and aromatic ones.
