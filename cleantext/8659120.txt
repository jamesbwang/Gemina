  Flaviviridae family is a class of single-stranded RNA virus , which is fatal to human and animals and mainly prevalent in subtropic and tropic countries. Even though people and animals are barraged with flavivirus<pathogen> infection every year , we have not invented either vaccines or antiviral for most flavivirus<pathogen> infections yet. Innate immunity is the first line of defense in resisting pathogen invasion , serving an important role in a resisting virus. Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I- ( RIG-I-) like receptors ( RLRs) are crucial pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs) that play essential roles in recognizing and clearing pathogens , including resisting flavivirus<pathogen>. In the present review , we provide a significant reference for further research on the function of innate immunity in resisting
