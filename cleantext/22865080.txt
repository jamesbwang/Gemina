  We have isolated a total of five newer cholera<disease> phages which are novel broad host range to incorporate with the existing phage typing schemes for an extended typing scheme. These newly isolated phages were well characterized including the electron micrograph. A total of 300 These phages were found different from the existing phages. Electron microscopic results showed that the phages belonged to myophage and podophage group. Characterization of the phages based on pH , temperature , and organic solvent sensitivity showed differences among the phages used in this study. All the strains of The newer
