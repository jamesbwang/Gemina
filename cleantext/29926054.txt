  Coordination polymers were prepared from a luminescent s-tetrazine ligand ( OTz) and various rare-earth ions. Both the radii of the Ln ions and the synthetic conditions ( especially pH) drive the formation of the product , and three crystalline phases were finally identified. Using a two-step process , it was possible to increase the dimensionality of one of these compounds from 1-D ( MIL-165) to 2-D ( MIL-166). The luminescence properties of these coordination polymers were studied. Whereas for Ln = La , Pr , Eu , Tb , the emission characteristic of the s-tetrazine core was observed , such emission was not detected for Ln = Nd , while the emission typical for the Nd ion was present , due to energy transfer from the tetrazine ligand to the Nd3 + ion.
