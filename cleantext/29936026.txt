  Sonodynamic therapy ( SDT) is emerging as new atherosclerosis treatment. The use of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) as the vehicle for a sensitizer delivery improves reactive oxygen species formation. In this study , methyl ester of aminolevulinic acid ( MALA) gold nanoparticles ( MALA: AuNPs) functionalized with polyethylene glycol ( PEG) were synthesized by photoreduction and characterized by ultraviolet/visible optical absorption , zeta potential and electron microscopy. The reactive oxygen species generation induced by ultrasound irradiation of MALA: AuNPs solutions was studied by observing the decrease in the 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran emission band. The potential use of MALA: AuNPs as sensitizer for sonodynamic therapy was investigated on THP-1 macrophages. The cytotoxicity test was also described. The findings suggested that ultrasound combined with MALA: AuNPs provides impressive results in in vitro studies. Sonodynamic therapy with MALA: AuNPs through 2 minutes of ultrasound exposure ( 1 MHz and 1 W/cm
