  Social determinants of health ( SDOH) are important considerations in diagnosis , prevention , and health outcomes. However , they are often not well documented in the EHR and found primarily in unstructured or semi-structured text. Building upon previous work , we analyzed all flowsheet data in 2013 for information related to the SDOH topic areas of Residence , Living Situation , and Living Conditions. Overall , 91 rows were identified as being related to the topics areas resulting in 604,616 unique observations. Individual rows contained SDOH data often covered multiple concepts especially free-text entries. These data included most often references to the residence , residence details , and with whom the patient lives. Very few contained living condition references. Additionally , there was significant duplication and inconsistency of row labels , as well as variation in value list content for rows collecting the same concepts. Our findings demonstrate significant opportunities to improve and achieve better standardization in documentation around these SDOH.
