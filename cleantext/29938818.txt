  Little is known about suicidal ideation stability , including whether stability is heterogeneous or homogeneous between individuals. Studies of this kind are necessary to understand the progression from suicidal ideation to action. This study examined suicidal ideation trajectories , using growth mixture modeling , in a sample of 359 past/current military service members ( M age = 32.1 years , SD = 7.7; 88.3 % male). Self-reported suicidal ideation information was collected at baseline and follow-up sessions at months 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12. Following extraction of the best-fitting solution , predictors of trajectory status were examined and trajectory status was used to predict suicidal behavior between baseline and month 12 assessments. Results revealed four trajectories , Low-Stable ( n = 125) , Moderate-Stable ( n = 101) , High-Stable ( n = 76) , and High-Rapidly Declining ( n = 57). In general , the High-Stable trajectory had the highest levels of perceived burdensomeness , thwarted belongingness , PTSD symptoms , and drug use. The High- and Moderate-Stable trajectories had the highest rates of suicidal behavior between baseline and month 12. Suicidal ideation , even in individuals with elevated ideation , is not a homogeneous construct over time. Stability of suicidal ideation might be an important risk factor , even if ideation is only moderately elevated.
