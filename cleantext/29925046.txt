  In this study , a smart and green analytical method based on the second-order calibration algorithm coupled with excitation-emission matrix ( EEM) fluorescence was developed for the determination of rhodamine dyes illegally added into chilli samples. The proposed method not only has the advantage of high sensitivity over the traditional fluorescence method but also fully displays the `` second-order advantage ''. Pure signals of analytes were successfully extracted from severely interferential EEMs profiles via using alternating trilinear decomposition ( ATLD) algorithm even in the presence of common fluorescence problems such as scattering , peak overlaps and unknown interferences. It is worth noting that the unknown interferents can denote different kinds of backgrounds , not only refer to a constant background. In addition , the method using interpolation method could avoid the information loss of analytes of interest. The use of `` mathematical separation '' instead of complicated `` chemical or physical separation '' strategy can be more effective and environmentally friendly. A series of statistical parameters including figures of merit and RSDs of intra- ( ≤ 1.9 %) and inter-day ( ≤ 6.6 %) were calculated to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore , the authoritative method of HPLC-FLD was adopted to verify the qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed method. Compared with the two methods , it also showed that the ATLD-EEMs method has the advantages of accuracy , rapidness , simplicity and green , which is expected to be developed as an attractive alternative method for simultaneous and interference-free determination of rhodamine dyes illegally added into complex matrices.
