  This study aimed to investigate the association of the frequency of optic disk hemorrhage<symptom> ( DH) and progression of normal tension glaucoma ( NTG) between each group based on the location of the initial retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) defect. In this retrospective , observational cohort study , 142 NTG patients who underwent more than 5 reliable visual field tests with initial superior hemifield ( group 2 , n = 51) , inferior hemifield ( group 1 , n = 44) , or both hemifield ( group 3 , n = 47) defects were included. The number of DHs was inspected in serial optic disk photographs by 2 different ophthalmologists. Progression rates , which are the slope of mean thresholds from the 52 points , were calculated using a linear mixed effect model. The mean follow-up period was 8.19 Â± 3.30 years. DHs related with the initial RNFL defect occurred significantly more frequently in group 2 ( 35 in inferior hemifield) than in group 1 ( 6 in superior hemifield) ( p = 0.009) or group 3 ( 6 in inferior hemifield) ( p = 0.006). The progression rate in group 2 was significantly faster than in group 1 ( p = 0.019) or the superior hemifield of group 3 ( p = 0.001). The progression rate of subjects showing recurrent DH was significantly faster than those showing single DH from all groups ( -0.5460 vs. -0.2867 dB/year , p = 0.0053). More careful examination and caution are required when NTG patients show recurrent DH in the inferior hemifield related to the initial RNFL defect.
