  Cell-in-cell ( CIC) structures , characterized by enclosure of one or more cells within another cell , were extensively documented in human cancers. Although elevated CIC formation was found in cancers with CDKN2A inactivation , a causal link between them remains to be established. We reported here that inhibiting CDKN2A expression effectively promoted homotypic CIC formation , whereas ectopic overexpression of p16INK4a or p14ARF , two proteins encoded by CDKN2A gene , significantly suppressed CIC formation in MCF7 cells. The regulation of CIC formation by CDKN2A was tightly correlated with subcellular redistribution of E-cadherin , F-actin rearrangement and reduced phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 ( p-MLC2) , consistent with which , CDKN2A expression imparted cells winner/outer identity in competition assay. Moreover , CIC formation negatively correlates with p16INK4a expression in human breast cancers. Thus , our work identifies CDKN2A as the first tumor suppressor whose inactivation promotes homotypic CIC formation in human cancer cells.
