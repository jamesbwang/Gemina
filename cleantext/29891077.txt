  The cerebellum has long been known for its importance in motor learning and coordination. However , increasing evidence supports a role for the cerebellum in cognition and emotion. Consistent with a role in cognitive functions , the cerebellum has emerged as one of the key brain regions affected in nonmotor disorders , including autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Here , we discuss behavioral , postmortem , genetic , and neuroimaging studies in humans in order to understand the cerebellar contributions to the pathogenesis of both disorders. We also review relevant animal model findings.
