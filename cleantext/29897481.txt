  Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( aHSCT) is an efficacious treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. However , as rapid advances have resulted in other highly efficacious and less intensive therapies , the role of aHSCT has been questioned. We utilized population-based data to identify 13 494 newly diagnosed patients younger than age 80 years between 1998 and 2012. Patient characteristics of aHSCT and non-aHSCT groups were balanced using inverse probability weighting of a propensity score predicting aHSCT use. Multivariable models adjusted for baseline comorbidities , demographics , and socioeconomic status estimated the adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) of death. Twenty point eight percent ( 2807) of patients underwent aHSCT , and this rate increased over time from 15.4 % in 1998-2002 to 23.9 % in 2008-2012. aHSCT was utilized among 37.6 % and 11.5 % of patients younger than age 60 years and 60 to 79 years , respectively. The median time to aHSCT was 9.4 months , and 89 % of all aHSCTs occurred within two years of diagnosis. The median overall survival from time of aHSCT was 72.9 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 68 to 78). Autologous HSCT at any time was associated with improved survival ( aHR = 0.83 , 95 % CI = 0.75 to 0.92). Among aHSCT recipients , transplant more than 12 months after diagnosis ( vs â‰¤ 12 months) was associated with worse survival ( aHR = 1.33 , 95 % CI = 1.16 to 1.51). The positive effect of aHSCT on overall survival was similar across study time periods and age groups. In the era of highly efficacious induction therapies , aHSCT remained infrequently used but continued to be associated with improved survival for multiple myeloma patients and should be considered for newly diagnosed patients.
