  This study aimed to identify the prevalence and predictors of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) using South Korea 's nationwide healthcare database. Retrospective cohort and nested case-control analyses were conducted to estimate the prevalence and predictors of hypoglycemia , respectively. A cohort of 2,273,481 patients with T2D was followed to estimate the 1-year prevalence of hypoglycemia. Total hypoglycemia was identified using outpatient , inpatient , or emergency department visit data containing a diagnosis code for hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with inpatient admission or emergency care. Within the T2D cohort , cases with hypoglycemia were identified , and up to 4 controls were randomly selected after matching by sex , age , and cohort entry date. Possible predictive factors included insurance type , medical institution type , hypoglycemic history , antidiabetic drugs , Charlson Comorbidity Index score , and diabetic complications. We conducted conditional logistic regression analyses to estimate adjusted odds ratios ( aORs) and 95 % CIs to identify predictors of hypoglycemia. The prevalences of total and severe hypoglycemia were 1.38 % and 0.96 % , respectively. Those with a history of hypoglycemia had the highest risk for a further hypoglycemic event ( aOR , 16.71; 95 % CI , 15.62-17.88). Use of combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylurea was highly associated with severe hypoglycemia ( aOR , 15.09; 95 % CI , 13.60-16.74). Among diabetic complications , the presence of nephropathy was the greatest predictive factor ( aOR , 1.79; 95 % CI , 1.73-1.85). Patients with a history of hypoglycemia or receiving combined antidiabetic therapy must be appropriately managed to achieve optimal glycemic control without significant risk of hypoglycemia.
