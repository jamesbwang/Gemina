  Coronary artery ectasia ( CAE) is a rare disease and a substantial portion of patients with CAE are first diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). The question was raised if CAE was a kind of thrombotic disease. We assessed a consecutive series of 119 patients with CAE including 32 patients with AMI ( CAE + AMI group) and 87 patients without AMI ( CAE group). During the same period , 90 patients with coronary heart disease , 90 patients with normal coronary arteries ( control) , and 120 AMI patients without CAE ( AMI group) were randomly selected and evaluated. Both current and previous AMI prevalence rates in the CAE population were higher than the AMI rate for the other patients undergoing coronary angiograms; the mean platelet volume and fibrinogen were increased in the CAE + AMI and CAE groups. For patients with CAE with AMI , most of the thrombotic lesions<symptom> were in the ectasia site. After dividing the patients with CAE into with and without antiplatelet treatment groups before admission , the AMI rate was lower in the antiplatelet group. Platelets may participate in the thrombotic process in CAE. Antiplatelet treatment may decrease the AMI rate of patients with CAE.
