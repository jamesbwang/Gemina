  Meningioma growing into an arachnoid cyst<symptom> is an extremely rare event. Only three cases are reported in the literature. In two of them , an operative procedure in or near the arachnoid cyst<symptom> preceded tumor growth. Schul CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a patient requiring marsupialization of an arachnoid cyst<symptom> of the middle cranial fossa. On follow-up , three years postoperatively he showed no signs of recurrence or tumor growth. One year later , the fourth year after cyst<symptom> 's surgery , he presented with large tumor growth into the former cyst<symptom> 's cavity. Pathological workup after resection revealed an atypical meningioma ( WHO Grade II). We discuss the possible pathogenesis in light of the scarce published literature as well as the differential diagnosis of this rapidly growing tumor.
