  Vascularized omentum lymphatic transplant ( VOLT) for treatment of lymphedema has become popular because of no risk of iatrogenic lymphedema and abundant lymphatic tissue. However , perfusion to the omentum can be difficult to assess clinically. The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence and degree of ischemia in the omentum. A retrospective study was conducted to review indocyanine green perfusion findings on patients undergoing VOLT. Patients were placed into 4 categories based on the percentage surface area of omentum that was ischemic: normal , less than 25 % , between 25 % and 50 % , and greater than 50 % ischemic. Spearman correlation was performed to determine whether an association exists between prior abdominal surgery and the presence of ischemia. Twenty-six patients underwent VOLT for treatment of extremity lymphedema. Twelve ( 46.2 %) patients had normal perfusion , 8 patients ( 30.8 %) had less than 25 % ischemia , and 6 patients ( 23.1 %) had 25 % to 50 % ischemia. Prior abdominal surgery was not significantly associated with the presence of ischemia. Normal flap perfusion is a requisite for successful VOLT harvest. However , over half the patients had some degree of abnormal perfusion irrespective of prior abdominal surgery. Indocyanine green angiography is an important tool in ensuring a healthy lymphatic reconstruction.
