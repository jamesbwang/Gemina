  Polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) is common in premenopausal women. The majority of women with PCOS have insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D) is higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. In non-pregnant women with PCOS , glycemic status may be assessed by oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) , or HbA1c. OGTT has been reckoned gold standard test for diagnosing T2D , but OGTT is rarely used for diagnostic purpose in other non-pregnant individuals at risk of T2D , apart from PCOS. OGTT has questionable reproducibility , and the high sensitivity of the 2 hour glucose value is at the expense of relatively low specificity , especially regarding impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT). Furthermore , lean women with PCOS are rarely diagnosed with T2D and only few percent of normal-weight women have prediabetes. Glycemic status is necessary at diagnosis and during follow-up of PCOS , especially in women with high risk of T2D ( obesity , previous gestational diabetes ( GDM)). We suggest that OGTT should be used in the same situations in PCOS as in other patient groups at risk of T2D. OGTT is indicated for diagnosing GDM , however , OGTT during pregnancy may not be indicated in lean women with PCOS without other risk factors for GDM.
