  In humans and most other species , changes in the intensity and duration of light provide a critical set of signals for the synchronisation of the circadian system to the astronomical day. The timing of activity within the 24 h day defines an individual 's chronotype , i.e. morning , intermediate or evening type. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between environmental light exposure , due to geographical location , on the chronotype of university students. Over 6 000 university students from cities in the Northern Hemisphere ( Oxford , Munich and Groningen) and Southern Hemisphere ( Perth , Melbourne and Auckland) completed the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire. In parallel , light measures ( daily irradiance , timing of sunrise and sunset) were compiled from satellite or ground stations at each of these locations. Our data shows that later mid-sleep point on free days ( corrected for oversleep on weekends MFS
