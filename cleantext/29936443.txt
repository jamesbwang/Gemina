  Heterotopic pancreas is the presence of pancreatic tissue outside its normal location. It can develop similar pathological conditions that develop in the normal pancreas , including adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions<symptom>. Due to the rarity of the condition , the diagnosis can be challenging , and treatment is not well established. We present a 47-year-old female patient referred for endoscopic resection of a 2 cm polyp in the second part of her duodenum. Complete endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR) was performed , with pathology revealing low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PanIN) in heterotopic pancreatic tissue. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of heterotopic pancreas with low-grade PanIN in the duodenum to be incidentally diagnosed and treated with EMR.
