  This systemic review of the literature and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the current state of the evidence for and against reimplantation of the aortic valve ( RAV) versus the composite valve graft ( CVG) intervention in patients with Marfan syndrome<disease>. Random effects meta-regression was performed across the study arms with logit-transformed proportions of in-hospital deaths as an outcome measure when possible. Results are presented as odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) and P-values. Other outcomes are summarized with medians , interquartile ranges ( IQR) and ranges and the numbers of patients at risk. Twenty retrospective studies that included a combined 2156 patients with long-term follow-up were identified for analysis after a literature search. The in-hospital mortality rate favoured the RAV procedure with an odds ratio of 0.23 ( 95 % CI 0.09-0.55 , P = 0.001). The survival rate at mid-term for the RAV cohort was 96.7 % ( CI 94.2-98.5) vs. 86.4 % ( CI 82.8-89.6) for the CVG group and 93.1 % ( CI 66.4-100) for the RAV group vs. 82.6 % ( CI 74.9-89.2) for the CVG group for the long term. Freedom from valve-related reintervention ( median percentages) for the long term was 97.6 % ( CI 90.3-100 %) for the RAV procedure and 88.6 % ( CI 79.1-95.5) for a CVG. This systematic review of the literature stresses the advantages of the RAV procedure in patients with Marfan syndrome<disease> in regard to long- and short-term results as the treatment of choice in aortic root surgery. The RAV procedure reduces in-hospital as well as long-term deaths and protects against aortic valve reintervention.
