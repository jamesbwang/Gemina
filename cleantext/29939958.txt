  Chronic itch is clinically correlated with the development of mood disorders such as anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> Nonetheless , whether this relevance exists in rodents is unknown , and evidence demonstrating chronic itch can affect mood is lacking. The aim of this study is to characterize the affective consequences of chronic itch , and explore potential mechanisms and interventional strategy. We subjected mice to chronic itch by repetitively cutaneous treatment with acetone and diethylether followed by water ( AEW) that models `` dry skin ''. Following 3-4 weeks AEW treatment , the mice developed behavioral phenotypes of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> assessed by a battery of behavioral paradigms , such as light dark box and forced swim test. These behavioral symptoms of mood disturbance were independent of cutaneous barrier disruption , but correlated well with the degree of the irritating itch sensation. Although AEW mice showed normal circadian hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis activity , their neuroendocrine functionality was dampened , including impaired endocrine stress responsivity , altered neuroendocrine-immune interaction and blunted corticosterone response to both dexamethasone and CRF. Parameters of HPA functionality at the level of mRNA transcripts are altered in stress-related brain regions of AEW mice , implying an overdrive of central CRF system. Remarkably , chronic treatment of AEW mice with antalarmin , a CRFR1 antagonist , ameliorated their both mood impairment and stress axis dysfunction. This is the first evidence revealing mood impairment , HPA axis dysfunction and potential therapeutic efficacy by CRFR1 antagonist in mice with chronic itch , thus providing a preclinical model to investigate the affective consequence of chronic itch and the underlying mechanisms.
