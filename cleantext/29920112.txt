  The reaction of glycals containing good leaving groups with aromatic vinyl azides to give Î±- C-glycosyl amides in good yields is described. Various vinyl azides with different groups undergo the reaction smoothly. In these reactions , an iminodiazonium intermediate is generated by the attack of the vinyl azide onto the glycal under Lewis acid conditions. This undergoes Schmidt-type denitrogenative 1,2-migration to form a nitrilium ion , which , upon hydrolysis , gives the desired C-glycosyl amide.
