  Few studies have investigated the relationship between spiritual/religious coping ( S/R coping) and panic disorder ( PD). This Brazilian longitudinal study evaluated if S/R coping and depressive symptoms can predict PD remission and improved quality of life ( QoL). There were 101 outpatients with PD who were followed up for 12 to 16 weeks. The prevalence ratio ( PR) between positive S/R coping and negative S/R coping and PD remission was assessed , as well as the association between positive S/R coping and negative S/R coping and QoL. After adjusting for confounding factors , positive S/R coping presented an inverse PR with PD remission , which was not statistically significant ( 0.88; p = 0.075). There was no association between S/R coping and QoL. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with PD remission ( PR = 0.97; p < 0.01) and were not predictive of a better QoL.
