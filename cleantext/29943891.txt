  There is a paucity of information on procedural and long-term outcomes of tunneled central venous catheters ( TCVC) in infants and children younger than 3 years undergoing anticancer therapy. This study aims to evaluate the success , safety , and complications leading to surgical revision or premature removal of TCVC in this particular patient group. The clinical course of pediatric patients with percutaneous inserted TCVC , including Groshong ( GC) and Hickman/Broviac ( HB) catheters , has been analyzed retrospectively. The data analysis includes patient and device characteristics , adverse events during insertion , and dwell period complications. A consecutive series of 238 children undergoing implantation of 273 TCVC , including 148 ( 54.2 %) GC and 125 ( 45.8 %) HB catheters , with a total of 38,209 catheter days at risk ( cdr) were reviewed. The patient cohort consisted of 65 ( 23.8 %) infants , 77 ( 28.2 %) children aged 1-2 years , and 131 ( 48.0 %) aged 2-3 years. The overall rate of adverse events during catheter insertion was 12.8 % ( n = 35) with no differences between age groups or devices. The overall rate of long-term complication was 28.2 % ( n = 77 , catheter risk ( CR) per 1,000 cdr = 1.75) , with the highest prevalence in infants ( P = 0.01). The most common complication was late dislocation ( n = 24 , 8.8 % , CR = 0.47) , followed by early dislocation ( n = 20 , 7.3 %) and infection ( n = 18 , 7.4 % , CR = 0.42). Percutaneous landmark-guided insertion of TCVC in neonates and small children with cancer is safe. Patterns of long-term complications are different from those for older children and should be prevented through appropriate management.
