  This article updates the evidence base on outpatient behavioral treatments for adolescent substance use ( ASU) since publication of the previous review completed for this journal by Hogue , Henderson , Ozechowski , and Robbins ( 2014). It first summarizes the Hogue et al. findings along with those from recent literature reviews and meta-analytic studies of ASU treatments. It then presents study design and methods criteria used to select 11 comparative studies subjected to Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology level of support evaluation. These 11 studies are detailed in terms of their sample characteristics , methodological quality , and substance use outcomes. Cumulative level of support designations are then made for each identified treatment approach. These cumulative designations are virtually identical to those of the previous review: ecological family-based treatment , individual cognitive-behavioral therapy , and group cognitive-behavioral therapy remain well-established; behavioral family-based treatment and motivational interviewing remain probably efficacious; drug counseling remains possibly efficacious; and an updated total of 5 multicomponent treatments combining more than 1 approach ( 3 of which include contingency management) are deemed well-established or probably efficacious. Treatment delivery issues associated with evidence-based approaches are then reviewed , focusing on client engagement , fidelity and mediator , and predictor and moderator effects. Finally , to help accelerate innovation in ASU treatment science and practice , the article outlines promising horizons in improving youth identification and access , specifying and implementing pragmatic treatment in community settings , and leveraging emerging lessons from implementation science.
