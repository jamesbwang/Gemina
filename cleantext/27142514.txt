  Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is an aggressive and lethal tumor that has a high frequency of metastatic spread to unpredictable sites. One quarter of patients have either distant metastases or significant local-regional disease with atypical symptoms on presentation. We present a 41-year-old patient with symptoms of right heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and was found to have metastatic renal cell carcinoma with enhancing tumor from left renal vein up to right atrium.
