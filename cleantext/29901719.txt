  Ablation of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is recommended in the guidelines as a Class Ia/IIa indication. However , associated complications should not be dismissed; specifically , inguinal vascular complications ( IVC). Although IVCs are generally considered trivial , they represent an economic burden for the procedure-performing hospital and the patient. Therefore , the ability to monitor and ultimately minimize potential complications is of considerable interest. An economic model was developed to calculate the economic impact for certain IVC-types from a large German single-centre perspective in 2015 and 2016. Twenty-nine of 1040 ( 2.79 %) and 48 of 1152 ( 4.17 %) AF-ablation patients had documented IVC in 2015 and 2016 ( P = 0.08) , respectively. Inguinal vascular complications that required invasive treatment ( thrombin , intervention , surgery) occurred in 0.58 % of the 2015 and in 0.87 % of the 2016 AF-ablation cases. The expected excess costs ( incorporating direct costs , benefit lost adjusted for reimbursement) per patient treated with AF-ablation were 139.54 $ and 153.31 $ in 2015 and 2016 , respectively. This was mostly driven by opportunity costs , which could reach 15 544.71 $ for certain IVC. Sensitivity analysis revealed the probability of occurrence , length of stay of certain IVC types , and the revenue per day influenced the expected costs per AF-ablation patient. Even relatively benign complications such as IVC can result in considerable cost increases. Therefore , measures to reduce them should be established and implemented.
