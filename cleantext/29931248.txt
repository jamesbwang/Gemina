  The Profile 3D annuloplasty ring is a complete , rigid , saddle-shaped ring indicated for reconstruction and/or remodelling of the pathological mitral valve ( MV) in patients with mitral insufficiency. This prospective , non-randomized , observational , postmarket release study characterized the patient population for which the study ring was chosen for MV repair , assessed the relief from MV dysfunction and determined the level of mitral regurgitation ( MR) at follow-up ( 6-12 months postimplant). Between February 2013 and July 2015 , 151 patients were enrolled at 7 centres; data were excluded for 3 patients. The mean age of the remaining 148 patients was 63.8 Â± 12.3 years , and 85 patients ( 57.4 %) were men. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy was present in 15 patients ( 10.1 %) and dilated cardiomyopathy in 12 patients ( 8.1 %). MR was severe in 86 of 145 patients with available data ( 59.3 %). Implantation was successful in 141 of 147 attempted procedures. Two deaths ( n = 148 , 1.4 %) occurred within 30 days , and 1 death ( 0.7 %) occurred > 30 days after implant. Analysis of patients with data from both visits ( n = 111) demonstrated that MR was none or mild in 94.5 % of patients , moderate in 3.6 % and moderate to severe in 1.8 % at follow-up. Nearly all ( 104 of 109 , 95.4 %) patients were in New<pathogen> York Heart Association Class I/II. Among patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy preoperatively , 16 of 19 patients with available data ( 84.2 %) had no or mild MR at follow-up. MV repair using the Profile 3D annuloplasty ring is a safe and effective treatment for MR. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy derive unique benefit from this saddle-shaped ring. www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01112566.
