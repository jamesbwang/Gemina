  Locally advanced colorectal tumors constitute to about 5-22 % of all colorectal cancers at the time of presentation. Multi-visceral resection is usually required for such cases in order to achieve curative resection ( R0). We aim to present our experience of right and transverse colonic en bloc resections and their outcomes. Retrospective review of a prospective database between February 2008 and December 2014. Case notes , operative findings , histopathology results , and follow-up records were analyzed. A total of 23 patients underwent en bloc multi-visceral resections for locally advanced right-sided or transverse colonic cancers. There were 11 males and 12 females. The mean age was 75 years. Fifteen patients were operated electively and eight were done as emergency. Median follow-up was 36 months. Eleven out of 23 ( 47 %) had more than one organ resected. 78.3 % had R0 resections , 17.4 % were R1 , and 4.3 % were indeterminate. The average lymph node yield was 22 ( range 5-45). Senior trainees under supervision did 65 % of procedures. Twelve-month disease-free survival was 90 % and the 5-year survival was 65 %. Right-sided and transverse colonic tumors have a propensity to become locally advanced making curative resections challenging. This is especially relevant when these patients present as an emergency or if the surgeon is less experienced and may opt for a palliative procedure , thus leading to suboptimal outcomes. Multi-visceral resections for locally advanced tumors can be feasible in the district general hospital setting with acceptable outcomes. Multi-disciplinary meeting ( MDM) process , adequate training , and experience are vital.
