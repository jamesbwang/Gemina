  Aberrant activations of the STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathway are associated with cancer and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Three of the four Janus kinases , JAK1 , JAK2 , and Tyk2 , are the major upstream kinases of STAT3 in responses to cytokine stimulations. Among them , JAK2 is the key kinase in the IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Here we report the mechanisms of a natural compound parthenolide from the medicinal herb Feverfew in regulating the JAK/STAT3 signaling. We found that parthenolide was a potent inhibitor of JAKs. It covalently modified the Cys178 , Cys243 , Cys335 , and Cys480 of JAK2 and suppressed its kinase activity. It also interacted with other JAKs in a similar fashion. The binding of parthenolide to JAKs was selective. It preferentially bound to the JAKs , but not to the abundant proteins , such as tubulin and actin. Parthenolide also induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , but the increased ROS did not seem to contribute to the inhibition of JAK/STAT3 signaling. Furthermore , parthenolide inhibited the IL-6-induced cancer cell migration and preferentially inhibited the growth of cancer cells that had constitutively activated STAT3. Our study suggests a novel strategy to inactivate JAKs and provides a promising anti-inflammation and anticancer drug candidate.
