  Reaction of 5,11,17,23-tetra-tert-butyl-dihydroxy-26,28-bis ( 2-pentoxy) calix ( 4) arene ( L ( OH) 2 ( Opentyl) 2) with ( TiCl4) afforded the dichlorotitanoacalix ( 4) arene complex ( TiCl2L ( O) 2 ( Opentyl) 2) ( 1) in good yield. Hydrolysis of 1 led to the isolation of the complex ( ( TiL ( O) 3 ( Opentyl)) 2 ( μ-OH) ( μ-Cl)) ( 2). Reaction of 5,11,17,23,29,35,41,47-p-tert-butyl-49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56-octapropoxycalix ( 8) arene ( L' ( Opropyl) 8) with ( TiCl4) in refluxing toluene afforded , following work-up , a 35: 65 mixture ( 3) of the complex ( Ti ( NCMe) Cl) 2 ( TiCl ( μ-O)) 2L ' and the silicone grease derived complex ( Ti ( NCMe) Cl) 2 ( Ti ( μ-O)) 2 ( OSi ( CH3) 2OSi ( CH3) 2O) L' in which the grease replaces two chloride ligands. The molecular structures of 1 · 2MeCN , 2 · 7 1/4 MeCN , and 3 · 10MeCN have been determined. The complexes were studied using in vitro cell assays and were found to have CC50 values in the range 111-186 μM , i.e. they have low toxicity.
