  Non-attendance for vascular screening potentially restricts the overall benefit of screening at population level , but may be the result of rational judgment on the part of invitees who might not consider their risk to be relevant. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of current use of preventive medication and personal risk attitude as potential factors explaining non-attendance at triple vascular screening. This was a case control study across 25,078 men offered screening and intervention for abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> , peripheral artery disease , and hypertension in the Viborg Vascular ( VIVA) screening trial. Data on socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics , diagnoses , and use of preventive medication were extracted from national registries. A proxy for personal risk attitude was constructed. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals. Use of statins ( 0.78; 95 % CI 0.71-0.85) , antihypertensives ( 1.26 , 95 % CI 1.13-1.41) , or antithrombotics ( 1.13 , 95 % CI 1.04-1.23) were all associated with non-attendance. With regards to personal risk attitude , a statistically significant association was found between users of preventive medication with no recent diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and non-attendance ( 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.72-0.94). The role of traditional factors explaining non-attendance at vascular screening , such as low socio-economic status and comorbidity , was confirmed. Non-attendance at triple vascular screening is influenced by use of preventive medications and traditional explanatory factors of non-attendance at vascular screening , including existing CVD comorbidity. Attendance rates might benefit from rethinking risk communication alongside screening invitations according to varying invitee profiles and clinical risk scenarios , and from providing interventions targeted at individuals with lower levels of health literacy.
