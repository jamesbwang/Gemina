  Recent comprehensive next-generation genome and transcriptome analyses in lung cancer patients , several clinical observations , and compelling evidence from mouse models of lung cancer have uncovered a critical role for Notch signaling in the initiation and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Notably , Rumi is a `` protein O-glucosyltransferase '' that regulates Notch signaling through O-glucosylation of Notch receptors , and is the only enzymatic regulator whose activity is required for both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of Notch. We have conducted a detailed study on RUMI 's involvement in NSCLC development and progression , and have further explored the therapeutic potential of its targeting in NSCLC. We have determined that Rumi is highly expressed in the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelia , including club cells and alveolar type II cells. Remarkably , RUMI maps to the region of chromosome 3q that corresponds to the major signature of neoplastic transformation in NSCLC , and is markedly amplified and overexpressed in NSCLC tumors. Notably , RUMI expression levels are predictive of poor prognosis and survival in NSCLC patients. Our data indicates that RUMI modulates Notch activity in NSCLC cells , and that its silencing dramatically decreases cell proliferation , migration , and survival. RUMI downregulation causes severe cell cycle S-phase arrest , increases genome instability , and induces late apoptotic-nonapoptotic cell death. Our studies demonstrate that RUMI is a novel negative prognostic factor with significant therapeutic potential in NSCLC , which embodies particular relevance especially when considering that , while current Notch inhibitory strategies target only ligand-dependent Notch activation , a large number of NSCLCs are driven by ligand-independent Notch activity.
