  Road traffic accident ( RTA) , an unexpected traumatic event , may not only lead to death and serious physical injuries , but also could put survivors at an increased risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders , particularly acute stress disorder ( ASD). Early assessment of trauma-related psychological responses is important because acute trauma responses in the early post-traumatic period are among the robust predictors of long-term mental health problems. However , estimates of the prevalence of ASD among RTA survivors varied considerably across studies. Therefore , this meta-analysis aimed to identify the pooled prevalence of ASD among RTA survivors. A systematic literature search in the databases of PubMed , PsycINFO , PsycARTICLES , Embase and Web of Science was performed from their inception dates to December 2017. Subject headings were used to identify relevant articles , and the search strategy was adjusted across databases. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by Cochran 's Ï‡ Thirteen eligible studies conducted in 8 countries were included. A total of 2989 RTA survivors were assessed , of which 287 were identified with ASD. The overall heterogeneity was high across studies ( I Nearly one-sixth of RTA survivors suffer from ASD , indicating the need for regular assessment of early trauma responses among RTA survivors , as well as the importance of implementing early psychological interventions.
