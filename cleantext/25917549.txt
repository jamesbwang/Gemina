  Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation , whereas the ability to enter quiescence or dormancy is important for cancer cell survival and disease recurrence. Therefore , understanding the mechanisms regulating cell cycle progression and exit is essential for improving patient outcomes. The MuvB complex of five proteins ( LIN9 , LIN37 , LIN52 , RBBP4 , and LIN54) , also known as LINC ( LIN complex) , is important for coordinated cell cycle gene expression. By participating in the formation of three distinct transcriptional regulatory complexes , including DREAM ( DP , RB-like , E2F , and MuvB) , MMB ( Myb-MuvB) , and FoxM1-MuvB , MuvB represents a unique regulator mediating either transcriptional activation ( during S-G2 phases) or repression ( during quiescence). With no known enzymatic activities in any of the MuvB-associated complexes , studies have focused on the therapeutic potential of protein kinases responsible for initiating DREAM assembly or downstream enzymatic targets of MMB. Furthermore , the mechanisms governing the formation and activity of each complex ( DREAM , MMB , or FoxM1-MuvB) may have important consequences for therapeutic response. The MMB complex is associated with prognostic markers of aggressiveness in several cancers , whereas the DREAM complex is tied to disease recurrence through its role in maintaining quiescence. Here , we review recent developments in our understanding of MuvB function in the context of cancer. We specifically highlight the rationale for additional investigation of MuvB in high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the need for further translational research.
