  The aim was to examine the prevalence of childhood mental disorders in overweight/obese pediatric sample and also to explore the relationship between these pathologies and loss of control eating ( LOC). Another aim was to assess the association between psychopathology and severity of obesity. A total of 170 children from different Health Centers were evaluated ( 84 girls and 86 boys; aged 8 to 12 years). Childhood psychological problems were assessed through a standardized diagnostic interview schedule ( K-SADS-R) and by questionnaires ( STAIC for anxiety<symptom> , CDI for depression<symptom> and ChEAT for disordered eating). Loss of control eating episodes were evaluated through the diagnostic interview. Of the sample , 57.06 % of overweight/obese children met a DSM-5 diagnosis , typically an anxiety<symptom> disorder; and 33.53 % of the overweight/obese children presented loss of control eating episodes. We found more pathologic eating attitudes ( ChEAT) in children who presented LOC versus children who did not. Finally , the scores obtained in the STAIC correlated positively with z-BMI and a positive association was found between z-BMI and the presence of episodes of LOC. These results highlight the importance of including psychological component in the initial assessment and contribute to the understanding of LOC episodes , which are still underestimated in childhood obesity.
