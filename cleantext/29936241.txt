  In the present study , carotenoid metabolism was investigated in the fruits of a novel citrus cultivar , ` Seinannohikari ' ( Citrus spp.). During the maturation , β,β-xanthophylls were accumulated rapidly with β-cryptoxanthin being the dominant carotenoid compound in the flavedo and juice sacs of ` Seinannohikari '. In the juice sacs of mature fruits , ` Seinannohikari ' accumulated high amount of carotenoids , especially β-cryptoxanthin. The content of β-cryptoxanthin in the juice sacs of ` Seinannohikari ' was approximately 2.5 times of that in ` Miyagawa-wase ' ( Citrus unshiu) , which is one of its parental cultivars , at the mature stage. Gene expression results showed that the massive accumulation of β-cryptoxanthin might be attributed to the higher expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes ( CitPSY , CitPDS , CitZDS , CitLCYb2 , CitHYb , and CitZEP) , and lower expression of carotenoid catabolic genes ( CitNCED2 and CitNCED3) in the juice sacs of ` Seinannohikari '.
