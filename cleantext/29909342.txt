  Adipose derived stem cells ( ADSCs) could undergo osteogenesis via focal adhesion kinase ( FAK) and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) 9 signals , both of which could affect Wnt-β-catenin signal , a signal pathway closely related to ADSCs osteogenesis. It 's still enigma whether FAK and BMP-9 contribute to osteogenesis. Here , we examined the effect of FAK on BMP9-inducedosteogenic differentiation , unveiled the possible molecular mechanism underling this process. In the present study , ADSCs were isolated and purified , and cells of passage 3 underwent virus mediated transfection to prepare ADSCs with stable FAK shRNA expression. Cell viability and migration were detected by MTT and transwell assay , respectively. Expression of osteogenic gene , phosphorylation of FAK and GSK were detected by western blot. Osteogenic potential was evaluated by activity of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) and calcium deposition by ALP staining and Alizarin Red S staining. BMP-9 administration promoted ADSCs osteogenesis. Knocking down FAK attenuated this process , inhibited osteogenic proteins expression through Wnt-β-catenin signal. BMP-9 also triggered ADSCs proliferation and migration , and shFAK antagonized such effects too. Although Wnt signal is affected by FAK shRNA , Smad signal remains intact in ADSCs with shFAK. FAK and BMP-9 could cross talk on Wnt signal pathway and promote ADSCs osteogenesis. FAK could participate in BMP-9 induced ADSCs osteogenesis via Wnt signal pathway other than Smads signals ( see in graph).
