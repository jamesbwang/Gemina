  Background/aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate why dementia patients ( DPs) are admitted to a palliative care center ( PCC) and which factors affect the length of stay ( LOS) of DPs in the PCC , and to predict the course of the disease. Materials and methods: The files of DPs were scanned retrospectively in the PCC between 2013 and 2016. Data related to age , sex , LOS , symptoms , clinical conditions , comorbidities , and prognosis were recorded. Results: The study included 85 DPs with a mean age of 84.1 Â± 6.7 years. LOS was determined as a median of 15.0 days. While LOS decreased due to age and cancer , it increased due to pressure injury. Although mortality was increased by LOS , it was decreased by hypertension , mobilization , and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Among the DPs who were admitted to the PCC , the death rate was 54.1 % and the discharge rate was 45.9 %. Conclusion: It is concluded that adopting a palliative care approach eases symptom management. While this approach decreases the burden of symptoms , it at the same time increases the quality of life of DPs and their families.
