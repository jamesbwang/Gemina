  This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy , safety , and feasibility of performing endoscopic submucosal resection with a ligation device ( ESMR-L) after apical mucosal incision ( AMI) for the treatment of gastric subepithelial tumors originating from the muscularis propria ( SET-MPs). 14 patients with gastric SET-MPs were treated by ESMR-L with AMI between December 2016 and May 2017. The complete resection rate , operation duration , and postoperative complications were collected. All patients were followed for 2- 6 months. The complete resection rate was 100 % , the mean tumor size was 10.71 Â± 3.45 mm ( 7- 18 mm) , and the median operative time was 18.5 minutes. Perforation occurred in four patients , with all lesions<symptom> being completely repaired endoscopically. No delayed bleeding or peritoneal signs were observed. No residual lesions<symptom> or recurrence were found during the follow-up period. AMI with ESMR-L appears to be an efficient and simple method for the histological diagnosis of gastric SET-MPs , but it carries a high perforation rate and can not guarantee cure.
