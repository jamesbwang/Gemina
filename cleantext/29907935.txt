  Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone neoplasia affecting individuals in the second decade of life. The survival rate has not been improved during the last 25 years , in part because of the lack of specific markers. The microRNAs have been identified as important regulators of gene expression , experimental evidence suggests these molecules as key players in cancer development and progression. To identify miRNAs differentially expressed in serum from patients with osteosarcoma compared to healthy donors in Mexican population. Fifteen osteosarcoma patients and fifteen age and sex matched healthy individuals were recruited. Two pools of total RNA extracted from serum per study group were prepared and the miRNA expression profiles were analyzed through TaqMan Low Density Arrays. Validation was carried out through RT-qPCR using individual TaqMan assays for those miRNAs differentially expressed. Fifteen miRNAs were differentially expressed in osteosarcoma patients compared to healthy controls. Overexpression of miR-215-5p and miR-642a-5p was confirmed by validation through RT-qPCR. The expression analysis of miRNAs from serum in osteosarcoma patients revealed differential expression of miR-215-5p and miR-642a-5p. Both microRNAs are potential markers for osteosarcoma diagnosis.
