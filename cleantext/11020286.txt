  The enthalpy and Gibbs energy of sublimation are predicted using quantitative structure property relationship ( QSPR) models. In this study , we compare several approaches previously reported in the literature for predicting the enthalpy of sublimation. These models , which were reproduced successfully , exhibit high correlation coefficients , in the range 0.82 to 0.97. There are significantly fewer examples of QSPR models currently described in the literature that predict the Gibbs energy of sublimation; here we describe several models that build upon the previous models for predicting the enthalpy of sublimation. The most robust and predictive model constructed using multiple linear regression , with the fewest number of descriptors for estimating this property , was obtained with an R
