  The industrial application of Trichoderma<pathogen> reesei has been greatly limited by insufficient β-glucosidase activity in its cellulase system. In this study , a novel β-glucosidase expression cassette was constructed and integrated at the target site in T. reesei ZU-02 , which achieved the overexpression of β-glucosidase gene and in situ disruption of the cellulase transcriptional repressor ACE1. The resulting transformants showed significant increase in both β-glucosidase activity ( BGA) and filter paper activity ( FPA). The BGA and FPA increased to 25.13 IU/mL and 20.06 FPU/mL , respectively , 167- and 2.45-fold higher than that of the host strain. Meanwhile , the obtained cellulase system exhibited improved ratio of BGA to FPA , leading to better synergistic effect between cellulase components. Furthermore , submerged fermentation of the transformant was established in 50 m
