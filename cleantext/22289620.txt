  Suboptimal temporal sampling of time-activity curves ( TAC) from dynamic The 1T2k + VB model was selected. The target K1 value as the objective was 0.506 mL/ccm/min ( range 0.216-1.246). Results showed a significant difference between K1 values from the simulated TAC with the seven different time samplings analyzed. The closest K1 value from the simulated TAC to the target K1 value was obtained by the 12 × 5 ″ -8 × 30 ″ time sampling. Concerning the clinical validation , K1 values extracted from the optimal time sampling ( 12 × 5 ″ -8 × 30 ″) were significantly different with K1 values extracted from the other time samplings , except for the comparison with K1 values extracted from the 10 × 5 ″ -4 × 10 ″ -3 × 20 ″ -5 × 30 ″ time sampling. A two-phase framing of dynamic PET reconstruction with frame durations of 5 s ( blood phase) and 30 s ( tissue phase) could be used to sample the TAC for uptake quantification in prostate cancer assessment.
