  In recognition of potential for increased overdose risk , drug labels for extended-release and long-acting ( ER/LA) opioids emphasize the need for established opioid tolerance prior to initiating high dosages. Describe the proportion of patients with opioid tolerance prior to initiation of 90 morphine milligram equivalents ( MME) ER/LA opioids and examine subsequent risk of opioid poisoning<disease>. We used Truven Health Analytics ' MarketScan Databases ( 2006-2015) to identify patients initiating ER/LA opioids ≥ 90 MME. We examined prescription histories and describe the proportion of initiators with opioid tolerance ( defined as ≥ 7 days of 60 MME in the prior 14 days). We adjusted for age , sex , year of initiation , and baseline comorbidities using inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox proportional hazards models. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the effect of opioid tolerance on the risk of clinically recognized opioid poisoning<disease> ( based on diagnosis codes) in specific periods ( 0-7 , 8-30 , 31-90 , and 91-365 days) following initiation. Among 372 038 initiators , 38 % did not meet opioid tolerance criteria. The proportion of nontolerant initiators was highest among those initiating methadone ( 44 %) and fentanyl ( 42 %). Nontolerant patients were 37 % more likely to be diagnosed with opioid poisoning<disease> ( adjusted hazard ratios = 1.37 ( 1.07 , 1.76)) in the week following ER/LA initiation. Over one-third of patients initiating ≥ 90 MME ER/LA opioids did not have evidence of opioid tolerance. The 7 days following high dose ER/LA initiation may represent a high-risk period for clinically diagnosed opioid poisoning<disease> in patients who do not have prior opioid tolerance.
