  Natural products ( NPs) are progressively recognized as invaluable source of pharmacological tools and lead structures. To enable NP-inspired retinoid X receptor ( RXR) modulator design , three novel RXR-targeting NPs were computationally identified. Among them , valerenic acid was found to be selective for RXRÎ² , rendering it a unique pharmacological tool compound. The NPs then served as templates for automated , ligand-based de novo design of innovative , easily accessible mimetics that inherited the biological activities of their natural templates.
