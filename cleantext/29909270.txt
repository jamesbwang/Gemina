  Thiodiglycolic acid ( TDGA) is a major metabolite of vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM) , and it has been suggested as an exposure biomarker for VCM. The validity of this biomarker when the level of VCM is less than 5 ppm , however , is questionable. The objective of this article is to evaluate the feasibility of using urinary TDGA as a biomarker of VCM exposure in a community health risk assessment setting where the concentration of VCM in air is typically very low ( likely below 1 ppm). To achieve this objective , we examine the fraction of urinary TDGA associated with different levels of VCM exposures of three studies from different countries , using estimations of the TDGA metabolite predicted by a PBPK model. It is demonstrated that differences in background TDGA have considerable effect on the adequacy of TDGA as a biomarker of VCM. We conclude that , in a community health assessment setting , TDGA should not be used as an exposure biomarker for VCM without having a proper control group , and a PBPK model can be used first to determine whether or not the amount of TDGA in urine is of concern.
