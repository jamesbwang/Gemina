  Vitamin D depletion is associated with unfavourable outcomes after hip fracture. However , the classes of vitamin D status currently in use , which are defined according to serum calcifediol levels , have not been validated for their predictive capability of the functional recovery. To investigate the association between serum calcifediol categorized into 4 classes and the functional recovery after hip fracture. Prospective , short-term observational study. Rehabilitation hospital in Italy. We evaluated 1350 of 1412 inpatients with hip fracture. Serum calcifediol was measured by an immunoenzymatic assay 14.7 ± 4.4 ( mean ± SD) days after surgery and categorized into 4 classes: I class < 12ng/ml; II class 12-20ng/ ml; III class 21-29ng/ ml; IV class ≥ 30ng/ml. The functional outcome was assessed by using the Barthel index. We found a significant difference in Barthel index scores at the end of inpatient rehabilitation across the 4 classes of vitamin D status: 2 ( 3 , n = 1350) 27.2; p < 0.001. The difference persisted after adjustment for 8 covariates ( p = 0.004). By comparing pairs of classes , we found that Barthel index scores were lower in the 829 patients of the I class than in the 275 of the II ( p = 0.005) who had in turn Barthel index scores lower than the 132 patients of the III class ( p = 0.038). Conversely , no significant differences emerged between the patients of the III class and the 114 patients of the IV class ( p = 0.421). The results did not materially change when Barthel Index effectiveness was substituted for Barthel Index scores as the outcome measure. Calcifediol levels below 12ng/ml were associated with a worse recovery than those between 12 and 20ng/ml that were in turn associated with a worse recovery than those between 21 and 29ng/ml. Conversely , no significant differences were found between the patients with calcifediol between 21 and 29ng/ml and those with calcifediol ≥ 30ng/ml. Despite caution due to the observational design , our study suggests that vitamin D depletion should be treated after hip fracture to optimize the functional outcome , with a target level for serum calcifediol of 21-29ng/ ml and no further advantages associated with calcifediol levels of 30ng/ml or higher.
