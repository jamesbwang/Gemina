  Neuroprotection is created following the inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R). Therefore , the purpose of this research was examining AT1R blockage by candesartan in diffuse traumatic brain injury ( TBI). Male rats were assigned into sham , TBI , vehicle , and candesartan groups. Candesartan ( 0.3 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered IP , 30 min post-TBI. Brain water and Evans blue contents were determined , 24 and 5 hr after TBI , respectively. Intracranial pressure ( ICP) and neurologic outcome were evaluated at -1 , 1 , 4 and 24 hr after TBI. Oxidant index ( malondialdehyde ( MDA)) was determined 24 hr after TBI. Brain water and Evans blue contents , and MDA and ICP levels increased in TBI and vehicle groups in comparison with the sham group. Candesartan attenuated the TBI-induced brain water and Evans blue contents , and ICP and MDA enhancement. The neurologic score enhanced following candesartan administration , 24 hr after TBI. The blockage of AT1R may be neuroprotective by decreasing ICP associated with the reduction of lipid peroxidation , brain edema<symptom> , and blood-brain barrier ( BBB) permeability , which led to the improvement of neurologic outcome.
