  Aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases are crucial enzymes for initiation step of translation. Possessing editing activity , they protect living cells from misincorporation of non-cognate and non-proteinogenic amino acids into proteins. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase ( TyrRS) does not have such editing properties , but it shares weak stereospecificity in recognition of d-/ l-tyrosine ( Tyr). Nevertheless , an additional enzyme , d-aminoacyl-tRNA-deacylase ( DTD) , exists to overcome these deficiencies. The precise catalytic role of hydroxyl groups of the tRNA
