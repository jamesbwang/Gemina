  This study tested the mechanism of the oxidative stress ( OS)- induced senescence pathway at the feto-maternal interface cells. Primary amnion mesenchymal cells ( AMCs) , chorion and decidual cells isolated from the placental membranes<symptom> of women at normal term ( not in labor) were exposed to OS-inducing cigarette smoke extract ( CSE) for 48 h. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was measured using 2 ' 7 '- dichlorodihydrofluorescein. Western blot analysis determined phosphorylated ( P) p38MAPK and p53 expression. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase ( SA-β-Gal) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP9) histochemistry were used to measure senescence and inflammation<symptom> respectively. Cotreatment of cells with the antioxidant , N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC) , or the p38MAPK inhibitor , SB203580 ( SB) , verified the activation specificity. CSE increased ROS production from AMCs , chorion cells , and decidual cells ( P < 0.05) compared to controls. Western blot analysis determined that CSE induced p38MAPK activation ( P < 0.05) and cotreatment with NAC inhibited ROS production and p38MAPK activation ( P < 0.05) in all cell types. CSE did not increase p53 phosphorylation in any of the cells; however , AMCs showed constitutive P-p53 expression. CSE increased senescence in AMCs and chorion cells compared to controls ( P = 0.01 and P = 0.003 , respectively); however , senescence was not observed in decidual cells. Senescence was significantly reduced following cotreatment with SB and NAC ( AMCs; P = 0.01 and chorion; P = 0.009). CSE increased MMP9 in all cells that was reduced by NAC. OS induced p38MAPK activation and inflammation<symptom> in all cell types that was associated with senescence in fetal cells but not in maternal cells.
