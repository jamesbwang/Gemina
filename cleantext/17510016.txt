  Recent analyses of metabolic rates in fishes , echinoderms , crustaceans and cephalopods have concluded that bathymetric declines in temperature- and mass-normalized metabolic rate do not result from resource-limitation ( e.g. oxygen or food/chemical energy) , decreasing temperature or increasing hydrostatic pressure. Instead , based on contrasting bathymetric patterns reported in the metabolic rates of visual and non-visual taxa , declining metabolic rate with depth is proposed to result from relaxation of selection for high locomotory capacity in visual predators as light diminishes. Here , we present metabolic rates of Holothuroidea , a non-visual benthic and benthopelagic echinoderm class , determined
