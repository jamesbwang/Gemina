  The pathologist 's role in the multidisciplinary treatment of rectal cancer is to evaluate and stage the tumor according to the latest standards , as well as indicate the quality of the surgical act. This study aims to evaluate circumferential and distal resection margins as well as quality of mesorectal resection and correlate them with different clinical , pathological and therapeutic factors. Four hundred ninety-eight patients treated radically for mid and low rectal cancer within one Clinic of Oncological Surgery in Iasi , Romania , were included in this study. The distal resection margin showed significant correlations with the type of surgical intervention , chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment plan and pathological node staging. The circumferential resection margin depended mostly on pathological node staging and the length of the interval between neoadjuvant treatment and surgery.
