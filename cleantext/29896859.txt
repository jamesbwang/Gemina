  Echocardiographic determination of the RV end-systolic base/apex ( RVESb/a) ratio was proposed to be of clinical value for the assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) in adults. We hypothesized that the RVES b/a ratio will be affected in children with PAH and aimed to correlate the RVES b/a ratio with conventionally used echocardiographic and hemodynamic variables , and with NYHA functional class ( FC). We first determined normal pediatric values for the RVES b/a ratio in 157 healthy children ( 68 male; age range: 0.5-17.7 yrs.). We then conducted an echocardiographic study in 51 children with PAH ( 29 male , age range: 0.3-17.8 yrs.). The RVES b/a ratio was lower compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls ( p < 0.001). In children with PAH , the RVES b/a ratio decreased with worsening NYHA FC. The RVES b/a ratio inversely correlated with RV/LV end-systolic diameter ratio ( ρ = -0.450 , p = 0.001) , but did not correlate with RV systolic function parameters , i.e. tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and correlated with the cardiac catheterization determined pulmonary vascular resistance index ( ρ = -0.571 , p < 0.001). ROC analysis unraveled an excellent performance of the RVES b/a ratio to detect PAH in children ( p < 0.001 , AUC: 0.95 , CI: 0.89-1.00). The RVES b/a ratio decreased in children with PAH compared to age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. The RVES b/a ratio inversely correlated with both echocardiographic and hemodynamic indicators of increased RV pressure afterload , and with NYHA FC , suggesting the RVES b/a ratio to reflect disease severity in PAH children.
