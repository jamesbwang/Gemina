  In the course of neurological early rehabilitation , decannulation is attempted in tracheotomized patients after weaning due to its considerable prognostic significance. We aimed to identify predictors of a successful tracheostomy decannulation. From 09/2014 to 03/2016 , 831 tracheotomized and weaned patients ( 65.4 Â± 12.9 years , 68 % male) were included consecutively in a prospective multicentric observation study. At admission , sociodemographic and clinical data ( e.g. relevant neurological and internistic diseases , duration of mechanical ventilation , tracheotomy technique , and nutrition) as well as functional assessments ( Coma<symptom> Recovery Scale-Revised ( CRS-R) , Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index , Bogenhausener Dysphagia Score) were collected. Complications and the success of the decannulation procedure were documented at discharge. Four hundred seventy patients ( 57 %) were decannulated. The probability of decannulation was significantly negatively associated with increasing age ( OR 0.68 per SD = 12.9 years , p < 0.001) , prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation ( OR 0.57 per 33.2 days , p < 0.001) and complications. An oral diet ( OR 3.80; p < 0.001) and a higher alertness at admission ( OR 3.07 per 7.18 CRS-R points; p < 0.001) were positively associated. This study identified practically measurable predictors of decannulation , which in the future can be used for a decannulation prognosis and supply optimization at admission in the neurological early rehabilitation clinic.
