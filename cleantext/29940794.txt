  Autophagy dysfunction is a potential toxic effect of nanoparticles. Previous studies have indicated that silica nanoparticles ( SiNPs) induce macroautophagy/autophagy dysfunction , while the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. Hence , the present study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which SiNPs enhanced autophagosome synthesis , which then contributed to autophagy dysfunction. First , the effects of SiNPs on autophagy and autophagic flux were verified using transmission electron microscopy , laser scanning confocal microscopy , and western blot assays. Then , the activation of endoplasmic reticular ( ER) stress was validated to be through the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways but not the ERN1-XBP1 pathway , along with the upregulation of downstream ATF4 and DDIT3. Thereafter , the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate ( 4-PBA) was used to verify that SiNP-induced autophagy could be influenced by ER stress. Furthermore , specialized lentiviral shRNA were employed to determine that autophagy was induced via specific activation of the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways. Finally , the 2 autophagic genes LC3B and ATG12 were found to be transcriptionally upregulated by downstream ATF4 and DDIT3 in ER stress , which contributed to the SiNP-enhanced autophagosome synthesis. Taken together , these data suggest that SiNPs induced autophagosome accumulation via the activation of the EIF2AK3 and ATF6 UPR pathways in hepatocytes , which offers a new insight into detailed molecular mechanisms underlying SiNP-induced autophagy dysfunction , and specifically how UPR pathways regulate key autophagic genes. This work provides novel evidence for the study of toxic effects and risk assessment of SiNPs.
