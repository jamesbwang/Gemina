  One of the main obstacles of electrode implantation in epilepsy surgery is the electrode shift between implantation and the day of explantation. We evaluated this possible electrode displacement using intraoperative MRI ( iopMRI) data and CT/MRI reconstruction. Thirteen patients ( nine female , four male , median age 26 ± 9.4 years) suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy were examined. After implantation , the position of subdural electrodes was evaluated by 3.0 T-MRI and thin-slice CCT for 3D reconstruction. Localization of electrodes was performed with the volume-rendering technique. Post-implantation and pre-explantation 1.5 T-iopMRI scans were coregistered with the 3D reconstructions to determine the extent of electrode dislocation. Intraoperative MRI at the time of explantation revealed a relevant electrode shift in one patient ( 8 %) of 10 mm. Median electrode displacement was 1.7 ± 2.6 mm with a coregistration error of 1.9 ± 0.7 mm. The median accuracy of the neuronavigation system was 2.2 ± 0.9 mm. Six of twelve patients undergoing resective surgery were seizure<symptom> free ( Engel class 1A , median follow-up 37.5 ± 11.8 months). Comparison of pre-explantation and post-implantation iopMRI scans with CT/MRI data using the volume-rendering technique resulted in an accurate placement of electrodes. In one patient with a considerable electrode dislocation , the surgical approach and extent was changed due to the detected electrode shift.
