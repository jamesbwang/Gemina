  Currently , more than half of newly diagnosed cancer patients receive radiation treatment. However , the radioresistance of tumor cells as well as the early and late side effects limit the beneficial outcome of radiotherapy. Accordingly , the innovative approaches to maximize tumor killing and/or minimize radiation toxicity remain a major focus of interest. In the past decade , several pieces of evidence have shown the importance of different modes of regulated cell death ( RCD) in the radioresponse of malignant and normal tissues. Furthermore , the biological modulation of radiation-induced RCDs has come to attention as a novel therapeutic means. Here , we review the major signaling pathways that orchestrate all types of RCD initiated by exposure to ionizing radiation. The latest advances in the development of small-molecule RCD modulators ( both natural and synthetic) that are intended for widening the therapeutic window of radiotherapy are also discussed.
