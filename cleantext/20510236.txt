  Proinflammatory cytokine activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription ( JAK/STAT) signal transduction pathway is a critical event in the pathogenesis and progression of rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Under normal conditions , JAK/STAT signaling reflects the influence of negative regulators of JAK/STAT , exemplified by the suppressor of cytokine signaling and protein inhibitor of activated STAT. However , in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) both of these regulators are dysfunctional. Thus , continuous activation of JAK/STAT signaling in RA synovial joints results in the elevated level of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression , increased frequency of apoptotic chondrocytes and most prominently ` apoptosis resistance ' in the inflamed synovial tissue. Tofacitinib , a JAK small molecule inhibitor , with selectivity for JAK2/JAK3 was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( US FDA) for the therapy of RA. Importantly , tofacitinib has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy for RA in the post-US FDA-approval surveillance period. Of note , the success of tofacitinib has spurred the development of JAK1 , JAK2 and other JAK3-selective small molecule inhibitors , some of which have also entered the clinical setting , whereas other JAK inhibitors are currently being evaluated in RA clinical trials.
