  To investigate the effects of atorvastatin on the surgical treatment of patients with chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH). Our retrospective study included 245 consecutive adult patients undergoing burr-hole craniotomy for CSDH. Data included baseline characteristics and recurrence , postoperative complications , and mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression models analyzed the association between administration of atorvastatin perioperatively and recurrence rates. Multivariate analysis showed perioperative atorvastatin administration ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.336; P = 0.039) , diabetes mellitus ( OR 3.949 , P = 0.010) , and GCS of 15 preoperatively ( OR 0.197; P = 0.020) to be significantly related to recurrence risk. Postoperative complications and mortality did not significantly differ between patients with and those without atorvastatin therapy. Our findings demonstrate that the administration of atorvastatin perioperatively is associated with a lower risk of CSDH recurrence rate. The use of atorvastatin perioperatively was not associated with higher rates of morbidity or mortality.
