  The whale shark ( None Aggregation sites were significantly shallower than non-aggregation sites and in closer proximity to deep water ( the mesopelagic zone) by two orders of magnitude. Slope at aggregation sites was significantly steeper than non-aggregation sites. These three bathymetric variables were shown to have the biggest association with aggregation sites , with up to 88 % of deviation explained by the GLMs. The three key bathymetric characteristics similar at the aggregation sites are known to induce upwelling events , increase primary productivity and consequently attract numerous other filter feeding species. The location of aggregation sites in these key areas can be attributed to this increased prey availability , thought to be the main reason
