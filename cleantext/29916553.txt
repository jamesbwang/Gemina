  The present study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA ( miRNA/miR) 184 in osteosarcoma growth , development and metastasis , and the effects of miRNA‑184 on the proliferation , invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells and associated mechanisms. In vitro , miR‑184 was transfected into U‑2OS cells and 143B cells. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR‑184. MTT was utilized to detect cell proliferation. A Transwell assay was applied to detect cell invasiveness. In vivo , an osteosarcoma tibial orthotopic metastatic tumor model was established , and western blotting and RT‑qPCR were used to detect the expression of Wnt and β‑catenin. Following the overexpression of miR‑184 , the proliferation and cell invasion ability were significantly increased in U‑2OS and 143B cells. Following inhibition of miR‑184 , cell proliferation and cell invasion ability were significantly decreased. In nude mice , tumor volume significantly increased following overexpression of miR‑184 , and Wnt and phosphorylated β‑catenin levels were significantly increased. Following miR‑184 inhibition , tumor volume was significantly decreased , and Wnt and phosphorylated β‑catenin levels were significantly decreased. The results of the present study indicated that the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway serves a key function in the mechanism of osteosarcoma. Inhibition of miRNA‑184 may reduce tumor volume of osteosarcoma via regulation of the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway and may provide a novel strategy for the future diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma.
