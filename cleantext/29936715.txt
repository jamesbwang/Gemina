  Objective: This study aims to isolate the active anticancer compound from ethyl acetate fraction extracted from the roots of Calotropis gigantea and to determine the operating mechanism of the isolates towards WiDr colon cancer cells. Methods: the isolation was conducted by using bioassay guided isolation approach method. The cytotoxic potential was determined by using MTT method. The chemical structure was identified by using UPLCMS/MS and NMR-1H spectroscopy. The cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction were determined by flow cytometry method. The expression of caspase-8 was determined by immunocytochemistry method. Results: The results showed that the active compounds are obtained calotroposid A compound which is glycosides terpenoids. Calotroposide A is capable of inhibiting the growth of WiDr colon cancer cells at IC50 17.23 Î¼g/ml. Cell apoptosis induction took place and was indicated by cell apoptosis increase , S and G2/M accumulation and by caspase-8 expression. Conclusion: Calotroposide A induces anticancer activity against WiDr colon cancer cells by means of apoptosis induction mechanism through extrinsic pathway with increased expression of caspase-8.
