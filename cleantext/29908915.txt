  Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> appears as an often multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen in hospitals worldwide. Its remarkable persistence in the hospital environment is probably due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics , tolerance to desiccation stress , capability to form biofilms , and is possibly facilitated by surface-associated motility. Our attempts to elucidate surface-associated motility in A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> revealed a mutant inactivated in a putative DNA- ( adenine N6)- methyltransferase , designated A1S_0222 in strain ATCC 17978. We recombinantly produced A1S_0222 as a glutathione S-transferase ( GST) fusion protein and purified it to near homogeneity through a combination of GST affinity chromatography , cation exchange chromatography and PD-10 desalting column. Furthermore we demonstrate A1S_0222-dependent adenine methylation at a GAATTC site. We propose the name AamA ( Acinetobacteradenine methyltransferase A) in addition to the formal names M.AbaBGORF222P/ M.Aba17978ORF8565P. Small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS) revealed that the protein is monomeric and has an extended and likely two-domain shape in solution.
