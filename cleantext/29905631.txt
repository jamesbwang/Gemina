  For superficial surgery of anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces of the upper arm , the medial brachial cutaneous nerve ( MBCN) and the intercostobrachial nerve ( ICBN) must be selectively blocked , in addition to an axillary brachial plexus block. We compared efficacy of ultrasound-guided ( USG) versus conventional block of the MBCN and the ICBN. Eighty-four patients , undergoing upper limb surgery , were randomized to receive either USG ( n = 42) or conventional ( n = 42) block of the MBCN and the ICBN with 1 % mepivacaine. Sensory block was evaluated using light-touch on the upper and lower half of the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces of the upper arm at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 minutes after nerve blocks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had no sensation in all 4 regions innervated by the MBCN and the ICBN at 20 minutes. Secondary outcomes were onset time of complete anesthesia , volume of local anesthetic , tourniquet tolerance , and quality of ultrasound images. In the USG group , 37 patients ( 88 %) had no sensation at 20 minutes in any of the 4 areas tested versus 8 patients ( 19 %) in the conventional group ( P < 0.001). When complete anesthesia was obtained , it occurred within 10 minutes in more than 90 % of patients , in both groups. Mean total volumes of local anesthetic used for blocking the MBCN and the ICBN were similar in the 2 groups. Ultrasound images were of good quality in only 20 ( 47.6 %) of 42 patients. Forty-one patients ( 97.6 %) who received USG block were comfortable with the tourniquet versus 16 patients ( 38.1 %) in the conventional group ( P < 0.001). Ultrasound guidance improved the efficacy of the MBCN and ICBN blocks. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT02940847.
