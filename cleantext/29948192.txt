  Amacrine cells are critical for processing of visual signals , but little is known about their electrotonic structure and passive membrane properties. AII amacrine cells are multifunctional interneurons in the mammalian retina and essential for both rod- and cone-mediated vision. Their dendrites are the site of both input and output chemical synapses and gap junctions that form electrically coupled networks. This electrical coupling is a challenge for developing realistic computer models of single neurons. Here , we combined multiphoton microscopy and electrophysiological recording from dye-filled AII amacrine cells in rat retinal slices to develop morphologically accurate compartmental models. Passive cable properties were estimated by directly fitting the current responses of the models evoked by voltage pulses to the physiologically recorded responses , obtained after blocking electrical coupling. The average best-fit parameters ( obtained at- 60 mV and ~ 25 °C) were 0.91 µF cm
