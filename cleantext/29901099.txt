  Bigelovii A is a 30‑nortriterpenoid glycoside , isolated from Salicornia bigelovii Torr. Until now , the effect of Bigelovii A on breast cancer treatment was unknown. The present research indicated that Bigelovii A significantly inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells ( MCF‑7 , MDA‑MB‑231 and MDA‑MB‑468) in a concentration‑dependent manner. It was particularly effective in MCF7 cells , with an IC50 value of 4.10 ± 1.19 µM. The anti‑proliferative effect of Bigelovii A was ascribed to the induction of apoptosis , which was characterized by chromatin condensation , externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane , hypodiploid DNA , activation of caspases and poly ( ADP‑ribose) polymerase cleavage. Furthermore , Bigelovii A reduced B-cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl‑2) and B‑cell lymphoma‑extra large ( Bcl‑xl) expression and caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential , which are indicative features of mitochondria‑dependent apoptotic signals. It was also identified that Bigelovii A downregulated the constitutive activation of nuclear factor ( NF) κB , as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore , Bigelovii A suppressed constitutive IκBα phosphorylation via inhibition of IκB kinase activity. In addition to the effects on Bcl‑2 and Bcl‑xl , Bigelovii A also downregulated the expression of the NF‑κB‑regulated gene products , Cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase‑2. This led to the induction of apoptosis and arrest of cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
