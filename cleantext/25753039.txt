  Endothelial cell VCAM-1 regulates recruitment of lymphocytes , eosinophils , mast cells , or dendritic cells during allergic inflammation<symptom>. In this report , we demonstrated that , during allergic lung responses , there was reduced zonula occludens ( ZO) -1 localization in lung endothelial cell junctions , whereas there was increased lung endothelial cell expression of VCAM-1 , N-cadherin , and angiomotin. In vitro , leukocyte binding to VCAM-1 reduced ZO-1 in endothelial cell junctions. Using primary human endothelial cells and mouse endothelial cell lines , Ab crosslinking of VCAM-1 increased serine phosphorylation of ZO-1 and induced dissociation of ZO-1 from endothelial cell junctions , demonstrating that VCAM-1 regulates ZO-1. Moreover , VCAM-1 induction of ZO-1 phosphorylation and loss of ZO-1 localization at cell junctions was blocked by inhibition of VCAM-1 intracellular signals that regulate leukocyte transendothelial migration , including NOX2 , PKCÎ± , and PTP1B. Furthermore , exogenous addition of the VCAM-1 signaling intermediate H
