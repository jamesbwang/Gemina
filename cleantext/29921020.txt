  Spore ( akinete) formation in the heterocystous and branched filamentous cyanobacterium Fischerella muscicola involves a significant increase in cell size and formation of several endospores in each of the cells. In present study , the physico-chemical factors ( pH , light sources , nutrient deficiency , nitrogen sources , carbon sources , and growth hormones) affecting the germination of spores of F. muscicola were examined. Increase in spore germination frequency was detected above pH 8 with maximum germination ( 46.04 %) recorded at pH 9 , whereas a significant decrease in germination was observed at pH 6 when compared to control ( pH 7.6). Spore germination was not observed at pH 5. Among light sources germination frequency followed the following order , that is , red light ( 39.9 %) > white light ( 33.8 %) > yellow light ( 3.4 %) > green light ( 1.3 %) whereas germination did not take place in dark and blue light.
