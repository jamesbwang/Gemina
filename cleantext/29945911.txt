  Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein ( CTMP) has been implicated in cancer , brain injury , and obesity. However , the role of CTMP in pathological cardiac hypertrophy has not been identified. In this study , decreased expression of CTMP was observed in both human failing hearts and murine hypertrophied hearts. To further explore the potential involvement of CTMP in pathological cardiac hypertrophy , cardiac-specific CTMP knockout and overexpression mice were generated. In vivo experiments revealed that CTMP deficiency exacerbated the cardiac hypertrophy , fibrosis<disease> , and function induced by pressure overload , whereas CTMP overexpression alleviated the response to hypertrophic stimuli. Consistent with the in vivo results , adenovirus-mediated gain-of-function or loss-of-function experiments showed that CTMP also exerted a protective effect against hypertrophic responses to angiotensin II in vitro. Mechanistically , CTMP ameliorated pathological cardiac hypertrophy through the blockade of the protein kinase B signaling pathway. Moreover , inhibition of protein kinase B activation with LY294002 rescued the deteriorated effect in aortic banding-treated cardiac-specific CTMP knockout mice. Taken together , these findings imply , for the first time , that increasing the cardiac expression of CTMP may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
