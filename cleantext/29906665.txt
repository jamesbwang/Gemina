  Two experiments were performed to evaluate the reproductive performance of zebu beef cows treated with different doses of eCG at the end of a progesterone ( P4)/ estrogen based protocol for timed artificial insemination ( TAI). In Experiment 1 , suckling Bos indicus Nelore cows ( n = 261) received , on day 0 , a progesterone ( P4) intravaginal device ( PD) and an injection of 1 mg estradiol benzoate ( EB). On day 8 , the PD was removed , 500 Î¼g of cloprostenol was injected , and cows were assigned to one of the following groups: Control ( no treatment) , 300 ( 300 IU of eCG) , 600 ( 600 IU of eCG) , and 900 ( 900 IU of eCG). On day 9 , all cows received 1 mg EB and TAI performed 54-56 h after cloprostenol injection. A pregnancy diagnosis was done by ultrasound scanning 40 days after TAI , and the number of fetuses and calves was recorded at pregnancy diagnosis and at birth. More cows treated with eCG displayed estrus within 48 h after removal of the PD ( 42.3 % vs. 11.6 % , P < 0.01) , and ovulated more than one follicle ( 42 % , 58/138 vs. 1.8 % , 1/54; P < 0.01). This effect on ovulation rate was dose dependent ( P < 0.05). The pregnancy rate was affected only by cow parity ( primiparous , 25.3 % vs. multiparous , 48.9 %; P < 0.01). Twin pregnancy was higher ( P < 0.01) in cows treated with eCG ( 42 % , 58/138) than controls ( 0 % , 0/54). However , few cows ( 33.3 %) were able to keep both fetuses intact until birth. For evaluation of ovarian characteristics by B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography , 43 Nelore cows were submitted In Experiment 2 to the same four groups described in Experiment 1. Although no difference ( P > 0.1) was observed for size and blood perfusion in the pre-ovulatory follicles , corpus luteum was larger and with greater blood perfusion ( P < 0.05) in eCG-treated cows. In conclusion , eCG increased the number of double/multiple ovulations in a dose-dependent manner , induced larger and more vascularized corpora lutea , but did not affect the fertility of cyclic or anestrous cows. Although eCG results in twin pregnancies , most of cows underwet embryo/fetus loss and birth a single calf.
