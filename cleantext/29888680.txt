  Violence against women ( VAW) in Turkey is concerning , and to develop and implement effective prevention strategies for addressing it , careful consideration must be given to the factors that influence it. In this review , we synthesized the body of literature on VAW in Turkey according to a social ecological framework , which is a theoretical model considering the complex interplay between individual , relationship , community , and societal factors. Consistent with this framework , we obtained research articles and commentaries in Turkish and English from a variety of national and international databases and websites regarding risk factors , cultural practices violating women 's rights , and trends and current practices , including prevention efforts. Our review revealed that factors influencing VAW are marriage at young age , lower education level , alcohol abuse , and childhood trauma or abuse history for individual level; having multiple partners , low relationship satisfaction , and forced marriage for relationship level; poverty , lack of social support , and lack of employment opportunities for community level; cultural acceptance of men 's superiority and dominance over women , acceptance of violence , cultural practices , and weak legal sanctions for societal level. Additionally , we reviewed multilevel prevention strategies in the extant literature on effective prevention and intervention efforts according to social ecological framework and proposed research , practice , and policy implications derived from this framework.
