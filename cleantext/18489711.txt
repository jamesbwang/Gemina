  To evaluate the use of a pretest probability score ( 4Ts score) in cancer patients to guide ordering of laboratory screening tests for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( HIT). A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients ( n = 140) in whom laboratory testing for HIT was requested. 4Ts scores were calculated and correlated with heparin-endogenous platelet factor 4 antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) test results. All patients with a high pretest probability of HIT ( 4Ts score = 6-7) had positive ELISA results , compared to 26.1 % of patients with intermediate ( 4Ts score = 4-5) and 4.3 % of patients with low ( 4Ts score â‰¤ 3) pretest probability. No patients with 4Ts scores of 2 or less had positive ELISA results. HIT can be ruled out in cancer patients ( negative predictive value and sensitivity = 100 %) with low pretest probability , defined by 4Ts scores of 2 or less , significantly reducing the need for laboratory testing in this patient population.
