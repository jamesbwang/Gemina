  Andean populations have variable degrees of Native American and European ancestry , representing an opportunity to study admixture dynamics in the populations from Latin America ( also known as Hispanics). We characterized the genetic structure of two indigenous ( Nasa and Pijao) and three admixed ( Ibagu√© , Ortega and Planadas) groups from Tolima , in the Colombian Andes. DNA samples from 348 individuals were genotyped for six mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) , seven non-recombining Y-chromosome ( NRY) region and 100 autosomal ancestry informative markers. Nasa and Pijao had a predominant Native American ancestry at the autosomal ( 92 %) , maternal ( 97 %) and paternal ( 70 %) level. The admixed groups had a predominant Native American mtDNA ancestry ( 90 %) , a substantial frequency of European NRY haplotypes ( 72 %) and similar autosomal contributions from Europeans ( 51 %) and Amerindians ( 45 %). Pijao and nearby Ortega were indistinguishable at the mtDNA and autosomal level , suggesting a genetic continuity between them. Comparisons with multiple Native American populations throughout the Americas revealed that Pijao , had close similarities with Carib-speakers from distant parts of the continent , suggesting an ancient correlation between language and genes. In summary , our study aimed to understand Hispanic patterns of migration , settlement and admixture , supporting an extensive contribution of local Amerindian women to the gene pool of admixed groups and consistent with previous reports of European-male driven admixture in Colombia.
