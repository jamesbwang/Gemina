  To investigate the relationship of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2) and imaging features with the therapeutic efficacy of Phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy in recurrent craniopharyngioma.Thirty-two patients with recurrent craniopharyngioma underwent phosphorus-32 colloid interstitial radiotherapy. The tumor imaging features were classified into 4 types according to the thickness of the cyst<symptom> wall and signals of the cyst<symptom> contents as shown by computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) images. Protein expressions of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in craniopharyngioma tissues were evaluated with immunohistochemistry before radiotherapy. The tumor radiosensitivity was determined at 12 months after the interstitial radiotherapy.VEGF mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm , and VEGFR-2 expressed either in vascular endothelial cells or in tumor endothelial cells. VEGF/VEGFR -2 expressions varied significantly in cases sensitive or insensitive to the radiotherapy ( VEGF: P = .028; VEGFR-2: P = .017). Tumor imaging features were associated with the therapeutic efficacy of interstitial radiotherapy ( P = .000). VEGF expression had no association with the imaging features of tumors ( P = .226) , but VEGFR-2 expression was associated with the imaging features of tumors ( P = .008). Our results confirmed the association among imaging features , VEGFR-2 expressions , and tumor radiosensitivity in craniopharyngiomas. Imaging features and VEGFR-2 expressions may add useful data to the radiosensitive assessment of craniopharyngiomas.
