  Anorexia<symptom> nervosa is often accompanied by comorbid mood disorders , in particular depression<symptom> , but individual or family history of bipolar disorders has not frequently been explored in anorexia<symptom> nervosa. The objectives of the present study were: ( 1) to assess the frequency of bipolar disorders in patients with anorexia<symptom> nervosa hospitalized in adolescence and in their parents , ( 2) to determine whether the patients with a personal or family history of bipolar disorders present particular characteristics in the way in which anorexia<symptom> nervosa manifests itself , in their medical history , in the secondary diagnoses established , and in the treatments prescribed. Overall , 97 female patients aged 13 to 20 hospitalized for anorexia<symptom> nervosa and their parents were assessed. The diagnoses of anorexia<symptom> nervosa and bipolar disorders were established on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria. A high frequency of type II and type V bipolar disorders was observed. The patients with anorexia<symptom> nervosa and presenting personal or family histories of bipolar disorder had an earlier onset of anorexia<symptom> nervosa , more numerous hospitalizations , a longer time-lapse between anorexia<symptom> nervosa onset and hospitalization , more suicide attempts and more psychiatric comorbidities. The occurrence of anorexia<symptom> nervosa-bipolar disorders comorbidity appears to be considerable and linked to the severity of anorexia<symptom> nervosa , raising the issue of the relationship between anorexia<symptom> nervosa and bipolar disorders.
