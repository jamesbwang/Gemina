  Although preterm delivery is the most common cause of infant morbidity and mortality , an obvious cause can not be found in most cases. Preterm delivery is known to be the most important risk factor for preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. We aimed to evaluate the recurrence rate of premature births for subsequent pregnancies in women with a history of a preterm birth. Study data were collected from the Korea National Health Insurance ( KNHI) claims database and data from a national health-screening program for infants and children. We enrolled women who had their first delivery between January 1 , 2007 and December 31 , 2007 and a subsequent delivery before 2014. Preterm delivery had a significant higher risk of preterm birth in a subsequent singleton pregnancy. The risk of preterm birth at second pregnancy was 2.2 % in women whose first delivery at â‰¥ 37 weeks and 18.6 % in women whose first delivery at < 37 weeks ( relative risks ( RR) , 8.64; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 7.94-9.40). In the analysis of the third pregnancy , we compared women with an initial term birth followed by preterm birth and women with an initial preterm birth followed by a subsequent term birth. A history of a just preceding preterm birth at < 37 weeks was the most relevant factor for recurrence of preterm delivery in a subsequent pregnancy ( 26.6 % , RR , 4.01; 95 % CI , 2.45-6.58). We found that the prognosis of a third pregnancy was more closely related to the outcome of the second pregnancy to that of the first pregnancy.
