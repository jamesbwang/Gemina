  Changes in medical education have drawn attention to student-based learning. It is necessary that teachers ' educational roles be redefined to conform to these changes. While numerous educational activities are listed for medical teachers , it seems that they involve themselves in only some of these roles. We conducted this study to assess the importance of different educational roles in the view of medical faculties. A questionnaire that consisted of a total of 12 roles classified into six categories including information provider , role model , facilitator , examiner , planner , and resource developer was prepared. Faculty members were asked to score the importance of each role using a 1-10 scale. Participants assigned the highest score to `` on-the-job role model '' ( 9.47) and the lowest score to `` curriculum planner '' ( 8.31) from their own point of view. They also assigned the highest score to `` planning or participating in student exams '' ( 8.10) and the lowest score to `` learning facilitator '' ( 6.51) from the perspective of the importance of roles in their school 's programs. Faculty members are generally familiar with different educational roles but they need to be informed about some of the roles which have gained lower scores in this study.
