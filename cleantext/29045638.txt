  Iron is an essential micronutrient for most bacteria and is obtained from iron-chelating siderophores or directly from iron-containing host proteins. For Gram-negative bacteria , classical iron transport systems consist of an outer membrane receptor , a periplasmic binding protein , and an inner membrane ABC transporter , which work in concert to deliver iron from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. We recently showed that
