  NMDA receptors ( NMDARs) are crucial for excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. The number and subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs are tightly controlled by neuronal activity and sensory experience , but the molecular mechanism mediating NMDAR trafficking remains poorly understood. Here , we report that RIM1 , with a well-established role in presynaptic vesicle release , also localizes postsynaptically in the mouse hippocampus. Postsynaptic RIM1 in hippocampal CA1 region is required for basal NMDAR- , but not AMPA receptor ( AMPAR)- , mediated synaptic responses , and contributes to synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. Moreover , RIM1 levels in hippocampal neurons influence both the constitutive and regulated NMDAR trafficking , without affecting constitutive AMPAR trafficking. We further demonstrate that RIM1 binds to Rab11 via its N terminus , and knockdown of RIM1 impairs membrane insertion of Rab11-positive recycling endosomes containing NMDARs. Together , these results identify a RIM1-dependent mechanism critical for modulating synaptic function by facilitating membrane delivery of recycling NMDARs.
