  A patent foramen ovale<disease> ( PFO) is linked to increased risk of decompression illness in divers. One theory is that venous gas emboli crossing the PFO can be minimized by avoiding lifting , straining and Valsalva maneuvers. Alternatively , we hypothesized that mild increases in external inspiratory and expiratory resistance , similar to that provided by a SCUBA regulator , recruit the PFO. Nine healthy adults with a Valsalva-proven PFO completed three randomized trials ( inspiratory , expiratory , and combined external loading) with six levels of increasing external resistance ( 2-20 cmH
