  To determine the effects of the intake of low-fat yoghurt supplemented with rooster comb extract ( RCE) on muscle strength. 148 subjects , with mild knee pain , participated in a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , and parallel study. Muscle strength , knee effusion<symptom> , and pain perception were measured. C2C12 myoblasts were used to elucidate the mechanisms of action involved. RCE improved total work and mean power in men , and also peak torque in extension by 10 %. RCE reduced synovial effusion<symptom> by 11.8 % and pain perception by 24.6 %. Both RCE and HA increased myoblast proliferation by 29 % , while RCE reduced myoblast differentiation by 36.2 % , suggesting a beneficial role of RCE in muscle regeneration. Low-fat yoghurt supplemented with RCE improved muscle strength. This effect is partially explained by muscle regeneration enhancement , reduced synovial effusion<symptom> , and reduced pain perception , which could exert a beneficial clinical impact on men affected by mild knee pain.
