  Human Ataxin-3 protein was first identified as a transcript from patients with Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD) , also known as spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 3 ( SCA3). Recent studies have demonstrated that Ataxin-3 is involved in gastric cancer and lung cancer. However , the role of Ataxin-3 in testicular cancer ( TC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to explore the significance of Ataxin-3 expression in TC. Firstly , we investigated 53 paired TC and para-tumor tissues and found that Ataxin-3 was overexpressed in TC tissues , and this overexpression of Ataxin-3 was correlated with tumor stages. Functionally , Ataxin-3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation , and Ataxin-3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation. In addition , up-regulation of Ataxin-3 inhibited the expression of PTEN and activated the AKT/mTOR pathway. Conversely , inhibition of Ataxin-3 suppressed the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR , and increased the expression of p-4EBP1. These findings may provide a better understanding about the mechanism of TC and suggest that Ataxin-3 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for TC.
