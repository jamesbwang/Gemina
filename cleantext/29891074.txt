  The cerebellum plays a fundamental role in movement execution and motor control in humans. Because of multiple cerebellar connections and a broad variety of motor and nonmotor functions , the field of cerebellar stimulation with noninvasive techniques has gained success among researchers in the last few years. These techniques allow investigation of the neural network noninvasively , collecting more information on cerebellar physiology and pathophysiology. Several studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of noninvasive brain stimulation ( NIBS)- repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation of the brain- in patients with neurologic diseases. More recently , NIBS has been delivered over the human cerebellum. Cerebellar NIBS has provided interesting novel data about cerebellar physiology in humans , especially in relation to its cognitive and behavioral functions. Cerebellar NIBS is also increasingly tested in patients with ataxia<symptom> , dystonia , Parkinson disease , stroke , and essential tremor<symptom>. NIBS is a promising approach not only to elucidate the numerous cerebellar functions , but also to improve the management of cerebellar ataxias<symptom> in children and in adults.
