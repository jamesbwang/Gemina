  The nature and definition of schizotypy , as the latent liability for schizophrenia capable of generating various phenotypic and endophenotypic outcomes , is reviewed. The proceedings of the 2017 meeting of the International Consortium on Schizotypy Research are included in this Special Section and they are presented as illustrations of current research work on schizotypy. The potential leverage of the schizotypy framework for schizophrenia research continues to be realized and these articles present current research efforts that explore new angles of inquiry while building upon past advances. Methodological and substantive areas of concern are highlighted and suggestions for improvement of future schizotypy research are made.
