  Cochlear inflammatory response to various environmental insults , including acoustic and ototoxic overexposures , has been increasingly become a topic of interest. As the immune response is associated with both pathology and protection , targeting specific components of the immune response is expected to dissect the relationships between cellular damage and inflammation-associated protection and repair in the cochlea. Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines ( DARC) is a member of a group of atypical chemokine receptors , and essential for chemokine-regulated leukocyte/neutrophil trafficking during inflammation<symptom>. Previous studies have reported that
