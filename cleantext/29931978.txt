  In this study , a composite material with healable and foldable features is formulated to print conductive patterns on rough surfaces , such as paper , cloth , and three-dimensional ( 3D) printed objects. Carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) are mixed with wax to formulate a solid composite for pen writing. The composite has a low percolation threshold of 2.5 wt % CNTs and can be written on various rough substrates , such as paper and cloth , to create conductive patterns for electronic conductors. Because of the strong infrared ( IR) absorption of CNTs , the printed patterns can be selectively sintered by noncontact IR radiation efficiently to show great electrical conductivity. The electrical resistance of the written patterns on paper also show an insignificant increase after bending , folding , and crumpling. Furthermore , the conductive composite exhibits great healability after destructive damages. The conductivity of the damaged patterns after severe folding or knife cutting recovers to its original value with thermal or IR heating. Several examples , such as conductive tracks on paper , cloth , or 3D printed objects , are also demonstrated to show the potential of this healable conductive composite for electronic applications.
