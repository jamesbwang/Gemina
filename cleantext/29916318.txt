  Trauma , unfortunately , is an all too common part of today 's world. The construct posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) has been the dominant paradigm to guide researchers and clinicians in the United States and around the world in their efforts to understand and help persons who have experienced trauma. However , PTSD as a diagnosis and this theoretical construct has some problems and limitations , particularly when considered from a global perspective. The author explores the less widely studied construct of posttraumatic growth ( PTG) as a phenomenon that avoids some of the problems of PTSD and asks the question: Does it represent a paradigm shift or a paradox? The author seeks to consider this issue from a global perspective and discusses Syrian refugees as a case study.
