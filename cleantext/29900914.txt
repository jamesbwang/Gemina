  The paradigm of etiology of early childhood caries<disease> ( ECC) is shifting toward genetics. Of various inherited factors , blood group of an individual is genetically determined. The aim of the study is to determine if blood group of an individual will serve as a potential risk factor in the development of ECC. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chennai. Blood samples were collected from a total of 500 children < 71 months of age for determination of the blood group. Of which 96 children ( 24 per blood group) were randomly selected and were included in the study. Oral screening of the selected children was done by a pediatric dentist who was blinded to the blood group of the children. Decayed , extracted , and filling index was noted. Details on other associated factors for the development of ECC such as the socioeconomic status , oral hygiene measures , diet , and feeding practices were collected by directly interviewing the parents through a questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Tukey test with significance level set at 0.05. Intergroup analysis of the associated factors showed no significant differences between the children of different blood groups. A statistically significant relation was noted between the blood groups and development of ECC ( P = 0.025). Blood group is a potential risk indicator for the development of ECC.
