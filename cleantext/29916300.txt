  Despite the now significant contribution of magnetic resonance imaging , the accurate and timely diagnosis of multiple sclerosis ( MS) is still clinically challenging. Al Hussona et al. , with their case series , highlight the complexities of attributing paroxysmal , and in particular cortical , symptoms such as epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> to inflammatory demyelinating lesions<symptom> , and establishing a diagnosis of MS based on them. In such circumstances an MS diagnosis is likely to be more tentative than for more typical MS presentations , and treatment choices should be weighed accordingly.
