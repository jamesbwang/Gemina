  In recent years , merocyanine photoacids have been utilized to control various chemical processes using visible light and have found applications in materials , energy , and biomedical areas. Molecular merocyanine photoacids are commonly used in the previous works. Covalently linking the photoacids to polymers improves their compatibility with different media , avoids leakage problems , and allows a localized proton concentration to be produced. However , the phenolic and indolinium moieties of the photoacids make them difficult to be polymerized with common methods. In this work , the monomer of a merocyanine photoacid is converted to a spiropyran in situ by adding trimethylamine to a dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) solution of the monomer. Free radical polymerization yields the polymers of the spiropyran , which is acidified to regenerate the photoacid. The photoacid polymers prepared show good solubility , photoacidity , and reversibility. Irradiating a thin film of a photoacid polymer doped with methyl orange through a mask copies the pattern of the mask to the film. The pattern can be erased by heating the film at 80 Â°C for 10 min , and a new pattern is created by irradiation through a different mask.
