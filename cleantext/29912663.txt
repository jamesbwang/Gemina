  Up till now , there is no satisfactory treatment for lymphedema. The aim of this study is to evaluate stem cell therapy in lymphedema. This prospective randomized study includes 40 patients with chronic lymphedema divided randomly into two groups: group I ( stem cell therapy group) and group II ( control group). In group I , bone<disease> marrow was aspirated and mononuclear cells were separated and then transplanted into the patients. In group II , patients compression therapy alone was applied. Group I included 20 patients ( 12 males and 8 females) , their age ranged from 18 to 38 years with a mean age of 24.8 ± 6.39 years , whereas group II included 20 patients ( 10 males and 10 females) , their age ranged from 18 to 36 years with a mean value of 25.6 ± 8.18 years. In group I , there was a decrease in the mean circumference at ankle after 6 months , which was statistically significant ( t = 3.250 , p = 0.014). This was associated with marked improvement of pain and walking ability. Whereas in group II , the change in the circumference was statistically insignificant ( t = 1256 , p = 0.349) with no satisfactory pain relief and improvement in walking ability. Biopsies examined by immunohistochemistry showed marked increase in the number of lymphatic capillaries in group I. Stem cell therapy can achieve improvement in limb circumference as well as pain relief and improvement in walking ability in patients with chronic lymphedema compared with those in control group.
