  Soil microorganisms are crucial to indicate ecosystem functions of terrestrial ecosystems. However , the responses of microbial communities to soil nutrient limitation in desert-grassland are still poorly understood. Hence , we investigated soil microbial community structures and metabolic characteristics in a desert-grassland ecological transition zone from the northern Loess Plateau , China , and explored the association of microbial communities with nutrient limitation via high-throughput sequencing. Threshold elemental ratios ( TER) indicated that the microbial communities were strongly limited by nitrogen ( N) under A. ordosica and P. tabuliformis communities. The phosphorus ( P) limitation of microbial communities was observed in the aeolian sandy soil. The results imply that soil microbial communities had strong nutrient competition for N and P with aboveground vegetation in arid and oligotrophic ecosystems. The LEfSe and linear regression analysis revealed that the microbial taxa of Micrococcales , Micrococcaceae and Herpotrichiellaceae were significantly correlated with microbial N limitation. The Thermoleophilia taxa were significantly correlated with microbial P limitation. These biomarkers related to microbial nutrient limitation could be considered as the key microbial taxa to shape microbial communities and functions. Furthermore , N form had different effects on microbial communities , which NH
