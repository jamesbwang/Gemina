  The corpus callosum , which is the most important fiber pathway linking the bilateral hemispheres , plays a key role in information access , as well as the functional coordination and reorganization between the bilateral hemispheres. However , whether the corpus callosum will undergo structural changes during the recovery of aphasia<symptom> is still unclear. In the current study , a Chinese aphasic patient with stroke was reported to develop changes in the corpus callosum after speech therapy. A 33-year-old right-handed male patient had aphasia<symptom> only without limb<symptom> paralysis<symptom> at 14 months after stroke. Neuroimaging evaluation confirmed a diagnosis of cerebral infarction in the left frontal lobe , insula and basal ganglia. He underwent 5-month speech therapy and received language function evaluation and DTI examination before and after speech therapy. The result ABC showed that the language functions in the patient , including spontaneous speech , auditory comprehension , repetition and naming , were improved after the speech therapy. In addition , results of follow-up DTT suggested that the fiber pathway between the splenium of corpus callosum and the left superior temporal gyrus ( Wernicke 's area) had been established. At the same time , fiber connections between the genu of corpus callosum and the right inferior frontal gyrus ( the mirror region of Broca 's area) were increased. The fibrous structure between the corpus callosum and cortical language areas may be reconstructed during the recovery of aphasia<symptom>. In addition , and the corpus callosum may play an important role in the occurrence and recovery of aphasia<symptom> after stroke.
