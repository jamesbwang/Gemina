  The application of conventional thermophilic composting ( TC) is limited by poor efficiency. Newly-developed hyperthermophilic composting ( HTC) is expected to overcome this shortcoming. However , the characterization of microbial communities associated with HTC remains unclear. Here , we compared the performance of HTC and TC in a full-scale sludge composting plant , and found that HTC running at the hyperthermophilic and thermophilic phases for 21 days , led to higher composting efficiency and techno-economic advantages over TC. Results of high-throughput sequencing showed drastic changes in the microbial community during HTC. Thermaceae ( 35.5-41.7 %) was the predominant family in the hyperthermophilic phase , while the thermophilic phase was dominated by both Thermaceae ( 28.0-53.3 %) and Thermoactinomycetaceae ( 29.9-36.1 %). The change of microbial community could be the cause of continuous high temperature in HTC , and thus improve composting efficiency by accelerating the maturation process. This work has provided theoretical and practical guidance for managing sewage sludge by HTC.
