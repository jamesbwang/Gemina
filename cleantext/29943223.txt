  Endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) is involved in the development of abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA). Since bioactive peptide intermedin ( IMD) 1-53 protects against AAA formation , here we investigated whether IMD1-53 attenuates AAA by inhibiting ERS. AAA model was induced by angiotensin II ( AngII) in ApoE KO mouse background. AngII-treated mouse aortas showed increased ERS gene transcription of caspase12 , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a ( eIf2a) and activating transcription factor 4 ( ATF4). The protein level of ERS marker glucose regulated protein 94 ( GRP94) , ATF4 and C/EBP homologous protein 10 ( CHOP) was also up-regulated by AngII. Increased ERS levels were accompanied by severe VSMC apoptosis in human AAA aorta. In vivo administration of IMD1-53 greatly reduced AngII-induced AAA and abrogated the activation of ERS. To determine whether IMD inhibited AAA by ameliorating ERS , we used 2 non-selective ERS inhibitors phenyl butyrate ( 4-PBA) and taurine ( TAU). Similar to IMD , PBA , and TAU significantly reduced the incidence of AAA and AAA-related pathological disorders. In vitro , AngII infusion up-regulated CHOP , caspase12 expression and led to VSMC apoptosis. IMD siRNA aggravated the CHOP , caspase12-mediated VSMC apoptosis , which was abolished by ATF4 silencing. IMD infusion promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine 5 '- monophosphate ( AMP)- activated protein kinase ( AMPK) in aortas in ApoE KO mice , and the AMPK inhibitor compound C abolished the protective effect of IMD on VSMC ERS and apoptosis induced by AngII. In conclusion , IMD may protect against AAA formation by inhibiting ERS via activating AMPK phosphorylation.
