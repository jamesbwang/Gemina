  This study aimed to examine whether exogenous NaHS can protect myocardial mitochondrial injury from sepsis<disease> by enhancing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α ( PGC-1α)/ nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 ( NRF2) pathway and mitochondrial biosynthesis in mice. Animals were divided into sham-operated , sepsis<disease> , sepsis<disease> + 25 μmol/L NaHS , sepsis<disease> + 50 μmol/L NaHS , sepsis<disease> + 100 μmol/L NaHS , and sepsis<disease> + 200 μmol/L NaHS groups. The myocardial damage was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining for myocardial microstructure and serum cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) detection. The myocardial mitochondrial damage was evaluated through transmission electron microscopic observation of mitochondrial microstructure and detection of the degree of myocardial mitochondrial swelling. The adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) level was used to appraise the mitochondrial function. The mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 , PGC-1α , and Tfam were analyzed to explore the molecular mechanism. In the sepsis<disease> group , the structure of myocardial tissue and mitochondria were significantly damaged , the serum cTnI level increased ( Exogenous NaHS had a protective effect against myocardial mitochondrial injury in sepsis<disease>. The mechanism might lie in enhancing the PGC-1α/ NRF2 pathway and mitochondrial biosynthesis.
