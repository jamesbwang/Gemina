  Next generation sequencing ( NGS) has traditionally been performed in various fields including agricultural to clinical and there are so many sequencing platforms available in order to obtain accurate and consistent results. However , these platforms showed amplification bias when facilitating variant calls in personal genomes. Here , we sequenced whole genomes and whole exomes from ten Korean individuals using Illumina and Ion Proton , respectively to find the vulnerability and accuracy of NGS platform in the GC rich/poor area. Overall , a total of 1013 Gb reads from Illumina and ~ 39.1 Gb reads from Ion Proton were analyzed using BWA-GATK variant calling pipeline. Furthermore , conjunction with the VQSR tool and detailed filtering strategies , we achieved high-quality variants. Finally , each of the ten variants from Illumina only , Ion Proton only , and intersection was selected for Sanger validation. The validation results revealed that Illumina platform showed higher accuracy than Ion Proton. The described filtering methods are advantageous for large population-based whole genome studies designed to identify common and rare variations associated with
