  Hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs) are widely used as flame retardants for various products and have become ubiquitous pollutants in environmental media. However , little is known about HBCD exposure for humans , especially in China. This study aimed to investigate the levels and profiles of hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs) in human breast milk and to estimate the daily HBCD intake for infants in Shenzhen , China. Levels of the HBCD diastereoisomers α- , β- , and γ-HBCD in 180 breast milk samples collected from primiparas in Shenzhen were measured. The concentrations of α- , β- , and γ-HBCD ( ΣHBCDs) ranged within 0.103-15.1 ng/g lipid and had a median of 1.82 ng/g lipid. ΣHBCDs levels in milk in the present study are comparable to those in milk from other countries and regions but are markedly higher than those for most populations in other regions of China. Among the diastereoisomers , α-HBCD was predominant , accounting for 97.6 % of the concentration of ΣHBCDs. The estimated daily intake of ΣHBCDs via breast milk for infants in Shenzhen ranged from 0.481 to 100ng/kgbw/day with a median of 8.40 ng/kgbw/day , however , which was unlikely to raises a health concern based on the margin of exposure ( MOE) approach. The duration of residence was found to have a significant positive correlation with the HBCD levels in the human breast milk ( p < 0.05). To our knowledge , this is the first report on HBCD levels in breast milk from Shenzhen residents.
