  Glutamate , the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate Central Nervous System , is involved in almost every aspect of brain physiology , and its signaling properties are severely affected in most neurodegenerative diseases. This neurotransmitter has to be efficiently removed from the synaptic cleft in order to prevent an over-stimulation of glutamate receptors that leads to neuronal death. Specific sodium-dependent membrane transporters , highly enriched in glial cells , elicit the clearance of glutamate. Once internalized , it is metabolized to glutamine by the glia-enriched enzyme Glutamine synthetase. Accumulated glutamine is released into the extracellular space for its uptake into pre-synaptic neurons and its conversion to glutamate that is packed into synaptic vesicles completing the glutamate/glutamine cycle. Diverse chemical compounds , like organophosphates , directly affect brain chemistry by altering levels of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Organophosphate compounds are widely used as pesticides , and all living organisms are continuously exposed to these substances , either in a direct or indirect manner. Its metabolites , like the diethyl dithiophosphate , are capable of causing brain damage through diverse mechanisms including perturbation of neuronal-glial cell interactions and have been associated with attention-deficit disorders and other mental illness. In order to characterize the neurotoxic mechanisms of diethyl dithiophosphate , we took advantage of the well characterized model of chick cerebellar Bergmann glia cultures.
