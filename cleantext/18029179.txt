  Indian lettuce ( Lactuca indica<pathogen> L.) is an undomesticated wild plant with high economic potential. We know little about the plant 's genome , such as its DNA markers , making genetic research using this plant difficult. In this study , 100 genic simple sequence repeat ( SSR) primers with a 99-250 bp target amplicon were synthesized from L. indica<pathogen> transcriptomic sequences. These primers were examined in 8 diverse L. indica<pathogen> accessions , and 90 polymorphic SSRs were obtained. Twenty-three of the 90 polymorphic SSRs were used to investigate transferability to another two Lactuca species , Lactuca serriola and Lactuca sativa. Genetic diversity was investigated in 77 Lactuca accessions , including 73 L. indica<pathogen> collected from across South Korea , 2 L. serriola , and 2 L. sativa. Our genic-SSR markers were highly polymorphic with a mean polymorphic information content of 0.61 and , on average , 10.83 alleles per locus. The average expected heterozygosity ( 0.76) was higher than the observed heterozygosity. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the total variance in our population is attributable to genetic variation among accessions , rather than among provinces. STRUCTURE , unweighted neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees , and principal coordinate analyses resulted in three clusters , where northern and central-southern L. indica<pathogen> accessions were grouped into two clusters with some admixture. The L. serriola and L. sativa accessions did not produce a separate cluster due to a small sample size. These results show our SSR markers will be useful in germplasm assessment and genetic studies of L. indica<pathogen> and other Lactuca species.
