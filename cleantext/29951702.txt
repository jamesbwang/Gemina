  Friedreich ataxia<symptom> ( FRDA) is an inherited movement disorder which manifests with progressive<symptom> gait<symptom> instability , sensory<symptom> loss<symptom> and cardiomyopathy. Peripheral neuropathy is an established feature of FRDA. At neuropathological examination , a depletion of large , myelinated axons is evident , but also unmyelinated fibers are affected which may result in a variety of sensory and autonomic signs and symptoms. Impaired temperature perception , vasomotor disturbances of lower extremities and a high prevalence of urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> have been documented in FRDA , but data from autonomic function testing in genetically confirmed cases are lacking. Genetically confirmed FRDAs were recruited in an outpatient setting. In a screening visit , general and neurological examination , laboratory testing , ECG and echocardiography were performed. Autonomic functions were evaluated by means of systematic questionnaires ( SCOPA-Aut , OHQ) , skin sympathetic reflex and cardiovascular autonomic function testing ( CAFT). For the latter , a comparison with matched healthy controls was performed. 20 patients were recruited and 13 underwent CAFT. Symptoms referred to multiple autonomic domains , particularly bladder function , thermoregulation and sweating were reported. SCOPA-Aut scores were significantly predicted by disease severity. At CAFT , FRDAs did not differ from controls except for increased heart rate at rest and during orthostatic challenge. Two patients had non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( 14 %). Skin sympathetic responses were pathologic in 3 out of 10 patients ( of whom 2 aged > 50). FRDA patients may experience several autonomic symptoms and overall their burden correlates with disease severity. Nonetheless , clinical testing shows no major involvement of sudomotor and cardiovascular autonomic function.
