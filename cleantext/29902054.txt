  Reports an error in `` Is daytime napping associated with inflammation<symptom> in adolescents '' by Karen P. Jakubowski , Martica H. Hall , Anna L. Marsland and Karen A. Matthews ( Two hundred thirty-four Black and White high school students completed a week of actigraph and diary measures of sleep and napping and provided a fasting blood sample. Napping measures were the proportion of days napped and the average minutes napped across 1 week during the school year. Linear regressions adjusted for age , sex , race , average nocturnal sleep duration , time between sleep protocol and blood draw , and body mass index percentile demonstrated that proportion of days napped measured by actigraphy , B ( SE) = .41 ( .19) , p < .05 , across the full week was positively associated with IL-6. Higher proportions of school days napped between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. , B ( SE) = .40 ( .20) , p < .05 , and between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. , B ( SE) = .57 ( .28) , p < .05 , were associated with increased IL-6. No associations emerged between average actigraphy-assessed nap duration and either study outcome. Diary-reported napping was unrelated to either study outcome. Actigraphy-assessed napping and IL-6 are associated but the direction of the relationship remains to be determined. Overall , napping is an important factor to consider to better understand the relationship between short sleep and cardiovascular health in adolescents. ( PsycINFO Database Record
