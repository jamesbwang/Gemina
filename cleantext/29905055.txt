  To investigate the possibility and effect of chitosan porous scaffolds combined with bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) in repair of neurological deficit after traumatic brain injury ( TBI) in rats. BMSCs were isolated , cultured , and passaged by the method of bone<disease> marrow adherent culture. The 3rd generation BMSCs were identified by the CD29 and CD45 surface antigens and marked by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( BrdU). The chitosan porous scaffolds were produced by the method of freeze-drying. The BrdU-labelled BMSCs were co-cultured Flow cytometry test showed that the positive rate of CD29 of the 3rd generation BMSCs was 98.49 % , and the positive rate of CD45 was only 0.85 %. After co-cultured with chitosan porous scaffolds The transplantation of chitosan porous scaffolds combined with BMSCs can improve the neurological deficit of rats following TBI obviously , and also inhabit the glial scar 's formation in the brain damage zone , and can make BMSCs survive , proliferate , and differentiate into nerve cells in the brain damage zone.
