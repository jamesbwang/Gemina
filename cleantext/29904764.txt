  We developed highly bright and stable far-red emissive AIEdots by using a new kind of click-functional PEG grafted amphiphilic polymer to coat hydrophobic AIE-active polymers ( PDFDP). Furthermore , an anti-HER2 recombinant fully human antibody was produced and conjugated on the AIEdots via metal-free click chemistry to fabricate in vivo tumor-targeting nanoprobes.
