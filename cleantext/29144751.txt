  Hydrogenation reactions are essential processes in the chemical industry , giving access to a variety of valuable compounds including fine chemicals , agrochemicals , and pharmachemicals. On an industrial scale , hydrogenations are typically performed with precious metal catalysts or with base metal catalysts , such as Raney nickel , which requires special handling due to its pyrophoric nature. We report a stable and highly active intermetallic nickel silicide catalyst that can be used for hydrogenations of a wide range of unsaturated compounds. The catalyst is prepared via a straightforward procedure using SiO
