  Huntington 's disease ( HD) is a genetically caused neurodegenerative disorder characterized by heterogeneous motor , psychiatric , and cognitive symptoms. Although motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> may be the most prominent presentation , cognitive symptoms such as memory deficits and executive dysfunction typically co-occur. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) and task fMRI-based dynamic causal modeling ( DCM) to evaluate HD-related changes in the neural network underlying working memory ( WM). Sixty-four pre-symptomatic HD mutation carriers ( preHD) , 20 patients with early manifest HD symptoms ( earlyHD) , and 83 healthy control subjects performed an
