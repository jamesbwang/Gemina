  The present study aimed to investigate the effects of microRNA-210 ( miR-210) in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Venous blood was collected from 30 prostate cancer patients , that were treated in the Medical Group of Ping Mei Shenma General Hospital ( Pingdingshan , China) from June 2013 to May 2015 , and 20 healthy men. The miR‑210 expression levels in patients and healthy men was quantified. Primary prostate cancer cells were placed in three treatment groups: i) NC group , untreated; ii) BL group , empty vector; and iii) anti‑miR‑210 group , miR‑210 inhibitor‑transfected. Cell proliferation and apoptotic rate were detected by MTT and flow cytometry , respectively. The expression levels of miR‑210 and regulator of differentiation 1 ( ROD1) were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑qPCR) and the ROD1 protein expression in each group was detected by western blotting. Cell proliferation rate of the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly reduced when compared with the NC and BL groups ( P ≤ 0.05); however , the apoptotic rate of the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly increased compared with the NC and BL groups ( P ≤ 0.05). RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression level of miR‑210 and ROD1 in the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly reduced when compared with the NC and BL groups ( P < 0.05). MiR‑210 was overexpressed in the serum of prostate cancer patients and transfection with an miR‑210 inhibitor was able to effectively inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and promote apoptosis.
