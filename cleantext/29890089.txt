  Adipose tissue-derived stem cell ( ADSC)- based therapy is promising for the treatment of intervertebral disc ( IVD) degeneration , but the difficulty in inducing nucleus pulposus ( NP)- like differentiation limits its clinical applications. Forkhead box ( Fox)- A2 is an essential transcription factor for the formation of a normal NP. We demonstrated that type II collagen stimulates NP-like differentiation of ADSCs , partly by increasing the expression of FoxA2. We constructed FoxA2-overexpressing and- knockdown ADSCs by using lentiviral vectors. FoxA2 overexpression significantly enhanced NP-specific gene expression and the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and collagen , whereas FoxA2 knockdown decreased NP-like differentiation and the expression of aggrecan and collagen II. The enhanced NP-like differentiation related to FoxA2 overexpression was partially rescued by an Shh signaling pathway inhibitor. In addition , FoxA2 inhibited the expression of Itg-Î±2 and further promoted NP-like differentiation induced by type II collagen. Furthermore , FoxA2-overexpressing ADSCs combined with type II collagen hydrogels promoted regeneration of degenerated NP in vivo. Our findings suggest that FoxA2 plays an essential role in the NP-like differentiation of ADSCs by activating the Shh signaling pathway.-Zhou , X. , Ma , C. , Hu , B. , Tao , Y. , Wang , J. , Huang , X. , Zhao , T. , Han , B. , Li , H. , Liang , C. , Chen , Q. , Li , F.
