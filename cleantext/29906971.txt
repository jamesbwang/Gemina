  A linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous cooling state is carried out to identify the conditions for stability of a granular gas of rough hard spheres. The description is based on the results for the transport coefficients derived from the Boltzmann equation for inelastic rough hard spheres ( Phys. Rev. E 90 , 022205 ( 2014) PLEEE81539-375510.1103/ PhysRevE .90.022205) , which take into account the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients and the cooling rate on the coefficients of normal and tangential restitution. As expected , linear stability analysis shows that a doubly degenerate transversal ( shear) mode and a longitudinal ( `` heat '') mode are unstable with respect to long enough wavelength excitations. The instability is driven by the shear mode above a certain inelasticity threshold; at larger inelasticity , however , the instability is driven by the heat mode for an inelasticity-dependent range of medium roughness. Comparison with the case of a granular gas of inelastic smooth spheres confirms previous simulation results about the dual role played by surface friction: while small and large levels of roughness make the system less unstable than the frictionless system , the opposite happens at medium roughness. On the other hand , such an intermediate window of roughness values shrinks as inelasticity increases and eventually disappears at a certain value , beyond which the rough-sphere gas is always less unstable than the smooth-sphere gas. A comparison with some preliminary simulation results shows a very good agreement for conditions of practical interest.
