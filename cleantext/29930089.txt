  Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional ( 3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult , limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues. We developed and applied a technology for 3D intact-tissue RNA sequencing , termed STARmap ( spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping) , which integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry , targeted signal amplification , and in situ sequencing. The capabilities of STARmap were tested by mapping 160 to 1020 genes simultaneously in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution with high efficiency , accuracy , and reproducibility. Moving to thick tissue blocks , we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter-scale volumes ( > 30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap.
