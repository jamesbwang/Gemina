  T cell search behavior is dictated by their need to encounter their specific antigen to eliminate target cells. However , mechanisms controlling effector T cell motility are highly tissue-dependent. Specifically , how diabetogenic T cells encounter their target beta cells in dispersed islets throughout the pancreas ( PA) during autoimmune diabetes remains unclear. Using intra-vital 2-photon microscopy in a mouse model of diabetes , we found that CXCR3 chemokine downregulated CD8
