  Pembrolizumab , a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin ( Ig) G4 antibody that is directed against the human cell surface receptor PD-1 , is a PD-1 pathway inhibitor that has been approved to treat various malignant diseases , including advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). PD-1 is the major inhibitory receptor regulating T-cell exhaustion<symptom> , and T-cells with high PD-1 expression lose their ability to eliminate cancer. PD-1 pathway blockade by pembrolizumab reinvigorates exhausted T-cells and restores their antitumor immune responses. However , reinvigorated T-cells also evoke immune-related adverse effects ( irAEs) , which stem from the restored activity. Currently , the pathogenic mechanisms of irAEs have not been sufficiently determined. We experienced a patient with NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression and cervical lymph node metastases , who demonstrated a good clinical response to first line pembrolizumab but suffered from a severe cutaneous adverse event. Both of his skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and cervical metastases showed extensive CD8 ( +) PD-1 ( +) T-cell infiltration in immunofluorescence analysis. This finding suggests a possible contribution of reinvigorated CD8 ( +) PD-1 ( +) T-cells in anti-PD-1 therapy-induced skin<symptom> rash<symptom>. Intriguingly , CD8 ( +) T-cells in the skin<symptom> rash<symptom> showed higher Ki-67 expression , a proliferation marker , than those in the cervical lymph node lesion<symptom>. This is the first report of an association between proliferative CD8 ( +) PD-1 ( +) T-cells and irAEs.
