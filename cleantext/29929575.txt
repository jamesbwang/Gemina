  The present study analysed live birth ratios in frozen embryo transfer ( FET) cycles where embryo ploidy status was determined with preimplantation genetic testing ( PGT) using next-generation sequencing ( NGS). PGT was performed on trophectoderm cells biopsied at the blastocyst stage. The present prospective cohort study included 112 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer , with NGS PGT. The control group consisted of 85 patients who underwent the IVF procedure with FET planned for a subsequent cycle. The live birth rate per cycle was higher by ~ 18.5 percentage points in the investigated compared with control group ( 42.0 % vs 23.5 % respectively; P = 0.012). The differences between the study and control groups were also significant for clinical pregnancy ( 42.0 % vs 23.5 % respectively; P = 0.012) , implantation ( 41.2 % vs 22.2 % respectively; P = 0.001) and pregnancy loss rates ( 9.6 % vs 28.6 % respectively; P = 0.027). The results show that PGT NGS is a useful method for embryo selection and it may be implemented in routine clinical practice with propitious results.
