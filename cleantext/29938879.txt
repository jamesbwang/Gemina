  It may sometimes be difficult to differentiate subtle ST-segment elevation ( STE) due to anterior myocardial infarction ( MI) from benign variant ( BV) STE. Recently , two related formulas were proposed for this purpose. However , they have never been tested in an external population. Consecutive patients from May 2017 to January 2018 , who were admitted with the diagnosis of acute anterior STEMI , were enrolled. Electrocardiograms were systematically reviewed and only subtle ones were included. First 200 consecutive patients with noncardiac chest<symptom> pain<symptom> were also enrolled as a control group. Relevant electrocardiographic parameters were measured. A total of 379 anterior MI and 200 BV-STE cases were enrolled during study period. A total of 241 patients in STEMI group were excluded for not matching subtleness criteria , four patients in control group were also excluded because of prior left-anterior descending artery intervention. The three-variable formula , with recommended cut-point of 23.5 , had a sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic accuracy of 73.9 % , 86.7 % , and 81.4 % , respectively. The four-variable formula , with the published cut-point of 18.2 , had a sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic accuracy of 83.3 % , 87.7 % , and 85.9 % , respectively. Three- and four-variable formulas with recommended cutoffs have a reasonable sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic accuracy in differentiating subtle STEMI with BV-STE. Although both perform well , the four-variable formula has a higher sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic accuracy and should be preferred.
