  Gene expression profile , phenolic composition , and antioxidant capacity were evaluated in red-fleshed berries and their wines ( RF berries and wines) from new grape genotypes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ten metabolic pathways involved in polyphenol synthesis and catabolism were significantly altered , and 13 genes related to the biosynthesis and transport of phenolics were largely upregulated in RF berries compared to that of Cabernet Sauvignon ( CS). Expression of MybA1 was associated with anthocyanin accumulation in red flesh. Additionally , RF berries and wines contained higher concentrations of total anthocyanins , phenols , flavonoids , and proanthocyanidins than those in CS berries and wine. Particularly , diglucosides of malvidin , peonidin , delphinidin , and cyanidin were present in red flesh and RF wines , but they were undetectable or present at very low concentrations in CS flesh and wine. Cinnamic acid and ferulic acid were clearly increased in the RF wines compared to those in the CS wine. Additionally , the RF wines had higher antioxidant capacity than that in the CS wine , and total anthocyanin content was significantly correlated to antioxidant capacity. This research provides insight into the mechanisms underlying grape flesh coloration and the composition of phenolic compounds in RF berries and wines.
