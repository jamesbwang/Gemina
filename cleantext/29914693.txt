  With the development of advanced focusing optics for x-rays , we can now use x-ray beams with spot sizes in the micro- or nanometer range to scan cells and large areas of tissues and continuously record the diffraction signals. From this data , x-ray scattering maps or so-called x-ray darkfield images are computed showing how different types of cells or regions of tissues differ in their diffraction intensity. At the same time a diffraction pattern is available for each scan point which encodes the local nanostructure , averaged over many contributing constituents illuminated by the beam. In this work we have exploited these new capabilities of scanning x-ray diffraction to investigate cardiac muscle cells as well as cardiac tissue. We give examples of how cardiac cells , especially living , cultured cells , can be prepared to be compatible with the instrumentation constraints of nano- or micro-diffraction instruments. Furthermore , we show how the developmental stage , ranging from neonatal to adult cells , as well as the final preparation state of the cardiomyocytes influences the recorded scattering signal and how these diffraction signals compare to the structure of a fully developed cardiac muscle.
