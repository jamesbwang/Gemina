  The reporting and analysing of data of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests encourages the quality improvement of the emergency medical services. For this reason , the establishment of a sufficiently large patient database is intended to allow analysis of resuscitation treatments for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and performances of different emergency medical services. The aim of this study was to describe the demographics , characteristics , outcomes and determinant factors of survival for patients who suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. this was a retrospective study including all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases treated by the emergency medical service in the district of Udine ( Italy) from 1 January 2010-31 December 2014. A total of 1105 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were attended by the emergency medical service. Of these , 489 ( 44.2 %) underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation , and return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 142 patients ( 29 %). There was a male predominance overall , and the main age was 72.6 years ( standard deviation 17.9). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation before emergency medical service arrival was performed on 62 cases ( 44 %) in the return of spontaneous circulation group , and on 115 cases ( 33 %) in the no return of spontaneous circulation group ( p < 0.024). Among the 142 cases of return of spontaneous circulation , 29 ( 5.9 %) survived to hospital discharge. There was a smaller likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation when patients were female ( odds ratio 0.61 , 0.40-0.93). Patients who had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm ( odds ratio 6.33 , 3.86-10.39) or an age < 60 years ( odds ratio 2.91 , 1.86-4.57) had a greater likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation. In addition , bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( odds ratio 1.56 , 1.04-2.33) was associated with an increased chance of return of spontaneous circulation. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and survival rate lies within the known range. A wider database is necessary to achieve a better knowledge of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and to drive future investments in the healthcare system.
