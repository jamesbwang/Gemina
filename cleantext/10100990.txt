  In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) , mucins display disease-related alterations caused by airway mucus obstruction. MUC5AC , MUC5B and MUC8 are known as the major secretory mucins in human airway epithelial cells. Analysis of mucin genes has identified the presence of several features with a variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR; minisatellites) in the central region of each mucin. In our previous study , six minisatellites in the region of the MUC8 gene were identified , and the MUC8-MS5 minisatellite showed the highest heterozygosity among them. In this study , we evaluated the relationship between MUC8-MS5 and susceptibility to asthma and COPD. A case-control study was performed with 229 controls , 123 COPD cases and 77 asthma cases. A significant association ( OR 3.96) between short alleles ( 2/2 repeats) and the occurrence of COPD was observed ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.32-11.88; p = 0.008). Hence , the increased frequency of 2/2 homo-short alleles were also found in asthma cases ( 3.11; CI 0.88-11.05; p = 0.066) , though this association was not statistically significant. These results revealed a genetic association between MUC8 and COPD , and that the specific short minisatellite alleles ( 2/2) of MUC8-MS5 may be a risk factor for COPD.
