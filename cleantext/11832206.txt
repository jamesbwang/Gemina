  Colorectal cancer is a commonly diagnosed malignancy and also the major cause of death worldwide. Chemotherapy is the primary therapy for advanced colorectal cancer. Although oxaliplatin has potential effect in colorectal cancer therapy , the molecular mechanisms involved in its cytotoxic effects are not well elucidated.
