  To assess the studies that focus on the study of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis ( FDEIA) and food-dependent NSAID-induced anaphylaxis ( FDNIA). Cofactors , as exercise and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) , are relevant in up to 30 % of episodes of anaphylaxis. Gliadin and lipid transfer proteins are the main allergens involved. The attempts to reproduce FDEIA and FDNIA in a controlled setting have an important failure rate. The cyclooxigenase ( COX) pathway could play an important role in the underlying mechanisms: NSAIDs and exercise increase the permeability of the intestinal barrier. This effect is stronger with NSAID that inhibit both isoforms than with preferential COX-2 inhibitor. Basophils obtained from FDNIA patients , showed an increase of its activation with the food allergen with lysine-aspirin compared with the food allergen alone. This potentiating effect was not observed when basophils were stimulated with the food allergen with selective COX-2 inhibitor. Other mechanisms including transient receptor potential superamily , reactive oxygen species , altered B-cell pathway and increased neutrophil activation markers have been speculated. The frequent implication of cofactors , as exercise and NSAID , in food-induced anaphylaxis highlights the importance of recognizing and including them into diagnostic workup. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms would help in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
