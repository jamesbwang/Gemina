  A trilayer SiO ₂/ Ag/SiO ₂ nanocap array was prepared on a two-dimensional template. When annealed at different temperatures , the curvature of the SiO ₂/ Ag/SiO ₂ nanocap arrays increased , which led to Ag nanocap shrinkage. The stress provided by the curved SiO ₂ layer induced the formation of Ag nanotwins. Ag nanotwins assisted the growth of nanoparticles when the neighboring nanotwins changed the local misorientations. Nanocap shrinkage reduced the surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) coupling between neighboring nanocaps; concurrently , grain growth decreased the SPR coupling between the particles in each nanocap , which led to a red shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) bands and decreased the surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) signals.
