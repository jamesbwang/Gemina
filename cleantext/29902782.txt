  The objective of this work is to demonstrate if the hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase Coq1p might be involved in monoterpenes synthesis in Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , although its currently known function in yeast is to catalyze the first step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. However , in a BY4743 laboratory strain , the presence of an empty plasmid in a chemically defined grape juice medium results in a statistically significant increase of linalool , ( E)- nerolidol and ( E , E)- farnesol. When COQ1 is overexpressed from a plasmid , the levels of the volatile isoprenoids are further increased. Furthermore , overexpression of COQ1 in the same genetic context but with a mutated farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase ( erg20 mutation K197E) , results in statistically significant higher levels of linalool ( above 750 μg/L) , geraniol , α-terpineol , and the sesquiterpenes , farnesol and nerolidol ( total concentration of volatile isoprenoids surpasses 1300 μg/L). We show that the levels of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> can produce , in the absence of plant genes , depend on the composition of the medium and the genetic context. To the best of our knowledge , this is the highest level of linalool produced by S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> up to now. Further research will be needed for understanding how COQ1 and the medium composition might interact to increase flavor complexity of fermented beverages.
