  Second primary malignancies ( SPMs) may occur in organs after radiotherapy ( RT). This study aimed to determine the rate and distribution of SPMs for photon- or neutron-emitting radiotherapy sources for patients treated for primary endometrial cancer. The cohort comprised 426 patients with 5334 patient-years of observation. Patients were treated by different methods of RT from 1990 to 2000. Patients received postoperative Over a 25-year period , 47 SPMs were observed ( 21 for HDR For followup at 25 years , 47 SPMs were observed with no differences in the high-intermediate risk group depending on the RT source.
