  Cutaneous somatosensory neurons convey innocuous and noxious mechanical , thermal , and chemical stimuli from peripheral tissues to the CNS. Among these are nociceptive neurons that express calcitonin gene-related peptide-α ( CGRPα). The role of peripheral CGRPα neurons ( CANs) in acute and injury-induced pain has been studied using diphtheria<disease> toxin ablation , but their functional roles remain controversial. Because ablation permanently deletes a neuronal population , compensatory changes may ensue that mask the physiological or pathophysiological roles of CANs , particularly for injuries that occur after ablation. Therefore , we sought to define the role of intact CANs
