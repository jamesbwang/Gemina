  Gastrointestinal diaphragm disease is a rare entity characterized by the formation of thin membranous circumferential mucosal septa , resulting in marked narrowing of the intestinal lumen. The most frequent etiology is the chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). Idiopathic cases and other possible etiologies have been reported. We present a rare association of diaphragm disease with Crohn 's disease in a boy without a history of significant NSAID usage.
