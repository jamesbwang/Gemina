  UW and HTK solutions are the two primary organ preservation solutions most used in the United States. This study analyzes use of the two solutions in all pediatric liver transplants performed at a single center between 2001and 2017. Outcome measures included early graft function , as well as graft and patient survival. Bile duct complications were reviewed. Operative technique , immunosuppressive protocols , and donor acceptance criteria remained uniform among participating surgeons throughout the study period. There were 104 pediatric liver transplants with complete data during the study period , 75 preserved with HTK ( 68 %) and 29 with UW ( 26 %). Demographics were similar. Cold and warm ischemia times were similar. Peak ALT post-transplant was higher in the UW group at both peak and post-transplant day 3. The peak TB levels were similar. Bile duct strictures were more common in the UW group ( 44 % vs 16 % , P < .01). Early graft survival was statistically similar at 7- , 90- and 365-days post-transplant. Cox regression graft survival was similar at 10-years. This study suggests that use of HTK in pediatric liver transplantation is safe with outcomes similar to UW , though bile duct stricture rates may be lower with HTK.
