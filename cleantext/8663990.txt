  Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation ( e.g. surgery , infection , or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood , but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging ( 24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However , their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge ( an intraperitoneal injection of
