  Previous case reports have suggested a possible association of congenital hyperinsulinism with Turner syndrome<disease>. We examined the clinical and molecular features in girls with both congenital hyperinsulinism and Turner syndrome<disease> seen at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ( CHOP) between 1974 and 2017. Records of girls with hyperinsulinism and Turner syndrome<disease> were reviewed. Insulin secretion was studied in pancreatic islets and in mouse islets treated with an inhibitor of KDM6A , an X chromosome gene associated with hyperinsulinism in Kabuki syndrome<disease>. Hyperinsulinism was diagnosed in 12 girls with Turner syndrome<disease>. Six were diazoxide-unresponsive; 3 had pancreatectomies. The incidence of Turner syndrome<disease> among CHOP patients with hyperinsulinism ( 10 of 1,050 from 1997 to 2017) was 48 times more frequent than expected. The only consistent chromosomal anomaly in these girls was the presence of a 45 , X cell line. Studies of isolated islets from 1 case showed abnormal elevated cytosolic calcium and heightened sensitivity to amino acid-stimulated insulin release; similar alterations were demonstrated in mouse islets treated with a KDM6A inhibitor. These results demonstrate a higher than expected frequency of Turner syndrome<disease> among children with hyperinsulinism. Our data suggest that haploinsufficiency for KDM6A due to mosaic X chromosome monosomy may be responsible for hyperinsulinism in Turner
