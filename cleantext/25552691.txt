  Lack of unallocated spectrum and increasing demand for bandwidth in wireless networks is forcing new devices and technologies to share frequency bands. Spectrum sensing is a key enabler for frequency sharing and there is a large body of existing work on signal detection methods. However a unified methodology that would be suitable for objective comparison of detection methods based on experimental evaluations is missing. In this paper we propose such a methodology comprised of seven steps that can be applied to evaluate methods in simulation or practical experiments. Using the proposed methodology , we perform the most comprehensive experimental evaluation of signal detection methods to date: we compare energy detection , covariance-based and eigenvalue-based detection and cyclostationary detection. We measure minimal detectable signal power , sensitivity to noise power changes and computational complexity using an experimental setup that covers typical capabilities from low-cost embedded to high-end software defined radio devices. Presented results validate our premise that a unified methodology is valuable in obtaining reliable and reproducible comparisons of signal detection methods.
