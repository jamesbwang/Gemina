  Phoenixin is a recently discovered brain peptide initially thought to be restricted to reproductive functions. The subsequent identification of phoenixin & rsquo; s expression in peripheral tissues was accompanied by the description of several other actions of this hormone , such as effects on behavior , sensory perception , memory retention , the cardiovascular system as well as food intake , pointing towards a pleiotropic role of this peptide. The present review will discuss the present knowledge on phoenixin and the signaling involved as well as highlight gaps in knowledge to stimulate further research.
