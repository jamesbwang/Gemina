  The objective of this study was to develop biodegradable active film to improve the shelf-life of minimally processed fresh-produce. Guar gum ( GG) based films with improved properties were fabricated by employing tween-80 ( 0.88 %) as emulsifier , nanoclay ( 13.9 %) as reinforcement , beeswax ( 1.21 %) for hydrophobicity , glycerol ( 3.07 %) as plasticizer , and grape pomace extract ( 5 %) as active ingredient ( % w/w of GG). Active films had a tensile strength of 122 MPa and water vapor transmission rate of 69 gm
