  The chromatin state is finely tuned to regulate function and specificity for transcription factors such as oestrogen receptor alpha ( ER) , which contributes to cell growth in breast cancer. ER transcriptional potential is mediated , in large part , by the specific associated proteins and co-factors that interact with it. Despite the identification and characterisation of several ER coregulators , a complete and systematic view of ER-regulating chromatin modifiers is lacking. By exploiting a focused siRNA screen that investigated the requirement for a library of 330 chromatin regulators in ER-mediated cell growth , we find that the NuRD and coREST histone deacetylation complexes are critical for breast cancer cell proliferation. Further , by proteomic and genomics approaches , we discover the transcription factor TRPS1 to be a key interactor of the NuRD and coREST complexes. Interestingly , TRPS1 gene amplification occurs in 28 % of human breast tumours and is associated with poor prognosis. We propose that TRPS1 is required to repress spurious binding of ER , where it contributes to the removal of histone acetylation. Our data suggest that TRPS1 is an important ER-associated transcriptional repressor that regulates cell proliferation , chromatin acetylation and ER binding at the chromatin of cis-regulatory elements.
