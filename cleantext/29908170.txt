  Transmission risk for vector borne disease is greatest during periods of heightened vector activity. Triatomine bugs ( Hemiptera: Reduviidae) , which transmit Trypanosoma cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas disease , are generally considered nocturnal , but their patterns of activity in controlled settings have rarely been studied. We quantified activity patterns across a 24-hour period in nymphs of two triatomine species: ( 1) Triatoma gerstaeckeri Stål , a North American triatomine which is closely associated with sylvatic and peridomestic hosts , and ( 2) Rhodnius prolixus Stål , a Central and South American triatomine that thrives in the domestic environment. T. gerstaeckeri showed activity throughout the night , with peaks around midnight , 3:00 , and again around dawn. Refuge use was highest in the pre-dawn hours then again after the dawn activity peak. We hypothesize that the dawn activity peak may represent a period of host seeking for this sylvatic species that targets nocturnal hosts returning to their home at dawn. In contrast , R. prolixus displayed high activity near 23:00 and again around noon. This study provides a baseline understanding of diel activity for future behavioral experiments and identifies periods of time that may represent the greatest risk of host exposure to triatomines and T. cruzi.
