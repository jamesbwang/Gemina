  Self-limited delayed puberty ( DP) segregates in an autosomal dominant pattern , but the genetic basis is largely unknown. Although DP is sometimes seen in relatives of patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( HH) , mutations in genes known to cause HH which segregate with the trait of familial self-limited DP have not yet been identified. To assess the contribution of mutations in genes known to cause HH to the phenotype of self-limited DP. We performed whole exome sequencing in 67 probands and 93 relatives from a large cohort of familial self-limited DP , validated the pathogenicity of the identified gene variant in vitro and examined the tissue expression and functional requirement of the mouse homolog in vivo. A potentially pathogenic gene variant segregating with DP was identified in 1 of 28 known HH genes examined. This pathogenic variant occurred in HS6ST1 in one pedigree and segregated with the trait in the six affected members with heterozygous transmission ( p = 3.01 x 10-5). Biochemical analysis showed that this mutation reduced sulphotransferase activity in vitro. Hs6st1 mRNA was expressed in peri-pubertal wild type mouse hypothalamus. GnRH neuron counts were similar in Hs6st1 +/- and Hs6st1 +/ + mice , but vaginal opening was delayed in Hs6st1 +/- mice despite normal postnatal growth. We have linked a deleterious mutation in HS6ST1 to familial self-limited DP and show that heterozygous Hs6st1 loss causes DP in mice. In this study , the observed overlap in potentially pathogenic mutations contributing to the phenotypes of self-limited DP and HH was limited to this one gene.
