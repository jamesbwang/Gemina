  UK national anaesthetic activity was studied in 2013 but weekend working was not examined. Understanding changes since 2013 in workload and manpower distribution , including weekends , would be of value in workforce planning. We performed an observational survey of NHS hospitals ' anaesthetic practice in October 2016 as part of the 6th National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists ( NAP6). All cases cared for by an anaesthetist during the study period were included. Patient characteristics and details of anaesthetic conduct were collected by local anaesthetists. Responses were received from 342/356 ( 96 %) hospitals. In total , 15 942 cases were reported , equating to an annual anaesthetic workload of ≈ 3.13 million cases. Approximately 95 % ( 9888/10 452) of elective and 72 % ( 3184/4392) of emergency work was performed on weekdays and 89 % ( 14 145/15 942) of activity was led by senior ( consultant or career grade) anaesthetists and 1.1 % ( 180/15942) by those with < 2 yr anaesthetic experience. During weekends case urgency increased , the proportion of healthy patients reduced and case mix changed. Cases led by senior anaesthetists fell to 80 % ( 947/1177) on Saturday and 66 % ( 342/791) on Sunday. Senior involvement in obstetric anaesthetic activity was 69 % ( 628/911) during the week and 45 % ( 182/402) at weekends , compared with 93 % ( 791/847) in emergency orthopaedic procedures during the week and 89 % ( 285/321) at weekends. Since 2013 , the proportion of obese patients , elective weekend working , and depth of anaesthesia monitoring has increased ( 12 % ( 1464/12 213) vs 2.8 %) , but neuromuscular monitoring has not ( 37 % ( 2032/5532) vs 38 % of paralysed cases). Senior clinicians deliver most UK anaesthesia care , including at weekends. Our findings are important for any planned workforce reorganisation to rationalise 7-day working.
