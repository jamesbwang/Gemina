  ( Purpose) To investigate the effect of electrical stimulation and pelvic floor muscle training on muscle strength , urinary incontinence and erectile function in men with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. ( Subjects and Methods) One hundred twenty-three males were randomized into 3 groups 1 month after RP: ( G1 , n = 40) control; ( G2 , n = 41) guideline: patients were instructed to perform three types of home exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and ( G3 , n = 42) electrical stimulation: patients in this group were also instructed to perform exercises as group G2 , and also received anal electro-stimulation therapy , twice a week for 7 weeks. The primary outcome assessment was based on the measurement of the recovery of pelvic floor muscle strength between groups. Secondary outcomes were: 1 hour Pad Test , ICIQ-SF , IIEF-5 and IPSS. Data were obtained preoperatively and at 1 , 3 and 6 months after surgery. ( Results) There was no significant difference in the demographic data among groups. Greater urinary leakage and pelvic floor muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> in the first month compared to pre treatment improved after 3 and 6 months postoperative , without difference among groups. ( Conclusion) The muscle strength recovery occurs independently of the therapy employed. Pelvic floor exercises or electrical stimulation also did not have an impact on the recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in our study.
