  The cause of osteochondritis dissecans is unknown. Various hypotheses suggest mechanical , ischemic , and hereditary causes. We describe a 13-year-old girl with spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy , who had an associated crouch gait and presented with bilateral osteochondral defects of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. This case highlights the potential role of repetitive microtrauma , likely due to the poor biomechanical forces in a crouch gait , and provides support for a mechanical cause of osteochondritis dissecans.
