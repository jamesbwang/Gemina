  Smoking activities still represent the main , and preventable , cause of lung cancer risk worldwide. For this reason , a number of studies were carried out to deepen and better characterize the emission of cigarette-generated mainstream aerosols in order to perform an a-priori evaluation of the particle doses and related lung cancer risks received by active smokers. On the contrary , a gap of knowledge still exists in evaluating the dose and risk received by passive smokers in indoor private micro-environments ( e.g. homes). For this purpose , in the present paper , an experimental campaign was performed to evaluate the exposure to second-hand aerosol from conventional and electronic cigarettes and to estimate the consequent dose received by passive smokers/vapers and the related lung cancer risk. Measurements of exposure levels in terms of particle number , PM
