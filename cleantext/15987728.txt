  Since 2006 , CDC has recommended routine , provider-initiated human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) screening ( i.e. , HIV<pathogen> screening at least once in lifetime) for all patients aged 13-64 years in all health care settings ( 1). Whereas evidence related to the frequency of HIV<pathogen> testing is available , less is known about the prevalence and predictors of providers ' HIV<pathogen> test offers to patients ( 2). National HIV<pathogen> Behavioral Surveillance ( NHBS) data from Virginia were used to examine the prevalence and predictors of provider-initiated HIV<pathogen> test offers to heterosexual adults aged 18-60 years at increased risk for HIV<pathogen> acquisition. In a sample of 333 persons who visited a health care provider in the 12 months before their NHBS interview , 194 ( 58 %) reported not receiving an HIV<pathogen> test offer during that time , approximately one third of whom ( 71 , 37 %) also reported never having had an HIV<pathogen> test in their lifetime. In multivariable analysis , the prevalence of HIV<pathogen> test offers was significantly lower among men than among women ( adjusted prevalence ratio ( aPR) = 0.72; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.53-0.97). Provider-initiated HIV<pathogen> test offers are an important strategy for increasing HIV<pathogen> testing among heterosexual populations; there is a need for increased provider-initiated HIV<pathogen> screening among heterosexual adults who are at risk for acquiring HIV<pathogen> , especially men , who were less likely than women to be offered HIV<pathogen> screening in this study.
