  Trio based whole exome sequencing via the Deciphering Developmental Disorders ( DDD) study has identified three individuals with de novo frameshift variants in the Suppressor of Variegation , Enhancer of Zeste , and Trithorax ( SET) gene. Variants in the SET gene have not previously been recognised to be associated with human developmental disorders. Here we report detailed phenotypic information and propose that SET is a new Intellectual Disability/Developmental Delay ( ID/DD) gene.
