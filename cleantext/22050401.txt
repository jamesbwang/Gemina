  Studies have shown increased urine excretion of vitamin D-binding protein ( VDBP) in patients with diabetic nephropathy ( DN) resulting from postulated mechanisms linked to renal tubular damage. In this study , we evaluate the utility of VDBP clearance ratio as a novel determinant of glycemic status , DN , and other diabetes-associated complications. Levels of vitamin D , HbA1c , serum , urine concentrations of VDBP , and creatinine were measured in 309 subjects. The ratio of urine microalbumin to creatinine was determined to categorize subjects as normoalbuminuric ( NAO) , microalbuminuric ( MIA) , and macroalbuminuric ( MAA). The VDBP clearance ratio was calculated. Mean VDBP clearance ratios in NAO , MIA , and MAA were 0.7 , 4 , and 15 , respectively. Significant positive correlations of VDBP clearance ratio were found with age , WC , SBP , DBP , TG , glucose , HbA1c , urine VDBP , urine microalbumin , and urine microalbumin/creatinine , and a significant negative correlation was found with the steady-state estimate of beta cell function ( B %). Receiver operating curve ( ROC) analyses of the use of VDBP clearance ratio for detection of albumin status shows a value of 0.81 for the area under the curve. The strong associations of VDBP clearance ratio with glycemic control and diabetes-associated complications suggest that this index could play a wider role in detection and/or pathogenesis and complications of diabetes.
