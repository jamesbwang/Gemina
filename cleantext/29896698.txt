  Developmental biology is a fascinating branch of science which helps us to understand the mechanism of development , thus the findings are used in various therapeutic approach. Drosophila melanogaster served as a model to find the key molecules that initiate and regulate the mechanism of development. Various genes , transcription factors , and signaling pathways helping in development are identified in Drosophila. Many toxic compounds , which can affect the development , are also recognized using Drosophila model. These compounds , which can affect the development , are named as a teratogen. Many teratogens identified using Drosophila may also act as a teratogen for a human being since 75 % of conservation exist between the disease genes present in Drosophila and human. There are certain teratogens , which do not cause developmental defect if exposed during pregnancy , however; behavioral defect appears in later part of development. Such compounds are named as a behavioral teratogen. Thus , it is worthy to identify the potential behavioral teratogen using Drosophila model. Drosophila behavior is well studied in various developmental stages. This chapter describes various methods which can be employed to test behavioral teratogenesis in Drosophila.
