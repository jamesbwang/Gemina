  This study developed the potential regulation capacity ( PRC) and actual regulation capacity ( ARC) to characterize the flood regulation function of river systems in the delta plains. Spatial autocorrelation and the grey relational analysis were then employed to investigate the spatial-temporal change of the flood regulation function in the urbanization process , of which the results revealed its spatial coupling and quantitative relation with the urbanization process and river systems changes in the Taihu Plain. The results indicated that: ( 1) the PRC exhibited a 20.3 %- decrease during the 1960s to the 2010s , though its change exhibited significant structural and hierarchical differences. The global distributions of the PRCs all presented insignificant clustered characteristics , and the local distribution of smaller PRC regions with a high flood risk was stable; ( 2) the ARC exhibited a 33.2 %- reduction in the recent 50 years , and its decrement also exhibited an accelerating trend. The global ARC distribution changed from significant clusters to insignificant aggregations , and the local distribution range of the smaller ARC regions with a high flood risk gradually increased; ( 3) the spatial coupling degree between the change in the PRC and the urbanization process was greater than that between the change in the ARC and the urbanization process , and the effect of urbanization on the change in the PRC was also larger than the change in the ARC; ( 4) the spatial coupling degree between the changes in the ARC and the river systems was greater than that between the changes in the PRC and the river systems , though the impacts of the river systems changes on the change in the PRC were larger than that on the change in the ARC. Therefore , the developed indicators based on limited and available information can serve as references for planning effective flood control strategies in the delta plains.
