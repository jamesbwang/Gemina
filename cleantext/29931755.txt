  Mushrooms have been widely considered as health foods as their extracts have anti-hypertensive and anti-tumor activities. After a thorough literature survey , we hypothesized that enzymes in mushroom extracts play an important role in synthesizing functional molecules. Therefore , in the present study , proteins extracted from Reishi mushroom ( Ganoderma lucidum) , which is used in oriental medicine , were identified by the proteomic approach , and appropriate extraction methods for improving angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitory activities were investigated. Various glycoside hydrolases ( GHs) , such as β-N-acetylhexaminidase ( GH family 20) , α-1,2-mannosidase ( GH family 47) , endo-β-1,3-glucanase ( GH family 128) and β-1,3-glucanase ( GH152) , that degrade glycans in the fruiting body were identified. The residual glucanase activities generated β-oligosaccharides. Additionally , the glutamic acid protease of the peptidase G1 family was determined as the major protein in the extract , and the residual peptidase activity of the extracts was found to improve ACE inhibitory activities. Finally , it was observed that extraction at 50 °C is suitable for yielding functional molecules with high ACE inhibitory activities. Water extraction is generally believed to extract only functional macromolecules that exist in mushroom fruiting bodies. The present study proposed a new concept that describes how functional molecules are produced by enzymes , including proteases and GHs , during extraction. This article is protected by copyright.
