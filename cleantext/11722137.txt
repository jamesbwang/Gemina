  The best treatment for displaced , intraarticular fractures of the calcaneum remains controversial. Surgical treatment of these injuries is challenging and have a considerable learning curve. Studies comparing operative with nonoperative treatment including randomized trials and meta-analyses are fraught with a considerable number of confounders including highly variable fracture patterns , soft-tissue conditions , patient characteristics , surgeon experience , limited sensitivity of outcome measures , and rehabilitation protocols. It has become apparent that there is no single treatment that is suitable for all calcaneal fractures. Treatment should be tailored to the individual fracture pathoanatomy , accompanying soft-tissue damage , associated injuries , functional demand , and comorbidities of the patient. If operative treatment is chosen , reconstruction of the overall shape of the calcaneum and joint surfaces are of utmost importance to obtain a good functional result. Despite meticulous reconstruction , primary cartilage damage due to the impact at the time of injury may lead to posttraumatic subtalar arthritis<disease>. Even if subtalar fusion becomes necessary , patients benefit from primary anatomical reconstruction of the hindfoot geometry because
