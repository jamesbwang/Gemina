  Stu2/XMAP215 microtubule polymerases use multiple tubulin-binding TOG domains and a lattice-binding basic region to processively promote faster elongation. How the domain composition and organization of these proteins dictate polymerase activity , end localization , and processivity is unknown. We show that polymerase activity does not require different kinds of TOGs , nor are there strict requirements for how the TOGs are linked. We identify an unexpected antagonism between the tubulin-binding TOGs and the lattice-binding basic region: lattice binding by the basic region is weak when at least two TOGs engage tubulins , strong when TOGs are empty. End-localization of Stu2 requires unpolymerized tubulin , at least two TOGs , and polymerase competence. We propose a ` ratcheting ' model for processivity: transfer of tubulin from TOGs to the lattice activates the basic region , retaining the polymerase at the end for subsequent rounds of tubulin binding and incorporation. These results clarify design principles of the polymerase.
