  Immunotherapy trials to prevent type 1 diabetes have been unsuccessful for more than fifteen years. Understanding pitfalls and knowledge gaps in the immunology of type 1 diabetes should lead us in new directions that will yield better trial outcomes. A proposal is made for precision medicine trial design in future type 1 diabetes studies. High quality peer-reviewed basic science and clinical research trials for type 1 diabetes were used in this Perspectives article. Type 1 diabetes publications were reviewed from the years 2000 to 2018 using Google Scholar and PubMed reference databases. Personalized medicine for type 1 diabetes should recognize that each individual has phenotypic and genotypic quirks that distinguish them from other study subjects. A uniform protocol for antigen-specific immunotherapy has consistently failed to prevent disease. An alternative approach using molecular tools to personalize the preventive treatment strategy might be a road forward for type 1 diabetes research. Assumptions or lack knowledge about disease stratification ( not all type 1 diabetes is the same disease) , individualized antigen-specific T-cells , regulatory T-cell populations , and T-cell receptor rearrangement are just a few aspects of immunology that need integration with clinical trial design. The type 1 diabetes research community continues to bring forward novel immunotherapy trials to prevent disease , but this approach is unlikely to succeed until several fundamental aspects of clinical immunology are recognized and addressed. Here , we identify several knowledge gaps that could rectify type 1 diabetes trial design and lead to future success.
