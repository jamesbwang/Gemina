  Activity of the voltage-gated Nav1 .5 sodium channel has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation , cancer invasion and gene expression. In addition , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA) has recently been suggested to inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth and suppress tumor metastasis. The present study aimed to explore the association between EPA , the Nav1 .5 sodium channel and ovarian cancer cells. Using patch-clamp technique and RNA interference approaches , sodium currents were recorded in epithelial ovarian cancer cells , and it was confirmed that the Nav1 .5 channel carried the sodium currents. Furthermore , EPA effectively inhibited sodium currents in a dose-dependent manner , shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of sodium currents to the hyperpolarizing direction and reduced sodium window currents. In addition , EPA induced a shift in the inactivation curve in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of the sodium channel , either by EPA or by Nav1 .5 knockdown , attenuated ovarian cancer cell migration and proliferation. To the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first to conduct sodium current recording in ovarian cancer cells , and revealed that EPA may inhibit Nav1.5-mediated ovarian cancer cell migration and growth. These findings not only present a potential prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer , but also provide a strategy towards the development of novel pharmacological treatments for patients with ovarian cancer.
