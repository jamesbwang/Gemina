  A new series of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 ( TRPV1) antagonists were designed and synthesized from N- ( 3-hydroxyphenyl) -2- ( piperidin-1-ylmethyl) biphenyl-4-carboxamide hydrochloride ( 8). SAR studies identified ( R)- N- ( 1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-quinolyl) -2- ( ( 2-methylpyrrolidin-1-yl) methyl) biphenyl-4-carboxamide hydrochloride ( ASP8370 , 7) , as a compound with high aqueous solubility , satisfactory stability in human liver microsomes , and reduced CYP3A4 inhibition. ASP8370 was selected as a clinical development candidate with significant ameliorative effects on neuropathic pain. SAR studies also revealed the structural mechanisms underlying the switching between TRPV1 antagonism and agonism.
