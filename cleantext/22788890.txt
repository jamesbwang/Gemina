  Aberrant right subclavian artery is the most common brachiocephalic artery congenital abnormality and may result in dysphagia<symptom> from external compression by the aberrant artery on the esophagus. Repair of this anatomic variant can be performed by both open and hybrid endovascular techniques. This case illustrates a complication of a hybrid repair resulting in proximal migration of a vascular occlusion plug , presenting as recurrent dysphagia<symptom> and need for open surgical extraction of the plug.
