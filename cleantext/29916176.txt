  The flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea and related species are emerging model systems in such fields as stem-cell biology , regeneration , and evolutionary biology. Excellent molecular tools have been developed for S. mediterranea , but ultrastructural techniques have received less attention , which is unfortunate , as these methods are necessary to better understand the actual histological , cellular and subcellular features of regeneration and development. Tissue-processing regimens can be quite idiosyncratic for particular species or specimen types-what works for mammalian tissues or cell cultures will not necessarily give good results with freshwater planarians. Here we present detailed , optimized protocols for preparation of S. mediterranea by `` standard '' chemical fixation , and by a rapid microwave-based technique.
