  Copper is an essential element in some biological processes in organisms , so it was important to find ways to identify trace amounts of it. Minimal amounts of copper ions can be determined in aqueous solutions in the spectrophotometric method suggested in this study. The method depends on the reaction between Cu ( II) and Amaranth dye at the pH 6.0. The gradual disappearance of Amaranth colour at 520 nm occurring with an increase of Cu ( II) concentration from 0.13 up to 2.0 Î¼g cm
