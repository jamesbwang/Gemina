  The importance of circulating free DNA ( cfDNA) in cancer clinical research was recognized in 1994 when a mutated RAS gene fragment was detected in a patient 's blood sample. Up to 1 % of the total circulating DNA in patients with cancer is circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) that originates from tumor cells. As ctDNA is rapidly cleared from the blood stream and can be obtained by minimally invasive methods , it can be used as a dynamic cancer biomarker for cancer early detection , diagnosis , and treatment monitoring. Despite the potential for clinical use , few ctDNA assays have been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. As tools for clinical and translational research , current ctDNA assays face some challenges , and more research is needed to advance use of these assays. On September 29-30 , 2016 , the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute convened a workshop entitled `` Circulating Tumor DNA Assays in Clinical Cancer Research '' to garner input from industry experts , academia , and government research and regulatory agencies to understand and promote the translation of ctDNA assays to clinical research , with potential to advance to use in clinical practice. This Commentary presents the topics of the workshop covered in the presentations and points made in the discussions that followed: 1) background on ctDNA , 2) potential clinical utility of ctDNA assays , 3) assay technology , 4) assay clinical and analytical validation , and 5) industry perspectives. Additional relevant information that has come to light since the workshop has been included.
