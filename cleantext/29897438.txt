  In this study , we investigated CIS reaction ( clamping-mediated incorporation of single-stranded DNA with concomitant DNA syntheses) of Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase ( MMLV-RT) , and established a set of conditions with which single-stranded DNA is ligated to a G-tailed model substrate DNA at efficiencies close to 100 %. Prior to the CIS reaction , a target blunt-end DNA was 3 ' G-tailed by MMLV-RT in the presence of a tailing enhancer , deoxycytidine. In the CIS reaction , the G-tail reacted with a single-stranded DNA carrying a stretch of Cs on its 3 ' end ( termed as GAO for guide adaptor oligonucleotide) , and MMLV-RT performed DNA polymerization , starting from the 3 ' overhang , using the GAO as a template. We could append a given nucleotide sequence of as long as 72 nucleotides , which would be sufficient for various NGS-sequencing platforms. The high efficiency and the unique features of this MMLV-RT activity that enables the labelling of each DNA molecule with a unique degenerate sequence as a molecular identifier has many potential uses in biotechnology.
