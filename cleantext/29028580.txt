  Oceanic gateways are sensitive to climate driven processes. By connecting oceans , they have a global influence on marine biological production and biogeochemical cycles. The furthest north of these gateways is Nares Strait at the top of the North Water between Greenland and Ellesmere Island ( Canada). This gateway is globally beneficial , first by supporting high local mammal and bird populations and second with the outflow of phosphate-rich Arctic waters fueling the North Atlantic spring bloom. Both sides of the North Water are hydrologically distinct with counter currents that make this Arctic portal a Janus gateway , after Janus , the Roman god of duality. We examined oceanographic properties and differences in phytoplankton and other protist communities from the eastern and western sides of the North Water ( latitude 76.5 Â° N) and found that species differed markedly due to salinity stratification regimes and local hydrography. Typical Arctic communities were associated with south flowing currents along the Canadian side , while potentially noxious Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were dominant on the Greenland side and associated with greater surface freshening from ice melt. This susceptibility of the Greenland side to Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms suggest that monitoring species responses to climate mediated changes is needed.
