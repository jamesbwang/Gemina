  Investigating the role of nutrition on cognitive health is challenging. Human brain tissue is inaccessible in living humans and is often limited in deceased individuals. Therefore , biomarkers of brain nutrient levels are of interest. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationships between levels of fat-soluble nutrients in serum and matched brain tissues from the frontal and temporal cortices of participants in the Georgia Centenarian Study ( n = 47). After adjusting for sex , race , cognitive status ( global deterioration scale) , body mass index , and presence of hypertension and/or diabetes , there was a significant relationship ( p < 0.05) between serum and brain levels of carotenoids ( lutein , zeaxanthin , cryptoxanthin , β-carotene) , α- , γ-tocopherols , total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs) and n-6/ n-3 PUFA ratio. The relationship between serum and brain total n-6 PUFAs was inconsistent among the two brain regions. No significant relationship was identified between serum and brain retinol , total saturated fatty acid , total monounsaturated fatty acid , and trans-fatty acid levels. These findings suggest that serum carotenoids , tocopherols , total n-3 PUFAs and n-6/ n-3 PUFA ratio reflect levels in brain and can be used as surrogate biomarkers in older population.
