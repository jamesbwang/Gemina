  Malaria<disease> , a major cause of morbidity and mortality , is the most prevalent vector borne disease in Baringo County; a region which has varied house designs in arid and semi-arid areas. This study investigated the association between house structures and indoor-malaria vector abundance in Baringo County. The density of malaria<disease> vectors in houses with open eaves was higher than that for houses with closed eaves. Grass thatched roof houses had higher density of malaria<disease> vectors than corrugated iron sheet roofs. Similarly , mud walled houses had higher vector density than other wall types. Houses in the riverine zone were significantly associated with malaria<disease> vector abundance ( p < 0.000) possibly due to more varied house structures. In Kamnarok village within riverine zone , a house made of grass thatched roof and mud wall but raised on stilts with domestic animals ( sheep/goats) kept at the lower level had lower mosquito density ( 5.8 per collection) than ordinary houses made of same materials but at ground level ( 30.5 mosquitoes per collection) , suggestive of a change in behavior of mosquito feeding and resting. House modifications such as screening of eaves , improvement of construction material and building stilted houses can be incorporated in the integrated vector management ( IVM) strategy to complement insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual spray to reduce indoor malaria<disease> vector density.
