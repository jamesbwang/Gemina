  The study compared the pharmacokinetic ( PK) behaviour and anthelmintic efficacy against susceptible and resistant nematodes following subcutaneous ( SC) and oral administration of ivermectin ( IVM) to cattle. Six commercial farms were involved: Farms 1 and 2 ( IVM-susceptible nematode population) and Farms 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ( IVM-resistant nematode population). On each farm , forty-five calves naturally infected with gastrointestinal ( GI) nematodes were randomly allocated into three groups ( n = 15): untreated control , IVM SC administration , and IVM oral administration ( both at 0.2 mg/kg). PK assessment ( plasma and faeces) was performed on Farm 1. Efficacy was determined by Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test. IVM systemic availability upon SC administration ( 421 ± 70.3 ng · d/mL) was higher ( P < 0.05) compared to the oral treatment ( 132 ± 31.3 ng · d/mL). However , higher ( P < 0.05) faecal IVM concentrations were observed following oral treatment ( 9896 ± 1931 ng · d/mL) compared to SC administration ( 4760 ± 924 ng · d/mL). Similar ( 91-93 %) IVM efficacy was observed on Farms 1 and 2 by both routes. Efficacy against resistant nematodes was slightly higher on Farms 3 and 4 after the oral ( 63 and 82 % , respectively) compared to the SC ( 36 and 68 % , respectively) treatment. However , there was complete therapeutic failure ( 0 % efficacy) on Farm 5 and a very low response on Farm 6 ( 40 and 41 % for SC and oral administration , respectively). Although larger faecal concentrations following IVM oral administration may increase drug exposure of GI adult worms , this does not always improve efficacy against resistant nematodes. The potential therapeutic advantages of oral treatments should be cautiously assessed , especially in presence of anthelmintic resistance.
