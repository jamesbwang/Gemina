  To evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygenation ( HBO) on the expression of the genes antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 4 ( Gpx4) and lactoperoxidase ( Lpo) in the lung of mice subjected to intestinal ischemia and reperfusion ( IIR). Control group ( CG) in which were subjected to anesthesia , laparotomy and observation for 120 minutes; an ischemia and reperfusion group ( IRG) subjected to anesthesia , laparotomy , small bowel ischemia for 60 minutes and reperfusion for 60 minutes; and three groups treated with HBO during ischemia ( HBOG + I) , during reperfusion ( HBOG + R) and during ischemia and reperfusion ( HBOG + IR). Studied 84 genes of oxidative stress by the method ( RT-qPCR). Genes with expression levels three times below or above the threshold cycle were considered significantly hypoexpressed or hyperexpressed , respectively ( Student 's t-test p < 0.05). Gpx4 and Lpo were hiperexpressed on IRG , showing a correlation with these genes with lung oxidative stress. Treated with HBO , there was a significant reduction on genic expression on HBOG+I. Hyperbaric oxygenation showed to be associated with decreased expression of these antioxidant genes , suggesting a beneficial effect on the mechanism of pulmonary oxidative stress whenever applied during the ischemia.
