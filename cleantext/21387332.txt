  Cellulose microfibrils are the principal structural building blocks of wood and plants. Their crystalline domains provide outstanding mechanical properties. Cellulose microfibrils have thus a remarkable potential as eco-friendly fibrous reinforcements for structural engineered materials. However , the elastoplastic properties of cellulose crystals remain poorly understood. Here , we use atomistic simulations to determine the plastic shear resistance of cellulose crystals and analyze the underpinning atomic deformation mechanisms. In particular , we demonstrate how the complex and adaptable atomic structure of crystalline cellulose controls its anisotropic elastoplastic behavior. For perfect crystals , we show that shear occurs through localized bands along with noticeable dilatancy. Depending on the shear direction , not only noncovalent interactions between cellulose chains but also local deformations , translations , and rotations of the cellulose macromolecules contribute to the response of the crystal. We also reveal the marked effect of crystalline defects like dislocations , which decrease both the yield strength and the dilatancy , in a way analogous to that of metallic crystals.
