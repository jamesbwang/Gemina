  This study compared three-dimensional ( 3D) and two-dimensional ( 2D) percentage gamma passing rates ( % GPs) for detection sensitivity to IMRT delivery errors and investigated the correlation between two kinds of % GP. Eleven prostate IMRT cases were selected , and errors in multileaf collimator ( MLC) bank sag , MLC leaf traveling , and machine output were simulated by recalculating the dose distributions in patients. 2D doses were extracted from the 3D doses at the isocenter position. The 3D and 2D % GPs with different gamma criteria were then obtained by comparing the recalculated and original doses in specific regions of interest ( ROI) , such as the whole body , the planning target volume ( PTV) , the bladder , and the rectum. The sensitivities to simulated errors of the two types of % GP were compared , and the correlation between the 2D and 3D % GPs for different ROIs were analyzed. For the whole-body evaluation , both the 2D and 3D % GPs with the 3 %/ 3 mm criterion were above 90 % for all tested MLC errors and for MU deviations up to 4 % , and the 3D % GP was higher than the 2D % GP. In organ-specific evaluations , the PTV-specific 2D and 3D % GP gradients were -4.70 % and -5.14 % per millimeter of the MLC traveling error , and -17.79 % and -20.50 % per percentage of MU error , respectively. However , a stricter criterion ( 2 %/ 1 mm) was needed to detect the tested MLC sag error. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant strong correlation ( r > 0.8 and P < 0.001) between the 2D and 3D % GPs in the whole body and PTV-specific gamma evaluations. The whole-body % GP with the 3 %/ 3 mm criterion was inadequate to detect the tested MLC and MU errors , and a stricter criterion may be needed. The PTV-specific gamma evaluation helped to improve the sensitivity of the error detection , especially using the 3D GP %.
