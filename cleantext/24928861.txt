  Endothelial cells serve as gatekeepers of vascular hemostasis and local inflammatory reactions. They can rapidly respond to changes in the environment , caused , for example , by blood vessel injury , tissue damage or infection , by secreting in a strictly regulated manner factors regulating these processes. These factors include adhesion receptors for circulating leukocytes and platelets , P-selectin and von-Willebrand factor ( VWF) that are stored in specialized secretory granules of endothelial cells , the Weibel-Palade bodies ( WPB). Acute exposure of these adhesion molecules converts the endothelial cell surface from an anti-adhesive state enabling unrestricted flow of circulating blood cells to an adhesive one capable of capturing leukocytes ( through P-selectin) and platelets ( through VWF). While these are important ( patho) physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> , compromised or dysregulated WPB secretion can cause pathologies such as excessive bleeding or vascular occlusion. Several factors are involved in regulating the exocytosis of WPB and thus represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions in these pathologies. Among them , the annexin A2 ( AnxA2)- S100A10 complex has been shown to participate in the tethering/docking of secretion-competent WPB at the plasma membrane , and interference with AnxA2/S100A10 expression or complex formation significantly reduces acute WPB exocytosis and VWF release. Thus , developing specific means to efficiently block AnxA2-S100A10 complex formation in endothelial cells could lead to novel avenues towards interfering with acute vascular thrombosis.
