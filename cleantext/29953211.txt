  Gold nanostars ( GNSs) have received considerable attention in surface-enhanced spectroscopies , catalysis , biosensing , photothermal therapy , and photovoltaics because of their unique optical properties arising from the anisotropic structure. GNSs typically consisting of a central core and several protruding tips are usually synthesized by a seed-mediated growth approach , but the growth mechanism and optical properties have yet to be fully understood. Here , we systematically investigate the seed-mediated growth process of GNSs to gain an insight into the growth mechanism and evolution of their optical and photothermal properties. By tailoring the core size , tip length and tip angle , the main localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) peak wavelength can be broadly tuned from the visible to near-infrared ( NIR) region. Our observations show that the protruding tips grow rapidly away from the central core at the initial growth stage , leading to a red-shift of the main LSPR peak. The preferential deposition of gold atoms onto the gold core takes place at the later growth stage , gradually blue-shifting the main LSPR peak. GNSs exhibit a large molar extinction coefficient ranging from 4.0 Ã— 10
