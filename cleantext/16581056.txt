  Developmental exposure to estrogenic chemicals is an established risk factor for cancer of the female reproductive tract. This increase in risk has been associated with disruption of normal patterns of cellular differentiation during critical stages of morphogenesis. The goal of this study was to document uterine epithelial phenotypes over time following neonatal treatment with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( DES) or the soy phytoestrogen genistein ( GEN) in female CD-1 mice. Both DES and GEN induced three distinct populations of abnormal endometrial epithelial cells: luminal ( SIX1 +/ P63-/ CK14-/ CK18 +) , basal ( SIX1 +/ P63 +/ CK14 +/ CK18-) , and mixed/bipotential ( SIX1 +/ P63-/ CK14 +/ CK18 +) , which were all established by early adulthood. In older animals , DES and GEN resulted in uterine carcinomas with mixed glandular , basal , and squamous cell elements. All carcinomas were composed largely of the three abnormal cell types. These findings identify novel epithelial differentiation patterns in the uterus and support the idea that disruption of cellular programming in early development can influence cancer risk later in life.
