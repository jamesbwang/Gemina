  The effects of the high-dose ionizing radiation used in radiotherapy have been thoroughly demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. However , the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation ( LDIR) such as computed tomography-guided biopsies and X-ray fluoroscopy on skin cells remain controversial. This study investigated the molecular effects of LDIR on the human primary keratinocytes ( HPKs) and U937 cells , monocytes-like cell lines. These cells were exposed to 0.1 Gray ( Gy) X-ray as LDIR. The modulation of transcription was assessed using a cDNA array , and the protein expression after LDIR exposure was investigated using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification ( iTRAQ) proteomic analysis at 24 hours. These effects were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. The direct effects of LDIR on the U937 cells and HPKs and the bystander effects of irradiated HPKs on U937 cells were also investigated. LDIR downregulated c-Myc in both U937 cells and HPKs , and upregulated the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression in U937 cells along with the activation of TGFÎ² and protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A). In HPKs , LDIR downregulated the mTOR signaling with repression of S6 and 4EBP1 activation. Similar changes were observed as bystander effects of LDIR. Our findings suggest that LDIR inhibits protein synthesis and induces the cytokines activation associated with inflammation<symptom> via direct and bystander effects , which might recapitulate the effects of LDIR in inflammated skin structures.
