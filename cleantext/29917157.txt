  Toxocariasis is a widespread zoonosis caused by canine and feline Toxocara spp.. In Venezuela , seroepidemiological studies in Aragua State have been carried out only in preschool children. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies and identify clinical symptoms and risk factors of Toxocara spp. infection in school children in two municipalities of Aragua State of Venezuela. A cross-sectional field study with 259 children between 6 and 12 y of age was conducted in six schools in Aragua State. Immunoglobulin G antibodies against Toxocara spp. by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , haematology and eosinophil counts were detected in blood. Participating families filled in a questionnaire and studied children were clinically evaluated by paediatricians. Anti-Toxocara spp. antibodies were detected in 14.3 % of children. The seroprevalence in the schools studied ranged from 4.4 % to 24.1 %. Statistical associations with eosinophilia , decreased visual acuity , eyestrain , headache<symptom> and paleness were found. Significant risk factors were contact with dogs , playing with dogs and playing with soil. The identification of risk factors and their association with infection suggest that the infection is a problem in the municipalities studied , so screening for toxocariasis in school children should be recommended.
