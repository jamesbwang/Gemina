  Nickel-rich layered cathode materials have the potential to enable cheaper and higher energy lithium ion batteries. However , these materials face major challenges ( e.g. , surface reconstruction , microcracking , potential oxygen evolution) that can hinder the safety and cycle life of lithium ion batteries. Many studies of nickel-rich materials have focused on ways to improve performance. Understanding the effects of temperature and cycling on the chemical and structural transformations is essential to assess the performance and suitability of these materials for practical battery applications. The present study is focused on the spectroscopic analysis of surface changes within a strong performing LiNi
