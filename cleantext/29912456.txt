  In the development of an attract-and-kill approach for the management of harlequin bug ( HB) , Murgantia histrionica ( Hahn) , we evaluated attraction and retention of HB by pheromone-baited traps in the field. In release-recapture and on-farm experiments , traps with collard plants with lures-containing HB aggregation pheromone ( murgantiol = 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol) arrested and retained more HB than traps with either plant or lure. In order to avoid unwanted vicinity effects ( increased feeding injury to neighboring crop plants due to halo or spillover effects) , we also investigated two methods of retaining HB that were attracted to traps: a systemic toxicant ( neonicotinoid applied to the trap plant as a drench) and a contact toxicant ( long-lasting insecticidal netting ( LLIN) with incorporated pyrethroid). More HB adults and more HB-feeding injury were observed on collard plants in the vicinity of lures compared with those neighboring lures in combination with a systemic toxicant. This difference indicates that improvements to trap retention acted to mitigate spillover effects , thereby avoiding unwanted vicinity effects. We also conducted laboratory assays in order to estimate the length of exposure to LLIN necessary to knock down HB adults and nymphs , calculating a knockdown time ( KDT50) of 78.3 , 2.6 , and 2.1 s for females , males , and nymphs , respectively.
