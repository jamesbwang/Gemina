  Locally recurrent , previously irradiated primary head and neck tumors have historically been associated with poor outcomes. Stereotactic body radiation therapy has emerged as a feasible and promising treatment option for tumor recurrence , particularly in nonsurgical candidates. This study aimed to assess the associated outcomes of stereotactic body radiation therapy used in this setting. Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 25 patients treated with CyberKnife for unresectable , recurrent head and neck cancer in a previously irradiated field. The primary end points evaluated were rates of survival , tumor control , and treatment-related toxicities. Median survival of the study population was 7.5 months ( range , 1.5-47.0 months). Median survival of the 20 ( 80 %) patients who were treated with curative purpose was 8.3 months. One-year overall survival rate for the entire population was 32 %. The respective 1-year and 2-year survival rates for the curative subcohort were 40 % and 20 % , respectively. Local and locoregional failure occurred in 8 ( 32 %) and 7 ( 28 %) patients , respectively. Low severe acute ( 4 %) and late ( 6 %) treatment-related toxicity rates were observed. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a viable treatment option for patients with unresectable , recurrent head and neck cancer. Significant tumor control rates are achievable with minimal severe toxicity. Although perhaps associated with patient selection and a heterogeneous sample , overall survival of stereotactic body radiation therapy outcomes appears unfavorable.
