  Red-light running ( RLR) has been identified as one of the prominent contributing factors involved in signalized intersection crashes. In order to reduce RLR crashes , primarily , a better understanding of RLR behavior and crashes is needed. In this study , three RLR crash types were extracted from the general estimates system ( GES) , including go-straight ( GS) RLR vehicle colliding with go-straight non-RLR vehicle , go-straight RLR vehicle colliding with left-turn ( LT) non-RLR vehicle , and left-turn RLR vehicle colliding with go-straight non-RLR vehicle. Then , crash features within each crash type scenario were compared , and risk analyses of GS RLR and LT RLR were also conducted. The results indicated that for the GS RLR driver , the speed limit displayed the highest effects on the percentages of GS RLR collision scenarios. For the LT RLR driver , the number of lanes displayed the highest effects on the percentages of LT RLR collision scenarios. Additionally , the drivers who were older than 50 years , distracted , and had a limited view were more likely to be involved in LT RLR accidents. Furthermore , the speeding drivers were more likely to be involved in GS RLR accidents. These findings could give a comprehensive understanding of RLR crash features and propensities for each RLR crash type.
