  Neurofibromatosis type I ( NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by peripheral nervous system tumors ( PNSTs) , including plexiform neurofibromas ( pNFs) that cause nerve<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> , deformity , pain damage to adjacent structures , and can undergo malignant transformation. There are no effective therapies to prevent or treat pNFs. Drug discovery efforts are slowed by the ` benign ' nature of the Schwann cells that are the progenitor cells of pNF. In this work we characterize a set of pNF-derived cell lines at the genomic level ( via SNP Arrays , RNAseq , and Whole Exome- Sequencing) , and carry out dose response-based quantitative high-throughput screening ( qHTS) with a collection of 1,912 oncology-focused compounds in a 1536-well microplate cell proliferation assays. Through the characterization and screening of NF1
