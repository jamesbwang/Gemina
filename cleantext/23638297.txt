  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pterostilbene ( PTS) ( trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4 '- hydroxystilbene) and resveratrol ( RSV) ( trans-3,5,4 ' trihydroxystilbene) applied at different doses for the treatment of streptozotocin- ( STZ-) induced diabetic rats. At the end of the 5-week experimental period , the right gastrocnemius muscles of the rats were examined biomechanically , while the left ones were examined histologically. In addition , blood glucose , serum insulin , and malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels were analyzed in blood samples taken from the rats. The skeletal muscle isometric contraction forces , which showed a decrease with diabetes , were observed to increase with antioxidant applications. Blood glucose , serum insulin , and MDA levels in diabetic rats approached normal levels after applying PTS. When the electron microscopic images of the rat skeletal muscle were examined , those in the combination treatment group were observed to show a better enhancement in the skeletal muscle morphological structure compared to the other diabetic and treatment groups. According to the findings , we suggest that these antioxidant treatments might have good therapeutic nutraceutical potential for some muscle diseases that coexist with diabetes. These treatments should be comprehensively investigated in the future.
