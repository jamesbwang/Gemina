  Smoking is more prevalent in persons living with HIV<pathogen> than the general population and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Some have suggested that based on current knowledge of harms and benefits , it may be feasible to advise smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit to switch to electronic cigarettes ( ECs) as a less harmful alternative. We conducted 25 qualitative interviews with HIV-positive current or former smokers to explore perceived barriers to smoking cessation and perceptions of ECs. A high level of nicotine dependence , smoking as a form of stress management , motivational factors ( including lack of readiness , low self-efficacy , ambivalence toward quitting) , and having a social network of smokers were identified as cessation barriers. Low knowledge of ECs and uncertainty about EC safety and efficacy were barriers to EC uptake. However , current smokers indicated a willingness to try ECs. This study provides evidence that HIV-positive smokers face significant individual and environmental barriers to cessation. ECs may have potential as a harm reduction strategy in this population; however , there is a significant need for education regarding use and relative safety.
