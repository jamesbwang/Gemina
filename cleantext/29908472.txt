  Only 60 % of depressed patients respond sufficiently to treatment , so there is a dire need for novel approaches to improve treatment effects. Cognitive Bias Modification ( CBM) may be an effective and easily implemented computerized add-on to treatment-as-usual. Therefore , we investigated the effects of a positivity-attention training and a positivity-approach training compared to control trainings. In a blinded randomized-controlled design , 139 depressed inpatients received either the CBM Attention Dot-Probe Training ( DPT) or the CBM Approach-Avoidance Training ( AAT) , next to treatment as usual. N = 121 finished all four training sessions. Both trainings had an active and a control condition. In both active conditions , patients were trained to preferentially process generally positive pictures over neutral pictures. Depressive symptom severity was assessed before and after CBM , and positivity bias was measured at the start and end of each session. Clinician-rated depressive symptom severity decreased more in patients who received the active condition of the DPT or the AAT compared to patients in the control conditions. Significant change in positivity bias was found for the DPT ( not the AAT) , but did not mediate the effect of the training on depressive symptoms. The results suggest that both types of CBM ( i.e. , DPT and AAT) may provide a fitting add-on treatment option for clinical depression<symptom> The working mechanisms and optimal dose of CBM trainings , plus their possible combination , should be examined in more detail.
