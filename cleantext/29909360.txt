  Nitrogen-transforming microorganisms play pivotal roles for the microbial nitrogen-cycling network in the anammox granular system. However , little is known about the effects of inorganic carbon ( IC) stresses on the assemblage patterns and functional profiles of abundant and rare taxa. Herein , the community assemblage and functional traits of abundant and rare sub-communities were investigated. Results revealed that insufficient IC had adverse influences on the process performance , while anammox activity could be recovered by IC addition. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that abundant and rare sub-communities present divergent co-occurrence patterns. Additionally , environmental filtering had different influences on the ecological adaptability of bacterial sub-communities. Furthermore , qPCR results illustrated that NH
