  The encapsulation by spray drying of maize anthocyanins was evaluated using two types of wall materials , consisting of normal and waxy maize starch , which were esterified with octenyl succinic anhydride. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that SWMS possessed a completely amorphous , while SNMS had a crystalline structure. SNMS showed peaks at 2
