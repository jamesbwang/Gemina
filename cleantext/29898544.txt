  We compared the effectiveness of explanatory variables representing different environmental spheres on the risk of alien plant invasion. Using boosted regression trees ( BRT) , we assessed the effect of anthropogenic factors , soil variables , land relief , climate and landscape structure on neophyte richness ( NR) ( alien plant species introduced after the 15th century). Data on NR were derived from a 2 Ã— 2 km grid covering a total area of 31,200 km
