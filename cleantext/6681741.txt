  People talk not only to others but also to themselves. The self talk we engage in may be overt or covert , and is associated with a variety of higher mental functions , including reasoning , problem solving , planning and plan execution , attention , and motivation. When talking to herself , a speaker takes devices from her mother tongue , originally designed for interpersonal communication , and employs them to communicate with herself. But what could it even mean to communicate with oneself? To answer that question , we need a theory of communication that explains how the same linguistic devices may be used to communicate with others and oneself. On the received view , which defines communication as information exchange , self talk appears to be an anomaly , for it is hard to see the point of exchanging information with oneself. However , if communication is analysed as a way of negotiating commitments between speaker and hearer , then communication may be useful even when speaker and hearer coincide. Thus a commitment-based approach allows us to make sense of self talk as well as social talk.
