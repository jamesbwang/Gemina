  Hyaluronic acid ( HA) dermal fillers are commonly used in cosmetic dermatology. Due to differences in their physical characteristics , HA fillers demonstrate different sensitivity to degradation by hyaluronidase ( Hase) because of HA concentration and differences in cross-linking. Similarly , there are differences in the activity of Hase products depending on source and concentration. The primary objective was to demonstrate the differences in potency and activity of 5 Hase products when used to degrade 5 different HA products using a human in vivo model. The study subject was a healthy , consenting adult woman scheduled to undergo abdominoplasty. Skin<symptom> to be excised was injected with 0.1 to 0.2 mL of each filler ( 10 injections each) leaving a visible lump. Immediately afterward , the HA lumps were injected with 4 IU of each Hase product every 2 minutes until the HA lumps were no longer visible or palpable. This procedure was repeated after 30 days. Injected tissues were excised after abdominoplasty for histological analysis. The 5 Hase products displayed a wide range of doses and times required to completely degrade the 5 HA products ranging from < 2 to > 16 minutes. Cosmetic practitioners should familiarize themselves with differences in HA and Hase products.
