  This experimental study analyzes the relationship between the dimensionality of turbulence and the upscale or downscale nature of its energy transfers. We do so by forcing low-Rm magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in a confined channel , while precisely controlling its dimensionality by means of an externally applied magnetic field. We first identify a specific length scale l ( over ^) _ ( ‚ä•) ^ ( c) that separates smaller 3D structures from larger quasi-2D ones. We then show that an inverse energy cascade of horizontal kinetic energy along horizontal scales is always observable at large scales , and that it extends well into the region of 3D structures. At the same time , a direct energy cascade confined to the smallest and strongly 3D scales is observed. These dynamics therefore appear not to be simply determined by the dimensionality of individual scales , nor by the forcing scale , unlike in other studies. In fact , our findings suggest that the relationship between kinematics and dynamics is not universal and may strongly depend on the forcing and dissipating mechanisms at play.
