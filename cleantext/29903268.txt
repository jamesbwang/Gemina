  To investigate milk consumption and effects on dietary calcium among Chinese middle and old aged residents of 15 provinces in 2015. Data used in present study was derived from the China Health and Nutrition Survey ( CHNS). The participants were aged 45 years old and over , and had completed personal dietary information data during the 10 th wave 's survey. The subjects were divided into the following groups according to milk consumption per day , 0 ( no milk drinking) , 1-99 , 100-199 , 200-299 and ≥ 300 g/d. Dietary calcium from different milk consumption groups was compared , and the percentage of achieving the Chinese dietary reference intake on calcium was calculated. Chi-square test and non-parametric test were used to compare the differences of count data and quantitative data , respectively. The result showed that , in 2015 , the percentage of milk consumption and daily intake of milkin P95 was 14. 7 % and 158. 9 g/d , respectively; the average daily intake of calcium of 0 ( no milk drinking) , 1-99 , 100-199 , 200-299 and ≥ 300 g/d groups were 283. 8 , 376. 8 , 467. 5 , 547. 2 and 785. 8 mg/d , respectively; the percentage of achieving the Chinese dietary reference intake on calcium was 4. 3 % in milk consumers and 1. 3 % in non-milk consumers. The milk intake of Chinese middle and old aged residents still remains in quite low level , and dietary calcium increased with milk consumption.
