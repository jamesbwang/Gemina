  To describe the methodology of constructing a three-dimensional ( 3D) printed model of the glenohumeral joint , to serve as an interventional phantom for fluoroscopy-guided shoulder arthrography training. The osseous structures , intra-articular space and skin surface of the shoulder were digitally extracted as separate 3D meshes from a normal CT arthrogram of the shoulder , using commercially available software. The osseous structures were 3D-printed in gypsum , a fluoroscopically radiopaque mineral , using binder jet technology. The joint capsule was 3D printed with rubber-like TangoPlus material , using PolyJet technology. The capsule was secured to the humeral head and glenoid to create a sealed intra-articular space. A polyamide mold of the skin was printed using selective laser sintering. The joint was stabilized inside the mold , and the surrounding soft tissues were cast in silicone of varying densities. Fluoroscopically-guided shoulder arthrography was performed using anterior , posterior , and rotator interval approaches. CT arthrographic imaging of the phantom was also performed. A life-size phantom of the glenohumeral joint was constructed. The radiopaque osseous structures replicated in-vivo osseous corticomedullary differentiation , with dense cortical bone and less dense medullary cancellous bone. The glenoid labrum was successfully integrated into the printed capsule , and visualized on CT arthrography. The phantom was repeatedly used to perform shoulder arthrography using all three conventional approaches , and simulated the in vivo challenges of needle guidance. 3D printing of a complex capsule , such as the glenohumeral joint , is possible with this technique. Such a model can serve as a valuable training tool.
