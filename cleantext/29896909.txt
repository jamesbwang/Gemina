  Hypoxia causes vasodilatation of coronary arteries which protects the heart from ischaemic damage through mechanisms including the generation of hydrogen sulphide ( H Porcine left circumflex coronary arteries were prepared as cleaned segments and with PVAT intact , myocardium intact or both PVAT and myocardium intact , and contractility investigated using isometric tension recording. Immunoblotting was used to measure levels of H All three H PVAT augments hypoxic relaxation of coronary arteries through a mechanism involving H
