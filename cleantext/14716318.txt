  Early 21st-century droughts in Europe have been broadly regarded as exceptionally severe , substantially affecting a wide range of socio-economic sectors. These extreme events were linked mainly to increases in temperature and record-breaking heatwaves that have been influencing Europe since 2000 , in combination with a lack of precipitation during the summer months. Drought propagated through all respective compartments of the hydrological cycle , involving low runoff and prolonged soil moisture deficits. What if these recent droughts are not as extreme as previously thought? Using reconstructed droughts over the last 250 years , we show that although the 2003 and 2015 droughts may be regarded as the most extreme droughts driven by precipitation deficits during the vegetation period , their spatial extent and severity at a long-term European scale are less uncommon. This conclusion is evident in our concurrent investigation of three major drought types- meteorological ( precipitation) , agricultural ( soil moisture) and hydrological ( grid-scale runoff) droughts. Additionally , unprecedented drying trends for soil moisture and corresponding increases in the frequency of agricultural droughts are also observed , reflecting the recurring periods of high temperatures. Since intense and extended meteorological droughts may reemerge in the future , our study highlights concerns regarding the impacts of such extreme events when combined with persistent decrease in European soil moisture.
