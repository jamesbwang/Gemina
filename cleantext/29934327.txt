  Inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 ( CDK4/6) were originally designed to block proliferation and cell cycle progression of cancer cells in which the activity of these kinases is dysregulated. CDK4/6 inhibitors have already been FDA approved for the treatment of estrogen receptor ( ER)- positive breast cancer and are being tested in numerous other cancer types. However , several recent studies have identified novel effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors on tumor growth , most notably an indirect effect resulting from the activation of immune surveillance. This Perspective discusses these recent observations , including the effects that CDK4/6 inhibitors may have on immune cells themselves. It is likely that CDK4/6 inhibitors will have a broader impact than their expected induction of cell cycle arrest in the treatment of human cancers.
