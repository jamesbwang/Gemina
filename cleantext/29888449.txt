  The synthesis and in vitro cytotoxic characteristics of new imidazo ( 1,2-b) pyrazole-7-carboxamides were investigated. Following a hit-to-lead optimization exploiting 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 human breast , 4T1 mammary gland , and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia<disease> cancer cell lines , a 67-membered library was constructed and the structure-activity relationship ( SAR) was determined. Seven synthesized analogues exhibited sub-micromolar activities , from which compound 63 exerted the most significant potency with a remarkable HL-60 sensitivity ( IC
