  Nematodes of the genus Physaloptera are common in rodents , including in species of the Family Cricetidae. There is no report of nematodes parasitizing Cerradomys goytaca , so this is the first one. For this study , 16 rodents were captured in the city of Quissam√£ , in the northern of Rio de Janeiro State. The rodents were necropsied , and the digestive tracts were analyzed under a stereomicroscope for the presence of parasites. The nematodes were fixed in hot AFA , clarified in Amann 's lactophenol , mounted on slides with coverslip , and observed under an optical microscope. Part of the nematodes was fixed in Karnovisk solution for scanning electron microscopy. Nematodes presented evident sexual dimorphism. Oral openings had two semicircular pseudolabia , with an external lateral tooth and an internal lateral tripartite tooth on each pseudolabium. Males had a ventral spiral curved posterior ends with the presence of a caudal alae with 21 papillae with four pairs of pedunculated papillae arranged laterally , three pre-cloacal sessile papillae arranged rectilinearly and five pairs of post-cloacal sessile papillae. There was also a pair of phasmids located between the fourth and fifth pairs of post-cloacal papillae as well as two spicules that were sub-equal in size but of distinct shapes. The females have five uterine branches. The morphological and morphometrical analyses of the nematodes collected from C. goytaca were compared with other species , and the results indicated that this is a new species of the genus Physaloptera , Physaloptera goytaca n. sp..
