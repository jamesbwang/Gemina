  Transarterial chemoembolization is the standard treatment for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. However , in Japan , not a few patients with intermediate-stage HCC undergo liver transplantation ( LT). The present study investigated characteristics and outcomes of LT for intermediate-stage HCC. Between February 1999 and November 2016 , a total of 226 patients underwent LT for HCC at our institute. Among these , 56 patients showed intermediate-stage HCC ( 24.8 %). We examined overall survival and recurrence rate after LT according to our extended criteria ( maximum size ≤ 5 cm , number ≤ 10 , des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin ≤ 400 mAU/mL) and pretreatment. One- , 3- , and 5-year overall survival and recurrence rates of LT for intermediate-stage HCC were 88/64/58 % and 22/34/44 % , respectively. One- , 3- , and 5-year overall survival and recurrence rates in patients within (
