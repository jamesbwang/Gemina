  Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) affects structural connectivity , triggering the reorganization of structural-functional circuits in a manner that remains poorly understood. We focus here on brain network reorganization in relation to postural control deficits after TBI. We enrolled young participants who had suffered moderate to severe TBI , comparing them to young , typically developing control participants. TBI patients ( but not controls) recruited prefrontal regions to interact with two separated networks: ( 1) a subcortical network , including parts of the motor network , basal ganglia , cerebellum , hippocampus , amygdala , posterior cingulate gyrus , and precuneus; and ( 2) a task-positive network , involving regions of the dorsal attention system , together with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions. We also found that the increased prefrontal connectivity in TBI patients was correlated with some postural control indices , such as the amount of body sway , whereby patients with worse balance<symptom> increased their connectivity in frontal regions more strongly. The increased prefrontal connectivity found in TBI patients may provide the structural scaffolding for stronger cognitive control of certain behavioral functions , consistent with the observations that various motor tasks are performed less automatically following TBI and that more cognitive control is associated with such actions.
