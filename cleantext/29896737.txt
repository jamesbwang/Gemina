  To construct an eukaryotic expression plasmid for AY358935 gene and explore its function. cDNA of the AY358935 gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pGEM-Teasy. The pGEM-T-AY was validated by sequencing and served as a template for the construction of eukaryotic expression plasmid. The pcDNA3.1-AY recombinant was validated by double enzyme digestion and used for transient transfection of M14 cells. Expression of the AY358935 protein and proliferation of the M14 cells were determined respectively by Western blotting and 3- ( 4,5)- dimethylthiahiazo (- z-y1) -3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide ( MTT) colorimetry. The amplicons of RT-PCR were confirmed to have similar size with the cDNA fragment of the AY358935 gene as well as cloned region of pcDNA3.1-AY. The cloned region of pGEM-T-AY was sequenced to be identical with cDNA sequence of the AY358935 gene. M14 cells were transfected by the AY358935 gene , pcDNA3 .1 and liposomes , respectively. After 48 h , expression of the AY358935 protein in M14 cells transfected with the AY358935 gene was significantly higher than other two groups. They also had a significantly higher absorbance value ( A = 0.74) than other two groups ( A = 0.39 and 0.46 , respectively; P < 0.05). An eukaryotic expression plasmid of the AY358935 gene was successfully constructed. Product of the AY358935 gene may promote the proliferation of M14 cells.
