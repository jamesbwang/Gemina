  The irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) is the most common chronic gastrointestinal disorder referred to gastroenterologists. One of the most common manifestations of IBS is bloating. Abdominal bloating is defined as subjective sensation of abdominal distension associated with girth increment. Therefore it is described in the Rome IV criteria as bloating/abdominal distension. Bloating symptoms are reported by 10 % -30 % of the general population and it was rated as the most bothersome symptom by 60 % of IBS patients; the lack of specificity of this complaint prevented bloating to be included between the diagnostic criteria for IBS. Indeed , bloating may be reported also in healthy people or in other functional conditions. This papers looks to the evolutions of the concepts on bloating according to the Rome working groups from the beginning until now and represents a comprehensive review on prevalence and pathogenesis of bloating.
