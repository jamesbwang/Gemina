  Infestation of cats with the Australian paralysis tick , Ixodes<pathogen> holocyclus<pathogen> continues to be a threat because of the paralysis that can result from attachment of just a single tick. The outcome can be fatal , particularly if tick removal and treatment is not initiated soon after the onset of paralysis. However , there are no published studies to guide veterinarians and owners on preventive measures. A study was therefore initiated to determine the efficacy of a systemically-acting , spot-on formulation of fluralaner ( Bravecto Healthy domestic cats , short or long-hair , immunized against holocyclotoxin , were randomly allocated to two groups of 10 cats per group , to receive either a single topically applied fluralaner treatment or no treatment. Fluralaner treatments were administered on Day 0 at a dose rate of 40 mg/kg. All cats were infested with 10 adult unfed female I.<pathogen> holocyclus<pathogen> on Day -1 and on Days 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 70 and 84. Ticks were assessed at 24 and 48 h after fluralaner treatment and 24 , 48 and 72 hours after each subsequent re-infestation. Ticks were counted but not removed at the 24- and 48-h post-challenge assessments and were removed following the 72-h counts. The efficacy of fluralaner spot-on against an existing I.<pathogen> holocyclus<pathogen> infestation was 100 % at 48 h post treatment. Following re-infestations , efficacy remained at 100 % at the 72-h assessments for all challenges from Day 14 to Day 84. Differences between mean live tick counts on treated versus control cats were significant at all time points from the first post-treatment assessment ( t-test: t A single treatment of fluralaner spot-on was well tolerated and provided 100 % efficacy against I.<pathogen> holocyclus<pathogen> ticks for at least 84 days. Fluralaner spot-on can be a valuable tool to prevent tick infestation in cats , and to control the risk of I. holocyclus-induced paralysis.
