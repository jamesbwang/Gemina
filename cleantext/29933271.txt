  Desflurane and propofol are cardioprotective , but relative efficacy is unclear. The aim was to compare myocardial protection of single , simultaneous , and serial administration of desflurane and propofol. Sixty New Zealand White rabbits and 65 isolated Sprague Dawley rat hearts randomly received desflurane , propofol , simultaneous desflurane and propofol , or sequential desflurane then propofol. Rabbits were subdivided to receive either ischemia-reperfusion with temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending artery or a time-matched , nonischemic perfusion protocol , whereas rat hearts were perfused in a Langendorff model with global ischemia-reperfusion. End points were hemodynamic , functional recovery , and mitochondrial uptake of H-2-deoxy-D-glucose as an indicator of mitochondrial permeability transition. In rabbits , there were minimal increases in preload-recruitable stroke-work with propofol ( P < .001) , desflurane ( P < .001) , and desflurane-and-propofol ( P < .001) groups , but no evidence of increases with pentobarbitone ( P = .576) and desflurane-then-propofol ( P = .374). In terms of end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship , there was no evidence of increase compared to nonischemic controls with desflurane-then-propofol ( P = .364) , a small but significant increase with desflurane ( P < .001) , and larger increases with pentobarbitone ( P < .001) , propofol ( P < .001) , and desflurane-and-propofol ( P < .001). In rat hearts , there was no statistically significant difference in mitochondrial H-activity between propofol and desflurane-and-propofol ( 165 ± 51 × 10 vs 154 ± 51 × 10 g · mL · min/μmol; P = .998). Desflurane had lower uptake than propofol ( 65 ± 21 × 10 vs 165 ± 51 × 10 g · mL · min/μmol; P = .039) , but there was no statistically significant difference between desflurane and desflurane-then-propofol ( 65 ± 21 × 10 vs 59 ± 11 × 10 g · mL · min/μmol; P = .999). Propofol and desflurane are cardioprotective , but desflurane is more effective than propofol. The added benefit of desflurane is lost when used simultaneously with propofol.
