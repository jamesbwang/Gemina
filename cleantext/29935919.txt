  Autistic spectrum disorders ( ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders for which genetic components have been well defined. However , specific gene deregulations related to synapse function in the autistic brain have not been as extensively described. Based on a candidate genes approach , we present in this study the expression data of 4 transcripts of interest ( BDNF , CAMK2a , NR-CAM and RIMS1) located at the synapse in two regions of interest in the context of the ASDs; the lobule VI of cerebellum and the Brodmann area 46. We have also genotyped in our cohort the coding single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265 , located in the BDNF gene. After correction for age and sex , whereas no change was observed in the lobule VI between controls and autistic patients , we found a significant increase of BDNF expression level in the BA46 from autistic patients. No significant interaction between the rs6265 genotype and autism was observed for the BDNF expression. However , `` A '' allele carriers are more likely to have increased BDNF levels. Finally , we found a significant positive correlation between BDNF and RIMS1 expression levels. Our data suggest that these two molecules which are involved in cell signalling at the synapse , might have coordinated expressions and , that BDNF regulation in the brain has to be investigated further in the context of ASDs.
