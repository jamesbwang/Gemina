  Acute<symptom> blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) elevation represents a frequent reason of concern for clinicians in everyday clinical practice. The terms `` hypertensive emergencies '' and `` hypertensive urgencies '' may be used in order to better define the so called `` hypertensive crises ''. A hypertensive emergency may be defined as a condition characterized by an acute and severe elevation of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) associated to a new onset or worsening organ damage ( OD). A hypertensive urgency may be defined as a condition characterized by an isolated elevation of BP values without evidence of acute hypertensive OD. This article will review the definition , the prevalence , and the prognostic implications of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies.
