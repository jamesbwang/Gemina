  Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) induces a proviral selective autophagy targeting lipid droplets , termed lipophagy , that stimulates lipid metabolism. Zhang et al. gained mechanistic insight into this process , demonstrating that DENV<pathogen> NS4A/B binds unmodified AUP1 and promotes its translocation from lipid droplets to autophagosomes to drive the induction of lipophagy.
