  Titanium dioxide as a food additive ( E171) has been demonstrated to facilitate growth of chemically induced colorectal tumours in vivo and induce transcriptomic changes suggestive of an immune system impairment and cancer development. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the tumour stimulatory effects of E171 in combination with azoxymethane ( AOM)/ dextran sodium sulphate ( DSS) and compare these results to a recent study performed under the same conditions with E171 only. BALB/c mice underwent exposure to 5 mg/kg
