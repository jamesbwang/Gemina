  To evaluate the clinical significance of supraclavicular lymph node ( SCLN) in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) receiving curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed all 369 locally advanced ESCC patients treated with CCRT between 2000 and 2015 , including 70 patients with SCLN metastasis and 299 patients without SCLN metastasis. For these locally advanced ESCC patients treated with curative CCRT , N0-2 were significantly associated with superior progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) in univariate and multivariable analyses. However , there were no significant differences in PFS and OS between the SCLN metastasis and non-SCLN metastasis groups; a subgroup analysis also revealed there was no significant differences in PFS and OS between patients with and without SCLN metastasis either in the N0-2 or in the N3 subgroup analysis. Our study suggests that SCLN metastasis is not a prognostic factor in locally advanced ESCC patients receiving curative CCRT , and that SCLNs should be considered to be regional LNs and treated with curative intent.
