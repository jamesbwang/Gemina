  Silicon nanowire field effect transistor ( FET) sensors have demonstrated their ability for rapid and label-free detection of proteins , nucleotide sequences , and viruses at ultralow concentrations with the potential to be a transformative diagnostic technology. Their nanoscale size gives them their ultralow detection ability but also makes their fabrication challenging with large sensor-to-sensor variations , thus limiting their commercial applications. In this work , a combined approach of nanofabrication , device simulation , materials , and electrical characterization is applied toward identifying and improving fabrication steps that induce sensor-to-sensor variations. An enhanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible process for fabricating silicon nanowire FET sensors on 8 in. silicon-on-insulator wafers is demonstrated. The fabricated nanowire ( 30 nm width) FETs with solution gates have a Nernst limit subthreshold swing ( SS) of 60 ± 1 mV/decade with ∼ 1.7 % variations , whereas literature values for SS are ≥ 80 mV/decade with larger ( > 10 times) variations. Also , their threshold voltage variations are significantly ( ∼ 3 times) reduced , compared to literature values. Furthermore , these improved FETs have significantly reduced drain current hysteresis ( ∼ 0.6 mV) and enhanced on-current to off-current ratios ( ∼ 10
