  In this review we provide a broad overview on the use of nanotechnology for the fight against breast cancer ( BC). Nowadays , detection , diagnosis , treatment , and prevention may be possible thanks to the application of nanotechnology to clinical practice. Taking into consideration the different forms of BC and the disease status , nanomaterials can be designed to meet the most forefront objectives of modern therapy and diagnosis. We have analyzed in detail three main groups of nanomaterial applications for BC treatment and diagnosis. We have identified several types of drugs successfully conjugated with nanomaterials. We have analyzed the main important imaging techniques and all nanomaterials used to help the non-invasive , early detection of the lesions<symptom>. Moreover , we have examined theranostic nanomaterials as unique tools , combining imaging , detection , and therapy for BC. This state of the art review provides a useful guide depicting how nanotechnology can be used to overcome the current barriers in BC clinical practice , and how it will shape the future scenario of treatments , prevention , and diagnosis , revolutionizing the current approaches , e.g. , reducing the suffering related to chemotherapy.
