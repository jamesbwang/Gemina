  After the Germanwings accident , the French Safety Investigation Authority ( BEA) recommended that the World Health Organization ( WHO) and European Community ( EC) develop clear rules for the duty of notification process. Aeromedical practitioners ( AMEs<pathogen>) face a dilemma when considering the duty of notification and conflicts between pilot privacy and public and third-party safety. When balancing accountability , knowledge of the duty of notification process , legislation and the clarification of a doctor & rsquo; s own set of values should be assessed a priori. Relatively little is known of the magnitude of this problem in aviation safety. To address this , the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB) database was searched to identify fatal accidents during 2015 in the United States in which a deceased pilot used a prescribed medication or had a disease that potentially reduced pilot performance and was not reported to the AME. Altogether , 202 finalized accident reports with toxicology were available from ( the year) 2015. In 5 % ( 10/202) of these reports , the pilot had either a medication or a disease not reported to an AME which according to the accident investigation was causal to the fatal accident. In addition , the various approaches to duty of notification in aviation in New Zealand , Finland and Norway are discussed. The process of notification of authorities without a pilot & rsquo; s express permission needs to be carried out by using a guidance protocol that works within legislation and professional responsibilities to address the pilot and the public , as well as the healthcare provider. Professional guidance defining this duty of notification is urgently needed.
