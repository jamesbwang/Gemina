  The aim of the study was to develop the most optimal variant for placing the reinforcing element of a fiberglass splint with the mobility of the anterior teeth on the basis of a parallelometric study of the diagnostic models of the jaws depending on the type of occlusion and the degree of bone resorption. For the most optimal variant of the placement of the reinforcing element of the adhesive splint with orthognathic bite and deep incisal overlap , the front slope of the model was selected with the transfer of the reinforcing element of the adhesive splint onto the lingual surface. With direct , prognathic and progenic bite and bone resorption up to 1/4 height ( according to retrography data) , the back slope of the model was selected with the placement of the reinforcing element of the adhesive splint on the vestibular surface of the lower jaw. The disadvantage of locating the reinforcing element on the lingual surface when the incisors were crowded was that after the application of the splint and inter-proximal adaptation , the change in the position of the teeth was not corrected. On the contrary , when applying an adhesive splint on the vestibular surface with the help of restoration , it was possible to completely restore the original position of the teeth and fix it for a long time.
