  We examine correlated electron and doubly charged ion momentum spectra from strong field double ionization of neon employing intense elliptically polarized laser pulses. An ellipticity-dependent asymmetry of correlated electron and ion momentum distributions has been observed. Using a 3D semiclassical model , we demonstrate that our observations reflect the subcycle dynamics of the recollision process. Our Letter reveals a general physical picture for recollision impact double ionization with elliptical polarization and demonstrates the possibility of ultrafast control of the recollision dynamics.
