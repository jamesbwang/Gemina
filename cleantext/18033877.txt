  The phase diagram of colloidal suspensions of electrically charged nanosheets , such as clays , despite their many industrial uses , is not yet understood either experimentally or theoretically. When the nanosheet diameter is very large ( ∼ 100 nm to 1 µm) , it is quite challenging to distinguish the lamellar liquid-crystalline phase from a nematic phase with strong stacking local order , often called `` columnar '' nematic. We show here that newly upgraded small-angle X-ray scattering beamlines at synchrotron radiation facilities provide high-resolution measurements which allow us to identify both phases unambiguously , provided that single domains can be obtained. We investigated dilute aqueous suspensions of synthetic Sb
