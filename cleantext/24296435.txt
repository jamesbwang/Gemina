  Quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR) is a standard method to measure gene expression in function exploring. Accurate and reproducible data of qRT-PCR requires appropriate reference genes , which are stably expressed under different experimental conditions. However , no housekeeping genes were validated as internal controls for qRT-PCR in Sinonovacula constricta<pathogen>. In this study , we classified the transcriptome data of two tissues for Vibrio<pathogen> infection and Cd
