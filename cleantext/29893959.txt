  An in situ straining holder capable of tensile deformation and high-angle tilt for electron tomography was developed for polymeric materials. The holder has a dedicated sample cartridge , on which a variety of polymeric materials , such as microtomed thin sections of bulk specimens and solvent-cast thin films , can be mounted. Fine , stable control of the deformation process with nanoscale magnification was achieved. The holder allows large tensile deformation ( ≃ 800 μm) with a large field of view ( 800 × 200 μm before the deformation) , and a high tilt angle ( ± 75 °) during in situ observations. With the large tensile deformation , the strain on the specimen can be as large as 26 , at least one order of magnitude larger than the holder 's predecessor. We expect that meso- and microscopic insights into the dynamic mechanical deformation and fracture processes of polymeric materials can be obtained by combining the holder with a transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy filter. The filter allows zero-loss imaging to improve the resolution and image contrast for thick specimens. We used this technique to study the deformation process in a silica nanoparticle-filled isoprene rubber.
