  Prescription medications are increasingly used among adults in the United States and many have a potential for causing depression<symptom> To characterize use of prescription medications with depression<symptom> as a potential adverse effect and to assess associations between their use and concurrent depression<symptom> Five 2-year cycles ( 2005-2006 through 2013-2014) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , representative cross-sectional surveys of US adults aged 18 years or older , were analyzed for use of medications with depression<symptom> as a potential adverse effect. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between use of these medications and concurrent depression<symptom> Analyses were performed among adults overall , excluding antidepressant users , and among adults treated with antidepressants and with hypertension. Prescription medications with depression<symptom> as a potential adverse effect ( listed in Micromedex). Prevalence of any use and concurrent use of medications with a potential to cause depression<symptom> and prevalence of depression<symptom> ( PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10). The study included 26192 adults ( mean age , 46.2 years ( 95 % CI , 45.6-46.7); women , 51.1 %) and 7.6 % ( 95 % CI , 7.1 % -8.2 %) reported depression<symptom> The overall estimated prevalence of use of medications with depression<symptom> as an adverse effect was 37.2 % , increasing from 35.0 % ( 95 % CI , 32.2 % -37.9 %) in the cycle years 2005 and 2006 to 38.4 % ( 95 % CI , 36.5 % -40.3 %) in 2013 and 2014 ( P for trend = .03). An estimated 6.9 % ( 95 % CI , 6.2 % -7.6 %) reported use of 3 or more concurrent medications with a potential for depression<symptom> as an adverse effect in 2005 and 2006 and 9.5 % ( 95 % CI , 8.4 % -10.7 %) reported such use in 2013 and 2014 ( P for trend = .001). In adjusted analyses excluding users of antidepressants , the number of medications used with depression<symptom> as possible adverse effects was associated with increased prevalence of concurrent depression<symptom> The estimated prevalence of depression<symptom> was 15 % for those reporting use of 3 or more medications with depression<symptom> as an adverse effect vs 4.7 % for those not using such medications ( difference , 10.7 % ( 95 % CI , 7.2 % -14.1 %)). These patterns persisted in analyses restricted to adults treated with antidepressants , among hypertensive adults , and after excluding users of any psychotropic medication. In this cross-sectional survey study , use of prescription medications that have depression<symptom> as a potential adverse effect was common. Use of multiple medications was associated with greater likelihood of concurrent
