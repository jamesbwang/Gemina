  Tumor stroma remodeling is a key feature of malignant tumors and can promote cancer progression. Laminins are major constituents of basement membranes<symptom> that physically separate the epithelium from the underlying stroma. By employing mouse models expressing high and low levels of the laminin α1 chain ( LMα1) , we highlighted its implication in a tumor-stroma crosstalk , thus leading to increased colon tumor incidence , angiogenesis and tumor growth. The underlying mechanism involves attraction of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts by LMα1 , VEGFA expression triggered by the complex integrin α2β1-CXCR4 and binding of VEGFA to LM-111 , which in turn promotes angiogenesis , tumor cell survival and proliferation. A gene signature comprising LAMA1 , ITGB1 , ITGA2 , CXCR4 and VEGFA has negative predictive value in colon cancer. Together , we have identified VEGFA , CXCR4 and α2β1 integrin downstream of LMα1 in colon cancer as of bad prognostic value for patient survival. This information opens novel opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.
