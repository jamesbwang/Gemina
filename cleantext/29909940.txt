The study took place over a period of 8 weeks. Eighty-five mothers were interviewed. Seventy-two percent of the newborn babies left the delivery room during the first 2h of life. For 67 % , the duration of skin-to-skin contact was less than 1h. For 49 % , the main reason was the performance of routine care. The mothers were satisfied with the care provided in the delivery room. Too many healthy newborn babies are separated from their mothers during the first 2h of life , mainly for routine care. Skin-to-skin contact must be part of the physiological reception of newborn babies in the delivery room. The medical staff and parents must be informed of this aspect and its beneficial effects. It is necessary to reconsider the organization of practices to propose a management system that promotes the establishment of a strong mother-child bond.
