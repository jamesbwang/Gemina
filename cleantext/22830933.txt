  This review summarizes recent advances in the development of nanoparticles ( NPs) for efficient photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , particularly the development and application of various NPs based on organic and inorganic materials. PubMed database was used for literature search with the terms including NP , nanomedicine , PDT , photosensitizer ( PSs) , and drug delivery. For successful PDT , it is essential to deliver PSs to target disease sites. A number of NPs have been developed and tested as the carriers for both imaging and therapy , an approach termed `` nanomedicine ''. Many studies of NP carriers showed increased water solubility and stability of PSs for
