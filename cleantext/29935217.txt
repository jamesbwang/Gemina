  The manipulation of single cells and whole tissues has been possible since the early 70 's , when semi-automatic injectors were developed. Since then , microinjection has been used to introduce an ever-expanding range of colloids of up to 1000 nm in size into living cells. Besides injecting nucleic acids to study transfection mechanisms , numerous cellular pathways have been unraveled through the introduction of recombinant proteins and blocking antibodies. The injection of nanoparticles has also become popular in recent years to investigate toxicity mechanisms and intracellular transport , and to conceive semi-synthetic cells containing artificial organelles. This article reviews colloidal systems such as proteins , nucleic acids and nanoparticles that have been injected into cells for different research aims , and discusses the scientific advances achieved through them. The colloids ' intracellular processing and ultimate fate are also examined from a drug delivery perspective with an emphasis on the differences observed for endocytosed versus microinjected material.
