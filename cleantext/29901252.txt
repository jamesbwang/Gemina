  Polymeric carbon nitride ( PCN) photosensitizers are proposed replacements for their inorganic counterparts in solar-to-fuel conversion via photoelectrochemical water splitting. However , intense charge recombination , primarily because of surface defects , limits the use of PCN in PEC systems. Now , photoanodes are designed by coating PCN films onto highly conductive yttrium-doped zinc oxide ( Y: ZnO) nanorods ( NRs) serving as charge collectors. The generation of charge carriers can therefore be promoted by this type II alignment. The charge collectors would be kept nearby for charge separation and transport to be used in the interfacial redox reactions. The photocurrent density of the polymer electrode is improved to 0.4 mA cm
