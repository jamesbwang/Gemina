  The newly discovered macrolactone , mucorolactone , along with eight known compounds , was isolated from an ethyl acetate extract of the insect-borne fungus Mucor<pathogen> sp.. All structures were elucidated using 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectroscopic experiments. Relative and absolute configurations of the original skeleton of mucorolactone was deduced from NOESY experiments , from the
