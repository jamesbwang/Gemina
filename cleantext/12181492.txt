  Although lizards are often described as having robust neurogenic abilities , only a handful of the more than 6300 species have been explored. Here , we provide the first evidence of homeostatic neurogenesis in the leopard gecko ( Eublepharis macularius). We focused our study on the medial cortex , homologue of the mammalian hippocampal formation. Using immunostaining , we identified proliferating pools of neural stem/progenitor cells within the sulcus septomedialis , the pseudostratified ventricular zone adjacent to the medial cortex. Consistent with their identification as radial glia , these cells expressed SOX2 , glial fibrillary acidic protein , and Vimentin , and demonstrated a radial morphology. Using a 5-bromo-2 '- deoxyuridine cell tracking strategy , we determined that neuroblast migration from the ventricular zone to the medial cortex takes ~ 30-days , and that newly generated neuronal cells survived for at least 140-days. We also found that cell proliferation within the medial cortex was not significantly altered following rupture of the tail spinal cord ( as a result of the naturally evolved process of caudal autotomy). We conclude that the sulcus septomedialis of the leopard gecko demonstrates all the hallmarks of a neurogenic niche.
