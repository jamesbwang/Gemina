  Many hospitals in China experience large volumes of emergency department ( ED) radiology patients , thereby lengthening the wait times for non-emergency radiology patients. We examine whether an emergency reservation policy which deals with stochastic arrivals of ED patients can shorten wait times , and what effect it has on patient and hospital related metrics. In this study , operations research models are used to develop an emergency reservation policy. First , we construct a discrete event simulation ( DES) model based on the process of patients served by one computed tomography ( CT) scanner at West China Hospital ( WCH). Next , a newsvendor model is built to compute the daily reservation quantity for emergency patients. Based on the appointment scheduling rule and daily emergency reservation policies , the effects of the proposed policy on daily examination quantity , patient wait times , and equipment utilization are explicitly modeled. Finally , we evaluate the impact of different reservation policies on these system performance measures. Our analysis indicates that reserving capacity for emergency patients greatly shortens the delay for non-emergency patients with an average 43.9 % reduction in total wait times. The pre-model utilization and average post-model utilization are 99.3 % and 98.5 % , respectively. In addition , the comparison of different reservation policies shows that there is no significant difference between any two policies in terms of patients ' wait times. Reserving proper capacity for emergency patients not only positively affects the patients ' delay times , but also affects various aspects of the hospital. Our goal is to design a simple and implementable emergency reservation policy. DES proves to be an effective tool for studying the effects of proposed scenarios to optimize capacity allocation in radiology management.
