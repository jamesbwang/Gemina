  Repeated corticosterone ( CORT) injections reliably produce depressive-like behavior in rodents. Our previous study showed that sleep parameters were altered in rats after daily injections of CORT for 7 days , and sleep disturbances appeared to be correlated with depressive-like behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate time-dependent correlations between changes in sleep parameters and the formation of depressive-like behavior in rats after more prolonged treatment with CORT. Rats received daily injections of CORT ( 40 mg/kg , s.c.) for 7 , 14 , or 21 days. Electroencephalographic recordings were performed to study sleep parameters. The sucrose preference test and forced swim test were performed to evaluate depressive-like behavior. Western blot was used to detect protein levels. Our results showed that 7-day CORT treatment resulted in no significant depressive-like behavior or changes in rapid-eye-movement ( REM) sleep. However , the duration of non-REM sleep significantly decreased , tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) levels significantly increased , and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) expression decreased in the locus coeruleus. Treatment with CORT for 14 and 21 days increased depressive-like behavior , enhanced REM sleep , shortened REM sleep latency , decreased TH and GR levels , and increased the levels of the chaperone FK506 binding protein 51 ( FKBP51) in the locus coeruleus. These results indicate that the development of depression<symptom> after chronic CORT treatment may be related to the formation of sleep disorders. Abnormalities of REM sleep may be a characteristic of sleep in models of depression<symptom> that is induced by chronic CORT administration in rats. The noradrenergic system and GR pathway in the locus coeruleus may be involved in the formation of depression<symptom> concomitant with sleep disturbances.
