  The high chemical shift separation at 9.4 T allows for selective saturation of proton pools in exchange with water protons. For the first time , highly selective and comprehensive chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) experiments were performed in the human brain at 9.4 T. This work provides insight into CEST signals in the human brain in comparison with existing animal studies , as well as with CEST effects in vivo at lower field strengths. A novel snapshot-CEST method for human brain scans at 9.4 T was optimized and employed for highly-spectrally-resolved ( 95 offsets) CEST measurements in healthy subjects and one brain tumor patient. Reproducibility and stability between scans was verified in grey and white matter after B At a saturation power of B High spectral resolution chemical exchange saturation transfer at 9.4 T allows deeper insights into the Z-spectrum structure of the human brain , and provides many different contrasts showing different correlations in healthy tissue and in tumor-affected areas of the brain , generating hypotheses for future investigations of in-vivo-CEST at UHF.
