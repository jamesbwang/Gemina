  Epidemiological and experimental observations tend to prove that environment , lifestyle or nutritional challenges influence heart functions together with genetic factors. Furthermore , when occurring during sensitive windows of heart development , these environmental challenges can induce an ` altered programming ' of heart development and shape the future heart disease risk. In the etiology of heart diseases driven by environmental challenges , epigenetics has been highlighted as an underlying mechanism , constituting a bridge between environment and heart health. In particular , micro-RNAs which are involved in each step of heart development and functions seem to play a crucial role in the unfavorable programming of heart diseases. This review describes the latest advances in micro-RNA research in heart diseases driven by early exposure to challenges and discusses the use of micro-RNAs as potential targets in the reversal of the pathophysiology.
