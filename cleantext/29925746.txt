  At present , the quantitation of the mycelial weight of the industrially important non-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> , which is used for manufacturing koji , is performed by quantitating N-acetylglucosamine. However , since N-acetylglucosamine is a cell wall component , the extraction procedure is costly and tedious , and its quantitative performance is poor. Here , we report a novel method for the quantitation of A.<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> mycelial weight. The amount of glycosylceramide significantly correlated with both the mycelial weight of A.<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> and the amount of N-acetylglucosamine , an established index of the mycelial weight of A.<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> in koji. This new method is simple and efficient and can be used in the brewing and food industries to determine the mycelial weight of
