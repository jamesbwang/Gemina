  Present study reports the characterization results of settled dust particles in different indoor micro-environments of an academic institution in India. Field emission scanning electron microscope analysis of indoor dust revealed the presence of mineral particles , fly ash , and soot particles of different morphologies. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis of indoor dust indicated that crystal particles are comprised of elements such as C , O , Na , Mg , Al , Si , S , Cl , K , Ca , Fe , and Ti. These elements accounted for more than 99 % of the samples. The average content of O ( 42.7 %) and C ( 18.9 %) in the dust particles was found to be higher than their natural abundances.
