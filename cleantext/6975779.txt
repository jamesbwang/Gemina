  The folate and methionine cycles are crucial for biosynthesis of lipids , nucleotides and proteins , and production of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM). 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) represents a key regulatory connection between these cycles , generating 5-methyltetrahydrofolate for initiation of the methionine cycle , and undergoing allosteric inhibition by its end product SAM. Our 2.5 Ã… resolution crystal structure of human MTHFR reveals a unique architecture , appending the well-conserved catalytic TIM-barrel to a eukaryote-only SAM-binding domain. The latter domain of novel fold provides the predominant interface for MTHFR homo-dimerization , positioning the N-terminal serine-rich phosphorylation region near the C-terminal SAM-binding domain. This explains how MTHFR phosphorylation , identified on 11 N-terminal residues ( 16 in total) , increases sensitivity to SAM binding and inhibition. Finally , we demonstrate that the 25-amino-acid inter-domain linker enables conformational plasticity and propose it to be a key mediator of SAM regulation. Together , these results provide insight into the molecular regulation of MTHFR.
