  The purpose of the present study was to determine the association of unhealthy dietary food items with cardiometabolic risk factors with and without sociodemographic factors. This cross-sectional study used data available to the public from the National Health and Nutrition Survey ( NHANES) 2009-2010 where unhealthy food consumption was based on responses to the Dietary Screener Questionnaire ( unique to this NHANES cycle) , and cardiometabolic risk factors were based on laboratory results , anthropometric measures , interview and examination questions for 2045 adults aged 20-69 and belonging to four racial/ethnic groups: 473 Mexican Americans ( MA); 267 Other Hispanics ( OH); 389 , non-Hispanic Blacks ( NHB) and 916 non-Hispanic Whites ( NHW) ( characterised by NHANES). A higher percent of MA , followed by OH and NHB , consumed soft drinks as compared to NHW. Consumption of fried potatoes was over 75 % across groups and was associated with higher odds dyslipidaemia ( high non-HDL cholesterol) in the reduced model: OR = 1.38 ( 1.10 , 1.73) , P = 0.009 and full model: OR = 1.50 ( 1.15 , 1.96) , P = 0.005. All unhealthy foods measured were consumed more often by males as compared to females. Dyslipidaemia was associated with fried potato consumption and marginally with processed meats. Dietary interventions , tailored to specific populations , are needed to determine if substituting healthy foods in place of unhealthy ones will improve cardiometabolic outcomes.
