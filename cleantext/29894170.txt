  We analyze the magnetic properties of three mononuclear Co ( II) coordination complexes using quantum chemical complete active space self-consistent field and N-electron valence perturbation theory approaches. The complexes are characterized by a distorted tetrahedral geometry in which the central ion is doubly chelated by the icosahedral ligands derived from 1,2- ( HS)
