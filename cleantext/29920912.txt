  To develop core outcome sets ( COS) for studies evaluating interventions for ( 1) prevention and ( 2) treatment of postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH) , and recommendations on how to report the COS.. A two-round Delphi survey and face-to-face meeting. Healthcare professionals and women 's representatives. Outcomes were identified from systematic reviews of PPH studies and stakeholder consultation. Participants scored each outcome in the Delphi on a Likert scale between 1 ( not important) and 9 ( critically important). Results were discussed at the face-to-face meeting to agree the final COS.. Consensus at the meeting was defined as â‰¥ 70 % of participants scoring the outcome as critically important ( 7-9). Lectures , discussion and voting were used to agree how to report COS outcomes. Outcomes from systematic reviews and consultations. Both Delphi rounds were completed by 152/205 ( 74 %) participants for prevention and 143/197 ( 73 %) for treatment. For prevention of PPH , nine core outcomes were selected: blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , shock<symptom> , maternal death , use of additional uterotonics , blood transfusion , transfer for higher level of care , women 's sense of wellbeing , acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention , breastfeeding , and adverse effects. For treatment of PPH , 12 core outcomes were selected: blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , shock<symptom> , coagulopathy , hysterectomy , organ dysfunction , maternal death , blood transfusion , use of additional haemostatic intervention , transfer for higher level of care , women 's sense of wellbeing , acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention , breastfeeding , and adverse effects. Recommendations were developed on how to report these outcomes where possible. These COS will help standardise outcome reporting in PPH trials. Core outcome sets for PPH: nine core outcomes for PPH prevention and 12 core outcomes for PPH treatment.
