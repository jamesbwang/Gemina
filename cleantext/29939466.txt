  A molecularly defined chiral boxmi iron alkyl complex catalyzes the hydroboration of various functionalized ketones and provides the corresponding chiral halohydrines , oxaheterocycles ( oxiranes , oxetanes , tetrahydrofurans , and dioxanes) and amino alcohols with excellent enantioselectivities ( up to > 99) and conversion efficiencies at low catalyst loadings ( as low as 0.5 mol %). Turnover frequencies of greater than 40000 h
