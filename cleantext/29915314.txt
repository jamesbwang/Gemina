  To further investigate the relationship between lung cancer and hedgehog interacting protein ( HHIP) polymorphisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) patients , we conducted a case-control study in a Chinese Han population. Six HHIP SNPs with minor allele frequencies > 5 % ( rs1489758 , rs1489759 , rs10519717 , rs13131837 , rs1492820 , and rs7689420) were analyzed in 1,017 COPD patients ( 767 males and 246 females) and 430 non-COPD patients. Using logistic regression analysis , we found that rs7689420 was significantly associated with lung cancer in COPD patients in the Chinese Han population ( P < 0.001). The recessive allele of rs7689420 was associated with the occurrence of lung cancer in all COPD patients ( odds ratios ( OR) of 0.609 and 0.424 for the CT and TT genotypes , respectively) as well as in serious COPD patients ( OR of 0.403 and 0.305 for CT and TT , respectively). Additionally , rs1489759 and rs3131837 were associated with lung cancer in various genetic models. rs1489758 , rs1489759 , and rs10519717 were also associated with lung cancer in serious COPD patients. However , none of the SNPs were significantly associated with lung cancer in mild COPD patients or healthy subjects. Therefore , the HHIP SNPs of COPD patients likely play a role in lung cancer pathology in the Chinese Han population.
