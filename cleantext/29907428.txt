  Operating room ( OR) procedures represent one quarter of hospitalizations , yet OR-related stays account for nearly 50 % of hospital costs. Understanding trends in inpatient parotidectomy , associated charges , and key outcomes including length of stay is imperative in the era of evolving health reform. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS) was queried for patients who underwent inpatient parotidectomy ( ICD9-CM procedure code 26.31 and 26.32) between 2001 and 2014. Patient demographics , co-morbidities , hospital characteristics and outcomes including length of stay ( LOS) and hospital charges were assessed. A total of 66,914 parotidectomies were performed in the inpatient setting between 2001 and 2014. The volume of inpatient parotidectomy decreased steadily by 48 % over the study period ( 7375 procedures in 2001 to 3530 procedures in 2014). Average LOS increased from 1.8 days in 2001 to 2.5 days in 2014. Total charges increased from $ 17,072 in 2001 to $ 55,929 in 2014. In 2014 , the majority of inpatient parotidectomies were performed in a teaching hospital ( 87 %) and among patients who were older than 65 years ( 48.1 %). In 2001 , only 35.4 % of patients who underwent parotidectomy were older than age 65 , and relatively fewer surgeries were performed at teaching hospitals ( 63.1 %). Inpatient parotidectomy in the United States has evolved over the past fourteen years. Notable trends include a nearly 50 % reduction of inpatient surgery , doubling in LOS , tripling of hospital charges and predominance of elderly patients with malignant disease. These results provide insight into inpatient parotid<symptom> lesion<symptom> management.
