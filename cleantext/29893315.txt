  Loss of cell differentiation and increased cellular proliferative activity during malignant transformation leads to alteration of biochemical content of cells. This is reflected in the fluorescence profile of tissues. ( 1) To evaluate the efficacy of autofluorescence in clinical detection of oral cancer. ( 2) To correlate it with the rate of cell proliferation by analyzing argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions ( AgNORs). Autofluorescence status was studied by devising a visual enhancement system using ultraviolet light , followed by an incisional biopsy. Tissue was sent for fluorescence spectroscopy and analyzed by routine histopathology and AgNORs staining. The obtained results were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test ( P < 0.05) and one-way analysis of variance. A statistically significant correlation was seen between autofluorescence ( AF) and clinical diagnosis as well as autofluorescence and histopathological diagnosis. The importance of autofluorescence as a screening tool was further supported by a statistically significant correlation between autofluorescence status and cell proliferative rate. A preliminary effort was attempted at delving into this relatively unexplored arena of optical biopsy systems through this study. They can be used to monitor treatment and potential complications , surgical margins , detection of nodal metastasis , etc.. They can provide a diagnosis noninvasively , in situ , and in real time.
