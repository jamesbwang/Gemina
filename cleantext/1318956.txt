  In the clinical setting , analgesic tolerance is a primary driver of diminished pain control and opioid dose escalations. Integral to this process are primary afferent sensory neurons , the first-order components of nociceptive sensation. Here , we characterize the factors modulating morphine action and tolerance in mouse small diameter dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) neurons. We demonstrate that acute morphine inactivates tetrodotoxin-resistant ( TTX-R) Na
