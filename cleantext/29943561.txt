  This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between family history of gastrointestinal ( GI) cancers and incidence of any GI cancer in the Korean population. Between January 2015 and July 2016 , 711 GI cancer patients and 849 controls in 16 hospitals in Korea were enrolled. Personal medical histories , life styles , and family history of GI cancers were collected via questionnaire. There was a significant difference in the incidence of family history of GI cancer between GI cancer patients and controls ( p = 0.002). Patients with family history of GI cancer tended to be diagnosed as GI cancer at younger age than those without family history ( p = 0.016). The family members of GI cancer patients who were diagnosed before 50 years of age were more frequently diagnosed as GI cancer before the age of 50 years ( p = 0.017). After adjusting for major confounding factors , age ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) 1.065 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI); 1.053-1.076) , male gender ( AOR 2.270 , 95 % CI; 1.618-3.184) , smoking ( AOR 1.570 , 95 % CI; 1.130-2.182) , and sibling 's history of GI cancer ( AOR 1.973 , 95 % CI; 1.246-3.126) remained independently associated with GI cancers. GI cancer patients tended to have a first relative with a history of concordant GI cancer. Personal factors ( old age and male) and lifestyle ( smoking) contribute to the development of GI cancer , independently. Individuals with high risk for GI cancers may be advised to undergo screening at an earlier age.
