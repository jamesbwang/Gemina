  Displaying tobacco products at point-of-sale ( PoS) has become an important marketing strategy for the tobacco industry. This study was designed to ( 1) examine how support for a PoS cigarette display ban changed among Dutch smokers between 2010 and 2015 and ( 2) identify the variables that predict support among smokers for a PoS cigarette display ban. Longitudinal data from six annual survey waves ( 2010-2015) from the International Tobacco Control ( ITC) Netherlands Survey were analyzed. The sample consisted of between 1279 and 1800 smokers per year. Smokers were asked whether they supported a complete ban on displays of cigarettes inside shops and stores. Support for a PoS cigarette display ban increased from 28.9 % in 2010 to 42.5 % in 2015 ( OR = 1.40 , p < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that support for a PoS display ban of cigarettes was more likely among smokers who had more knowledge about the health risks of smoking ( OR = 3.97 , p < 0.001) , believed smoking-related health risks to be severe ( OR = 1.39 , p < 0.001) , had a more positive attitude towards quitting smoking ( OR = 1.44 , p = 0.006) , reported stronger social norms to quit smoking ( OR = 1.29 , p = 0.035) , had a higher self-efficacy for quitting smoking ( OR = 1.31 , p = 0.001) , and had stronger intentions to quit smoking ( OR = 1.23 , p = 0.006). This paper showed that support for a PoS display ban of cigarettes increased among smokers in the Netherlands over the years. To further increase support , educational campaigns about the dangers of smoking , and campaigns that encourage quitting may be needed.
