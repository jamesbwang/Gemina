A survey to measure the impact of a mindfulness workshops on nurse managers ' perception of professional quality of life , burnout , and perceived wellness. There were significant changes in the scores on the compassion satisfaction ( T-1 mean 3.9 , T-2 mean 4.5 , p = .002) and burnout subscales ( T-1 mean 3.4 , T-2 mean 2.8 , p = .016) of the Professional Quality of Life scale , and on personal burnout ( T-1 mean 4.2 , T-2 mean 3.8 , p = .023) and work-related burnout ( T-1 mean 4.0 , T-2 mean 3.5 , p = .029) on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scale , following the mindfulness intervention. The 3-month follow-up scores on compassion satisfaction were higher but not statistically significant ( p = .810). Scores on the burnout scales , while lower than the preintervention levels , were higher at the 3-month follow-up than immediately following the intervention. These findings suggest that mindfulness practices need to be reinforced. Without continuous reinforcement , it may become a self-care practice moved to the bottom of the list of things to be done among the activities of a busy day.
