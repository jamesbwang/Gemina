  High mother-to-child ( MTC) transmission rate of HIV<pathogen> might contribute to the increased pandemic rate. The aim of this study was to identify the knowledge , attitude and practices of health personnel working in maternities in the prevention of MTC transmission of HIV<pathogen>. This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out from 20th February to 30th April , 2017. All health personnel working in the maternity wards were included in this study. The variables recorded included their age , grade , experience ( number of year of practice) , gender , educational level , health structure and the training in prevention of MTC transmission of HIV<pathogen>. Analyses were done using SPSS 21.0. The Pearson Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test and logistic regression were used for comparison. The level of significance was P < 0.05. A total of 140 health personnel were recruited. Knowledge was insufficient amongst 73 of them ( 52.1 %). The factors significantly associated with sufficient knowledge were midwifery qualification ( aOR 9.01 , 95 % CI 1.82-48.60) and training in prevention of MTC transmission of HIV<pathogen> ( aOR 2.23 , 95 % CI 1.02-4.81). Regarding attitudes , it was negative in 85 practitioners ( 60.7 %). Only those aged â‰¥ 33 years were significantly associated with a positive attitude ( aOR 2.34 , 95 % CI 1.14-4.23). As concerns practices , only 32 practitioners ( 22.9 %) had good practices. Only midwives were associated with good practices ( aOR 3.23 , 95 % CI 1.21-9.95). Insufficient knowledge , attitude and practices in the prevention of MTC transmission of HIV<pathogen> were observed among the majority of health personnel in the region. This lack of knowledge in prevention can therefore contribute to the rise of the mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV<pathogen>. To reduce this rate , more health personnel should be trained , especially midwives , in the prevention of MTC transmission of HIV<pathogen>. Moreover , deliveries of all women living with HIV<pathogen> should be conducted or at least supervised by trained midwives , especially those of at least 33 years of age.
