  People who inject drugs ( PWID) have high rates of Hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection. Little is known about the rates of diagnosis and treatment for HCV<pathogen> among PWID. Therefore , this study aims to characterize the cascade of care in Vancouver , Canada to improve HCV<pathogen> treatment access and delivery for PWID. Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of PWID in Vancouver , Canada between December 2005 and May 2015. We identified the progression of participants through five steps in the cascade of care: ( 1) chronic HCV<pathogen>; ( 2) linkage to HCV<pathogen> care; ( 3) liver disease assessment; ( 4) initiation of treatment; and ( 5) completion of treatment. Predictors of undergoing liver disease assessment for HCV<pathogen> treatment were identified using a multivariable extended Cox regression model. Among 1571 participants with chronic HCV<pathogen> , 1359 ( 86.5 %) had ever been linked to care , 1257 ( 80.0 %) had undergone liver disease assessment , 163 ( 10.4 %) had ever started HCV<pathogen> treatment , and 71 ( 4.5 %) had ever completed treatment. In multivariable analyses , HIV<pathogen> seropositivity , use of methadone maintenance therapy , and hospitalization in the past 6 months were independently and positively associated with undergoing liver disease assessment ( all P < 0.001) , while daily heroin injection was independently and negatively associated with undergoing liver disease assessment ( P < 0.001). Among this cohort of PWID , few had been started on or completed treatment for HCV<pathogen>. Our findings highlight the need to improve the prescribing of HCV<pathogen> treatment among PWID with active substance use.
