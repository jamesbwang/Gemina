  Multiple myeloma has a continued need for more effective and durable therapies. B cell maturation antigen ( BCMA) , a plasma cell surface antigen and member of the tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) receptor superfamily , is an attractive target for immunotherapy of multiple myeloma due to its high prevalence on malignant plasma cells. The current work details the pre-clinical evaluation of BCMA expression and development of a chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) targeting this antigen using a fully human single chain variable fragment ( scFv). We demonstrate that BCMA is prevalently , but variably expressed by all MM with expression on 25-100 % of malignant plasma cells. Extensive Immunohistochemical analysis of normal tissue expression using commercially available polyclonal antibodies demonstrated expression within B-lineage cells across a number of tissues as expected. Based upon the highly restricted expression of BCMA within normal tissues , we generated a set of novel , fully human scFv binding domains to BCMA by screening a na√Øve B-cell derived phage display library.
