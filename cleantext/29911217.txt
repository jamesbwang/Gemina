  The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ( DMI) in ferromagnetic/heavy metal ultra-thin film structures has attracted a lot of attention thanks to its capability to stabilize NÃ©el-type domain walls ( DWs) and magnetic skyrmions for the realization of non-volatile memory and logic devices. In this study , we demonstrate that magnetic properties in perpendicularly magnetized Ta/Pt/Co/ MgO/Pt heterostructures , such as magnetization and DMI , can be significantly influenced by the MgO thickness. To avoid the excessive oxidation of Co , an ultrathin Mg layer is inserted to improve the quality of the Co-MgO interface. By using field-driven domain wall expansion in the creep regime , we find that non-monotonic tendencies of the DMI field appear when changing the thickness of MgO. With the insertion of a monatomic Mg layer , the strength of the DMI could reach a high level and saturate. We conjecture that the efficient control of the DMI is a result of subtle changes of both Pt/Co and Co/MgO interfaces , which provides a method to optimize the design of ultra-thin structures achieving skyrmion electronics.
