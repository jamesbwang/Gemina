  Metal on metal hip resurfacing ( MoM-HR) is an alternative to total hip arthroplasty in young and active patients. The purpose was to determine the survivorship of MoM-HR procedures performed in patients aged 45 years and younger assessing patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs) at minimum 5-year follow-up. All 217 patients equal to or younger than 45 years of age at the time of surgical intervention presenting to our center with MoM-HR between May 2002 and May 2011 were prospectively followed. Baseline demographic data , preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements , and validated PROMs were obtained ( Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index , and University of California , Los Angeles Activity Score). Survivorship was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis , and risk factors for failure were identified using multivariate regression analysis. The overall survivorship excluding septic failures was 94.6 % and 93.8 % at 5 and 10 years , respectively. Aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was the most common mode of failure ( 11/20 cases). Gender , head size , and acetabular abduction angle had no significant effect on survivorship. Significant improvements in PROMs were seen for Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index , and University of California , Los Angeles Activity Scale ( P < .001). This study indicates that MoM-HR is a suitable option for young individuals , as demonstrated through improved functional scores and low revision rates. The survivorship of HR in the younger than 45 age-group was similar to that of total hip arthroplasty , as well as HR in older patients. Given the proposed benefits of HR , this procedure may be viewed as a viable option in patients aged younger than 45 years.
