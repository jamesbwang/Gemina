  A 3-year extension of two Phase III parent studies of intravenous ( IV) bapineuzumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease dementia ( apolipoprotein ( APOE) ɛ4 carriers and noncarriers) is summarized. The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the long-term safety , tolerability , and maintenance of efficacy of bapineuzumab. A multicenter study in patients who had participated in double-blind placebo-controlled parent studies. Patients enrolled in the extension study were assigned to receive IV infusions of bapineuzumab ( 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) every 13 weeks until termination but were blinded to whether they had received bapineuzumab or placebo in the parent studies. A total of 1,462 ( 688 were APOEɛ4 carriers and 774 were noncarriers) patients were enrolled. Extension-onset adverse events occurred in > 81 % of the patients in each dose group. Fall , urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> , agitation , and ARIA-E occurred in ≥ 10 % of participants. The incidence proportion of ARIA-E was higher among carriers and noncarriers who received bapineuzumab for the first time in the extension study ( 11.8 % and 5.4 % , respectively) versus those who were previously exposed in the parent studies ( 5.1 % and 1.3 % , respectively). After 6 to 12 months exposure to bapineuzumab IV in the extension study , similar deterioration of cognition and function occurred with no significant differences between the dose groups. Infusion of bapineuzumab 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg every 13 weeks for up to 3 years was generally well tolerated , with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that in previous studies.
