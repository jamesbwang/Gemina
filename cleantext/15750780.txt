  In order to study the in situ effects of the agricultural landscape and exposure to pesticides on honey bee health , sixteen honey bee colonies were placed in four different agricultural landscapes. Those landscapes were three agricultural areas with varying levels of agricultural intensity ( AG areas) and one non-agricultural area ( NAG area). Colonies were monitored for different pathogen prevalence and pesticide residues over a period of one year. RT-qPCR was used to study the prevalence of seven different honey bee viruses as well as
