  Butyric acid ( BA) is produced by periodontopathic bacterial pathogens and contributes to periodontal<disease> disease<disease> ( PD) induction. Moreover , PD has been associated with detrimental effects which subsequently may lead to systemic<disease> disease<disease> ( SD) development affecting certain organs. Surprisingly , the potential systemic manifestations and organ-localized effects of BA have never been elucidated. Here , we simulated BA-based oral infection among young ( 20-week-old) rats and isolated blood cytosol to determine BA effects on stress network-related signals ( total heme , hydrogen peroxide ( H
