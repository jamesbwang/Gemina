  To investigate the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) with human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infection and the presence of cytological changes in the cervix in a cohort of sexually active women in Greece. Cervical cytology testing and the molecular typing of HPV<pathogen> and other STIs were performed for 345 sexually active women aged between 18 and 45 years ( mean 33.2 Â± 7.2 years) visiting a gynaecology clinic for routine cervical screening. The association of HPV<pathogen> and STI detection with cytological findings was investigated. HPV<pathogen> was detected in 61 women ( 17.7 %) and STIs in 82 ( 23.8 %). Ureaplasma<pathogen> spp was the most frequently detected pathogen , which was found in 63 ( 18.2 %) women , followed by Mycoplasma<pathogen> spp ( 21 women , 25.6 %) and Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> ( five women , 6.1 %). HPV<pathogen> positivity only ( with no co-presence of STI) was associated with an abnormal cytology ( odds ratio 6.9 , p < 0.001) , while women who were negative for both HPV<pathogen> and STIs had a higher probability of a normal cytology ( odds ratio 0.36 , p < 0.01). Sixteen out of the 63 ( 25.4 %) women who tested positive for Ureaplasma<pathogen> spp , harboured a high-risk HPV<pathogen> type ( odds ratio 2.3 , p = 0.02). In a population with a high prevalence of Ureaplasma<pathogen> spp , there was an association of this pathogen with high-risk HPV<pathogen> infection , a finding that needs further elucidation.
