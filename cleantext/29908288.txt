  To investigate the pregnancy outcomes of women who were exposed to betahistine during their pregnancies. We identified and evaluated the outcomes of 27 pregnant women who were referred to Terafar ( Teratology Information Service , Izmir , Turkey) for a teratological risk assessment. Of 24 pregnancies with known outcomes , 21 resulted in live births ( including two pairs of twins) whereas two ended with miscarriage and three with elective terminations. Among the 20 live births for whom the malformation details were available , there were 17 normal outcomes , one major and two minor congenital malformations. Despite a number of limitations , this case series may be of value regarding counseling pregnant women with inadvertent betahistine exposure. Further epidemiological studies with larger sample sizes and control groups are necessary to draw more definite conclusions.
