  Adult rat 22-kHz vocalizations are often associated with alarm or distress , whereas a subset of 50-kHz calls is preferentially emitted in response to amphetamine and other rewarding stimuli. Whether any 50-kHz calls reflect anxiety<symptom> is unknown. To determine the effects of anxiogenic drugs on 50-kHz call rate and call subtype profile , in comparison with D-amphetamine. Adult male rats received systemic amphetamine ( 1 mg/kg) three times several days before testing. Ultrasonic vocalizations were then recorded after acute intraperitoneal injection of amphetamine or one of five anxiogenic drugs: yohimbine ( 2.5 mg/kg) , N-methyl-Î²-carboline-3-carboxamide ( FG 7142 , 5 mg/kg) , pentylenetetrazol ( PTZ , 20 mg/kg) , m-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP , 1 mg/kg) , caffeine ( 25 mg/kg) , or vehicle. The duration of immobility was increased by FG 7142 , PTZ , and mCPP; this measure was unchanged by yohimbine and reduced by the locomotor stimulant drugs amphetamine and caffeine. Conversely , the 50-kHz call rate was reduced by FG 7142 , PTZ and mCPP , and increased by caffeine and amphetamine. Overall , the most common 50-kHz call subtypes were flat , trill , step-up , and complex. Consistent with previous reports , amphetamine increased the relative prevalence of trill calls while reducing the relative prevalence of flat calls. Yohimbine and caffeine reduced flat call prevalence , whereas mCPP reduced trill call prevalence. No other shifts in the call profile were observed , and no anxiogenic drug induced 22-kHz calls. Anxiogenic drugs , as a class , did not uniformly alter the 50-kHz call rate or subtype profile. Amphetamine-induced effects on 50-kHz call rate and profile do not reflect
