  Recently , several epidemiologic studies have reported that lithium in drinking water may be associated with lower rates of suicide mortality , lower incidence of dementia , and lower levels of adolescents ' depression<symptom> and aggression at the population level. However , to our knowledge , no study has investigated lithium level in tap water in relation to psychotic experiences in a general population of adolescents. This is the first study to investigate this using a large dataset. Information on psychotic experiences , distress associated with these experiences , and depressive symptoms were collected in 24 public junior high schools in Kochi Prefecture in Japan. Samples were collected from sources that supplied drinking water to schools , and lithium levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The association of lithium levels with psychotic experiences , considering distress as a degree of severity , was examined using an ordinal logistic regression model with schools and depressive symptoms as random effects. In total , 3040 students responded to the self-reporting questionnaire ( response rate: 91.8 %). Lithium levels in tap water were inversely associated with psychotic experiences ( p = 0.021). We concluded that lithium level in tap water was inversely associated with psychotic experiences among a general population of adolescents and may have a preventive effect for such experiences and distress.
