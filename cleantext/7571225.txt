  To examine the effect of intra-operative cell salvage ( ICS) in open radical prostatectomy. In this retrospective cohort study , all patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy for malignancy at our institution between 10/04/2013 and 10/04/2017 were enrolled. Patients were grouped and compared based on whether they received ICS. Primary outcomes were allogeneic transfusion rates , and disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were complications and transfusion-related cost. Fifty-nine men were enrolled; 30 used no blood conservation technique , while 29 employed ICS. There were no significant differences between groups in age , pre- or post-operative haemoglobin , Charlson comorbidity index , operation duration or length of stay. Tumour characteristics were also similar between groups , including pre-operative prostate specific antigen , post-operative Gleason score , T-stage , nodal status and rates of margin positivity. Compared with controls , the ICS group had longer follow up ( 945 ICS reduced transfusion related costs , without affecting allogeneic transfusion rates , tumour recurrence or complication rates. These findings extend the literature supporting ICS in oncological surgery. Prospective randomised studies are needed to confirm the existing level III evidence.
