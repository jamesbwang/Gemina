  Spina bifida , hydrocephalus<symptom> , and similar congenital central nervous system ( CNS) anomalies take origin from embryologic stages weeks before birth , but assessment and follow-up of these patients are important to figure and predict the effects of these anomalies on child 's neurodevelopment. To evaluate of multiple groups of congenital CNS anomalies in the neurodevelopment level. The study was conducted at a research and treatment center for spina bifida patients. The study group included 348 patients with a mean age of 15.4 ( Â± 15.1) months , who had spina bifida aperta , hydrocephalus<symptom> , and microcephaly. Patients with other known intracranial conditions were excluded. The subjects were evaluated into five groups: Group 1 , 88 patients with congenital hydrocephalus<symptom>; Group 2 , 48 patients with congenital hydrocephalus<symptom> and ventriculoperitoneal shunt; Group 3 , 148 patients with microcephaly; Group 4 , 30 patients who were operated for spina bifida aperta; and Group 5 , 39 patients who were operated for spina bifida aperta and also had ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. Denver Developmental Screening Test II was used to assess patients ' neurodevelopment levels. Pearson 's chi-square and Fisher 's exact tests were used for data analysis. Group comparisons were also made in pairs with chi-square test according to Bonferroni corrections. Frequency of abnormal findings was significantly correlated with age ( Total score differences of five groups appeared to be statistically significant according to Pearson 's chi-square test ( Our results suggested that shunt-dependent hydrocephalus<symptom> caused serious neurodevelopmental impairments in patients.
