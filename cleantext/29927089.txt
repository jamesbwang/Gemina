  Lung cancer in the right middle lobe has a poorer prognosis than tumors located in other lobes. The optimal surgical procedure for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) in the right middle lobe has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare survival rates after lobectomy and sublobar resection for early-stage right middle lobe NSCLC. Patients who underwent lobectomy or sublobar resection for stage IA right middle lobe NSCLC tumors ≤ 2 cm between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results database of 18 registries. Cox regression model analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors. The lung cancer-specific survival ( LCSS) and overall survival ( OS) rates between the two groups were compared. A total of 861 patients met our criteria , including 662 ( 76.9 %) patients who underwent lobectomy and 199 ( 23.1 %) patients who underwent sublobar resection. No statistical differences in LCSS and OS rates were identified between the groups of patients with stage IA right middle lobe NSCLC ≤ 1 cm. For tumors > 1-2 cm , lobectomy was associated with more favorable LCSS and OS rates compared to sublobar resection. Lobectomy and sublobar resection deliver a comparable prognosis for patients with stage IA right middle lobe NSCLC ≤ 1 cm. For tumors > 1-2 cm , lobectomy showed better survival rates than sublobar resection.
