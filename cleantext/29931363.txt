  Our study showed the immune response before and after a booster against diphtheria<disease> given within the 20-year interval recommended in Sweden or after a prolonged interval. Of 40 travellers , 10/13 in recommended interval group were immune before booster and 19/27 with a delayed interval. After booster , 13/13 versus 26/27 were protected. One booster was sufficient to achieve immunity regardless of the interval.
