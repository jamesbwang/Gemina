  Adherence to long-term therapy for diabetes remains low. Accurately measuring adherence is the primary step in improving adherence. We translated and validated the Sinhalese version of the Brief Medication Questionnaire ( BMQ) in patients with diabetes. The study was conducted at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka between April and December 2017 , including 165 patients with diabetes. BMQ was translated into Sinhalese using the translation-back translation method. The translated questionnaire validation included evaluation of internal consistency , temporal stability , and performance in regard to a gold standard ( HbA1c). Mean age ( ± SD) was 60.6 ± 11.1 years , and 46.1 % were males. Mean duration of diabetes in the participants was 13.4 ± 7.8 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.3 ± 1.7 % , with poor glycaemic control ( HbA1c ≥ 8.5 %) identified in 41.8 %. Medication adherence measured by the BMQ regimen , belief , and recall screens were 39.4 % , 75.8 % , and 18.8 % , respectively. In the analysis of temporal stability , the overall BMQ and the regimen , belief , and recall screens demonstrated good concordance between test and retest with significant gamma correlation coefficients of The translated questionnaire demonstrated good reliability ( internal consistency) , temporal stability ( test-retest reliability) , and validity when assessed using a gold standard for disease control. Using culturally validated tools to evaluate adherence may help clinicians to identify low adherence and institute corrective measures.
