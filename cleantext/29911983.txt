  We report an electroadhesive approach to controlling friction forces on sliding fingertips which is capable of producing vibrations across an exceedingly broad range of tactile , audible , and ultrasonic frequencies. Vibrations on the skin can be felt directly , and vibrations in the air can be heard emanating from the finger. Additionally , we report evidence from an investigation of the electrical dynamics of the system suggesting that an air gap at the skin/surface interface is primarily responsible for the induced electrostatic attraction underlying the electroadhesion effect. We developed an experimental apparatus capable of recording friction forces up to a frequency of 6 kHz , and used it to characterize two different electroadhesive systems , both of which exhibit flat force magnitude responses throughout the measurement range. These systems use custom electrical hardware to modulate a high frequency current and apply surprisingly low distortion , broadband forces to the skin. Recordings of skin vibrations with a laser Doppler vibrometer demonstrate the tactile capabilities of the system , while recordings of vibrations in the air with a MEMS microphone quantify the audible response and reveal the existence of ultrasonic forces applied to the skin via electronic friction modulation. Implications for surface haptic and audio-haptic displays are briefly discussed.
