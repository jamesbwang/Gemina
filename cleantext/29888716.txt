  This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and pathological features of ocular adnexal lymphoma ( OAL) and the treatment results in an eye care service center in Turkey. The data sets of the patients diagnosed with OAL acquired between January 2008 and January 2016 were collected and analyzed. Fifteen patients were included in our study. The mean age was 55.80 Â± 17.85 years. The age range was 7-85 years. Most of the lesions<symptom> originated from orbital tissue , and histopathological and immunohistochemistry examinations of the lesions<symptom> were consistent with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma in 14 patients and Hodgkin 's lymphoma in 1 patient. The most common subtype of OAL , accounting for 40 % of cases , is extranodular marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT) type. Most of our patients ' histopathological and immunohistochemistry examinations are non-Hodgkin 's type and also involve the orbits. Ocular adnexal lymphomatosis is not a rare disorder and could be treated if there is no systemic involvement at first diagnosis.
