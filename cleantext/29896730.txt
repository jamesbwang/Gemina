  To assess the value of suspension array technology ( SAT) for the genetic diagnosis of non-syndromic hearing loss ( NSHL). Three hundred and sixteen NSHL patients were simultaneously tested by SAT targeting 20 hotspot mutations within 4 common pathologic genes among the Chinese population as well as 9 deafness gene mutation detection kits. The results of the two approaches were validated by Sanger sequencing. Among the 316 patients , 161 were found to carry a mutation by SAT. Sixty five patients have carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations , which yielded a mutation rate of 50.9 % and a diagnostic rate of 21.2 %. Seventy three patients were found to be carriers by the 9 deafness gene mutation detection kits. These included 34 patients carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations , which yielded a mutation rate of 23.1 % and diagnostic rate of 11.4 %. Above results were consistent with those of Sanger sequencing. SAT is a simple , rapid and accurate method featuring high detection rate for common mutations related to deafness among the Chinese population and has provided an effective means of genetic testing for hereditary deafness.
