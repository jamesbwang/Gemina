  Although many cancer patients benefit from physical activity ( PA) , healthcare professionals ( HCP) still do not promote it routinely. Including different groups of HCP , this study aimed to examine how structural barriers are perceived as impeding by HCP for promoting PA to cancer patients , how the perceptions of structural barriers are associated with promoting PA , and how HCP react to information resources. A total of 287 physicians in outpatient care , 242 physicians in inpatient care , and 388 oncology nurses completed our questionnaire ( paper-pencil or online). Participants assessed nine different structural barriers ( on a 4-point Likert Scale) and reported their PA promotion frequency. Further , they could request three different kinds of information resources about PA in oncological settings. Across professional groups , more than 70 % of HCP indicated that they promoted PA to their cancer patients often or routinely. Oncology nurses indicated that they were more impeded in promoting PA by six structural barriers than physicians ( all p < .01). `` Not enough time per patient '' and `` lack of an expert contact person '' were associated with a reduced PA promotion in two professional groups ( all p < .05). Information resources were requested by 69.5 % of the participants: mostly physicians working in outpatient care and especially by those perceiving structural barriers. Although a big proportion of HCP reported that they frequently promoted PA , our findings suggest that HCP still perceive structural barriers. The perception and influence of structural barriers differed between professional groups , pointing to the importance of profession specific guidance.
