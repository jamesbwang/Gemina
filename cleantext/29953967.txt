  To investigate whether statin intervention will improve the long-term prognosis of patients undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgeries. Major database searches for clinical trials enrolling patients undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgeries , including lower limb revascularization , carotid artery surgeries , arteriovenous fistula<disease> , and aortic surgeries , were performed. Subgroup analyses , stratified by surgical types or study types , were employed to obtain statistical results regarding survival , patency rates , amputation , and cardiovascular and stroke events. Odds ratio ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated by Review Manager 5.3. Sensitivity analysis , publication bias and meta-regression were conducted by Stata 14.0. In total , 34 observational studies , 8 prospective cohort studies and 4 randomized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs) were enrolled in the present analysis. It was demonstrated that statin usage improved all-cause mortality in lower limb , carotid , aortic and mixed types of vascular surgery subgroups compared with those in which statins were not used. Additionally , the employment of statins efficiently enhanced the primary and secondary patency rates and significantly decreased the amputation rates in the lower limb revascularization subgroup. Furthermore , for other complications , statin intervention decreased cardiovascular events in mixed types of vascular surgeries and stroke incidence in the carotid surgery subgroup. No significant publication bias was observed. The meta-regression results showed that the morbidity of cardiovascular disease or the use of aspirin might affect the overall estimates in several subgroups. This meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was associated with improved survival rates and patency rates and with reduced cardiovascular or stroke morbidities in patients who underwent non-cardiac vascular surgeries.
