  Bioaccumulation of heavy metals ( Zn , Pb , Cd , and Cu) was determined in the liver , gills , and flesh from benthic and pelagic fish species collected from Lake Geriyo covering two seasons. The levels of the heavy metals varied significantly among fish species and organs. Flesh possessed the lowest concentration of all the metals. Liver was the target organ for Zn , Cu , and Pb accumulations. Cd however exhibited higher concentration in the gills. Fish species showed interspecific variation of metals. These differences were discussed for the contribution of potential factors that affected metals uptake like age , geographical distribution , and species-specific factors. The concentration of metals in fish flesh was accepted by the international legislation limits for Cu , Zn , and Cd; however , Pb transcend in
