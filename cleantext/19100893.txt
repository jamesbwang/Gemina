  The detailed design considerations for the printed RFID-based sensor system is presented in this paper. Starting from material selection and metallization method , this paper discusses types of RFID-based sensors ( single- & dual-tag sensor topologies) , design procedures , and performance evaluation methods for the wireless sensor system. The electrical properties of the paper substrates ( cellulose-based and synthetic papers) and the silver nano-particle-based conductive film are thoroughly characterized for RF applications up to 8 GHz. The reported technology could potentially set the foundation for truly & ldquo; green & rdquo; , low-cost , scalable wireless topologies for autonomous Internet-of-Things ( IoT) , bio-monitoring , and & ldquo; smart skin & rdquo; applications.
