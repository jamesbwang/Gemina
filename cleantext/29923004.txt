  To determine the role of NMDA receptors in the functional regulation of immunocompetent cells , comparative assay was carried out for genes expressed in the mononuclears in peripheral blood of healthy persons under normal conditions and after blockade of these receptors. The genes , whose expression changed in response to blockade of NMDA receptors in mononuclears , encode the products involved in regulation of the major functions of immune cells , such as proliferation ( IL4 , VCAM1 , and CDKN2A) , apoptosis ( BAX , MYC , CDKN2A , HSPB1 , and CADD45A) , activation ( IL4R , IL4 , VCAM1 , and CDKN2A) , and differentiation ( IL4 , VCAM1 , and BAX).
