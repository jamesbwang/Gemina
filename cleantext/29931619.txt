  Photographs have been found to affect a variety of psychological judgments. For example , nonprobative but semantically related photographs may increase beliefs in the truth of general knowledge statements ( Newman , Garry , Bernstein , Kantner , & Lindsay , Psychonomic Bulletin & Review , 19 ( 5) , 969-974 , 2012; Newman et al. , Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning , Memory , and Cognition , 41 ( 5) , 1337-1348 , 2015). Photographs can also create illusions of memory ( Cardwell , Henkel , Garry , Newman , & Foster , Memory & Cognition , 44 ( 6) , 883-896 , 2016; Henkel , Applied Cognitive Psychology , 25 ( 1) , 78-86 , 2011; Henkel & Carbuto , 2008). A candidate mechanism for these effects is that a photograph increases the fluency with which a statement or an event is processed. The present study was conducted to determine whether photos at test can induce illusions of recognition memory and to test the viability of a conceptual fluency explanation of these effects. The results of the present study suggest that photographs enhance the fluency of related words ( Experiment 1) , that false memories can be produced by the mere presence of a related photo on a recognition memory test for words ( Experiments 2 & 3) , and that these effects appear to be limited to conceptually based recognition tests ( Experiments 4 & 5). The results support the notion that photograph-based illusions of memory stem from the ability of related photographs to increase the speed and ease of conceptual processing.
