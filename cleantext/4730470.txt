  The diversity in plant metabolites with improved phytonutrients is essential to achieve global food security and sustainable crop yield. Our study using computational metabolomics genome wide association study ( cmGWAS) reports on a comprehensive profiling of threonine ( Thr) metabolite in rice. Sixteen abiotic stress responsive ( AbSR)- Thr metabolite producing genes ( ThrMPG) , modulate metabolite levels and play a significant role determining both physiological and nutritional importance of rice. These AbSR-ThrMPG were computationally analysed for their protein properties using OryzaCyc through plant metabolic network analyser. A total of 1373 and 1028 SNPs were involved in complex traits and genomic variations. Comparative mapping of AbSR-ThrMPG revealed the chromosomal colinearity with C4 grass species. Further , computational expression pattern of these genes predicted a differential expression profiling in diverse developmental tissues. Protein interaction of protein coding gene sequences revealed that the abiotic stresses ( AbS) are multigenic in nature. In silico expression of AbSR-ThrMPG determined the putative involvement in response to individual AbS. This is the first comprehensive genome wide study reporting on AbSR- ThrMPG analysis in rice. The results of this study provide a pivotal resource for further functional investigation of these key genes in the vital areas of manipulating AbS signaling in rice improvement.
