  The evidence supporting the effects of age on the ability to coordinate a motor and a cognitive task show inconsistent results in children and adolescents , where the Dual-Task Effects ( DTE)- if computed at all- range from either being lower or comparable or higher in younger children than in older children , adolescents and adults. A feasible reason for the variability in such findings is the wide range of cognitive tasks ( and to some extend of motor tasks) used to study Cognitive-Motor Interference ( CMI). Our study aims at determining the differences in CMI when performing cognitive tasks targeting different cognitive functions at varying walking pathways. 69 children and adolescents ( boys ,
