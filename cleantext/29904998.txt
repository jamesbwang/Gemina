  Meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the effect of low-carbohydrate diet ( LCD) on renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes. An extensive literature search was conducted on scientific databases including PubMed , Scopus , and Cochrane Library until September 2017. Only controlled trials on human subjects written in English were included in this meta-analysis. Several markers of renal function were compared between subjects who adopted an LCD or control diet , including estimated glomerular filtration rate , creatinine clearance , urinary albumin , serum creatinine , and serum uric acid. Random effect model was used in the analysis of each marker. In this meta-analysis , 12 controlled trials were selected , which involved 942 participants ( 500 received LCD and 442 received a control diet). The pooled standardized mean difference ( SMD) of estimated glomerular filtration rate from LCD vs control diet was not different ( pooled SMD: 0.26; 95 % CI , -0.03 to 0.55; P = .08). Investigation on creatinine clearance also showed no significant difference ( pooled SMD: 0.51; 95 % CI , -0.38 to 1.40; P = .26). Other comparisons from urinary albumin ( pooled SMD: -0.04; 95 % CI , -0.75 to 0.67; P = .90) , serum creatinine ( pooled SMD: -0.57; 95 % CI , -1.51 to 0.38; P = .24) , and serum uric acid ( pooled SMD: -0.86; 95 % CI , -4.00 to 2.28; P = .59) also showed no significant difference in the results. In the present meta-analysis , no effect on markers of renal function was found after provision of a LCD compared with a control diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.
