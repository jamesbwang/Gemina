  Although activation/deactivation of specific brain regions has been shown to be predictive of successful memory encoding , the relationship between time-varying large-scale brain networks and fluctuations of memory encoding performance remains unclear. Here , we investigated time-varying functional connectivity patterns across the human brain in periods of 30-40 s , which have recently been implicated in various cognitive functions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging , participants performed a memory encoding task , and their performance was assessed with a subsequent surprise memory test. A graph analysis of functional connectivity patterns revealed that increased integration of the subcortical , default-mode , salience , and visual subnetworks with other subnetworks is a hallmark of successful memory encoding. Moreover , multivariate analysis using the graph metrics of integration reliably classified the brain network states into the period of high ( vs. low) memory encoding performance. Our findings suggest that a diverse set of brain systems dynamically interact to support successful memory encoding.
