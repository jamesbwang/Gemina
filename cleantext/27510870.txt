  The number of patients with hepatitis<disease> B<disease> e antigen ( HBeAg)- negative chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB) has shown a significant upward trend in recent years. However , antiviral drugs are not very effective. Regulation of liver regeneration by traditional Chinese medicine is an important way to improve clinical efficacy. This randomized controlled trial assessed the efficacy and safety of DWYG in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB. Overall , 130 subjects were randomized to ( A) DWYG 1.2 g three times daily ( n = 44) , ( B) entecavir 0.5 mg/day ( n = 43) in combination with DWYG or ( C) entecavir 0.5 mg/day ( n = 43). The liver histological response rate was assessed as the primary efficacy endpoint. The results showed that the liver histological response rate in the combination treatment group was significantly higher than that in the group with entecavir ( 71.43 % versus 22.22 %; P = 0.036) after 48 weeks of treatment. And the pathological progression rate of liver in the group with DWYG was significantly lower than that of the entecavir group during 228 weeks of follow-up ( 0 % versus 60.00 %; P = 0.019). No significant adverse events occurred during the study. In conclusion , treating HBeAg-negative CHB with DWYG is safe and effective to improve liver histological response.
