  Angiogenesis is an important pathophysiological response to cerebral ischemia. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase whose loss activates PI3K/Akt signaling , which is related to HIF-1α upregulation and enhanced angiogenesis in human cancer cells. However , the specific roles of PTEN in endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia remain unknown. Therefore , we sought to examine the potential effects of PTEN inhibition on post-ischemic angiogenesis in human blood vessel cells and to determine the underlying mechanism. In this present study , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation ( OGD) , cell proliferation , migration and apoptosis , in vitro tube formation and expression of PTEN/Akt pathway and angiogenic factors were examined in HUVECs after treatment with PTEN inhibitor bisperoxovanadium ( bpV) at different doses. The results showed that bpV significantly increased the cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis indicating that the drug exerts a cytoprotective effect on HUVECs with OGD exposure. bpV also enhanced cell migration and tube formation in HUVECs following OGD , and upregulated HIF-1α and VEGF expressions , but attenuated endostatin expression. Additionally , western blotting analysis demonstrated that Akt phosphorylation in HUVECs was significantly increased after bpV treatment. These findings suggest that PTEN inhibition promotes post-ischemic angiogenesis in HUVECs after exposure to OGD and this enhancing effect might be achieved through activation of the Akt signal cascade.
