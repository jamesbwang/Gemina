  The aim of this study was to determine the intramammary dose of benzylpenicillin required to maintain a concentration in the milk above the MIC for the Gram-positive bacteria that cause mastitis<symptom>. The product used in this study was a commercially available procaine benzylpenicillin in an oily suspension with micronized particles. Three dose levels were used: 200,000 , 300,000 , and 600,000 IU. Concentrations of benzylpenicillin in cow milk and plasma were determined after a single intramammary dose was administered into one quarter of each of the five cows in each treatment group. Samples were analyzed using an HPLC-MS/MS method , which was validated during the study. Concentrations in the milk were well above the MIC for the target pathogens for all doses tested. There was a linear dose-dependent increase in the mean AUCs of benzylpenicillin concentrations in plasma and milk. At the first milking , 12 hr after dosing , there was a significant difference between the mean milk benzylpenicillin concentrations in cows treated with a dose of 600,000 IU , and those treated with 200,000 or 300,000 IU. Although this study shows a linear relationship between the dose of procaine benzylpenicillin administered and the concentration in the milk in the healthy udder , it would be useful to conduct studies on cows with mastitis<symptom> to define the optimum dose and duration of intramammary treatment with benzylpenicillin.
