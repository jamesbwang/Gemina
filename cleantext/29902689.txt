  Few studies prospectively examined the role of maternal anxiety<symptom> and depressive disorders for early infant psychosocial stress responsivity. To investigate the role of lifetime maternal anxiety<symptom> and depressive disorders for various early infant interaction behaviors during the Face-to-Face Still Face Paradigm ( FFSFP) at 4 months postpartum. Prospective-longitudinal study among n = 251 mothers ( and their infants) from early pregnancy until 4 months postpartum. Cumulated lifetime diagnoses of maternal anxiety<symptom> and depressive disorders , repeatedly assessed with the CIDI-V from early pregnancy until 4 months postpartum. Infant positive and negative facial expressions and vocalizations , distancing behavior , self- and object-touch , observed during the FFSFP at 4 months postpartum. As indicated by fractional logit models , higher proportions of object-touch were seen among infants of mothers with anxiety<symptom> only ( still face: 7.8 %) and comorbid anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> ( still face: 7.9 %; reunion: 2.9 %) vs. no anxiety<symptom> and no depression<symptom> Higher proportion changes in object-touch were found among infants of mothers with anxiety<symptom> only ( play to still face: 6.4 %) and comorbid anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> ( play to still face: 7.2 %; play to reunion: 2.7 %) vs. no anxiety<symptom> and no depression<symptom> Higher proportion changes in distancing behavior were seen among infants of mothers with comorbid anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> ( still face to reunion: 1.1 %; play to reunion: 1.3 %) vs. no anxiety<symptom> and no depression<symptom> Particularly mothers with anxiety<symptom> only and comorbid anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> and their infants might profit from targeted early interventions to foster favorable interaction behaviors in early infancy and thereafter.
