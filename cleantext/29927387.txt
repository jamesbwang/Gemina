  The magnetotransport properties of the high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gas systems have been examined to determine the influence of the ac current bias on the carrier temperature. The changes in the line shape of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal magnetoresistance ( ( Formula: see text)) were followed as a function of the ac current bias in the temperature range of ( Formula: see text) in order to determine the carrier heating effect due to the ac bias. The lineshape analysis of these oscillations indicates that the carrier temperature of the two-dimensional electron system is linearly proportional to the ac bias current.
