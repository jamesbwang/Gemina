  Treatment of severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI) in the intensive care unit focuses on controlling intracranial pressure , ensuring sufficient cerebral perfusion , and monitoring for secondary injuries. Yet there are limited prognostic tools and no biomarkers or tests of the evolving neuropathology. Metabolomics has the potential to be a powerful tool to indirectly monitor evolving dysfunctional metabolism. We compared metabolite levels in simultaneously collected arterial and jugular venous samples in acute TBI patients undergoing intensive care as well as in healthy control volunteers. Our results show that , first , many circulating metabolites are decreased in TBI patients compared to healthy controls days after injury; both proline and hydroxyproline were depleted by 60 % or more compared with healthy controls as was gluconate. Second , both arterial and jugular venous plasma metabolomic analysis separates TBI patients from healthy controls and show distinct combinations of metabolites are driving the group separation in the two blood types. Third , TBI patients under heavy sedation with pentobarbital at the time of blood collection were discernibly different from patients not receiving pentobarbital. These results highlight the importance of accounting for medications in metabolomics analysis. Jugular venous plasma metabolomics shows potential as a minimally invasive tool to identify and study dysfunctional cerebral metabolism after TBI.
