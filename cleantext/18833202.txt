  High-resolution imaging of soft biological samples with atomic force microscopy ( AFM) is challenging because they must be imaged with small forces to prevent deformation. Typically , AFM of those samples is performed with soft silicon cantilevers ( k ≈ 0.1-10 N/m) and optical detection in a liquid environment. We set up a new microscope that uses a stiff qPlus sensor ( k ≥ 1 kN/m). Several complex biologically-relevant solutions are non-transparent , and even change their optical properties over time , such as the cell culture medium we used. While this would be problematic for AFM setups with optical detection , it is no problem for our qPlus setup which uses electrical detection. The high stiffness of the qPlus sensor allows us to use small amplitudes in frequency-modulation mode and obtain high Q factors even in liquid. The samples are immersed in solution in a liquid cell and long tips are used , with only the tip apex submerged. We discuss the noise terms and compare the minimal detectable signal to that of soft cantilevers. Atomic resolution of muscovite mica was achieved in various liquids: H
