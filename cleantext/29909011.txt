  To identify genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of bile duct obstruction in biliary atresia ( BA). We used rhesus rotavirus<pathogen> ( RRV) Balb/c mouse BA model to study BA. Liver and serum samples were harvested from BA and normal control ( NC) groups at 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 and 14 days postinoculation. Serum total bilirubin ( STB) and conjugated bilirubin ( CB) were measured. Livers of each group at day 7 were used for a genome-wide expression analysis. Expression of TLR7 signaling pathway in liver was measured by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting , including expression of TLR7 , activation of phosphorylated IRF7 and secretion of IFN-β , IL-1α and IL-6. Cell viability and survival rate after RRV infection were measured by using TLR7 knockdown human cholangiocarcinoma cell RBE. STB was significantly elevated from day 5 postinoculation and CB was from day 7 postinoculation , while CK19 ( the biomarker of biliary epithelial cells) expression by western blotting was decreased. By microarray analysis of liver tissues at day 7 postinoculation , TLR7 signaling pathway was up-regulated in BA mice. Based on the results of microarray analysis , the protein expression of TLR7 in the liver tissues of BA groups were found to be up-regulated from day 5 comparing to respective NC groups , although it was increased as pups aged in NC groups. And the level of p-IRF7 and secretion of cytokines were also statistically significant in BA groups. In vitro , TLR7 knockdown cell line showed less cellular proliferation and more susceptible to RRV infection. By in vivo study , TLR7 signal pathway was up-regulated in BA group; by additional in vitro study , intact TLR7 signal pathway might have some protective abilities in BA pathogenesis.
