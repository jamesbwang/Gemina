  Dietary stains can be adsorbed into the dentin of teeth. Using Orange II as a model dietary stain , this study investigated the strength of its interaction with the mineral and protein components of dentin matrix and how hydrogen peroxide ( H Dentin slices were prepared from human teeth and were either deproteinized ( 5.6 % sodium hypochlorite , 12 days) , demineralised ( 0.5 M EDTA , 3 days) or left as intact control samples. Samples were stained with Orange II for 1-168 h , during which staining intensity was quantified by image analysis. Similarly , uptake of stain by deproteinized/ demineralized samples treated with 10 or 30 % H Deproteinization of dentin matrix reduced the uptake of the orange II compared to the intact control. Conversely , demineralization of dentin samples increased the uptake of the dye. Treatment of samples for 48 h with H These results indicate a predominant role for collagen type I , which accounts for 90 % of the organic protein matrix of teeth , for attracting dietary stains. Binding analyses indicate that the interaction is highly dissociable , and further binding is reduced following H This study provides new information regarding adsorption of dietary stains into tooth dentin , suggesting that they are attracted and moderately bound to the collagen type I matrix. This study also contributes valuable information for discussion for considering the effect of H
