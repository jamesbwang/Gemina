  The prevalence of patients with a history of bariatric surgery is climbing. Medical and surgical questions arising in this patient population may prompt them to present to the nearest emergency department ( ED) , irrespective of that facility 's experience with bariatric surgery. The emergency physician is the first to evaluate patients with a history of bariatric surgery who present with abdominal<pathogen> symptoms.<pathogen> As a quality improvement project aimed at reducing resource utilization , we sought to determine which patients presenting to the ED could be treated in an outpatient setting in lieu of hospital admission. We conducted a retrospective review of bariatric patients admitted from our ED with abdominal<pathogen> symptoms<pathogen> , including abdominal<pathogen> pain<pathogen> , nausea<pathogen> , vomiting , dysphagia<pathogen> , obstruction , and hematemesis.<pathogen> We collected the following variables: type of bariatric operation , admission and discharge diagnoses , and all interventions performed during admission. One hundred sixty-nine patients ( 76.1 %) had a history of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The time from bariatric operation to presentation averaged 42 Â± 4.63 ( SD) months. The most common symptom was abdominal<pathogen> pain<pathogen> ( 80.2 %). Ninety-four percent of patients underwent invasive management via upper endoscopy , laparoscopy , or laparotomy. The most common postprocedural diagnoses were stricture , bowel obstruction , inflammatory findings , and cholecystitis.<pathogen> Most patient encounters resulted in invasive management ( 204/282; 72.3 %). The subset of these patients requiring endoscopic evaluation or therapy ( 37.7 %) may be suitable for outpatient management if appropriate measures are available for rapid follow-up and procedural scheduling.
