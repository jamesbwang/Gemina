  Luteinizing hormone receptor ( LHR) plays a critical role in reproduction by mediating LH signaling in the gonad. In this study , we cloned a novel lhr gene from the orange-spotted grouper , named glhr2. The cloned complete open reading frame sequence of glhr2 was 2082 bp in length , encoding a protein of 693 amino acids , sharing approximately 50 % amino acid identity with glhr1. glhr1 and glhr2 were primarily expressed in gonad , brain and hypothalamus with low expression in other tissues such as gill , spleen , etc.. The expressions of both glhr1 and glhr2 increased during vitellogenesis , while decreased during natural female to male sex change. The two gLHRs both could be activated by equine LH or human chorionic gonadotropin , but not by human follicle stimulating hormone. Both gLHR1 and gLHR2 activation stimulated the expression of cAMP response element driven reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner , while gLHR2 but not gLHR1 also activated serum response element driven reporter gene expression. This was the first study to demonstrate that two active LHRs exist in fish with possible different functional roles.
