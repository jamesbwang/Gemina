  A recently developed adenine base editor ( ABE) efficiently converts A to G and is potentially useful for clinical applications. However , its precision and efficiency in vivo remains to be addressed. Here we achieve A-to-G conversion in vivo at frequencies up to 100 % by microinjection of ABE mRNA together with sgRNAs. We then generate mouse models harboring clinically relevant mutations at Ar and Hoxd13 , which recapitulates respective clinical defects. Furthermore , we achieve both C-to-T and A-to-G base editing by using a combination of ABE and SaBE3 , thus creating mouse model harboring multiple mutations. We also demonstrate the specificity of ABE by deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing ( WGS). Taken together , ABE is highly efficient and precise in vivo , making it feasible to model and potentially cure relevant genetic diseases.
