  Minichromosome maintenance 10 ( MCM10) is deregulated in several malignancies including cervical cancer and urothelial carcinoma. However , the expression and biologic role of MCM10 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) is still unknown. In this study , we performed immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) analysis to examine the expression of MCM10 in ESCC and adjacent normal esophageal tissues. The associations of MCM10 expression with clinicopathologic parameters of ESCC were analyzed. Ablation of MCM10 through the CRISPR/Cas9 technology was conducted and its impact on ESCC cell growth and migration was investigated. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MCM10 were significantly greater in ESCC than in normal tissues ( In conclusion , these results suggest that MCM10 acts as an oncogene in ESCC through activation of Akt signaling and represents a promising therapeutic target for this malignancy.
