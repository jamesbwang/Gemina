  To investigate the effect of ATO on the proportion of Treg in the peripheral blood of patients with severe aplastic anemia<symptom> ( SAA) in vitro. The peripheral blood of 20 newlydiagnosed patients were collected , and the peripheral blood monomuclear cells ( PBMNC) were extracted. After the PBMNC were treated with ATO of different concentrotions ( 0 , 1 , 2.5 and 5 µmol/L) for 96 hours , the proportion of CD44 ATO significantly increased the proportion of Treg ( P < 0.01) at the concentration of 2.5 and 5 µmol/L , and the rising degree of Treg proportion improved with the increasing ATO concentration ( r = 0.524). Treg proportion increased at a concentration of 1 µmol/L , but without statistical significance ( P > 0.05). At 1 ( P < 0.05) , 2.5 ( P < 0.01) and 5 µmol/L ( P < 0.01) , ATO significantly up-regulated the expression of Foxp3 mRNA , and the increase of Foxp3 mRNA positively and linearly correlated with the increase of Treg cell-frequency ( r = 0.523). ATO significantly reduced the levels of IFN-γ ( at ATO 1,2.5 and 5 µmol/L , P < 0.01) , IL-4 ( at ATO 2.5 µmol/L , P < 0.01; at ATO 5 µmol/L , P < 0.01) and IL-17 ( at ATO 2.5 µmol/L , P < 0.05; at ATO 5 µmol/L , P < 0.01). ATO had no significant effect on TGF-β1 at 1 ( P > 0.05) and 2.5 µmol/L ( P > 0.05) , but significantly reduced TGF-β1 level at 5 µmol/L ( P < 0.05). ATO can mediate the immune regulation through up-regulating the proportion of Treg in peripheral blood of patients with SAA and reducing the levels of IFN-γ , IL-4 and IL-17.
