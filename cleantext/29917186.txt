  Long noncoding RNA FEZF1-AS1 ( FEZF1-AS1) has been showed to involve in a variety of cancers. However , its function and clinical significance in cervical cancer ( CC) have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of FEZF1-AS1 in CC patients. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression level of FEZF1-AS1 in CC specimens and adjacent normal cervical tissues. Association between FEZF1-AS1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed x2-test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival curves , and the log-rank statistic was used to test the role of FEZF1-AS1 expression. The possibility of FEZF1-AS1 as a prognostic biomarker for CC was examined by Cox proportional hazard regression model. We found that FEZF1-AS1 expression levels were significantly higher in CC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues ( p < 0.01). High expressions of FEZF1-AS1 were significantly association with poorer histological grade ( p = 0.004) , positive distant metastasis ( p = 0.002) and advanced FIGO stage ( p = 0.001). Furthermore , patients with low FEZF1-AS1 expression lived shorter than those with high FEZF1-AS1 expression ( Log-rank test , p < 0.0034). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that FEZF1-AS1 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for CC overall survival rates ( p = 0.008). We firstly provided clinical evidence that FEZF1-AS1 may be a possible biomarker of poor prognosis in CC.
