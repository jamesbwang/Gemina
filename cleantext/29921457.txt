  Inflammation<symptom> and caner are linked in a bidirectional manner. C-reactive protein ( CRP) is an important inflammatory marker. The aim of the study was to test whether the inflammatory marker , CRP at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer is associated with metastasis , recurrence , and death in breast cancer patients from Malwa region of Punjab where breast cancer is widely feared. Two hundred and forty-two breast cancer patients and 242 age and sex matched controls were included in the study. CRP levels were estimated using fully automated bio analyzer Erba200. Follow up interviews were conducted at an interval of 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , and 27 months to determine the outcome among breast cancer patients. Elevated levels of CRP were found among the diseased in comparison with controls ( P < 0.0001). Higher CRP levels associated significantly with poor outcome including metastasis and recurrence among breast cancer patients ( P = 0.03; 95 % confidence interval; odds ratio: 2.954 ( 0.9125-9.561)). Elevated levels of CRP associated significantly with increased risk of breast cancer and poor outcome. CRP estimation may be a simple and inexpensive tool for the risk assessment and outcome of the disease in Malwa region of Punjab where incidence of breast cancer is reported to be very high.
