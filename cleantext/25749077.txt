  Tooth extraction causes vertical and horizontal alveolar bone loss and consequent remodeling. Several methods have been introduced in terms of so-called & ldquo; ridge preservation & rdquo; techniques , which mostly resemble guided bone regenerative ( GBR) procedures using filler materials and membranes<symptom> in order to stabilize the respective sites. This conceptual case report describes a novel approach using a degradable polylactic acid membrane covered with a collagen matrix , which aims to reshape the resorbed alveolar wall and thereby to stabilize the soft tissues during matrix formation and socket mineralization. Clinical re-entry , radiographic ( CBCT) and histologic evaluation proved adequate for osteoneogenesis despite an unfavorable initial situation: An implant could be ideally placed , which was circumferentially covered by bone. This minimally invasive method could offer a new method to approach socket preservation without using filler materials and coverage of the socket entrance. However , more controlled research on this topic is needed.
