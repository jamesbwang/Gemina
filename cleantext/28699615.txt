  Clinical studies have exhibited microRNAs or cytokines could be used as new biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis , respectively. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of serum miR-17 , IL-4 , and IL-6 as early diagnostic markers of endometriosis. One hundred forty patients aged 22 to 45 years were recruited , 80 patients with pathologically confirmed endometriosis were assigned to endometriosis group whereas the remaining 60 patients were in the control group. The blood samples were collected immediately before laparoscopy and analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR analysis. In patients with endometriosis , the level of miR-23b decreased significantly , the levels of IL-4 and IL-6 increased remarkably compared with that in patients without endometriosis. Correlation analysis revealed miR-17 levels were negatively correlated with IL-4 ( r = -0.974 , P < .05) and IL-6 ( r = -0.944 , P < .05). The ROC curve manifested joint of miR-17 and selected cytokines could improve the diagnostic power with an AUC of 0.84 ( 95 % CI: 0.75-0.96). In short , the present study characterizes the role of miR-17 , IL-4 , and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis , suggesting the feasibility of using miR-17 and selected cytokines as a noninvasive diagnostic test for the detection of endometriosis.
