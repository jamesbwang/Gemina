  This study sought to compare early emergency department ( ED) use of coronary computed tomography angiography ( CTA) and stress echocardiography ( SE) head-to-head. Coronary CTA has been promoted as the early ED chest<symptom> pain<symptom> triage imaging method of choice , whereas SE is often overlooked in this setting and involves no ionizing radiation. The authors randomized 400 consecutive low- to intermediate-risk ED acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patients without known coronary artery disease and a negative initial serum troponin level to immediate coronary CTA ( n = 201) or SE ( n = 199). The primary endpoint was hospitalization rate. Secondary endpoints were ED and hospital length of stay. Safety endpoints included cardiovascular events and radiation exposure. Mean patient age was 55 years , with 43 % women and predominantly ethnic minorities ( 46 % Hispanics , 32 % African Americans). Thirty-nine coronary CTA patients ( 19 %) and 22 SE patients ( 11 %) were hospitalized at presentation ( difference 8 %; 95 % confidence interval: 1 % to 15 %; p = 0.026). Median ED length of stay for discharged patients was 5.4 h ( interquartile range ( IQR): 4.2 to 6.4 h) for coronary CTA and 4.7 h ( IQR: 3.5 to 6.0 h) for SE ( p < 0.001). Median hospital length of stay was 58 h ( IQR: 50 to 102 h) for coronary CTA and 34 h ( IQR: 31 to 54 h) for SE ( p = 0.002). There were 11 and 7 major adverse cardiovascular events for coronary CTA and SE , respectively ( p = 0.47) , over a median 24 months of follow-up. Median/mean complete initial work-up radiation exposure was 6.5/ 7.7 mSv for coronary CTA and 0/0 .96 mSv for SE ( p < 0.001). The use of SE resulted in the hospitalization of a smaller proportion of patients with a shorter length of stay than coronary CTA and was safe. SE should be considered an appropriate option for ED chest<symptom> pain<symptom> triage ( Stress Echocardiography and Heart Computed Tomography ( CT) Scan in Emergency Department Patients With Chest<symptom> Pain<symptom>; NCT01384448).
