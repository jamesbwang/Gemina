  Immunogenic cell death ( ICD) is a specific kind of cell death that stimulates the immune system to combat cancer cells. Ultrasound ( US)- controlled targeted release of drugs by liposome-microbubble complexes is a promising approach due to its non-invasive nature and visibility through ultrasound imaging. However , it is not known whether this approach can enhance ICD induced by drugs , such as doxorubicin. Herein , we prepared a doxorubicin-liposome-microbubble complex ( MbDox) , and the resultant MbDox was then characterized and tested for US-controlled release of Dox ( MbDox + US treatment) to enhance the induction of ICD in LL/2 and CT26 cancer cells and in syngeneic murine models. We found that MbDox + US treatment caused more cellular uptake and nuclear accumulation of Dox in tumor cells , and more accumulation of Dox in tumor tissues. Enhanced induction of ICD occurred both
