  DNA cytosine 5-methyltransferase ( DNMT) catalyzes methylation at the C5 position of the cytosine residues in the CpG sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in cancer cells. Therefore , inhibition of human DNMT is an effective strategy for treating various cancers. The inhibitors of DNMT have an electron-deficient nucleobase because this group facilitates attack by the catalytic Cys residue in DNMTs. Recently , we reported the synthesis and properties of mechanism-based modified nucleosides , 2-amino-4-halopyridine-C-nucleosides ( d
