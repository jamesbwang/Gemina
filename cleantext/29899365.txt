  Left atrial enlargement is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Little is known regarding the association between nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> variability and left atrial enlargement in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and preserved ejection fraction. The study population consisted of 140 consecutive patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( mean age 64 ± 10 years) with preserved ejection fraction ( ≥ 50 %). Nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was measured at hourly intervals , using a home blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring device. Nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> variability was expressed as the standard deviation of all readings. Left atrial volume index was measured using the modified Simpson 's biplane method with transthoracic echocardiography. Multiple regression analysis indicated that nighttime mean systolic/diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and its variability remained independently associated with left atrial enlargement after adjustment for age , sex , anti-hypertensive medication class , and left ventricular mass index ( P < 0.01). When patients were divided into four groups according to nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and its variability , the group with higher nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and its variability had significantly larger left atrial volume than the group with lower nighttime blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and its variability ( 46.6 ml/m
