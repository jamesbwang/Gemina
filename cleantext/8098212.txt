  Carbamyl phosphate ( CP) is well-known as an essential intermediate of pyrimidine and arginine/urea biosynthesis. Chemically , CP can be easily synthesized from dihydrogen phosphate and cyanate. Enzymatically , CP can be synthesized using three different classes of enzymes: ( 1) ATP-grasp fold protein based carbamyl phosphate synthetase ( CPS); ( 2) Amino-acid kinase fold carbamate kinase ( CK)- like CPS ( anabolic CK or aCK); and ( 3) Catabolic transcarbamylase. The first class of CPS can be further divided into three different types of CPS as CPS I , CPS II , and CPS III depending on the usage of ammonium or glutamine as its nitrogen source , and whether
