  Relacin is a synthetic molecule that targets RelA , an essential protein in a conserved bacterial stress response system. It was shown to inhibit bacterial growth. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of relacin combined with sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl) on Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> biofilms and to evaluate the cytotoxicity of relacin. 48-h E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> OG1RF biofilms were treated by various concentrations of relacin in order to determine its inhibitory concentration. Then , the 48-h biofilms were treated either with 1-min NaOCl ( 0.01 % , 0.05 %) alone , or in combination of relacin. As a means of comparison , the biofilms of ΔrelA were also treated by 1-min NaOCl ( 0.01 % , 0.05 % , 0.25 %). The treatment efficacy was determined by agar plate count assays. The cytotoxicity of relacin was examined on human gingival epithelial cells Ca9-22 and murine fibroblasts NIH-3T3 by a methyl thiazolyltetrazolium ( MTT) assay and a lactate dehydrogenase assay. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) with Bonferroni 's post-hoc test and an independent Student 's t-test. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Relacin inhibited the growth of OG1RF biofilms partially at 8 mM and fully at 14 mM. The relacin ( 14 mM) and NaOCl combined treatment resulted in significantly higher treatment efficacy than NaOCl treatment alone. At 0.05 % NaOCl , the combined treatment resulted in 5.65 ( ± 0.19) log reduction in biofilm viability. The ΔrelA biofilms were more susceptible to NaOCl treatment than the wild type biofilms at 0.25 % NaOCl. Relacin at 14 mM was not toxic to host epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The combination of relacin with a low concentration of NaOCl was effective and not cytotoxic.
