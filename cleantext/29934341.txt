  Prostate cancer ( PC) is a principal cause of cancer-associated morbidity in men. Although 5-year survival of patients with localized PC approaches 100 percent , survival decreases precipitously after metastasis. Bone is the preferred site for disseminated PC cell colonization , altering the equilibrium of bone homeostasis resulting in weak and fragile bones. Currently , no curative options are available for PC bone metastasis. MDA-7/ IL-24 is a well-studied cytokine established as a therapeutic in a wide-array of cancers upon delivery as a gene therapy. In this study , we explored the potential anti-cancer properties of MDA-7/ IL-24 delivered as a recombinant protein. Using bone metastasis experimental models , animals treated with recombinant MDA-7/ IL-24 had significantly less metastatic lesions<symptom> in their femurs as compared to controls. The inhibitory effects of MDA-7/ IL-24 on bone metastasis resulted from PC-selective killing and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation , which is necessary for bone resorption. Gain- and loss-of-function genetic approaches document that pro-survival Akt and Mcl-1 pathways are critically important in the anti-bone metastatic activity of MDA-7/ IL-24. Our previous findings showed that MDA-7/ IL-24 gene therapy plus Mcl-1 inhibitors cooperate synergistically. Similarly , an Mcl-1 small molecule inhibitor synergized with MDA-7/ IL-24 and induced robust anti-bone metastatic activity. These results expand the potential applications of MDA-7/ IL-24 as an anti-cancer molecule and demonstrate that purified recombinant protein is non-toxic in pre-clinical animal models and has profound inhibitory effects on bone metastasis , which can be enhanced further when combined with an Mcl-1 inhibitory small molecule.
