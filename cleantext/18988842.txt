  Oxytocin treatment reduces signs of long-term emotional stress after exposure to trauma; however , little is known about the potential protective effects of oxytocin treatment on behavioral and physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> associated with extreme stress exposure. The objective of this study was to investigate oxytocin treatment as a prophylactic measure against rat signs of fear. Two separate experiments were conducted in which the time of intranasal oxytocin administration differed. Intranasal oxytocin ( 1.0 Î¼g/kg) was administered 5 min after daily exposure to foot shock<symptom> in Experiment # 1 and 1 h before foot shock<symptom> in Experiment # 2. In Experiment # 1 , possible massage-evoked oxytocin release ( 5 min after foot shock<symptom>) was also investigated. In both experiments , a contextual fear conditioning procedure was employed in which stress was induced via inescapable foot shock<symptom> ( 3 days , 40 shocks/day , 8 mA/shock) in a fear conditioning chamber. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (
