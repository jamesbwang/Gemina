  The influence of a match including extra-time ( ET) on subsequent 90 min match performance and recovery has not been investigated. Four professional soccer players played in three competitive matches in a 7-day period: matches one ( MD1) and three ( MD3) lasted 90 min and match 2 ( MD2) lasted 120 min ( i.e. , included ET). Physical ( total and high-intensity ( HI) distance covered , accelerations and decelerations , and mechanical load) and technical performances ( pass and dribble accuracy) were analyzed throughout match-play. Subjective measures of recovery and countermovement jump ( CMJ) height were made 36 ⁻ 42 h post-match. Post-MD2 , there were very or most likely harmful effects of ET on CMJ height ( -6 ± 9 %) , muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( +18 ± 12 %) , and fatigue<symptom> ( +27 ± 4 %) scores , and overall wellness score ( -13 ± 5 %) compared to post-MD1. Furthermore , there were very likely harmful effects on muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( +13 ± 14 %) , wellness scores ( -8 ± 10 %) , and CMJ height ( -6 ± 9 %) post-MD3 vs. post-MD1. There was a possibly harmful effect of ET on HI distance covered during MD3 , along with reductions in pass ( -9.3 %) and dribble ( -12.4 %) accuracy. An ET match negatively impacted recovery 36 h post-match. Furthermore , in some players , indices of performance in a 90 min match played 64 h following ET were compromised , with subsequent recovery also adversely affected.
