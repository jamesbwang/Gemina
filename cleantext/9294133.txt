  Cryptococcus<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> is a facultative intracellular pathogen and its interaction with macrophages is a key event determining the outcome of infection. Urease is a major virulence factor in C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> but its role during macrophage interaction has not been characterized. Consequently , we analyzed the effect of urease on fungal-macrophage interaction using wild-type , urease-deficient and urease-complemented strains of C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen>. The frequency of non-lytic exocytosis events was reduced in the absence of urease. Urease-positive C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> manifested reduced and delayed intracellular replication with fewer macrophages displaying phagolysosomal membrane permeabilization. The production of urease was associated with increased phagolysosomal pH , which in turn reduced growth of urease-positive C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> inside macrophages. Interestingly , the ure1 mutant strain grew slower in fungal growth medium which was buffered to neutral pH ( pH 7.4). Mice inoculated with macrophages carrying urease-deficient C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> had lower fungal burden in the brain than mice infected with macrophages carrying wild-type strain. In contrast , the absence of urease did not affect survival of yeast when interacting with amoebae. Because of the inability of the urease deletion mutant to grow on urea as a sole nitrogen source , we hypothesize urease plays a nutritional role involved in nitrogen acquisition in the environment. Taken together , our data demonstrate that urease affects fitness within the mammalian phagosome , promoting non-lytic exocytosis while delaying intracellular replication and thus reducing phagolysosomal membrane damage , events that could facilitate cryptococcal dissemination when transported inside macrophages. This system provides an example where an enzyme involved in nutrient acquisition modulates virulence during mammalian infection.
