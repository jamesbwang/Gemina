  Many studies have provided evidence of altered brain structure in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions , as well as further adaptations following treatment that are coincident with changes in pain. Less is known regarding how these structural brain adaptations relate to assessments of nociceptive processing. The current study aimed to investigate brain structure in people with knee osteoarthritis ( OA) before and after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) and to investigate the relationships between these findings and quantitative sensory testing ( QST) of the nociceptive system. Twenty-nine people with knee OA underwent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans and QST before and six months after TKA and were compared with a pain-free control group ( N = 18). MRI analyses involved voxel-based morphometry and fractional anisotropy. Before TKA , there was reduced gray matter volume and impaired fractional anisotropy in areas associated with nociceptive processing , with further gray matter adaptations and improvements in fractional anisotropy evident after TKA. QST revealed increased nociceptive facilitation and impaired inhibition in knee OA that was reversed after TKA. There were minimal relationships found between MRI data and QST assessments or pain report. In people with end-stage knee OA , region-specific gray matter atrophy was detected , with further changes in gray matter volume and improvements in white matter integrity observed after joint replacement. Despite coincident alterations in nociceptive inhibition and facilitation processes , there did not appear to be any association between these functional assessments of the nociceptive system and changes in brain structure.
