  Obesity is the pandemic disease of this century. Surgery is the only effective treatment but can not be offered to every patient. Endoscopic sutured gastroplasty is a minimally invasive technique that may potentially fill the gap between surgery and behavioral therapy. In this study , we prospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of a novel suturing device. After a pre-bariatric multidisciplinary work-up , class 1 and 2 obese patients were included. Using a simple triangulation platform , transmural sutures with serosa-to-serosa apposition were performed in the gastric cavity. Patients were followed according to the same routines as those performed for bariatric procedures. Between November 2015 and December 2016 , 51 patients were included across three European Centers. Mean body mass index at baseline was 35.1 kg/m Endoscopic sutured gastroplasty using this novel device is safe and achieved weight<symptom> loss<symptom> results in line with criteria expected for these endoluminal techniques. Further prospective studies vs. placebo or nutritional support are needed.
