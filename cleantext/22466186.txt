  We demonstrate numerically and experimentally the enhancement of Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR) sensing via dispersion engineering of the plasmonic response using plasmonic nanograting. Following their design and optimization , the plasmonic nanograting structures are fabricated using e-beam lithography and lift-off process and integrated into conventional prism based Kretschmann configuration. The presence of absorptive nanograting near the metal film , provides strong field enhancement with localization and allows to control the dispersion relation which was originally dictated by a conventional SPR structure. This contributes to the enhancement in Q factor which is found to be 3-4 times higher as compared to the conventional Kretschmann configuration. The influence of the incident angle on resonance wavelength is also demonstrated both numerically and experimentally , where , only a negligible wavelength shift is observed with increasing the incident angles for plasmonic nanograting configuration. This surprising feature may be helpful for studying and utilizing light-matter interaction between plasmons and narrow linewidth media ( e.g. Rb atom or molecule) having nonlocalities in their susceptibility-momentum relation. Finally , we analyze the role of plasmonic nanograting in enhancing the performance of an SPR sensor. Our results indicate that the integrated SPR-nanograting device shows a great promise as a sensor for various types of analytes.
