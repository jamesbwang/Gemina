  Lung microbiota may affect innate immunity and treatment consequence in the obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) was obtained from 11 OSA patients and 8 patients with other lung diseases as control , and used for lung microbiota profiling by PCR amplification and sequencing of the microbial samples. It was demonstrated that phyla of Firmicutes , Fusobacteria , and Bacteriodetes were relatively abundant in the lung microbiota. Alpha-diversity comparison between OSA and control group revealed that Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were significantly higher in OSA patients ( 0.3863 ± 0.0631 and 0.0682 ± 0.0159 , respectively) than that in control group ( 0.119 ± 0.074 and 0.0006 ± 0.0187 , respectively , P < .05 for both phyla). In contrast , Firmicutes was significantly less in OSA patients ( 0.1371 ± 0.0394) compared with that in the control group ( 0.384 ± 0.046 , P < .05). Comparison within a group ( ß-diversity) indicated that the top 5 phyla in the OSA lung were Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , Fusobacteria , and Acidobacteria , while the top 5 phyla in the control group were Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , Proteobacteria , Actinobacteria , and Acidobacteria. These findings indicated that lung microbiota in OSA is distinct from that of non-OSA patients. Manipulation of the microbiota may be an alternative strategy to augment airway immunity and to reduce susceptibility to airway infection.
