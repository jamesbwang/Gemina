  Our previous cDNA microarray study revealed increased cellular mRNA levels of a panel of genes , including kallikrein-8 ( KLK8) , after long-term telbivudine treatment in chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> patients. The aim of this study was to verify whether serum protein levels of KLK8 , a cancer-related enzyme , are indeed increased after telbivudine treatment. A total of 83 chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> patients receiving telbivudine for > 2 years were retrospectively analyzed. Serum KLK8 protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) changes were compared before and after treatment. Both serum KLK8 protein and eGFR increased significantly after long-term telbivudine treatment ( paired t-test: KLK8 , p < 0.001; eGFR , p = 0.001). No direct correlation was found between KLK8 increase and eGFR change. However , eGFR change was positively associated with post-treatment KLK8 levels following adjustment for body height ( p < 0.001). Telbivudine treatment resulted in increased levels of serum KLK8 protein. Furthermore , eGFR increase was associated with body height-adjusted , post-treatment KLK8 levels.
