  A single-center retrospective analysis of 46 patients with Lenke 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS). To compare Cobb angle distribution in different segments of the main thoracolumbar/lumbar curve in patients with Lenke 5 AIS , and differences in the lateral-bending flexibility , the correction rate , and correction index among these segments.No studies have been reported the ratio of the different segments to the main thoracolumbar/lumbar curve in terms of curve angle distribution , lateral-bending flexibility differences between these segments , and the correction rate when surgical instrumentations are used to correct scoliosis.Included in this study were 46 consecutive patients with Lenke 5 AIS. All of them received one-stage posterior correction and fusion with pedicle screw in the same center between January 2009 and January 2012. General data and radiological films before surgery , and at final follow-up were collected for further analysis. The wedging angles in the different discs were measured within main thoracolumbar/lumbar curve before and after surgery. This angle was also measured in the bending film. The preoperative flexibility , the correction rate , and the correction index of different disc segments were calculated.There were 44 ( 95.65 %) female and 2 ( 4.35 %) male included in this study , with the average age of 15.26 ± 2.19 years at the time of surgery. The mean Cobb angle was 45.09 ± 9.40 °. The average disc wedge angles in AV- 2 ( apex vetebrea-2) , AV- 1 , AV + 1 , and AV + 2 segments were 5.59 ± 2.28 ° , 10.46 ± 3.41 ° , 9.85 ± 2.43 ° , 5.68 ± 2.80 ° , accounting for about 17.76 % , 33.16 % , 31.64 % , and 17.44 % of the Cobb angle in the main thoracolumbar/lumbar curve , respectively ( P < .001). Flexibility of the supine lateral bending was 75.84 % , 64.36 % , 72.16 % and 135.09 % ( P < .001) , while the correction rates were 76.00 % , 83.10 % , 92.10 % , and 109.65 % ( P < .001). The correction indexes were 1.16 , 1.77 , 2.02 , and 1.11 for the disc of AV- 2 , AV- 1 , AV + 1 , and AV + 2 , respectively ( P < .001). The disc angles are symmetric distribution in the main thoracolumbar/lumbar curve , and the distal segment is more flexible than the proximal/apical segments. Furthermore , the correction index is the highest in the apical vertebral segment.
