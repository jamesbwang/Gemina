  Cardiac arrest etiology is often assigned according to the Utstein template , which differentiates medical ( formerly `` presumed cardiac '') from other causes. These categories are poorly defined , contain within them many clinically distinct etiologies , and are rarely based on diagnostic testing. Optimal clinical care and research require more rigorous characterization of arrest etiology. We developed a novel system to classify arrest etiology using a structured chart review of consecutive patients treated at a single center after in- or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest over four years. Two reviewers independently reviewed a random subset of 20 % of cases to calculate inter-rater reliability. We used X We identified 14 principal arrest etiologies , and developed objective diagnostic criteria for each. Inter-rater reliability was high ( kappa = 0.80). Median age of 986 included patients was 60 years , 43 % were female and 71 % arrested out-of-hospital. The most common etiology was respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 148 ( 15 %)). A minority ( 255 ( 26 %)) arrested due to cardiac causes. Only nine ( 1 %) underwent a diagnostic workup that was unrevealing of etiology. Rates of awakening and survival to hospital discharge both differed across arrest etiologies , with survival ranging from 6 % to 60 % ( both P < 0.001) , and rates of favorable outcome ranging from 0 % to 40 % ( P < 0.001). Timing and mechanism of death ( e.g. multisystem organ<symptom> failure<symptom> or brain death) also differed significantly across etiologies. Arrest etiology was identifiable in the majority cases via systematic chart review. `` Cardiac '' etiologies may be less common than previously thought. Substantial clinical heterogeneity exists across etiologies , suggesting previous classification systems may be insufficient.
