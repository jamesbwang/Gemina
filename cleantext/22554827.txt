  Small for gestational age ( SGA) infants are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. It is unknown whether any prenatal biomarkers are helpful for identifying SGA infants with altered metabolic health profile at birth or later life. In a nested study of 162 SGA ( birth weight < 10th percentile) and 161 optimal birth weight ( 25th-75th percentiles) control infants in the 3D ( design , develop and discover) birth cohort in Canada , we assessed whether maternal circulating placental growth factor ( PlGF) , a biomarker of placental function , is associated with metabolic health biomarkers in SGA infants. Main outcomes were cord plasma insulin , proinsulin , insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I) , leptin , and high-molecular weight ( HMW) adiponectin concentrations. Maternal PlGF concentrations at 32-35 weeks of gestation were substantially lower in SGA versus control infants (
