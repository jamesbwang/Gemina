  SLC25A42 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein which has been shown to transport coenzyme A through a lipid bilayer in vitro. A homozygous missense variant in this gene has been recently reported in 13 subjects of Arab descent presenting with mitochondriopathy with variable clinical manifestations. By exome sequencing , we identified two additional individuals carrying rare variants in this gene. One subject was found to carry the previously reported missense variant in homozygous state , while the second subject carried a homozygous canonical splice site variant resulting in a splice defect. With the identification of two additional cases , we corroborate the association between rare variants in SLC25A42 and a clinical presentation characterized by myopathy , developmental delay , lactic acidosis , and encephalopathy. Furthermore , we highlight the biochemical consequences of the splice defect by measuring a mild decrease of coenzyme A content in SLC25A42-mutant fibroblasts.
