  Within nursing education , simulation has been recognised as an effective learning strategy. Embedding simulation within clinical units has the potential to enhance patient safety and improve clinical outcomes. However it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of this educational technique to support the actual value and effectiveness. This study aimed to implement and evaluate an innovative simulation experience for registered nurses. A high-fidelity simulation focusing on nursing assessment was conducted with 50 Registered Nurses in an Emergency Department ( ED) at a large tertiary referral hospital. Two questionnaires were completed pre and post simulation to assess anxiety<symptom> related to participating in the simulation , and self-efficacy in patient assessment. Participant satisfaction and self-confidence in learning was assessed post simulation. Additionally a documentation audit from the patient 's electronic chart was completed to review documentation entries before and after participation in the simulation. Anxiety<symptom> scores decreased significantly from pre ( M = 38.56 , SD = 9.87) to post ( M = 33.54 , SD = 8.99) , t ( 49) = 4.273 , p < 0.001. There was a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy scores from pre ( M = 195.16 , SD = 28.09) to post ( M = 214.12 , SD = 25.77) , t ( 49) = 5.072 , p < 0.001. ED nurses were highly satisfied with their simulation training and they were in agreement with the statements about self-confidence in learning. There was a statistically significant increase in two components of the documentation scores; initial clinical handover increased from pre ( M = 7.88 , SD = 1.76) to post ( M = 8.79 , SD = 1.22) , t ( 41) = 3.41 , p < 0.001 and indicators of urgent illness increased from pre ( M = 7.33 , SD = 1.95) to post ( M = 8.10 , SD = 1.45) , t ( 41) = 2.27 , p = 0.028. This study has demonstrated that a high fidelity simulation decreased participants ' anxiety<symptom> , increased self-efficiency in patient assessment , and improved documentation in patient records. Additionally ED nurses were highly satisfied with the simulation training.
