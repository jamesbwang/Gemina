  There is unexplained variation in length of stay ( LOS) across NICUs , suggesting that there may be practices that can optimize LOS. Three groups of NICUs in the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative were followed: ( 1) collaborative centers participating in an 18-month collaborative quality improvement project to optimize LOS for preterm infants; ( 2) individual centers aiming to optimize LOS; and ( 3) nonparticipants. Our aim in the collaborative project was to decrease postmenstrual age ( PMA) at discharge for infants born between 27 + 0 and < 32 weeks ' gestational age by 3 days. A secondary outcome was `` early discharge , '' the proportion of infants discharged from the hospital before 36 + 5 weeks ' PMA. The balancing measure of readmissions within 72 hours was tracked for the collaborative group. From 2013 to 2015 , 8917 infants were cared for in 20 collaborative NICUs , 19 individual project NICUs , and 71 nonparticipants. In the collaborative group , the PMA at discharge decreased from 37.8 to 37.5 weeks ( A structured collaborative project that was focused on optimizing LOS led to a 3-day decrease in LOS and was more effective than individualized quality improvement efforts.
