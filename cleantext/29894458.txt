  Autologous fat grafting is a surgical procedure used to correct volumetric defects , atrophies , and sclerosis. Three-dimensional ( 3D) facial photography may enable researchers to quantify the success of surgical procedures through volumetric and surface assessments. Using 3D photography , the authors assessed the results of autologous fat grafting performed in a 15-year-old patient affected by Parry-Romberg syndrome<disease> , a rare condition resulting in progressive hemifacial atrophy of skin , subcutaneous tissues and , ultimately , bone. Stereophotogrammetric acquisitions were performed before and 4 months after the surgical intervention. The obtained results were objectively assessed in terms of facial symmetry through calculation of root mean square deviation point-to-point distance between the treated and healthy side , and volume modifications between pre- and postsurgical 3D facial scans. Four months after surgery , 73 % of injected adipose tissue was resorbed , whereas facial symmetry increased up to 63 %. The proposed method is not invasive and provides quantitative information about the surgical and esthetic outcomes. Clinicians could better plan surgery , and the patients could be more motivated and compliant to the treatment.
