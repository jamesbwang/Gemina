  Kir4 .1/ 5.1 heterotetramer participates in generating the negative cell membrane potential in distal convoluted tubule ( DCT) and plays a critical role in determining the activity of Na-Cl co-transporter ( NCC). Kir5 .1 contains a phosphothreonine-motif at its c-terminus ( AA249-252). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that Nedd4-2 was associated with Kir5 .1 in HEK293 cells cotransfected with Kir5 .1 or Kir4 .1/ Kir5 .1. GST-pull-down further confirmed the association between Nedd4-2 and Kir5 .1. Ubiquitination assay showed that Nedd4-2 increased the ubiquitination of Kir4 .1/ Kir5 .1 heterotetramer in the cells co-transfected with Kir4 .1/ Kir5 .1 but it has no effect on Kir4 .1 or Kir5 .1 alone. Patch-clamp and western blot also demonstrated that co-expression of Nedd4-2 but not Nedd4-1 decreased K currents and Kir4 .1 expression in the cells cotransfected with Kir4 .1 and Kir5 .1. In contrast , Nedd4-2 fails to inhibit Kir4 .1 in the absence of Kir5 .1 or in the cells transfected with the inactivated form of Nedd4-2 ( Nedd4-2C821A). Moreover , the mutation of TPVT motif in the C-terminus of Kir5 .1 largely abolished the association of Nedd4-2 with Kir5 .1 and abolished the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on K currents in HEK293 cells transfected with Kir4 .1 and Kir5 .1 mutant ( Kir5 .1 T249A). Finally , the basolateral K conductance in the DCT and Kir4 .1 expression is significantly increased in the kidney-specific Nedd4-2 knockout or in Kir5 .1 knockout mice in comparison to their corresponding WT littermates. We conclude that Nedd4-2 binds to Kir5 .1 at phosphothreonine-motif of the c-terminus and the association of Nedd4-2 with Kir5 .1 facilitates the ubiquitination of Kir4 .1 thereby regulating its plasma expression in the DCT.
