  To examine the relationship between optical coherence tomography ( OCT) images and clinical course in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injection ( IVR). Prospective cohort study. Thirty eyes of 30 patients with BRVO treated with IVR. All patients received 1 initial IVR followed by repeated injections in the pro re nata ( PRN) regimen. Correlations between logarithm of minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity ( logMAR BCVA) or number of IVRs after 12 months and OCT parameters including the external limiting membrane ( ELM) , ellipsoid zone ( EZ) , interdigitation zone ( IZ) , and photoreceptor outer segment ( PROS) length at first resolution of macular edema<symptom> ( ME) were assessed. Resolution of ME was defined as central foveal thickness < 300 μm and the absence of subretinal fluid. OCT parameters influencing BCVA and number of IVRs were evaluated using multivariate analysis. Correlations between nonperfusion areas ( NPAs) and thinning areas and changes in retinal thickness of BRVO-affected areas were assessed. Of the 30 patients , 27 completed this study and were included in the statistical analyses. The mean logMAR BCVA at 3 , 6 , and 12 months was 0.16 ± 0.19 , 0.09 ± 0.20 , and 0.07 ± 0.20 , respectively , which improved significantly from baseline at each visit ( p < 0.0001 , respectively) , while the mean number of IVRs at 12 months was 3.9 ± 2.2. The mean number of IVRs for the first resolution of ME was 1.6 ± 0.8. Eyes with ELM and EZ defects at the points of first resolution of ME were correlated with a significantly lower BCVA at 12 months compared with eyes with preserved ELMs and EZs ( p = 0.035 , p = 0.002 , respectively). However , eyes with IZ defects at the points of first resolution of ME were not correlated with a significantly lower BCVA at 12 months compared with eyes with preserved IZs ( p = 0.160). Defects in the EZ at the points of first resolution of ME significantly affected the number of IVRs at 12 months ( p = 0.042) , although the ELM and IZ did not. PROS length at the points of first resolution of ME was significantly correlated with BCVA and number of IVRs at 12 months ( p = 0.006 , p = 0.0008 , respectively). In multivariate analysis , PROS length at the points of first resolution of ME had the most significant effect on BCVA and number of IVRs ( p = 0.013 , p = 0.012 , respectively). NPA size on fluorescein angiography and thinning area on OCT within the macular area showed a significant correlation ( p = 0.003 , r = 0.971). The retinal thickness of ischemic BRVO-affected areas was significantly less than that of control areas at 10 , 11 , and 12 months ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.005 , p = 0.003 , respectively). We showed that the 1 + PRN regimen may be a useful therapy for ME due to BRVO. In addition , PROS length at points of first resolution of ME appears to be a good indicator of BCVA and number of IVRs in BRVO patients.
