  This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of mandatory assignment of both a clinical decision rule ( CDR) and highly sensitive d-dimer in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism ( PE). Institutional guidelines with a CDR and highly sensitive d-dimer were embedded in an order entry menu with mandatory assignment of key components before ordering a CT pulmonary angiogram ( CTPA). Data were retrospectively extracted from the electronic health record. This was a retrospective review of 1,003 CTPA studies ( 905 patients , 845 male and 60 female patients , age 63.7 Â± 13.5 years). CTPAs were positive for PE in 170 studies ( 17 %) , representing an average yield of 15 % ( year ( average); 2007 ( 15 %) , 2008 ( 18 %) , 2009 ( 15 %) , 2010 ( 15 %) , 2011 ( 17 %) , 2012 ( 15 %) , 2013 ( 23 %)). The increased yield represented efforts of mandatory order entry assignments , educational sessions , and clinical champions. Different d-dimer thresholds with or without age adjustments in combination with the CDR identified about 10 % of patients who may have been managed without CTPA. Mandatory assignment of a CDR and highly sensitive d-dimer clinical decision pathway can be successfully incorporated into an order entry menu and produce a sustained increase in CTPA yield of patients with suspected PE.
