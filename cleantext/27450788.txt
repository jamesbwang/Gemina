  We examined the anti-inflammatory effects of ( +)- syringaresinol ( SGRS) , a lignan isolated from Rubia philippinensis , in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- stimulated RAW 264.7 cells using enzyme-based immuno assay , Western blotting , and RT-PCR analyses. Additionally , in vivo effects of SGRS in the acute inflammatory state were examined by using the carrageenan-induced hind paw edema<symptom> assay in experimental mice. As a result , treatment with SGRS ( 25 , 50 , and 100 μM) inhibited protein expression of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) as well as production of nitric oxide ( NO) , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) , interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β) , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) induced by LPS. Moreover , SGRS also reduced LPS-induced mRNA expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 , including NO , PGE2 , TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6 cytokines in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore , carrageenan-induced paw edema<symptom> assay validated the in vivo anti-edema effect of SGRS. Interestingly , SGRS ( 30 mg/kg) suppressed carrageenan-induced elevation of iNOS , COX-2 , TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6 mRNA levels as well as COX-2 and NF-κB protein levels , suggesting SGRS may possess anti-inflammatory activities.
