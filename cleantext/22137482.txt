  Ovarian cancer yields the highest mortality rate of all lethal gynecologic cancers , and the prognosis is unsatisfactory with the major obstacle in resistance to chemotherapy. The generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in tumor tissues was associated with chemotherapeutic effectiveness by mediating cellular longevity. In this study , we screened the prognostic values of oxidative stress-related genes in ovarian cancer patients received platinum-based chemotherapy , and conducted a prognostic gene signature composing of three genes ,
