  A 79-year old man with prostate cancer under active surveillance for 5 years was referred for a PSMA-PET/MRI for re-evaluation because of a rising prostate-specific antigen value. PET/MRI revealed a ribbonlike tracer accumulation in a healing fracture of the distal radius. This case illustrates that PSMA expression may occur in healing bone fractures in the distal radius. It can be assumed that benign causes of tracer accumulations in the upper extremities are missed in PET/CT due to elevated position of the arms during image acquisition.
