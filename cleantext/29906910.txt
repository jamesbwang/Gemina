  In this paper we study the transitions of stationary to pulsating solutions in the complex cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation ( CCQGLE) under the influence of nonlinear gain , its saturation , and higher-order effects: self-steepening , third-order of dispersion , and intrapulse Raman scattering in the anomalous dispersion region. The variation method and the method of moments are applied in order to obtain the dynamic models with finite degrees of freedom for the description of stationary and pulsating solutions. Having applied the first model and its bifurcation analysis we have discovered the existence of families of subcritical Poincaré-Andronov-Hopf bifurcations due to the intrapulse Raman scattering , as well as some small nonlinear gain and the saturation of the nonlinear gain. A phenomenon of nonlinear stability has been studied and it has been shown that long living pulsating solutions with relatively small fluctuations of amplitude and frequencies exist at the bifurcation point. The numerical analysis of the second model has revealed the existence of Poincaré-Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of Raman dissipative soliton under the influence of the self-steepening effect and large nonlinear gain. All our theoretical predictions have been confirmed by the direct numerical solution of the full perturbed CCQGLE. The detailed comparison between the results obtained by both dynamic models and the direct numerical solution of the perturbed CCQGLE has proved the applicability of the proposed models in the investigation of the solutions of the perturbed CCQGLE.
