  Many attempts to obtain high current rectification ratios ( RRs) in molecular electronics are triggered by a potentiometer rule argument , which predicts that a strongly asymmetric location of the dominant molecular orbital yields large RR-values. Invoking this argument , molecular junctions based on alkane monothiols ( CnT) can be expected to exhibit high RRs; the HOMO of these molecules is localized on the thiol terminal group bonded to one electrode. The extensive current-voltage (
