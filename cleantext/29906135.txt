  Experiments on self-diffusion in amorphous silicon ( Si) were performed at temperatures between 460 to 600 ° C. The amorphous structure was prepared by Si ion implantation of single crystalline Si isotope multilayers epitaxially grown on a silicon-on-insulator wafer. The Si isotope profiles before and after annealing were determined by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry. Isothermal diffusion experiments reveal that structural relaxation does not cause any significant intermixing of the isotope interfaces whereas self-diffusion is significant before the structure recrystallizes. The temperature dependence of self-diffusion is described by an Arrhenius law with an activation enthalpy Q = ( 2.70 ± 0.11) eV and preexponential factor D _ ( 0) = ( 5.5 _ ( -3.7) ^ ( +11.1)) × 10 ^ ( -2) cm ^ ( 2) s ^ ( -1). Remarkably , Q equals the activation enthalpy of hydrogen diffusion in amorphous Si , the migration of bond defects determining boron diffusion , and the activation enthalpy of solid phase epitaxial recrystallization reported in the literature. This close agreement provides strong evidence that self-diffusion is mediated by local bond rearrangements rather than by the migration of extended defects as suggested by Strauß et al. ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 , 025901 ( 2016) PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/ PhysRevLett .116.025901).
