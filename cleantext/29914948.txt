  None Prospective study involving 21 consecutive burn patients receiving amoxicillin. PK data were analysed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Monte-Carlo simulations assessed the influence of various amoxicillin dosage regimens with identified covariates on the probability to achieve a target ( PTA) value of time during which free amoxicillin concentrations in plasma exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (
