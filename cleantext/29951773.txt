  The introduction of ambient ionization at atmospheric pressure for mass spectrometry ( AI-MS) attracted the interest of many researchers in the field and various ionization techniques have been described in recent years that allow a quick and easy-to-handle analysis of samples under ambient conditions without or with only minor sample preparation. Among those , plasma-based techniques including the low-temperature plasma probe require very little resources thereby providing great potential for implementation in mobile analytical devices. However , systematic studies on signal responsiveness with this technique , such as the influence of the analyte and matrix characteristics on relative signal intensity , are still rare. Therefore , we used a low-temperature plasma source based on dielectric barrier discharge with helium as process gas to assess influencing factors on signal intensity in mass spectrometry. Among 12 tested molecular descriptors , in particular a low vaporization enthalpy and a large molecular nonpolar surface area improve the relative signal intensity. In addition , we show that the impact of compound characteristics strongly outperforms the influence of simple sample matrices such as different organic solvents and water , with a weak trend that volatile solvents tend to decrease the signal responsiveness of the analytes. However , several specific solvent-analyte interactions occurred , which have to be considered in targeted applications of this method. Our results will help further in improving the implementation and standardization of low-temperature plasma ionization for ambient mass spectrometry and understanding the requirements and selectivity of this technique.
