  Dual-specificity phosphatase ( DUSP) 14 ( also known as MAP-kinase phosphatase 6) inhibits T-cell receptor ( TCR) signaling and T-cell-mediated immune responses by inactivation of the TGF-β activated kinase 1 binding protein ( TAB1)- TGF-β activated kinase 1 ( TAK1) complex<pathogen> and ERK. DUSP14 phosphatase activity is induced by the E3 ligase TNF receptor associated factor ( TRAF) 2-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination. Here we report an interaction between DUSP14 and protein arginine methyltransferase ( PRMT) 5 by proximity ligation assay; similarly , DUSP14 directly interacted with TAB1 but not TAK1. DUSP14 is methylated by PRMT5 at arginine 17 , 38 , and 45 residues. The DUSP14 triple-methylation mutant was impaired in PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation , TRAF2-mediated lysine ubiquitination , and DUSP14 phosphatase activity. Consistently , DUSP14 methylation , TRAF2 binding , and DUSP14 ubiquitination were attenuated by PRMT5 short hairpin RNA knockdown. Furthermore , DUSP14 was inducibly interacted with PRMT5 and was methylated during TCR signaling in T cells. Together , these findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of DUSP14 by which PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation may sequentially stimulate TRAF2-mediated DUSP14 ubiquitination and phosphatase activity , leading to inhibition of TCR signaling.-Yang , C.-Y. , Chiu , L.-L. , Chang , C.-C. , Chuang , H.-C. , Tan , T.-H.
