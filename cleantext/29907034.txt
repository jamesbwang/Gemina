  We study the solvation free energy of two different conformations ( helix and extended) of two different peptides ( deca-alanine and deca-glycine) in two different solvents ( water and aqueous guanidinium chloride , GdmCl). The free energies are obtained using the quasichemical organization of the potential distribution theorem , an approach that naturally provides the repulsive ( solvophobic or cavity) and attractive ( solvophilic) contributions to solvation. The solvophilic contribution is further parsed into a chemistry contribution arising from solute interaction with the solvent in the first solvation shell and a long-range contribution arising from non-specific interactions between the solute and the solvent beyond the first solvation shell. The cavity contribution is obtained for two different envelopes , Î£
