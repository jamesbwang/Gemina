  Human hair dermal papilla ( DP) cells are specialized mesenchymal cells that play a pivotal role in hair regeneration and hair cycle activation. The current study aimed to first develop three-dimensional ( 3D) DP spheroids ( DPS) with or without a silk-gelatin ( SG) microenvironment , which showed enhanced DP-specific gene expression , resulting in enhanced extracellular matrix ( ECM) production compared with a monolayer culture. We tested the feasibility of using this DPS model for drug screening by using minoxidil , which is a standard drug for androgenic alopecia. Minoxidil-treated DPS showed enhanced expression of growth factors and ECM proteins. Further , an attempt has been made to establish an in vitro 3D organoid model consisting of DPS encapsulated by SG hydrogel and hair follicle ( HF) keratinocytes and stem cells. This HF organoid model showed the importance of structural features , cell-cell interaction , and hypoxia akin to in vivo HF. The study helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms to stimulate cell proliferation , cell viability , and elevated expression of HF markers as well as epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalks , demonstrating high relevance to human HF biology. This simple in vitro DP organoid model system has the potential to provide significant insights into the underlying mechanisms of HF morphogenesis , distinct molecular signals relevant to different stages of the hair cycle , and hence can be used for controlled evaluation of the efficacy of new drug molecules.
