  Externally controlling the excitation of a neuronal subset through ion channels activation can modulate the firing pattern of an entire neural circuit in vivo. As nanovalves in the cell membrane , ion channels can be opened by light ( optogenetics) or ultrasonic ( sonogenetics) means. A thoroughly analyzed force sensor is the Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> mechano sensitive channel of large conductance ( MscL). Here we expressed MscL in rat hippocampal neurons in a primary culture and showed that it could be activated by low-pressure ultrasound pulses. The gain-of-function mutation , I92L , sensitized MscL 's sonic response , triggering action potentials at a peak negative pressure as low as 0.25 MPa. Further , the I92L MscL reliably elicited individual spikes by timed brief pulses , making excitation programmable. Because MscL opens to tension in the lipid bilayer , requiring no other proteins or ligands , it could be developed into a general noninvasive sonogenetic tool to manipulate the activities of neurons or other cells and potential nanodevices.
