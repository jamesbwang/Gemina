  Two-photon active probe to label apoptotic cells plays a significant role in biological systems. However , discrimination of live/apoptotic cells at subcellular level under microscopy remains unachieved. Here , three novel Zn ( II) terpyridine-based nitrate complexes ( C1-C3) containing different pull/push units were designed. The structures of the ligands and their corresponding Zn ( II) complexes were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. On the basis of the comprehensive comparison , C3 had a suitable two-photon absorption cross section in the near-infrared wavelength and good biocompatibility. Under two-photon confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy , it is found that C3 could target mitochondria in living cells but immigrate into the nucleolus during the apoptotic process. This dual-functional probe ( C3) not only offers a valuable image tool but also acts as an indicator for cell mortality at subcellular level in a real-time manner.
