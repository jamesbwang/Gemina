  P-bodies are liquid droplet-like compartments that lack a limiting membrane and are present in many eukaryotic cells. These structures contain specific sets of proteins and mRNAs at concentrations higher than that in the surrounding environment. Although highly conserved , the normal physiological roles of these ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) granules remain poorly defined. Here , we report that P-bodies are required for the efficient completion of meiosis in the budding yeast ,
