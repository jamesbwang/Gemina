  Gyrovirus 3 ( GyV3) has been identified in faeces from children with acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<symptom> However , whether GyV3 is prevalent in poultry has not been determined to date. To the best of our knowledge , this study is the first to isolate GyV3 from commercial broiler chickens with transmissible viral proventriculitis ( TVP) in China. The complete genome of the virus shares 98.4 % sequence identity with the FecGy strain that causes acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<symptom> in children. Epidemiological investigation from 2013 to 2017 revealed that the infection rate of GyV3 reached 12.5 % ( 42/336) in commercial broiler chickens with TVP , indicating that the infection of GyV3 was ubiquitous in chickens. The emergence of GyV3 in commercial broiler chickens should be highly concerning for public health.
