  Chronic wasting disease ( CWD) , a fatal neurodegenerative prion disease of cervids , has spread across North<pathogen> America and has been detected in The Republic of Korea , Finland and Norway. CWD appears to spread by horizontal transmission , and prions shed in saliva , feces and urine are thought to contribute. However , studies investigating the rapid spread of CWD have been hampered by assay inhibitors and a lack of consistent and sensitive means to detect the relatively low levels of prions in these samples. Here we show that saliva frequently contains an inhibitor of the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay ( RT-QuIC) , and that the inhibitor is a member of the mucin family. To circumvent the inhibitor , we developed a modified PMCA method to amplify CWD prions in saliva that were undetectable or ambiguous by RT-QuIC. Our results reinforce the impact of saliva in horizontal CWD transmission and highlight the importance of detection optimization.
