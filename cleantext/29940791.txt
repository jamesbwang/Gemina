  The membrane origins of autophagosomes have been a key unresolved question in the field. The earliest morphologically recognizable structure in the macroautophagy/autophagy itinerary is the double-membraned cup-shaped phagophore. Newly formed phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ( PtdIns3P) on the membranes<symptom> destined to become phagophores recruits WIPI2 , which , in turn , binds ATG16L1 to define the sites of autophagosome formation. Here we review our recent study showing that membrane recruitment of WIPI2 requires coincident detection of PtdIns3P and RAB11A , a protein that marks recycling endosomes. We found that multiple core autophagy proteins are more tightly associated with the recycling endosome compartment than with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER)- mitochondrial contact sites. Furthermore , biochemical isolation of the recycling endosomes confirmed that they recruit autophagy proteins. Finally , fixed and live-cell imaging data revealed that recycling endosomes engulf autophagic substrates. Indeed , the sequestration of mitochondria after mitophagy stimulation depends on early autophagy regulators. These data suggest that autophagosomes evolve from the RAB11A compartment.
