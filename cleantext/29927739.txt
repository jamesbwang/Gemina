  This study assessed the critical aspect of individual staff attitudes and readiness for change within staff at a non-profit human service organization in Anchorage , Alaska , committed to adopting trauma-informed care ( TIC). Organizational research has highlighted that staff attitudes and readiness impact the success of change efforts. An online survey was used to measure staff knowledge about trauma , attitudes toward TIC , and readiness for change. A significant finding was that attitudes favorable toward TIC were positively associated with higher readiness for change. Human service organizations have sought to become more responsive to the needs of clients that have experienced trauma by adopting TIC. Prior to change efforts , it is critical that organizations consider staff readiness. As awareness about the prevalence and impact of trauma is increasing , these significant findings have implications for other agencies adopting TIC.
