  An anatomically based assessment scale of handwashing quality with alcohol-based hand rub was designed. Contents of the scale divided each hand into 40 zones. Psychometric measurements were studied in 30 participants ( 120 hand sides). The scale was both valid ( Cronbach α: 0 · 83 dorsal side and 0 · 73 palmar side) and reproducible ( linear regression R2 , 0 · 91; intraclass correlation coefficient , 0 · 99).
