  We report the case of a 14-year-old boy with pectus excavatum who developed a metal allergy to stainless steel bar as a late-onset complication after the Nuss procedure. He did not have atopic diathesis. Treatment with oral steroids was effective and the metal bar was successfully removed 2 years later.
