  Detection of an ultralow concentration of mRNA is important in the prognosis of gene-related diseases. In this study , a DNA-conjugated amphiphilic aggregation-induced emission probe ( TPE-R-DNA) was synthesized for cancer tissue imaging and prognosis analysis based on an exonuclease III-aided target recycling technique. TPE-R-DNA comprise two components: a hydrophobic component that serves as the `` turn-on '' long wavelength fluorescence imaging agent ( TPE-R-N
