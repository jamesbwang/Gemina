  An in vivo experimental model based on implanting porous biomaterials to study angiogenesis was proposed. In the implanted porous polyvinyl alcohol , three major modes of angiogenesis , sprouting , intussusception and splitting , were found. By electron microscopy and three-dimensional simulation of the angiogenic vessels , we investigated the morphological characteristics of the three modes and paid special attention to the initial morphological difference between intussusception and splitting , and it was confirmed that the endothelial abluminal invagination and intraluminal protrusion are pre-representations of intussusception and splitting , respectively. Based on immunohistochemical analysis of HIF-1Î± , VEGF and Flt-1 expressions , it was demonstrated that the dominant mode of angiogenesis is related to the local hypoxic condition , and that there is difference in the response of endothelial cells to hypoxia-induced VEGF between sprouting and splitting. Specifically , in the biomaterials implanted for 3 days , the higher expression and gradient of VEGF induced by severe hypoxia in the avascular area caused sprouting of the peripheral capillaries , and in the biomaterial implanted for 9 days , with moderate hypoxia , splitting became a dominant mode. Whether on day 3 or day 9 , Flt-1 expression in sprouting endothelia was significantly higher than that in splitting endothelia , which indicates that sprouting is caused by the strong response of endothelial cells to VEGF , while splitting is associated with their weaker response. As a typical experimental example , these results show the effectiveness of the porous biomaterial implantation model for studying angiogenesis , which is expected to become a new general model.
