  The recently derived steady-state generalized Danckwerts age distribution is extended to unsteady-state conditions. For three different wind speeds used by researchers on air-water heat exchange on the Heidelberg Aeolotron , calculations reveal that the distribution has a sharp peak during the initial moments , but flattens out and acquires a bell-shaped character with process time , with the time taken to attain a steady-state profile being a strong and inverse function of wind speed. With increasing wind speed , the age distribution narrows significantly , its skewness decreases and its peak becomes larger. The mean eddy renewal time increases linearly with process time initially but approaches a final steady-state value asymptotically , which decreases dramatically with increased wind speed. Using the distribution to analyse the transient absorption of a gas into a large body of liquid , assuming negligible gas-side mass-transfer resistance , estimates are made of the gas-absorption and dissolved-gas transfer coefficients for oxygen absorption in water at 25 °C for the three different wind speeds. Under unsteady-state conditions , these two coefficients show an inverse behaviour , indicating a heightened accumulation of dissolved gas in the surface elements , especially during the initial moments of absorption. However , the two mass-transfer coefficients start merging together as the steady state is approached. Theoretical predictions of the steady-state mass-transfer coefficient or transfer velocity are in fair agreement ( average absolute error of prediction = 18.1 %) with some experimental measurements of the same for the nitrous oxide-water system at 20 °C that were made in the Heidelberg Aeolotron.
