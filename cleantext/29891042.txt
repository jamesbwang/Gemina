  Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside ( TSG) is an active ingredient of Heshouwu and is an antioxidant. The underlying mechanisms of the renoprotective effect of TSG in diabetic nephropathy have not been previously reported. In this study , we investigated the mechanisms of TSG in preventing podocytes injury in high glucose ( HG) condition. Cultured mouse podocytes ( MPC5) were incubated in HG ( 30mmol/L) plus various concentration of TSG ( 0.1 , 1 and 10μM) for 48 hours. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production , malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels , terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase ( TdT)- mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling ( TUNEL) fluorescence intensity , caspase-3 activity and the mRNA expression of nephrin in cultured podocytes were determined. The protein expression of Nod-like receptor protein 3 ( NLRP3) inflammsome , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) and nephrin was detected by Western blot. When the podocytes were incubated with various concentrations of TSG under HG conditions for 48 hours , TSG decreased ROS production , MDA levels , TUNEL fluorescence intensity and caspase-3 activity , but increased cell viability and the expression of nephrin in HG-induced podocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently , the podocytes treated with TSG at 10 μΜ decreased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β compared with that of control. Furthermore , the podocytes transfected with NLRP3- small interfering RNA ( siRNA) exhibited a significant decrease in the expression of caspase-1 and IL-1β , but exhibited a significant increase in the expression of nephrin. Eventually , TSG significantly increased the expression of nephrin in IL-1β-treated podocytes. TSG attenuates high glucose-induced cell apoptosis in vitro partly through the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.
