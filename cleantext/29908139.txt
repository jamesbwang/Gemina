  Metarhizium<pathogen> robertsii , a butyltin-resistant filamentous fungus , can rapid and complete biodegradation of di- ( DBT) and tributyltin ( TBT) under conditions of intensive aeration and ascorbic acid supplementation. In this paper , lipidomic investigations were performed to find the membrane adaptations necessary for effective butyltins degradation. HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed that the phospholipid profile was greatly modified during M. robertsii batch cultivation ( pO
