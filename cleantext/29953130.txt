  Owing to the relatively small population sizes and remoteness of the Small Island Development States ( SIDS) , their mental health systems face many common difficulties. These include having few mental health specialists per country , limited access to mental health services and low awareness. To overcome these limitations , the World Health Organization ( WHO -RRB- Mental Health Gap Action Programme ( mhGAP) , which aims to decrease the treatment gap by training non-specialists , was implemented in more than 20 Pacific and English-speaking Caribbean countries. Many lessons were learnt from the experience. Mental health specialist support is crucial , and online training and supervision could be a solution. mhGAP training proved to be effective to improve knowledge and attitude , but close monitoring and supervision are needed to change clinical practice. Awareness raising and mental health service capacity building need to occur simultaneously. To realise sustainable development goals , countries need to invest more in mental health , especially in human resources; mhGAP will be one effective solution.
