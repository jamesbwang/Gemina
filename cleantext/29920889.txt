  The preparation of nanosized zeolites is critical for applications where mass-transport limitations within microporous networks hinder their performance. Often the ability to generate ultrasmall zeolite crystals is dependent upon the use of expensive organics with limited commercial relevance. Herein , we report the generation of zeolite L crystals with uniform sizes less than 30 nm using a facile , organic-free method. Time-resolved analysis of precursor assembly and evolution during nonclassical crystallization highlights key differences among silicon sources. Our findings reveal that a homogenous dispersion of potassium ions throughout silicate precursors leads to the formation of a metastable nonporous phase , which undergoes an intercrystalline transformation to zeolite L. The generation of highly interdispersed alkali-silicate precursors is seemingly critical to enhancing the rate of nucleation and facilitating the formation of ultrasmall crystal.
