  A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) for the prophylaxis of chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD) in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). Six studies involving 365 patients were included. The pooled results showed that MSCs significantly reduced the incidence of cGVHD ( risk ratio ( RR) 0.63 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.46 to 0.86 , P = 0.004). Favorable prophylactic effects of MSCs on cGVHD were observed with umbilical cord-derived , high-dose , and late-infusion MSCs , while bone marrow-derived , low-dose , and coinfused MSCs did not confer beneficial prophylactic effects. In addition , MSC infusion did not increase the risk of primary<disease> disease<disease> relapse and infection ( RR 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.70 to 1.50 , P = 0.913; RR 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.44 to 1.81 , P = 0.752; respectively). Moreover , there was an apparent trend toward increased overall survival ( OS) in the MSC group compared with that in the control group ( RR 1.13 , 95 % CI 0.98 to 1.29 , P = 0.084). In conclusion , this meta-analysis demonstrated that MSC infusion is an effective and safe prophylactic strategy for cGVHD in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allo-HSCT.
