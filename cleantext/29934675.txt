  Resting-state functional MRI ( rs-fMRI) has revealed the existence of a default-mode network ( DMN) based on spontaneous oscillations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) signal. The BOLD signal reflects the deoxyhemoglobin concentration , which depends on the relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow ( CBF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen ( CMRO Nine healthy volunteers ( 5 men and 4 women; mean age , 47.0 Â± 1.2 years) were studied by means of Significant positive correlations ( r > 0.7) were observed in 24 pairs of brain regions for the CBF and 22 pairs of brain regions for the CMRO We estimated the functional correlations in the DMN by means of quantitative PET using
