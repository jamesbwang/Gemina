  It is well-known that the Holocene exhibits a millennial-scale climate variability. However , its periodicity , spatio-temporal patterns and underlying processes are not fully deciphered yet. Here we focus on the central and western Mediterranean. We show that recurrent forest<disease> declines from the Gulf of Gaeta ( central Tyrrhenian Sea) reveal a 1860-yr periodicity , consistent with a ca. 1800-yr climate fluctuation induced by large-scale changes in climate modes , linked to solar activity and/or AMOC intensity. We show that recurrent forest<disease> declines and dry events are also recorded in several pollen and palaeohydrological proxy-records in the south-central Mediterranean. We found coeval events also in several palaeohydrological records from the south-western Mediterranean , which however show generally wet climate conditions , indicating a spatio-temporal hydrological pattern opposite to the south-central Mediterranean and suggesting that different expressions of climate modes occurred in the two regions at the same time. We propose that these opposite hydroclimate regimes point to a complex interplay of the prevailing or predominant phases of NAO-like circulation , East Atlantic pattern , and extension and location of the North African anticyclone. At a larger geographical scale , displacements of the ITCZ , modulated by solar activity and/or AMOC intensity , may have also indirectly influenced the observed pattern.
