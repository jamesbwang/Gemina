  Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease that affects large and medium-sized arteries. Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and subsequent acute cardiovascular complications remain a leading cause of death and morbidity in the Western world. There is a considerable difference in safety profile between a stable and a vulnerable , rupture-prone lesion<symptom>. The need for plaque-stabilizing therapies is high , and for a long time the lack of a suitable animal model mimicking advanced human atherosclerotic plaques made it very difficult to make progress in this area. Evidence from human plaques indicates that intra-plaque ( IP) angiogenesis promotes atherosclerosis and plaque destabilization. Although neovascularization has been widely investigated in cancer , studies on the pharmacological inhibition of this phenomenon in atherosclerosis are scarce , mainly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model.
