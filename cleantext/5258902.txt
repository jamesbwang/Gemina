  We describe a case of maxillofacial trauma in a pediatric patient in whom the mandibular condyle was superolaterally displaced into the temporal fossa , medial to the zygomatic arch which was intact. In addition , there was an associated mandibular symphyseal fracture. To our knowledge , this case is the first of its kind to be reported in the literature. We also observed a complication in the form of development of ankylosis in the involved joint which required another surgery.
