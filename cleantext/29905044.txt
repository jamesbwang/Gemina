  To analyze the correlation between the polymorphism on interleukin 6 ( IL-6) gene promoter region-174 locus and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS) , including the susceptibility , the bracing effectiveness , and the possible mechanism. The 182 AIS patients and 210 healthy controls who met the inclusion criteria between January 2013 and January 2016 were collected as research objects. The genotype of IL-6 gene promoter region-174 locus , the serum IL-6 , the bone mineral density ( BMD) of femoral neck and vertebrae ( L There were significant differences in AIS history , BMD of femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae between the AIS group and control group ( The polymorphism of IL-6 genepromoter region-174 locus was n't correlated with the AIS susceptibility , but it was correlated ( not independently correlated) with the scoliosis progression under bracing treatment , and the risk for G-carried patients was higher. The mechanism may be that the polymorphism affected the IL-6 expression level and eventually affected the BMD of AIS patients through the bone metabolism.
