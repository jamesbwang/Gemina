  Prior research with a rat model of behavioral therapy ( i.e. , effort-based reward ( EBR) contingency training) suggests that strengthened associations between physical effort and desired outcomes enhance neurobiological indices of resilience. In the current study , male and female Long-Evans rats were exposed to either six weeks of EBR training or noncontingent training prior to 10 days of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress ( CUS). Subsequently , all animals were exposed to a problem-solving task and then trained in a spatial learning/foraging task , the Dry Land Maze ( DLM). Following habituation training and test trials , rats were assessed in a probe trial that generated a prediction error ( cognitive uncertainty). Results indicated that , during CUS exposure , contingency-training enhanced dehydroepiandrosterone/corticosterone ratios ( consistent with healthier stress responses) , especially in male rats. Additionally , contingency training increased exploratory behaviors in the probe trial as well as differentially influenced on-task problem-solving performance in males and females. Following the probe trial , brains were exposed to histological analyses to determine the effects of sex and contingency training on various neurobiological markers. Contingency training decreased BDNF-immunoreactivity ( ir) in the hippocampus CA1 and lateral habenula , implicating differential neuroplasticity responses in the training groups. Further , coordinated fos-ir activation in areas associated with emotional resilience ( i.e. , motivation-regulation) was observed in contingent-trained animals. In sum , the current findings confirm that behavioral training is associated with neurobiological markers of emotional resilience; however , further assessments are necessary to more accurately determine the therapeutic potential for the EBR contingency training model.
