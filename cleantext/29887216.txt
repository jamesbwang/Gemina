  Development of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( sHLH) in the context of typhoid fever<disease> ( TF) is a very rare but serious complication. Description of the first pediatric case of typhoid fever<disease> acquired in a non-endemic area complicated by sHLH. A systematic literature review of sHLH in the context of TF was performed with extraction of epidemiological , clinical and laboratory data. The literature search revealed 17 articles ( 22 patients). Fifteen patients were eligible for data analysis ( 53.4 % children). All patients had fever<disease> and pancytopenia. Transaminases and LDH were frequently elevated ( 46.6 %). Salmonella<disease> typhi<disease> was detected mainly by blood culture ( 64.3 %). All the patients received antibiotics whereas immunomodulation ( dexamethasone) was used in two cases. A high suspicion index for this condition is needed even in non-endemic areas. The addition of immunmodulation to standard antimicrobial therapy should be considered in selected cases.
