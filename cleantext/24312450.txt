  Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) evaluated in primary breast cancer ( BC) convey prognostic information. Limited data in the metastatic setting are available. Secondary lesions<symptom> from 94 BC patients , 43 triple-negative ( TN) and 51 HER2-positive , were evaluated for TILs and expression of CD8 , FOXP3 , and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. TILs levels on metastasis were generally low ( median 5 %) and did not differ between TN and HER2 + tumors. Younger patients showed significantly lower TILs ( p = 0.002). In HER2 + patients , TILs were higher in lung metastases as compared to other sites ( p = 0.038). TILs composition was different across metastatic sites: skin metastases presented higher FOXP3 ( p = 0.002) and lower CD8/FOXP3 ratio ( p = 0.032). Patients treated for metastatic BC prior to biopsy had lower CD8 ( overall: p = 0.005 , HER2 +: p = 0.011 , TN: p = 0.075). In TN patients , median overall survival ( OS) was 11.8 and 62.9 months for patients with low and high TILs , respectively ( HR 0.29 , 95 % CI 0.11-0.76 , log-rank p = 0.008). CD8/FOXP3 ratio was also prognostic in TN patients ( median OS 8.0 , 13.2 , and 54.0 months in 1st , 2nd and 3th tertile , log-rank p = 0.019). Both TILs and CD8/FOXP3 ratio were independent factors at multivariate analysis. Counterintuitively , in HER2 + BC , low TILs tumors showed better prognosis ( median OS 53.7 vs 39.9 months in TILs low and TILs high , not statistically significant). Our findings indicate the relevance of TILs as prognostic biomarker for TNBC even in the advanced setting and provide novel hypothesis-generating data on potential sources of immune heterogeneity of metastatic BC.
