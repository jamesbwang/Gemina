  In this analysis , we aimed to systematically compare stent thrombosis ( ST) and its different subtypes following treatment with DAPT ( aspirin + clopidogrel) versus TAPT ( aspirin + clopidogrel + cilostazol). Studies were included if: they were randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing TAPT ( cilostazol + aspirin + clopidogrel) with DAPT ( aspirin + clopidogrel); they reported ST or its subtype including definite , probable , acute , sub-acute and late ST as their clinical outcomes. RevMan software ( version 5.3) was used to carry out this analysis whereby odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were generated. Statistical analysis of the data showed no significant difference in total ST with the addition of cilostazol to the standard DAPT with OR: 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.38-1.10; P = 0.11 , I This current analysis showed no significant difference in stent thrombosis with the addition of cilostazol to the standard dual antiplatelet therapy during any follow-up time period after PCI.
