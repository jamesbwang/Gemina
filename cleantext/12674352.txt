  The aim of this study is to compare semilunar vestibular incision technique with pouch and tunnel technique in combination with A-PRF and L-PRF for treatment of Miller 's class I and II multiple gingival recessions. This is a randomized , controlled , double-blinded , split mouth<symptom> study which consists of 16 systemically healthy patients with 96 sites and a mean age of 34.2 years , and divided randomly into 2 groups , Group A consists of semilunar vestibular incision technique sandwiched with A-PRF and L-PRF and Group B consists of Pouch and tunnel technique sandwiched with A-PRF and L-PRF. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline , 3 months and 6 months which include plaque index , gingival index , recession depth , recession width , clinical attachment loss and width of keratinized tissue. All the clinical parameters showed significantly better levels for both the groups from baseline to 6 months. Semilunar vestibular incision technique showed greater significance when compared to pouch and tunnel technique from baseline to 6 months post operatively. The combination of A-PRF and L-PRF with pouch and tunnel technique and semilunar vestibular technique showed better outcome 6 months post operatively. Semilunar vestibular incision technique showed promising results than pouch and tunnel technique for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.
