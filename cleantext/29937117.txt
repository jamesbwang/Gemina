  Proper soft tissue balance<symptom> is crucial for a successful clinical outcome after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Bi-cruciate substituting ( BCS)- TKA has been developed to more closely approximate normal knee characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate midflexion laxity before and after BCS-TKA using a navigation system , and assess the correlation between intraoperative laxity and the maximum flexion angle after surgery. Fifty-one knees in 46 patients with osteoarthritis replaced with BCS prosthesis were assessed. Manual mild passive internal-external rotational and varus-valgus stress was applied to the knees , and the maximum total laxity was measured automatically by a navigation system before and after TKA. The correlations with the range of motion ( ROM) were evaluated using Spearman 's correlation coefficients ( ρ). Internal-external stress assessment revealed no statistically significant difference at each flexion angle before and after BCS-TKA. In contrast , the varus-valgus stress assessment revealed that BCS-TKA had significantly decreased varus-valgus laxity from preoperative levels at 20-120 ° flexion angles. Furthermore , the maximum flexion angle at six months after surgery significantly correlated with the intraoperative laxity at deep flexion range. BCS-TKA stabilized varus-valgus laxity to better than preoperative levels at midflexion range.
