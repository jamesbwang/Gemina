  From a cognitive perspective , lying can be regarded as a complex cognitive process requiring the interplay of several executive functions. Meta-analytic research on 114 studies encompassing 3,307 participants ( Suchotzki , Verschuere , Van Bockstaele , Ben-Shakhar , & Crombez ,) suggests that computerized paradigms can reliably assess the cognitive burden of lying , with large reaction time differences between lying and truth telling. These studies , however , lack a key ingredient of real-life deception , namely self-initiated behavior. Research participants have typically been instructed to commit a mock crime and conceal critical information , whereas in real life , people freely choose whether or not to engage in antisocial behavior. In this study , participants ( n = 433) engaged in a trivia quiz and were provided with a monetary incentive for high accuracy performance. Participants were randomly allocated to either a condition where they were instructed to cheat on the quiz ( mimicking the typical laboratory set-up) or to a condition in which they were provided with the opportunity to cheat , yet without explicit instructions to do so. Assessments of their response times in a subsequent Concealed Information Test ( CIT) revealed that both instructed cheaters ( n = 107) and self-initiated cheaters ( n = 142) showed the expected RT-slowing for concealed information. The data indicate that the cognitive signature of lying is not restricted to explicitly instructed cheating , but it can also be observed for self-initiated cheating. These findings are highly encouraging from an ecological validity perspective.
