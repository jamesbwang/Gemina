  The value of carotid intervention is predicated on long-term survival for patients to derive a stroke prevention benefit. Randomized trials report no significant difference in survival after carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) vs carotid artery stenting ( CAS) , whereas observational studies of `` real-world '' outcomes note that CEA is associated with a survival advantage. Our objective was to examine long-term mortality after CEA vs CAS using a propensity-matched cohort. We studied all patients who underwent CEA or CAS within the Vascular Quality Initiative from 2003 to 2013 ( CEA , n = 29,235; CAS , n = 4415). Long-term mortality information was obtained by linking patients in the registry to their respective Medicare claims file. We assessed the long-term rate of mortality for CEA and CAS using Kaplan-Meier estimation. We assessed the crude , adjusted , and propensity-matched ( total matched pairs , n = 4261) hazard ratio ( HR) of mortality for CEA vs CAS using Cox regression. The unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year mortality was 14.0 % for CEA and 18.3 % for CAS. The crude HR of all-cause mortality for CEA vs CAS was 0.75 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.70-0.81) , indicating that patients who underwent CEA were 25 % less likely to die before those who underwent CAS. This survival advantage persisted after adjustment for age , sex , and comorbidities ( adjusted HR , 0.75; 95 % CI , 0.69-0.82). This effect was confirmed on a propensity-matched analysis , with an HR of 0.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.69-0.85). Finally , these findings were robust to subanalyses that stratified patients by presenting symptoms and were more pronounced in symptomatic patients ( adjusted HR , 0.69; 95 % CI , 0.61-0.79) than in asymptomatic patients ( adjusted HR , 0.80; 95 % CI , 0.71-0.90). During the last 15 years , patients who underwent CEA in the Vascular Quality Initiative have a long-term survival advantage over those who underwent CAS in real-world practice. Despite no difference in long-term survival in randomized trials , our observational study demonstrated a survival benefit for CEA that did not diminish with risk adjustment.
