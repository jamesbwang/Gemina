  To investigate the concordance between dominant intraprostatic cancer seen on endorectal multiparametric MRI and confirmed by MRI-targeted biopsy with histopathological findings at radical prostatectomy , since existing literature has emphasized the miss rather than the concordance rate of MRI. We retrospectively identified 20 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy after a dominant intraprostatic cancer focus was identified at endorectal multiparametric MRI and confirmed by MRI-targeted biopsy. Concordance was determined by comparing the location and Gleason grade group of dominant tumor at MRI with the location and Gleason grade group determined at histopathological review. Mean patient age was 65 years ( range , 48 to 76) and median serum prostatic specific antigen level was 9.4 ng/mL ( range , 4.6 to 58.0). In all 20 patients , the location of dominant tumor based on MRI and targeted biopsy corresponded with the dominant tumor location at histopathology. In 9 patients , Gleason grade group was the same at targeted biopsy and final histopathology. In 9 patients , final Gleason grade group was higher and in two patients it was lower. Our preliminary results suggest dominant tumor as determined by endorectal multiparametric MRI and confirmed by a positive MRI-targeted biopsy has high concordance with histopathological findings at radical prostatectomy for location , and reasonable concordance for Gleason grade group.
