  The use of noninvasive ventilation in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction may increase cardiac performance by decreasing inspiratory effort and left-ventricular afterload. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute effects of noninvasive ventilation on central-venous oxygen saturation ( S This study included 100 subjects during the postoperative phase of elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Blood samples , at 5 time points , were collected to assess tissue perfusion markers ( ie , S A significant increase in the blood lactate and a drop in the S The acute application of noninvasive ventilation improved S
