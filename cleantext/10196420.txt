  Periprosthetic fracture following total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is usually associated with a traumatic event and typically treated with fracture fixation techniques. However , we report on a series of patients with early atraumatic condyle fractures that occurred as a result of insufficiency of the unloaded preoperative femoral condyle treated with delayed reconstruction. We retrospectively reviewed a series of 7 patients who sustained femoral condyle fractures following TKA and evaluated risk factors for insufficiency. There were 6 females and 1 male with an average age of 65.5 ( range , 63-75) years and an average body mass index of 29.4 ( range , 27-32). Fracture occurred on average 24.9 days from the index surgery and secondary to a low energy mechanism. Five patients had valgus alignment ( mean , 15.2 °) preoperatively and sustained fracture of the unloaded medial femoral condyle. Two patients had varus alignment ( mean , 7.0 °) preoperatively and both fractured the unloaded lateral condyle. One patient underwent early intervention requiring distal femoral replacement secondary to femoral bone loss. The remaining 6 patients underwent delayed surgery for an average of 6 weeks to allow for fracture healing followed by femoral component revision. At last follow-up ( average , 48.5 months) , 1 patient required a tibial component revision; however , no revision of the femoral component was required. Early femoral condyle insufficiency fractures following TKA may be a risk in females with poor bone quality and preoperative valgus alignment. Delayed surgery and femoral component revision is a treatment strategy that prevented the need for other tertiary reconstruction.
