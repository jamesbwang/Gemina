  The dummies currently used for predicting vehicle occupant response during frontal crashes or whole-body vibration provide insufficient information about spinal loads. Although they aptly approximate upper-body rotations in different loading scenarios , they overlook spinal loads , which are crucial to injury assessment. This paper aims to develop a modified dummy finite element ( FE) model with a detailed viscoelastic lumbar spine. This model has been developed and validated against in-vitro and in-silico data under different loading conditions , and its predicted ranges of motion ( RoM) and intradiscal pressure ( IDP) maintain close correspondence with the in-vitro data. The dominant frequency of the model was f = 8.92 Hz , which was close to previous results. In the relaxation test , a force reduction of up to 21 % was obtained , showing high agreement in force relaxation during the in-vitro test. The FE lumbar spine model was placed in the HYBRID III test dummy and aligned in a seated position based on available MRI data. Under two impulsive acceleration loadings in flexion and lateral directions with a peak acceleration of 60 m/s
