  Probing the electrical response of the human body is minimally invasive and a promising area of investigation for future health care. The electrical responses of individuals may vary depending on daily physiological rhythms or environmental changes , which may hamper their prediction for pathological status. In this study , we observed circadian expressions via both alternating current ( AC) and direct current ( DC) electrical responses of the human body using bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA) and electrodermal activity ( EDA). In total , 14 healthy adults ( 9 males and 5 females) participated and were hospitalized for 2 nights<symptom> with controlled caloric intake , sleep hours and residential conditions. The EDA data showed a significant circadian rhythm , but the BIA data did not show significant modulations during the measurement period. No difference was found between circadian changes in male and female participants. The acrophase of the EDA voltage response showed similar behavior with variations in the heart rate variability , with a resistance minimum occurring at approximately 4 pm , implying that the behavior of the EDA is probably affected by the sympathetic nerve response. Moreover , the resistance of the EDA varied by up to 15 % from its mean value , which suggests that circadian variations can not be neglected for the correct diagnosis of pathological conditions. In contrast , the BIA method did not show this circadian variation but showed independent results over the measurement period. This difference in performance implies that the DC and AC responses of the human body contain different electrophysiological information.
