  Since elevated osteoclast formation and/or activity by inhibitory responses against pathogens leads to diverse osteolytic bone diseases including periodontitis<disease> , inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption has been a primary therapeutic strategy. In this study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel benzamide-linked molecule , OCLI-070 , for preventing alveolar bone loss in mice with ligature-induced experimental periodontitis<disease> OCLI-070 inhibited osteoclast formation by acting on both early and late stages of differentiation , and attenuated the induction of nuclear factor of activated T-cells , cytoplasmic 1 ( NFATc1) and the expression of osteoclast-specific genes. In addition , OCLI-070 significantly suppressed the formation of actin rings and resorption pits. Analysis of the inhibitory action of OCLI-070 showed that it markedly suppressed receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand ( RANKL)- induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) and NF-κB signaling cascades. Moreover , OCLI-070 prevented ligature-induced alveolar bone erosion in mice by suppressing osteoclast formation. These findings demonstrate that OCLI-070 attenuated osteoclast differentiation and function as well as ligature-induced bone erosion by inhibiting RANKL-mediated ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
