  Balloon dilatation is reportedly less effective for young patients with esophageal achalasia than for older patients. However , there is no consensus on the impact of prior balloon dilatation on outcomes of surgical treatment. This study investigated the significance of preoperative balloon dilatation on surgical outcomes in young patients with esophageal achalasia. Of patients aged less than 40 years who had undergone a laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation for esophageal achalasia , 201 with a postoperative follow-up period of at least 1 year were included. They were divided into two groups with and without a history of balloon dilatation , and compared preoperative pathological conditions and surgical outcomes. This study included 100 men and 101 women with a median age of 31 years , of whom 158 patients without a history of pneumatic dilatation ( 79 % , non-PD group) and 43 with a history of pneumatic dilatation ( 21 % , PD group) The preoperative symptom scores for dysphagia<symptom> and regurgitation were significantly higher in the non-PD group. Although no differences were observed in surgical outcomes or postoperative course , the esophageal clearance rates calculated on preoperative and postoperative timed barium esophagograms were lower in terms of both height and width of the barium column in the PD group than in the non-PD group. Subjectively , both groups expressed equally high satisfaction. In patients aged less than 40 years with esophageal achalasia , although preoperative balloon dilatation did not affect subjective levels of satisfaction with surgery , postoperative improvement in esophageal clearance in the lower esophagus was inhibited.
