  Multiple independent reports have demonstrated pericyte loss in both the hippocampus and cortex in human Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). The differentiation and recruitment of pericytes are the essential steps in vasculature development. However , the role of amyloid beta ( Aβ) in pericyte differentiation has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study , we investigated the interaction between Aβ and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) toward pericytes in culture. Our results showed that mice overexpressing Aβ-precursor protein ( APP/PS1) exhibited the loss of pericytes compared with the control group mice , evidenced by the lack of desmin expression in the cortex of 12-month-old mice. Interestingly , we further found that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 inhibited the expressions of pericyte markers ( α-SMA , desmin , and PDGFRβ) in cultured MSCs which can be differentiated into mature pericytes. Mechanistically , the inhibitory effects of Aβs on MSC-pericyte transition is mediated by the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK signal pathway. These new insights into the roles of Aβ in pericyte differentiation may help to develop more effective strategies for the treatment of AD.
