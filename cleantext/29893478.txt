  Traditionally used as an angiogenic assay , the chorioallantoic membrane ( CAM) assay of the chick embryo offers significant potential as an in vivo model for xenograft organ-culture. Viable human bone can be cultivated on the CAM and increases in bone volume are evident , however , it remains unclear by what mechanism this change occurs and whether this reflects the physiological process of bone remodelling. In this study we tested the hypothesis that CAM-induced bone remodelling is a consequence of host and graft mediated processes. Bone cylinders harvested from femoral heads post-surgery were placed on the CAM of GFP-chick embryos for 9 days , followed by micro-computed tomography ( μCT) and histologically. 3D registration of consecutive μCT-scans showed newly mineralised tissue in CAM-implanted bone cylinders , as well as new osteoid deposition histologically. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of bone resorption and formation markers ( Cathepsin K , SOX9 and RUNX2) co-localising with GFP staining , expressed in avian cells only. To investigate the role of the human cells in the process of bone formation , decellularised bone cylinders were implanted on the CAM and comparable increases in bone volume were observed , indicating that avian cells were responsible for the bone mineralisation process. Finally , CAM implantation of acellular collagen sponges , containing BMP2 , resulted in the deposition of extracellular matrix and tissue mineralisation. These studies indicate that the CAM can respond to osteogenic stimuli and support formation/resorption of implanted human bone; providing a humanised CAM model for regenerative medicine research and a novel short-term in vivo model for tissue engineering and biomaterial testing.
