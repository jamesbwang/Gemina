  Respiratory effects of long term exposure to low levels of ammonia<pathogen> have not been thoroughly investigated. In this cross sectional study , 124 male subjects ( 67 high exposed and 57 low exposed) , occupationally exposed to low levels of ammonia<pathogen> and120 male referent individuals were investigated. Airborne concentrations of ammonia<pathogen> were measured and subjects underwent spirometry tests prior to and at end of their daily work shift. Average concentrations of ammonia<pathogen> in the breathing zones of the high and low exposed employees were found to be 1.35 ± 4.59 and 0.29 ± 0.31 ppm , respectively. Additionally , mean baseline values of some parameters of pulmonary function such as Vital Capacity ( VC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second ( FEV1) in the high exposed group were significantly lower than those of referent individuals. Similarly , significant reversible cross shift decrements were noted in FEV1 , VC and Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC) of exposed employees. These findings indicate that exposure to low levels of ammonia<pathogen> is associated with significant chronic irreversible and acute reversible decrements in the lungs ' functional capacity.
