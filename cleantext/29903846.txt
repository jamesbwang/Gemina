  We assessed the association between diet quality and microalbuminuria in youth-onset type 1 diabetes using three indices: a modified Mediterranean diet score for children and adolescents ( mKIDMED) , the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) , and the Healthy Eating Index-2010 ( HEI). Youth and young adults from the SEARCH ( SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth) Nutrition Ancillary Study ( SNAS) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2002-2008 , who had repeated dietary assessments at baseline and follow-up visits and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( UACR) measured at the outcome visit ( 2012-2015) ( The cohort was 43 % female , and at follow-up , mean age was 20 years , disease duration was 108 months , and 7 % had microalbuminuria. Adherence to a higher-quality diet was low for the mKIDMED ( mean 3.7 of a possible range of -3 to 12) and the DASH ( mean 42 of 80) and better , for the HEI ( mean 56.3 of 100). A borderline inverse association was observed between the HEI score and microalbuminuria after adjustment for caloric and protein intake and demographic and disease factors ( odds ratio ( OR) Greater adherence to the HEI may be beneficial for kidney health in youth and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Low adherence to the mKIDMED and DASH diets may explain the lack of association with microalbuminuria.
