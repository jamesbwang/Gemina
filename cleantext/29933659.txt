  Quercetin has a variety of biological activities and pharmacological effects , but its clinical application is limited due to its low water solubility , low bioavailability and poor chemical stability. In order to overcome the above shortcomings of quercetin and achieve better clinical efficacy , many new drug delivery systems have been studied and developed in recent years , of which nano drug delivery system has become a research hotspot. Nano drug delivery system includes nanoparticles , nanocapsules , nanoliposomes , nanomicelles , nanosuspensions and nanoemulsions , with the advantages of reducing particle size , enlarging surface area , increasing drug permeability , improving intracorporeal circulation and distribution of the drug , enhancing drug targeting and so on. This article reviewed the latest progress at home and abroad about the studies and application of quercetin in nano drug delivery system , such as increasing solubility and dissolution , elevating bioavailability , raising drug stability , delaying drug release , enhancing skin permeability , promoting antioxidant capacity and improving therapeutic effect , in the hope of providing references for further research of quercetin preparations.
