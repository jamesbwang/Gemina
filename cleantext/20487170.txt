  Clinical studies have found that moderate intake of retinol or oleic acid can enlarge the lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells and suppress their activation. However , the link between lipid droplets and cell activation is unknown. This study compared the dynamics of lipid droplet-associated protein expression between activated and reverted stellate cells. Reversion of the activated human stellate cell line LX-2 and inhibition of primary mouse stellate cell activation were induced by retinol or oleic acid , which resulted in larger lipid droplets and the downregulation of cell activation markers. Quantitative proteomics and immunoblotting were performed to compare lipid-droplet protein profiles between activated and reverted LX-2 cells. Compared to expression in activated cells , 50 lipid-droplet proteins were upregulated , whereas 28 were downregulated upon reversion. ATG2A was significantly enriched in lipid droplets of retinol/oleic acid-treated LX-2 cells and quiescent primary stellate cells. Reduced expression of Î±-SMA , increased expression of perilipin-3 , enlarged lipid droplets , and suppression of autophagic flux were observed in ATG2A-deficient LX2 cells. Lipid-droplet protein profile changes during the reversion of activated stellate cells might provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms linking lipid droplets to liver fibrosis<disease>. ATG2A could represent a potential new drug target for hepatic
