  The aim of this quality improvement project was to determine whether a communication bundle would impact parents ' ratings of nurse-child communication in relation to ( a) how often the nurse listened carefully to the child and ( b) how often the nurse explained things in a way easy for the child to understand. The Child Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( HCAHPS) scores on the unit lagged behind the hospital 's 75th percentile external benchmark established by the National Research Corporation. A convenience sample of the unit 's staff participated in the project. The outcome measure was a comparison of Child HCAHPS scores and percentile ranks for the questions pre- and postimplementation of the communication bundle. Following implementation of the communication bundle , the unit 's patient satisfaction scores for both questions exceeded the 75th-percentile benchmark. This project enhanced nurse communication at the bedside and the parent 's perception of nurse-child communication.
