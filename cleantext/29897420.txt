  Direct assessment of skeletal muscle mass in older adults is clinically challenging. Relationships between lean mass and late-life outcomes have been inconsistent. The D3-creatine dilution method provides a direct assessment of muscle mass. Muscle mass was assessed by D3-creatine ( D3Cr) dilution in 1,382 men ( mean age , 84.2 yrs). Participants completed the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB); usual walking speed ( 6 meters); and DXA lean mass. Men self-reported mobility limitations ( difficulty walking 2-3 blocks or climbing 10 steps); recurrent falls ( 2 +); and serious injurious falls in the subsequent year. Across quartiles of D3Cr muscle mass/body mass , multivariate linear models calculated means for SPPB and gait speed; multivariate logistic models calculated odds ratios for incident mobility limitations or falls. Compared to men in the highest quartile , those in the lowest quartile of D3Cr muscle mass/body mass had slower gait speed ( Q1: 1.04 vs Q4: 1.17 m/s); lower SPPB ( Q1: 8.4 vs Q4: 10.4 points); greater likelihood of incident serious injurious falls ( OR Q1 vs Q4: 2.49 , 95 % CI: 1.37 , 4.54); prevalent mobility limitation ( OR Q1 vs Q4 ,: 6.1 , 95 % CI: 3.7 , 10.3) and incident mobility limitation ( OR Q1 vs Q4: 2.15 95 % CI: 1.42 , 3.26); p for trend < .001 for all. Results for incident recurrent falls were in the similar direction ( p = 0.156). DXA lean mass had weaker associations with the outcomes. Unlike DXA lean mass , low D3Cr muscle mass/body mass is strongly related to physical performance , mobility and incident injurious falls in older me.
