  Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) and N-terminal proBNP ( NT-proBNP) are prognostic biomarkers. Although these 2 peptides differ with regard to biological characteristics , there are few reports on the differences between BNP and NT-proBNP with regard to cardiovascular events or according to sex.Methods and Results: Between 2005 and 2012 , this study analyzed 3,610 of 4,310 Japanese outpatients ( mean age , 65 years; men , n = 1,664; women , n = 1,947) with a history of at least one cardiovascular event who were recruited to the Japan Morning Surge-Home Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Study. During an average 4-year follow-up , there were 129 cardiovascular events. Both median BNP ( 21.1 pg/mL; IQR , 10.9-40.6 pg/mL vs. 16.2 pg/mL , IQR , 7.2-36.2 pg/mL , P < 0.001) and median NT-proBNP ( 54.7 pg/mL; IQR , 30.2-102.6 pg/mL vs. 44.9 pg/mL , IQR , 20.7-92.6 pg/mL , P < 0.001) were significantly higher in women than in men. A 1-SD increment in log-transformed BNP ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.18; 95 % CI: 1.53-3.10) and NT-proBNP ( HR , 2.39; 95 % CI: 1.73-3.31) was associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular events in women; in men , only NT-proBNP showed this association. There was an interaction between log-transformed BNP ( P = 0.007) or NT-proBNP ( P = 0.001) and cardiovascular events according to sex. Both BNP and NT-proBNP predicted cardiovascular outcomes in a large Japanese clinical population. BNP and NT-proBNP were significantly stronger predictors in women than in men.
