  Reported herein is a visible-light-mediated organocatalytic direct C-H functionalization of toluene derivatives to afford enantioenriched Î²-benzylated aldehydes from the corresponding enals. The process combines the oxidative power of a chiral excited-state iminium ion and the basic nature of its counteranion to trigger the generation of benzylic radicals by means of a sequential multisite proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. This study shows that feedstock chemicals generally used as solvents , such as toluene and xylene derivatives , can be used as substrates for making chiral molecules with high enantioselectivity.
