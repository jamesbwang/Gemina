  Older adolescent African American and Latina females have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs). This article describes the development of a new video intervention for this population , modeled on Safe in the City ( SITC) , an evidence-based STI prevention video. Plan A was created from 2015 to 2016 , using a systematic process similar to SITC. This included forming a project team with reproductive health experts , hiring a video production company and screenwriter , conducting a clinic staff survey ( n = 8) , and soliciting priority population input using three focus groups ( n = 41) followed by a review panel ( n = 9). The expert input , clinic staff survey , focus groups , and review panel informed the content and format of Plan A. The 23-minute video includes three interconnected stories with relatable characters and two animated sequences. Topics covered include condoms , long-acting reversible contraception , emergency contraception , STI prevention and testing , and patient-provider communication. SITC provided a model to create a new entertainment-education intervention for a different audience and to address pregnancy prevention as well as STIs. Sustained priority population involvement , input from stakeholders , and a highly iterative process were vital to developing Plan A , which is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.
