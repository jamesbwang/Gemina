  Research investigating rates of help-seeking for problem gambling has traditionally focused on the uptake of face-to-face gambling services alone , despite the World Health Organisation defining help-seeking as any action or activity undertaken to improve or resolve emotional , psychological or behavioural problems. The primary aim of this study is to examine the full range of help-seeking options utilised by gamblers , and to determine whether administering a comprehensive list of help options yields higher help-seeking rates than a single item measure. A one-item and expanded 14-item help-seeking Questionnaire ( the Help-Seeking Questionnaire; HSQ) were administered to 277 problem gamblers seeking help online. We found the 14-item HSQ yielded a significantly higher level of lifetime professional help-seeking ( 70 %) compared to the one-item measure ( 22 %). When we included self-directed activities , 93 % of gamblers reported they had previously attempted at least one activity to reduce their gambling. Current measurement of help-seeking appears to underestimate the range of activities currently undertaken by gamblers to reduce their gambling. Surveys need to include the one-item HSQ ( over the past 12 months have you sought professional help or advice ( online , by phone , or in person) , support from family or friends , or did something by yourself to limit or reduce your gambling?) or the three-item HSQ which measures engagement of face-to-face services ( i.e. , counselling , advice , groups) , distance-based ( i.e. , anonymous telephone , online) and self-directed ( i.e. , activities not involving professional oversight) activities separately. The full 14-item screen can be administered when brief screens are positive to ensure accurate measurement of help-seeking.
