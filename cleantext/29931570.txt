  To compare the preoperative and postoperative measurements of optical low-coherence reflectometry ( OLCR) biometry and assessment of its refractive predictability. A total of 114 eyes of 102 patients who underwent cataract treatment were prospectively examined. The axial length ( AL) , central corneal thickness ( CCT) , anterior chamber depth ( ACD) , lens thickness ( LT) , K ( keratometry) 1 , K2 , K average ( KAVE) and K astigmatic ( KAST) values were recorded using Lenstar LS 900 ( Haag-Streit , Koeniz , Switzerland) OLCR device. The IOL ( intraocular lens) power was measured based on the SRK/T formula. The cases were divided into three subgroups according to AL ( Group 1: AL < 22 mm , Group 2: 22 mm ≤ AL < 24 mm , Group 3: 24 mm ≤ AL). The mean absolute error ( MAE) calculated for each eye. The right eyes of 45 patients ( 44.1 %) , left eyes of 45 patients ( 44.1 %) , and both eyes of 12 patients ( 11.7 %) were examined. The average AL in the preoperative period was 23.19 ± 1.01; it was 23.20 ± 0.99 in the postoperative period ( p > 0.05). A significant deepening was detected in the postoperative ACD ( preop 2.76 ± 0.38 mm , postop 3.81 ± 0.46 mm , p < 0.001). CCT was measured as 521.4 ± 36.3 µm in the preoperative period and as 530.8 ± 42.8 ( p > 0.05) µm in the postoperative period. The average mean absolute error ( MAE) was measured as 0.48 ± 0.41 D , whereas refractive error was- 0.081 ± 0.67 D. The MAE distribution of cases was found to be ≤ 1.5 D 109 ( 95.6 %) eyes , and ≤ 2.0 D in 114 ( 100 %) eyes. MAE values according to AL of the cases were calculated as 0.71 ± 0.83 D in group 1 , 0.49 ± 0.43 D in group 2 and 0.41 ± 0.36 D in group 3 ( p > 0.05). When the measurement and refractive results of the OLCR biometry were evaluated , it was observed that there was a very satisfactory result and a predictable device compatible with the current literature. The SRK/T formula , one of the new generation formulas , has shown high MAE and RE results in eyes with AL ≤ 22 mm , although not statistically significant. Other new generation formulas should be tried in these eyes.
