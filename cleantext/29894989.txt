  Cushing 's syndrome<disease> ( CS) , including visceral obesity , dyslipidemia , hypertension and diabetes among its many manifestations , is `` a model '' of metabolic syndrome<disease>. Glucocorticoid ( GC) excess , through a combination of effects on liver , muscle , adipose tissue and pancreas , increases gluconeogenesis and impairs insulin sensitivity , leading to carbohydrate abnormalities. Dyslipidemia is a common finding in CS as a consequence of GC-related increased lipolysis , lipogenesis and adipogenesis. CS patients experience typical changes in body composition , with fat redistribution resulting in accumulation of visceral adipose tissue. Hypertension , myocardial and vascular abnormalities along with the metabolic changes and the characteristic coagulopathy increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic syndrome<disease> features can persist long after normalisation of cortisol levels.
