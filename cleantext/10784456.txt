  Physically disabled people experience more restrictions in social activities than healthy people , which are associated with lower level of well-being and poor quality of life ( QoL). A cross-sectional study was conducted. This study was investigated on among 302 eligible physically disabled people. The predictive role of the demographics and clinical characteristics , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , physical activity , and self-efficacy on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36) was examined. Statistical analysis used univariate and multivariate regression models. Gender , self-reported physical activity levels , use of the disability aid tools , and depression<symptom> were significantly predictors of the physical component summary ( PCS) ( Study results revealed that four and three variables could predict 20 % and 43 % of PCS and MCS variations , respectively. These findings warranted the detection of QoL risk factors and establishment of targeted interventions to optimize the health-related QoL among physically disabled people.
