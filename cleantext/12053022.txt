  The vitamin D receptor ( VDR) plays a key role in vitamin-mediated signaling pathway. Emerging evidence has suggested that the VDR polymorphism may contribute to the risk of prostate cancer ( PCa). However , the existing results are not conclusive in Asian population. We aim to evaluate the potential role of VDR polymorphisms on PCa of Asian population. PubMed , Scopus , Embase , Web of Science , Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wang Fang Data , and VIP Periodical were retrieved , and eligible studies ( case-control or cohort study) meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated through an updated meta-analysis using Stata13 .0 software. A total of 1,363 cases and 2,101 controls obtained from 13 eligible publications were eventually included in this meta-analysis. Our results show that a significant association of VDR taq1 polymorphism with PCa risk , especially in the Japanese population. In the clinical stage-stratified analysis , the pooled results revealed no significant difference in genetic polymorphisms between the local stage and control groups , whereas there was increased frequency of T allele and TT genotype in the advanced tumor stage group compared with local tumor stage or control groups. Similarly , no significant difference was seen in Gleason < 7 and control groups , but the T allele and TT genotype were significantly higher in the Gleason â‰¥ 7 group compared with Gleason < 7 or control groups. The VDR TaqI polymorphism might be associated with PCa risk in Asian population , especially in the Japanese population. Also , PCa patients carrying the T allele or TT genotype were more likely to progress to advanced stage. These results suggest that VDR TaqI polymorphisms may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for PCa susceptibility.
