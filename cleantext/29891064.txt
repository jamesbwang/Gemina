  Dystonia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions , twisting movements , and abnormal<symptom> postures<symptom> in various body regions. It is widely accepted that the basal ganglia are involved in the pathogenesis of dystonia. A growing body of evidence , however , is challenging the traditional view and suggest that the cerebellum may also play a role in dystonia. Studies on animals indicate that experimental manipulations of the cerebellum lead to dystonic-like movements. Several clinical observations , including those from secondary dystonia cases as well as neurophysiologic and neuroimaging studies in human patients , provide further evidence in humans of a possible relationship between cerebellar abnormalities and dystonia. Claryfing the role of the cerebellum in dystonia is an important step towards providing alternative treatments based on noninvasive brain stimulation techniques.
