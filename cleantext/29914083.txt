  Material anisotropy for tension and compression is a significant characteristic of austenitic stainless steel compared to carbon steel. Due to limitations during the testing of the restrained jig , the maximum strain value of compressive experiments of austenitic stainless steel is around 2 %. This value can not satisfy the requirements of accurate finite simulation on austenitic stainless steel columns and beams in the high compressive strain range. In this study , a new type of compressive specimen that satisfies the high compressive strain test was designed. The stress-strain response of austenitic stainless steel S30403 ( JISCO , Gansu , China) was investigated in the high compressive strain range up to 10 % , and constitutive models were compared with the experimental data. It was found that the new type specimen with length-to-diameter ratio of 1:1 can reliably obtain the stress-strain response of austenitic stainless steel S30403 in the high compressive strain range. It was found that the material anisotropy of austenitic stainless steel S30403 is remarkable in the high compressive strain range up to 10 %. The strain-hardening curve of the austenitic stainless steel S30403 can be represented by a straight line in the high compressive strain range. Our study also found that the Quach constitutive model accurately describes the two-stage strain-hardening phenomenon in the high compressive strain range up to 10 %.
