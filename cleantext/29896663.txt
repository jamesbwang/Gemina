  Oncolytic virotherapy is a kind of antitumor therapy using viruses with natural or engineered tumor-selective replication to intentionally infect and kill tumor cells. An early clinical trial has been performed in the 1950s using wild-type and non-engineered in vitro-passaged virus strains and vaccine strains ( first generation oncolytic viruses). Because of the advances in biotechnology and virology , the field of virotherapy has rapidly evolved over the past two decades and innovative recombinant selectivity-enhanced viruses ( second generation oncolytic viruses). Nowadays , therapeutic transgene-delivering `` armed '' oncolytic viruses ( third generation oncolytic viruses) have been engineered using many kinds of viruses. In this chapter , the history , mechanisms , rationality , and advantages of oncolytic virotherapy by herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus ( HSV) are mentioned.
