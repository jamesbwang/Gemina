  The aim of this study was to investigate whether the classification of a previous spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB) into; i) sPTB or ii) PPROM , impacts the efficacy of cervical pessary or vaginal progesterone in pregnant women with short cervix on transvaginal ultrasound. Four European hospitals using pessary or vaginal progesterone as a primary PTB prevention treatment for asymptomatic high-risk singletons with a short cervix , provided retrospective cohort data. A log-rank test on Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the difference in performance of pessary and progesterone depending on history of sPTB or PPROM. A linear regression analysis evaluated significant predictors of gestational age at delivery. Between 2008-2015 , 170 women were treated with pessary and 88 with vaginal progesterone. Rate of sPTB < 34 weeks were 16 % for ` pessary + sPTB history ' , 55 % for pessary + PPROM history , 13 % for ` progesterone + sPTB history ' and 21 % for ` progesterone + PPROM history '. Treatment with a pessary resulted in earlier delivery in women with previous PPROM than in any other subgroup; p = < 0.0001 ( p = 1.45e-09). Linear regression showed clear effect of PPROM history ( p = 7.773e-10) , an interaction of PPROM with treatment ( p = 0.0002590) and effect of CL ( p = 0.0003763) on gestation at birth. Cervical pessary may be a less efficacious treatment option for women with previous PPROM , however results require prospective validation before change in practice is recommended. Phenotype of previous preterm births may be an important risk predictor and treatment effect modifier; this information should be reported in future clinical trials.
