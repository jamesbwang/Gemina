  CD22 is an important drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and B cell-derived malignancies. In this study , N-acetylneuraminic acid functionalized quantum dots nanoconjugate was synthesized and used for targeting and fluorescence imaging of CD22 on living cells. The nanoprobe was prepared by conjugating N-acetylneuraminic acid ( NANA) on the carboxyl groups modified CdSe/ZnS quantum dots ( COOH-QDs) via NHS/EDC mediated esterification. The NANA-QDs nanoprobe showed excellent size distribution , very low cytotoxicity and super fluorescent properties for biological imaging applications. The specificity of NANA-QDs nanoparticles for CD22 on living cancer cells was validated by cellular uptake inhibition assays , colocalization of the immunofluorescence staining with both anti-CD22 antibody and NANA-QDs nanoparticles. Furthermore , CD22 mediated endocytosis of NANA-QDs nanoparticles was investigated by cellular internalization kinetics in Daudi cells at multiple time points. The newly developed NANA-QDs based assay was successfully used to determine the expression levels of CD22 on various cancer cells , which were highly consistent with the results determined by immunofluorescence staining assay and western blotting. All these findings demonstrated that NANA-QDs nanoparticles system was a practical fluorescent nanoprobe for bioimaging of CD22 , which held great promise in a wide variety of biomedical applications of CD22 related studies.
