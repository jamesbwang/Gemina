  Nidovirus endoribonucleases ( NendoUs) include Nsp15 from coronaviruses and Nsp11 from arteriviruses , both of which have been reported to participate in the viral replication process and in the evasion of the host immune system. Results from a previous study of coronaviruses SARS-CoV , HCoV-229E and MHV Nsp15 indicate that it mainly forms a functional hexamer , whereas Nsp11 from the arterivirus PRRSV is a dimer. Here , we found that porcine deltacoronavirus ( PDCoV) Nsp15 primarily exists as dimers and monomers in vitro. Biological experiments reveal that a PDCoV Nsp15 mutant lacking the first 27 amino acids of the N-terminal domain ( NTD , Asn-1-Asn-27) forms more monomers and displays decreased enzymatic activity , indicating that this region is important for its dimerization. Moreover , multiple sequence alignments and three-dimensional structural analysis indicated that the C-terminal region ( His-251-Val-261) of PDCoV Nsp15 is 10 amino acids shorter and forms a shorter loop than that formed by the equivalent sequence ( Gln-259-Phe-279) of SARS-CoV Nsp15. This result may explain why PDCoV Nsp15 failed to form hexamers. We speculate that NendoUs may have originated from XendoU endoribonucleases ( XendoUs) forming monomers in eukaryotic cells and that NendoU from arterivirus gained ability to form dimers and that the coronavirus<pathogen> variants then evolved the capacity to assemble into hexamers. We further propose that PDCoV Nsp15 may be an intermediate in this evolutionary process. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for improving our understanding of NendoU evolution and offer useful clues for designing drugs and vaccines against nidoviruses.
