  A new nanohydrogel drug delivery platform based on Laponite nanodiscs , polyacrylate , and sodium phosphate salts is described. The hybrid nanohydrogel is tailored to obtain soft and flexible nanohydrogels with G ' around 3 kPa , which has been proposed as the ideal stiffness for drug delivery applications. In vitro studies demonstrate that the new nanohydrogels are biocompatible , biodegradable , nonswellable , pH-responsive , and noncytotoxic and are able to deliver antineoplastic drugs into cancer cells.
