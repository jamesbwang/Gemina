  Merkel cells are innervated mechanosensory cells responsible for light-touch sensations. In murine dorsal skin , Merkel cells are located in touch domes and found in the epidermis around primary hairs. While it has been shown that Merkel cells are skin epithelial cells , the progenitor cell population that gives rise to these cells is unknown. Here , we show that during embryogenesis , SOX9-positive ( +) cells inside hair follicles , which were previously known to give rise to hair follicle stem cells ( HFSCs) and cells of the hair follicle lineage , can also give rise to Merkel Cells. Interestingly , while SOX9 is critical for HFSC specification , it is dispensable for Merkel cell formation. Conversely , FGFR2 is required for Merkel cell formation but is dispensable for HFSCs. Together , our studies uncover SOX9 ( +) cells as precursors of Merkel cells and show the requirement for FGFR2-mediated epithelial signalling in Merkel cell specification.
