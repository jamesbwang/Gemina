  Asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA) is a risk factor for heart diseases. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ( DDAH) enzymes are key proteins for ADMA degradation. Endothelial DDAH1 is a vital regulator of angiogenesis. DDAH1 is also expressed in cardiomyocytes. However , the role of DDAH1 in cardiomyocytes needs further clarification. Herein , we used an inducible cardiac-specific DDAH1 knockdown mouse ( cardiac DDAH1
