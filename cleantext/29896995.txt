  This study examines the resting-state functional-connectivity ( RsFc) in young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder ( HF-ASD) using state-of-the-art fMRI data acquisition and analysis techniques. High temporal resolution fMRI using simultaneous multi-slice acquisition aided unbiased whole-brain connectome-wide multivariate pattern analysis ( MVPA) techniques for assessing RsFc. MVPA revealed two clusters ( Crus I/II and lobule IX) of abnormal connectivity in the cerebellum that are consistent with the notion of a triple representation of nonmotor processing in the cerebellum. Whole-brain seed-based RsFc analyses informed by these clusters showed significant under connectivity between the cerebellar and social , emotional , and language brain regions in the HF-ASD group compared to healthy controls. The results we report are coherent with existing structural , functional , and RsFc literature in autism , extend previous literature reporting cerebellar abnormalities in the neuropathology of autism , and highlight the cerebellum as a potential target for therapeutic , diagnostic , predictive , and prognostic developments in HF-ASD. The description of functional connectivity abnormalities reported in this study using whole-brain , data-driven analyses has the potential to crucially advance the development of ASD biomarkers , targets for therapeutic interventions , and neural predictors for measuring treatment response.
