  Incidental isolated mild to moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> is a frequent laboratory finding prompting a referral to pediatric hematology-oncology. We tested the hypothesis that patients with isolated asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia<symptom> would not progress to require an intervention from a pediatric hematologist-oncologist. This is a 5-year retrospective review of 113 patients referred to pediatric hematology-oncology for isolated thrombocytopenia<symptom>. Initial , lowest , and current platelet counts along with clinical course and need for interventions were recorded. Thrombocytopenia<symptom> was categorized as mild ( platelet count: 101-140 Ã— 10 Eight of 48 patients ( 17 %) referred for initial mild isolated thrombocytopenia<symptom> progressed to moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> at 1 visit. At present , 2 of these patients have moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> , 17 remain with mild thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and 29 patients have resolved thrombocytopenia<symptom>. Nine of 65 patients ( 14 %) referred for moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> progressed to severe or very severe<symptom> thrombocytopenia<symptom> on 1 occasion. At present , no patients have severe<symptom> thrombocytopenia<symptom> , 18 remain with moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> , 14 improved to mild thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and 33 have resolved thrombocytopenia<symptom>. Only 3 patients required interventions from a hematologist , whereas 10 patients required therapy from other subspecialties. We only identified 3 patients ( 3 %) with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia<symptom> who required an intervention from a hematologist to improve platelet counts. Patients with isolated mild thrombocytopenia<symptom> with a normal bleeding history and physical examination findings frequently have normalized their platelet counts within 1 month.
