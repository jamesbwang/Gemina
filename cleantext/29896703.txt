  Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) is a powerful research tool to localize specific antigens in whole-mount or tissue sections of embryos with labeled antibodies based on antigen-antibody interactions. In whole-mount IHC , the distribution of an antigen can be mapped rapidly and reliably in the embryos. Immunofluorescence microscopy is one of the numerous IHC methods that may be used to assess both the localization and endogenous levels of proteins of interest. In this chapter , a general protocol for whole-mount immunofluorescent labeling of zebrafish embryos and larvae is described.
