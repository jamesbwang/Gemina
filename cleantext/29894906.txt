  Our hypothesis is that neighborhood infrastructure modifies the association between state-level income distribution and self-rated health. In our findings neighborhood infrastructure amplifies the association between income equality and self-rated health , yet with a differential impact on health according to sex , race and education level favoring individuals at higher socioeconomic positions. Most of the individual health variation attributed to context happens at neighborhood level , based on random effects analyses. Our findings contribute to a further understanding of health inequalities in Brazil. The demonstrated synergism between state , neighborhood and individual level determinants of health supports inter-sectoral policies and interventions in a clearly multileveled way.
