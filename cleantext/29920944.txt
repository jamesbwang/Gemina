  The purpose of this study was to describe the current evidence found in the nursing literature about robotics used to assist or augment nursing care. A bibliometric analysis of published research focused on robotics in nursing care was conducted to analyze the trends of publications. A search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database was conducted. This analysis was used to determine the types and extent of robotic research presented in nursing and allied health literature , journals that publish robotic research , and the origins of the study. Twenty-one articles met inclusion criteria and spanned the years 2004 to 2016. The main disciplines represented by first authors in these 21 articles were medicine ( n = 4 , 9 %) , nursing ( n = 4 , 9 %) , and psychiatric medicine ( n = 4 , 9 %). Nine countries were represented by the first author. The majority of the specific studies reported using qualitative research methods ( n = 4 , 19 %) with reports of other research designs being used. Further analysis of subsequent citations found that 248 subsequent citations were generated from these articles. The application of robots has been used beyond typical physical day-to-day processes as many definitions of robotics suggest. Eleven ( 52 %) of the 21 articles described the use of robots with aged patients. In some cases , robots were used as companions for older adults , as opposed to replacing mechanical and repetitive motions. Robotics are being used globally in nursing care areas. While a limited amount of research on this topic in nursing exists , this study of the literature offers reports of applications of robots within nursing care areas.
