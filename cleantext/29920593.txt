  Surgical innovation is critical for the management of challenging cerebrovascular pathology. Flow-through free flaps are versatile composite grafts that combine viable tissue with a revascularization source. Neurosurgical experience with these flaps is limited. To provide an in-depth technical description of the radial artery fascial ( and fasciocutaneous) flow-through free flap ( RAFF and RAFCF , respectively) for complex cerebral revascularizations. An Institutional Review Board-approved , prospective database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients that underwent extracranial-to-intracranial cerebral bypass with a RAFF or RAFCF. Patient demographics , underlying pathology , surgical treatment , complications , and outcomes were recorded. A total of 4 patients were treated with RAFFs or RAFCFs ( average age 40 ± 8.8 yr). Two patients with progressive moyamoya disease involving multiple vascular territories with predominantly anterior cerebral artery ( ACA) symptoms and flow alterations underwent combined direct ACA and indirect middle cerebral artery ( MCA) bypass with a RAFF. The third patient with moyamoya disease and concomitant proximal fusiform aneurysms<disease> requiring internal carotid artery sacrifice underwent dual direct ACA and MCA bypass and indirect MCA revascularization with posterior tibial artery and RAFF grafts. The fourth patient with a large MCA bifurcation aneurysm<disease> and recurrent wound<disease> complications underwent a direct MCA bypass and complex wound<disease> reconstruction using a RAFCF. Good neurologic outcomes ( Glasgow Outcomes Scale score ≥ 4 at discharge) were achieved in all patients. There were no perioperative surgical complications , and graft patency was confirmed on long-term follow-up. The RAFF and RAFCF are versatile grafts for complex cerebral revascularizations.
