  The aim was to investigate the angiogenic effects of concentrated growth factors on human dental pulp cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Cells were treated with concentrated growth factor extracts. The CCK-8 assay and cell cycle assay were conducted to evaluate cell growth. Cell migration was evaluated by the Transwell migration assay. Angiogenesis-associated mRNA and protein expression levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting , respectively. A tube formation assay was conducted to evaluate the angiogenic capacity in vitro. The data showed that compared with the control , concentrated growth factor extracts significantly promoted dental pulp cell proliferation and differentiation and endothelial cell proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner ( p < 0.05). Concentrated growth factor extracts also promoted the tube-like structure formation of endothelial cells in vitro. The RT-PCR and Western blot results showed that concentrated growth factor extracts upregulated the expression of angiogenesis-related genes- chemokine receptor-4 , platelet-derived growth factor , and vascular endothelial growth factor- in dental pulp cells. In conclusion , concentrated growth factors showed proangiogenic effects on dental pulp cells and endothelial cells and have good application potential for dental pulp revascularization.
