  The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of cervical sentinel lymph node biopsy after mapping with indocyanine green fluorescence ( ICG) for imaging early-stage oral cancer. A sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) was performed during a selective neck dissection ( SND) in 20 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC , cT1 or cT2 , N0 status). The sentinel lymph nodes ( SLN) were identified using an infrared video camera after ICG injection. Lymph nodes were examined histologically. The endpoint of this study was to investigate the rate of false-negative results in SLNB. Sentinel lymph nodes could be detected after 8.1 min ( range 1-22 min). In eight out of 20 cases , lymph node metastases were found during histopathological evaluation of the neck dissection specimen. In four cases a metastasis could be found in the detected SLN ( sensitivity 50 %). In the other four cases metastases were found in different lymph nodes. Specificity was 100 % , positive predictive value 100 % , and negative predictive value 75 %. In this study , reliability of sentinel lymph node biopsy after ICG imaging could not be verified , as there were false-negative results in 50 % of the cases. Therefore , SND can still be recommended as for patients with cT1 or cT2 OSCC , and a N0
