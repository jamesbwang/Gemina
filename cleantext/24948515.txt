  Asymmetric auxin distribution is instrumental for the differential growth that causes organ bending on tropic stimuli and curvatures during plant development. Local differences in auxin concentrations are achieved mainly by polarized cellular distribution of PIN auxin transporters , but whether other mechanisms involving auxin homeostasis are also relevant for the formation of auxin gradients is not clear. Here we show that auxin methylation is required for asymmetric auxin distribution across the hypocotyl , particularly during its response to gravity. We found that loss-of-function mutants in
