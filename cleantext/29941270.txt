  Size-fractioned atmospheric aerosol particles were collected during a typical heavy air pollution event in Beijing. The organic and inorganic components on the surfaces of the samples were analyzed using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF-SIMS). The variation characteristics of the surface chemical composition and influencing factors were studied , and the possible sources of these chemical compositions were identified through principal component analysis. The results showed that inorganic components such as crustal elements and sulfate , and organic components such as aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic groups were present. Some surface components , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , heavy metals and fluorides may exert adverse effects on human health. The species and relative percentages of the chemical components varied with particle size , diurnal and pollution progress. During a heavy pollution event , the species and relative percentages of secondary components such as oxygen-containing organic groups and sulfurous compounds increased , indicating that particles aged during this event. The surface chemical composition of the aerosol particles was affected mainly by emissions from coal combustion and motor vehicles. In addition , air pollution , meteorological factors , and air mass transport also exerted a significant effect on the surface chemical composition of aerosol particles.
