  Progress in quantum computing and quantum cryptography requires efficient , electrically triggered , single-photon sources at room temperature in the telecom wavelengths. It has been long known that semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs) display strong excitonic binding and emit light over a broad range of wavelengths , but their use has been hampered by a low quantum yield and a high sensitivity to spectral diffusion and blinking. In this Perspective , we discuss recent advances in the mastering of SWCNT optical properties by chemistry , electrical contacting and resonator coupling towards advancing their use as quantum light sources. We describe the latest results in terms of single-photon purity , generation efficiency and indistinguishability. Finally , we consider the main fundamental challenges stemming from the unique properties of SWCNTs and the most promising roads for SWCNT-based chip integrated quantum photonic sources.
