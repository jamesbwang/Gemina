  Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that are vital for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin to induce the NF-κB activation and innate immune responses. In this study , we cloned and identified the TLR5 gene from the King pigeon ( Columba livia) designated as PiTLR5. Full-length PiTLR5 cDNA ( 2583 bp) encoded an 860-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide sequence , 10 leucine-rich repeat domains , a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain. Pigeon TLR5 mRNA expression was quantified by performing quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR) , which showed that PiTLR5 was broadly expressed in all examined tissues , with the highest expression in the liver , peripheral blood mononuclear cells , and spleen. PiTLR5-mediated innate immune responses were measured by determining its effects on NF-κB activation and cytokine expression. The results showed that HEK293T cells transfected with PiTLR5 robustly activated the NF-κB response to flagellin , but not other TLR stimuli , and induced significant upregulation of IL-1β , IL-8 , TNF-α , and IFN-γ , indicating that PiTLR5 is a functional TLR5 homolog. Additionally , following flagellin stimulation of pigeon splenic lymphocytes , the levels of TLR5 , NF-κB , IL-6 , IL-8 , CCL5 , and IFN-γ mRNA , assessed using qRT-PCR , were significantly upregulated. Besides , TLR5 knockdown resulted in the significantly downregulated expression of NF-κB and related cytokines/chemokines. Triggering pigeon TLR5 contributes to significant upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , suggesting that pigeon TLR5 plays an important role in the innate immune responses.
