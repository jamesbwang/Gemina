  Intrauterine devices ( IUDs) still remain underused in adolescents. Pain during insertion may prevent adolescents to opt for a levonorgestrel ( LNG)- releasing IUD. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review , following the PRISMA guidelines , and critically appraise published data with respect to the efficacy of various substances ( analgesics or not) in preventing pain during LNG-IUD insertion in nulliparous women as a proxy for adolescents. DESIGN , SETTING , PARTICIPANTS , INTERVENTIONS , AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A comprehensive computerized systematic literature search of all English language studies between 2006 and 2016 was performed in PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus , Evidence Based Medicine Reviews ( Cochrane Database and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) , and Google Scholar. Relevant article reference lists were hand searched. Computerised database search revealed 31 citations of relevance , 9 of which with a total of 355 treated women and 345 controls fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In women treated with misoprostol ( n = 150) versus placebo ( n = 145) , the median visual analog scale ( VAS) score ± standard deviation ( SD) were 5.7 ± 2.1 versus 5.1 ± 2.2 , respectively. In the abovementioned population , there was a non-significant change in VAS score ( OR = 1.44 , 95 % CI 0.86-2.40). In women treated with lidocaine ( n = 140) versus placebo ( n = 136) , the median VAS score ± SD were 4.6 ± 2.1 versus 5.8 ± 2 , respectively. In the aforementioned population , there was a significant decrease in VAS score ( OR = 0.12 , 95 % CI 0.02-0.91). In nulliparous women , lidocaine treatment seems to be a reasonable choice. However , further studies are required to examine the different routes and modes of administration as well as optimal quantities.
