  To investigate the effect of steadily down-regulating the expression of VE-cadherin on the chemotheraputic sensitivity of K562 cells , and explore its possible mechanism. Specifically targeting interference sequences carrying human VE-cadherin were designed , the recombinant lentiviral vector containing the IRES-GFP and NEO segment was constructed; recombinant lentivirus was generated by three-plasmids packing system , and transfected into K562 cells , then the cells steadily down-regulated were sorted. CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the VE-cadherin of chemotherapeutic ( Imatinib) sensitivity of K562 cells. The apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V/7-AAD double labeling. The expressions of CD133 and ALDH1 mRNA were determined by real time PCR. The protein expressions of VE-cadherin , BCR-ABL and β-catenin were analyzed by Western blot. The recombinant lentiviral vector pLB-shVEC-NEO-IRES-GFP was successfully constructed , packed into the lentivirus , then the K562 cells steadily down-regulating VE-cadherin expression was obtained. When VE-cadherin was down-rengulated in K562 cells , the proliferation rate was reduced while the the apoptosis rate was increased; the mRNA levels of CD133 and ALDH1 also were reduced; BCR-ABL fusion protein was not obviously changed; the total β-catenin protein , as well as the nuclear β-catenin protein were decreased in the K562/shVEC cells. Conclution: K562 cells are more susceptible to chemotherapy when VE-cadherin is down-regulated , that may be realized via reducing the stability and the nuclear transfer of β-catenin protein.
