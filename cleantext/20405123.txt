  Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of fungal diversity , identification based on phenotype can be difficult , even for trained experts. Fungi<pathogen> typically have a cryptic nature and can have a similar appearance to distantly related species. Moreover , the appearance of industrially processed mushrooms complicates species identification , as they are often sold sliced and dried. Here we present a small-scale citizen science project , wherein the participants generated and analyzed DNA sequences from fruiting bodies of dried and fresh fungi<pathogen> that were sold for commercial use in New<pathogen> York City supermarkets. We report positive outcomes and the limitations of a youth citizen scientist , aiming to identify dried mushrooms , using established DNA barcoding protocols and exclusively open-access data analysis tools for species identification. Our results indicate that the single-locus nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ( ITS) DNA barcoding approach allowed for identification of only a subset of all of the samples at the species level , although the generated high-quality DNA barcodes were submitted to three different databases. Our results highlight the need for a curated , centralized , and open access ITS reference database that allows rapid third-party annotations for the benefit of both traditional research as well as the emerging citizen science community.
