  Resin matrix dental materials undergo contraction and expansion changes due to polymerization and water absorption. Both phenomena deform resin-dentin bonding and influence the stress state in restored tooth structure in two opposite directions. The study tested three composite resin cements ( Cement-It , NX3 , Variolink Esthetic DC) , three adhesive resin cements ( Estecem , Multilink Automix , Panavia 2.0) , and seven self-adhesive resin cements ( Breeze , Calibra Universal , MaxCem Elite Chroma , Panavia SA Cement Plus , RelyX U200 , SmartCem 2 , and SpeedCEM Plus). The stress generated at the restoration-tooth interface during water immersion was evaluated. The shrinkage stress was measured immediately after curing and after 0.5 h , 24 h , 72 h , 96 h , 168 h , 240 h , 336 h , 504 h , 672 h , and 1344 h by means of photoelastic study. Water sorption and solubility were also studied. All tested materials during polymerization generated shrinkage stress ranging from 4.8 MPa up to 15.1 MPa. The decrease in shrinkage strain ( not less than 57 %) was observed after water storage ( 56 days). Self-adhesive cements , i.e. , MaxCem Elite Chroma , SpeedCem Plus , Panavia SA Plus , and Breeze exhibited high values of water expansion stress ( from 0 up to almost 7 MPa). Among other tested materials only composite resin cement Cement It and adhesive resin cement Panavia 2.0 showed water expansion stress ( 1.6 and 4.8 , respectively). The changes in stress value ( decrease in contraction stress or built up of hydroscopic expansion) in time were material-dependent.
