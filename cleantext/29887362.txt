  To assess the effect of successful external cephalic version ( ECV) on the risk of caesarean section ( CS) during attempted vaginal delivery after induction of labour. A unicentric matched retrospective observational case-control cohort study with exposed and unexposed groups. All pregnant women who had an induction of labour after a successful external cephalic version ( sECV) between 1998 and 2016 were included. A total of 88 cases were compared with 176 controls ( spontaneous cephalic presentation) , matching for the year of delivery , parity , gestational age , indication and mode of induction of labour. The main outcome measure was the risk of caesarean. A univariate analysis and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. The caesarean section rate was significantly higher after sECV ( 22 % versus 13.1 %; p = 0.039) especially for postdate pregnancy ( 55 % versus 8.2 %; p < 0.05). For the univariate analysis , age ( 31 years and 4 months versus 24 years and 6 months; p < 0.01) and maximal speed of oxytocin infusion ( 72 ml/h versus 68 ml/h; p = 0.04) were higher in the case group. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk of caesarean section was significantly increased after an sECV ( aOR 1.946; 95 % CI 1.017-3.772) and after the use of prostaglandins for ripening ( aOR 1.951; 95 % CI 1.097-3.468) , and decreased for multipara ( aOR 0.208; 95 % CI 0.114-0.377). Women who have a successful ECV are at increased risk of caesarean section after subsequent induction of labour.
