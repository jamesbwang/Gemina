  Preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with poor clinical outcomes in malignancies. There were few data about the prognostic value of plasma fibrinogen in glioblastomas ( GBMs). The objective of our study was to investigate the association between fibrinogen and patients ' clinicopathological factors and overall survival ( OS). From 2008 to 2016 , 315 patients with GBMs who had a surgical treatment at our institute , were retrospectively involved in this study. IDH ( isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations and ATRX ( alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome<disease> X-linked) loss were detected with IHC ( Immunohistochemistry). The preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels ranged from 1.00 to 5.22 g/L , with a mean of were 2.57 g/L. There were increased levels of plasma fibrinogen in patients aged â‰¥ 65 years , secondary GBMs , IDH mutation ( p = 0.033) and ATRX loss ( p = 0.040). Moreover , the plasma fibrinogen level was the highest in the subtype of IDH-1
