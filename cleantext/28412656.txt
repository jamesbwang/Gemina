  This paper theoretically and experimentally considers the pulsed mode of operation of the radiation-receiving system. The system contains two identical piezoceramic plates separated by a layer of immersion liquid ( glycerin). The emitter was excited by the complex electrical signal of the special shape , which consisted of two half-cycles of the sine<disease> wave ( exciting and compensating) on the natural frequency of the piezoplates. The forms of these signals were calculated by the authors and described in their previous papers using the d & rsquo; Alembert method. The length of the electrical signal was estimated at the output of the piezoelectric receiver. The problem was solved theoretically using the finite element method. The acoustical system was simulated with the help of the COMSOL Multiphysics modeling environment. A comparative study of the theoretical and experimental results is carried out. The form of the signal at the output of the system was calculated by the d & rsquo; Alembert method , and the simulated form by the finite element method was in good coincidence with the results of experimental and full-scale modeling. It is shown that the usage of complex waveforms allows achieving a significant pulse duration reduction of the electrical voltage at the output of the receiver.
