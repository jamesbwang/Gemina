  A new approach for fine tuning of the metal work function ( WF) in the range of 1 eV is described. WF control is achieved by 3D molecular doping of the metal rather than the classical 2D adsorption. Both small molecules ( Congo red , thionine) and polymers ( Nafion , poly ( vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium) chloride) were shown to affect the work function of gold and silver. The in situ reaction of the dopants within the metallic matrix is a further tool for altering the WF , confirming that this effect is dopant-dependent. We attribute this effect to the charge transfer interactions between the dopant molecule and the surrounding 3D metallic cage.
