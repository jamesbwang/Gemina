  Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery ( MINS) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and deaths , which anticoagulation therapy could prevent. Dabigatran prevents perioperative venous thromboembolism , but whether this drug can prevent a broader range of vascular complications in patients with MINS is unknown. The MANAGE trial assessed the potential of dabigatran to prevent major vascular complications among such patients. In this international , randomised , placebo-controlled trial , we recruited patients from 84 hospitals in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 45 years , had undergone non-cardiac surgery , and were within 35 days of MINS. Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1) to receive dabigatran 110 mg orally twice daily or matched placebo for a maximum of 2 years or until termination of the trial and , using a partial 2-by-2 factorial design , patients not taking a proton-pump inhibitor were also randomly assigned ( 1:1) to omeprazole 20 mg once daily , for which results will be reported elsewhere , or matched placebo to measure its effect on major upper gastrointestinal complications. Research personnel randomised patients through a central 24 h computerised randomisation system using block randomisation , stratified by centre. Patients , health-care providers , data collectors , and outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy outcome was the occurrence of a major vascular complication , a composite of vascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction , non-haemorrhagic stroke , peripheral arterial thrombosis , amputation , and symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome was a composite of life-threatening , major , and critical organ bleeding. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01661101. Between Jan 10 , 2013 , and July 17 , 2017 , we randomly assigned 1754 patients to receive dabigatran ( n = 877) or placebo ( n = 877); 556 patients were also randomised in the omeprazole partial factorial component. Study drug was permanently discontinued in 401 ( 46 %) of 877 patients allocated to dabigatran and 380 ( 43 %) of 877 patients allocated to placebo. The composite primary efficacy outcome occurred in fewer patients randomised to dabigatran than placebo ( 97 ( 11 %) of 877 patients assigned to dabigatran vs 133 ( 15 %) of 877 patients assigned to placebo; hazard ratio ( HR) 0 · 72 , 95 % CI 0 · 55-0 · 93; p = 0 · 0115). The primary safety composite outcome occurred in 29 patients ( 3 %) randomised to dabigatran and 31 patients ( 4 %) randomised to placebo ( HR 0 · 92 , 95 % CI 0 · 55-1 · 53; p = 0 · 76). Among patients who had MINS , dabigatran 110 mg twice daily lowered the risk of major vascular complications , with no significant increase in major bleeding. Patients with MINS have a poor prognosis; dabigatran 100 mg twice daily has the potential to help many of the 8 million adults globally who have MINS to reduce their risk of a major vascular complication.
