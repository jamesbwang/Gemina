  Malate dehydrogenases ( MDH) convert malate to oxaloacetate using NAD ( H) or NADP ( H) as a cofactor. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking plastidial NAD-dependent MDH ( pdnad-mdh) are embryo-lethal , and constitutive silencing ( miR-mdh-1) causes a pale , dwarfed phenotype. The reason for these severe phenotypes is unknown. Here , we rescued the embryo lethality of pdnad-mdh via embryo-specific expression of pdNAD-MDH. Rescued seedlings developed white leaves with aberrant chloroplasts and failed to reproduce. Inducible silencing of pdNAD-MDH at the rosette stage also resulted in white newly emerging leaves. These data suggest that pdNAD-MDH is important for early plastid development , which is consistent with the reductions in major plastidial galactolipid , carotenoid and protochlorophyllide levels in miR-mdh-1 seedlings. Surprisingly , the targeting of other NAD-dependent MDH isoforms to the plastid did not complement the embryo lethality of pdnad-mdh , while expression of enzymatically inactive pdNAD-MDH did. These complemented plants grew indistinguishably from the wild type. Both active and inactive forms of pdNAD-MDH interact with a heteromeric AAA-ATPase complex at the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope. Silencing the expression of FtsH12 , a key member of this complex , resulted in a phenotype that strongly resembles miR-mdh-1. We propose that pdNAD-MDH is essential for chloroplast development due to its moonlighting role in stabilizing FtsH12 , distinct from its enzymatic function.
