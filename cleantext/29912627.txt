  Given the lack of relevant data , the aim of this study was to examine femur cortical and trabecular bone in female and male professional ballet dancers. 40 professional ballet dancers and 40 sex- and age-matched non-exercising controls volunteered. Femoral bone density was scanned by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) scan. A 3D-DXA software was used to analyse trabecular and cortical bone. Anthropometry , maturation ( Tanner staging) , menstrual parameters ( age at menarche and primary amenorrhea) , energy availability and nutritional analysis ( 3-day record) were also assessed.Compared to non-exercising participants , dancers exhibited significantly higher volumetric density for integral , cortical and trabecular bone , and thicker cortex at the femur. Ballet dancers demonstrated lower body<symptom> weight compared to controls ( p < 0.01). Female dancers had their menarche later than controls , and the prevalence of primary amenorrhea were significantly higher in dancers than controls ( p < 0.01). Dancer 's energy availability was below the normal range ( < 30 kcal/kgFFM/day). Despite the presence of certain osteoporosis risk factors such as low energy availability , primary amenorrhoea and lower body<symptom> weight , professional ballet dancers revealed higher bone density for both cortical and trabecular bone compartments compared to controls.
