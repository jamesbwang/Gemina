  Increasing popularity of preservative-free cosmetics necessitates in-depth research , specifically as bacteria can react to local factors by important metabolic changes. In this respect , investigating the effect of cosmetic preparations on pathogenic strains of commensal species such as acneic forms of Cutibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> ( former Propionibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen>) and bacteria behaving both as commensals and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> is of major interest. In this study , we studied the effect of commonly used cosmetics , Uriage
