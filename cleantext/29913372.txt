  Due to the wide use , bisphenol A ( BPA) has been detected frequently in the aquatic environment. However , the information on the distribution of BPA transformation products is limited. In this study , we investigated two BPA transformation products , namely bisphenol A monomethyl ether ( BPA-MME) and bisphenol A dimethyl ether ( BPA-DME). This study revealed that both transformation products were widely detected in the wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) as well as in surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary with higher detected concentrations and detection frequencies for BPA-DME. Temporal variations were observed in a WWTP based on a five-year sampling campaign. Mass load of BPA and its transformation products was evaluated and results indicated the generation of BPA-MME and BPA-DME during the wastewater treatment processes , which contributed for 1.95 % BPA removal. BPA and its transformation products were also widely detected in the surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary. Results indicated their additional generation in the surface water , since BPA-MME and BPA-DME in the surface river water were with similar level or even higher than effluent in WWTPs.
