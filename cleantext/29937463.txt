  The effects of shearing on behavioral patterns , antioxidants , and inflammatory and stress biomarkers was investigated in Ossimi sheep. Clinical parameters and behavioral patterns were recorded , and serum samples were collected pre-shearing and 1 , 5 , 10 , and 15 days post-shearing from 60 Ossimi sheep. The results revealed that grooming and standing idle frequencies were significantly ( P < 0.01) increased post-shearing. There were significant ( P < 0.01) increases in IL-6 , cortisol , and MDA detected from the 1st to the 10th day post-shearing compared to pre-shearing values. IL-2 and TNF-Î± significantly ( P < 0.01) increased from the 1st until the 5th day post-shearing compared to pre-shearing values , while significant ( P < 0.01) decreases in the values of Catalase from the 1st until the 5th day post-shearing compared to pre-shearing values were recorded. Regarding to glutathione reductase , there was a significant ( P < 0.01) decrease from the 1st until the 10th day post-shearing compared to pre-shearing values. Shearing leads to significant changes in antioxidants , inflammatory , stress biomarkers , and some behaviors in sheep.
