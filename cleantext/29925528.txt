  Despite showing promise against PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers in preclinical studies , phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K)/ AKT pathway inhibitors demonstrate limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy. Here , we found that histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B-targeted IGFBP5 expression provides a protective mechanism for PI3K/AKT inhibitor-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We found that overexpression of KDM6B and IGFBP5 in luminal breast cancer are positively associated with poorer disease outcomes. Mechanistically , KDM6B promotes IGFBP5 expression by antagonizing EZH2-mediated repression , and pharmacologic inhibition of KDM6B augments apoptotic response to PI3K/AKT inhibitor treatment. Moreover , the IGFBP5 expression is upregulated upon acquired resistance to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 , which is associated with an epigenetic switch from H3K27me3 to H3K27Ac at the IGFBP5 gene promoter. Intriguingly , GDC-0941-resistant breast cancer cells remained sensitive to KDM6B or IGFBP5 inhibition , indicating the dependency on KDM6B-IGFBP5 axis to confer the survival advantage in GDC-0941-resistant cells. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism associated with resistance to targeted therapy and demonstrates that therapeutic targeting of KDM6B-mediated IGFBP5 expression may provide a useful approach to mitigate both intrinsic and acquired resistance to the PI3K inhibitor in breast cancer.
