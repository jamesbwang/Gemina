  Myocardial infarction ( MI) is one of the most common causes of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Many evidences suggest that hypothermia<symptom> have a more pronounced impact as an adjunctive therapy for MI to reduce infarct size. However , the function of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNA) in therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> for MI remains poorly understood. In this study , we investigated the expression of lncRNA-UIHTC ( upregulated in hypothermia<symptom> treated cardiomyocytes , NONHSAT094064) in ischemic heart tissues. To investigate its function , overexpression of UIHTC was performed by adeno-associated virus vectors after MI model in rat. lncRNA-UIHTC was upregulated in ischemic or injury cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of lncRNA-UIHTC in peri-infarction attenuated cardiac dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically , lncRNA-UIHTC enhanced the mitochondrial function via upregulation of PGC1α. Moreover , when we knocked down PGC1α , the mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption and ATP levels enhanced by overexpression of UIHTC were nearly completely restored. Altogether we have provided a new mechanism whereby hypothermia<symptom> protected heart against ischemic via lncRNA-UIHTC. The UIHTC provided a new potential therapeutic target for MI but prevented the complications of
