  This study was aimed to uncover the effects of miR-124-3p on bladder cancer ( BC) by regulating DNA methyltransferase 3B. The expressions of miR-124-3p and DNMT3B mRNA in BC tissues and cell lines were detected using RT-PCR. The expression of DNMT3B in cells was determined using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in tissues. In addition , chromogenic in situ hybridization staining was used to measure the expression of miR-124-3p in tissues. BC cells were transfected with miR-124-3p mimics , miR-124-3p inhibitors , DNMT3B siRNAs , and DNMT3B cDNAs + miR-124-3p mimics. Subsequently , cell proliferation , apoptosis , migration , and invasion were measured using CCK-8 , the cytometry test , wound<disease> healing assay , and Transwell assay , respectively. Finally , the relationship between miR-124-3p and DNMT3B was confirmed using dual luciferase reporter gene assay. MiR-124-3p expression was significantly lower and the level of DNMT3B was significantly higher in BC tissues and cell lines compared with the normal controls. MiR-124-3p was verified to target DNMT3B. The transfection of miR-124-3p mimics and DNMT3B siRNAs down-regulated BC cell proliferation , migration , and invasion , as well as induced cell apoptosis; miR-124-3p inhibitors promoted BC cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and reduced cell apoptosis; and the effects of DNMT3B cDNAs can be compromised by miR-124-3p mimics. Thus , we concluded that miR-124-3p could suppress the proliferation , migration , invasion , and promote apoptosis of BC cells by targeting DNMT3B.
