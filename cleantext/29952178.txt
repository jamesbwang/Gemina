  Runners who participate in endurance sports such as marathons or ultramarathons have superior physical capabilities and health benefits compared to others. However , they may suffer long-term effects of the negative physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> during long-distance running. This study aimed to examine the effects of an ultramarathon on hormone levels , and the associated risks. Ten participants who completed a 622-km ultramarathon were included. Blood was collected pre-race , at the 300-km mark , the 622-km mark , and on the 3rd day of recovery ( RD3) and the 6th day of recovery ( RD6) and analyzed for human growth hormone ( HGH) , cortisol , beta-endorphin , serotonin , testosterone , luteinizing hormone ( LH) , and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) levels. HGH and beta-endorphin showed the highest increase at the 300-km mark compared to pre-race levels , with recovery on RD3 and RD6 , respectively. LH , cortisol , and serotonin showed the highest levels of increase at the 622-km mark , with recovery on RD6 for LH , and RD3 for cortisol and serotonin. FSH showed the highest level of decrease at both 300-km and 622-km marks compared to pre-race levels , with recovery on RD3. Testosterone decreased the most at the 300-km mark compared to the pre-race level and this decrease was below the normal levels; however , it recovered to normal levels on RD3. Hormone levels after the 622-km ultramarathon were within their normal ranges , except for testosterone. However , all the hormones recovered to pre-race levels on RD3 or RD6. This study showed that running ultramarathons does not cause abnormal hormone levels.
