  To determine the frequency of missed opportunities ( MOs) among patients newly diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> , risk factors for presenting MOs and the association between MOs and late presentation ( LP) to care. Retrospective analysis. HIV<pathogen> outpatient clinic at a Swiss tertiary hospital. Patients aged â‰¥ 18 years newly presenting for HIV<pathogen> care between 2010 and 2015. Number of medical visits , up to 5 years preceding HIV<pathogen> diagnosis , at which HIV<pathogen> testing had been indicated , according to Swiss HIV<pathogen> testing recommendations. A visit at which testing was indicated but not performed was considered an MO for HIV<pathogen> testing. Complete records were available for all 201 new patients of whom 51 % were male and 33 % from sub-Saharan Africa. Thirty patients ( 15 %) presented with acute HIV<pathogen> infection while 119 patients ( 59 %) were LPs ( CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm At our centre , 47 % of patients presented at least one MO.. While our LP rate was higher than the national figure of 49.8 % , LPs were less likely to experience MOs , suggesting that these patients were diagnosed late through presenting late , rather than through being failed by our hospital. We conclude that , in addition to optimising provider-initiated testing , access to testing must be improved among patients who are unaware that they are at HIV<pathogen> risk and who do not seek healthcare.
