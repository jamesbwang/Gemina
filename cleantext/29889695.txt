  The aim of this study was to further evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale ( SEE-C) among middle-aged outpatients with coronary heart disease ( CHD). Psychometric evaluation design. A convenience sample of 355 CHD patients was recruited and followed up at 3 and 6 months. Cronbach 's alpha , construct validity ( exploratory factor analysis) , and concurrent and predictive validity were examined. The SEE-C had a single-factor structure that was stable over time and had high internal consistency. Baseline SEE-C scores were significantly and positively associated with quality of life and total exercise time per week and significantly and negatively associated with anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> They also significantly predicted total exercise per week at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The SEE-C is a robust , reliable , and valid measure of exercise self-efficacy for middle-aged Chinese CHD outpatients. The SEE-C can assess patients ' exercise self-efficacy , so that appropriate interventions to improve exercise self-efficacy can be provided.
