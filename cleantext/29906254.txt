  The Burkholderia<pathogen> cepacia<pathogen> complex ( Bcc) comprises a group of 24 species , many of which are opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised patients and also are widely distributed in agricultural soils. Several Bcc strains synthesize strain-specific antagonistic compounds. In this study , the broad killing activity of B.<pathogen> cenocepacia<pathogen> TAtl-371 , a Bcc strain isolated from the tomato rhizosphere , was characterized. This strain exhibits a remarkable antagonism against bacteria , yeast and fungi<pathogen> including other Bcc strains , multidrug-resistant human pathogens and plant pathogens. Genome analysis of strain TAtl-371 revealed several genes involved in the production of antagonistic compounds: siderophores , bacteriocins and hydrolytic enzymes. In pursuit of these activities , we observed growth inhibition of Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> and Paraburkholderia phenazinium that was dependent on the iron concentration in the medium , suggesting the involvement of siderophores. This strain also produces a previously described lectin-like bacteriocin ( LlpA88) and here this was shown to inhibit only Bcc strains but no other bacteria. Moreover , a compound with an m/z 391.2845 with antagonistic activity against Tatumella<pathogen> terrea SHS 2008
