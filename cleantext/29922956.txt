  We present a novel semi-autonomous clinician-in-the-loop strategy to perform the laparoscopic cryoablation of small kidney tumors. To this end , we introduce a model-independent bimanual tissue manipulation technique. In this method , instead of controlling the robot , which inserts and steers the needle in the deformable tissue ( DT) , the cryoprobe is introduced to the tissue after accurate manipulation of a target point on the DT to the desired predefined insertion location of the probe. This technique can potentially reduce the risk of kidney fracture , which occurs due to the incorrect insertion of the probe within the kidney. The main challenge of this technique , however , is the unknown deformation behavior of the tissue during its manipulation. To tackle this issue , we proposed a novel real-time deformation estimation method and a vision-based optimization framework , which do not require prior knowledge about the tissue deformation and the intrinsic/extrinsic parameters of the vision system. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the da Vinci Research Kit , we performed experiments on a deformable phantom and an ex vivo lamb kidney and evaluated our method using novel manipulability measures. Experiments demonstrated successful real-time estimation of the deformation behavior of these DTs while manipulating them to the desired insertion location ( s).
