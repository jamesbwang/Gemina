  Focus switching in working memory involves accessing an object in the focus of attention in order to retrieve its content. Objects in working memory can be viewed as consisting of two types of information: contents ( e.g. , numerical information) and contexts ( e.g. , cues to retrieve the contents). This study examined the extent to which content retrieval and context access may be separated. Three experiments were carried out in which object switching and content retrieval were manipulated. In addition , the alternation between the retrieval operations was also manipulated. The main result was that content retrieval required time over and above that needed to access the object. This finding supports the idea that contexts and their contents may be accessed independently when an object is brought into the focus.
