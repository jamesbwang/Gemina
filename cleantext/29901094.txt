  Fennel , commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine , is known as Foeniculum vulgare Mill. And its clinical application has been shown to target many biological systems including gastroenterology , endocrinology , gynecology and respiratory The main constituent of the fennel essential oil is trans‑anethole , which has been described to have anti‑inflammatory and antibacterial activities. The aim of the present study was to define the anti‑inflammatory influence in acute lung injury ( ALI) bearing mice. For 3 days , ALI‑bearing mice were induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) suspension in normal saline ( 24 mg/kg). On the fourth day , the trans‑anethole was administrated ( 36.4 , 72.8 or 145.6 mg/kg) as well as dexamethasone ( 5 mg/kg) once per day for 7 consecutive days in mice. Following the completion of drug administration mice were sacrificed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed in the lung paraffin section , for comparisons between monocyte and eosinophil cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The relative gene expression of interleukin ( IL) 10 and IL‑17 was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These two cytokines and the proportion of T helper 17 ( Th17) cells and T regulatory ( Treg) cells were determined by flow cytometry. The main constituent of fennel , trans‑anethole , eliminated LPS‑induced histopathological changes , decreased the number of inflammatory cells and resulted in a notable reduction in IL‑17 mRNA expression. In addition , trans‑anethole increased IL‑10 mRNA expression in isolated lung tissues and resulted in a marked elevation in Treg cells and reduction in Th17 cells in spleen tissues. The results of the present study indicated that the main constituent of fennel , trans‑anethole may be an anti‑inflammation component , which influenced the regulation of Th17/Treg responses. Therefore , this medicinal herb may support a healing effect on diseases of inflammatory.
