  A fertilizer delivery system based on chitosan ( Ch) or chitosan/montmorillonite clay ( Ch/MMt) was developed by spray drying technique using 2-fluid ( 2FN) and 3-fluid ( 3FN) nozzles. 2FN provided solid microspheres and 3FN formed microcapsules structures. Morphology is dependent upon formulation and the type of nozzle used. As higher the number of the components ( polymer , clay and sodium tripolyphosphate ( TPP)) in the microparticles more collapsed and non-shaped spheres are generated. Different structures provided distinct nutrient releasing profiles. Higher swelling values ( âˆ¼ 500 %) and slower fertilizer releasing process ( under 70 % in the firsts measurements) are observed for microcapsules. This phenomenon occurs due to entrapped nutrient by an extra chitosan outer layer. The swelling-controlled release mechanism was observed for both microcapsules and microspheres instead of diffusion-controlled. Swelling characteristic was confirmed in soil medium since after water irrigation higher fertilizer releases were observed.
