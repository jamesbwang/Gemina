  Anti-malarial pre-erythrocytic vaccines ( PEV) target transmission by inhibiting human<disease> infection<disease> but are currently partially protective. It has been posited , but never demonstrated , that co-administering transmission-blocking vaccines ( TBV) would enhance malaria<disease> control. We hypothesized a mechanism that TBV could reduce parasite density in the mosquito salivary glands , thereby enhancing PEV efficacy. This was tested using a multigenerational population assay , passaging
