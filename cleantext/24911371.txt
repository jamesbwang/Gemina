  Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is highly associated with post-operative pain. The present randomized trial aimed to explore the possible post-operative pain management by a different combination of analgesics or opioids ( ketamine and bupivacaine) following TKA. A total of 84 patients were randomly divided into four groups. All subjects were anesthetized for TKA surgery and received post-operative pain management via intra-articular saline ( control group; n = 23) , ketamine ( 2 mg/kg) infused with saline ( ket group; n = 21) bupivacaine ( 0.5 mg/kg) infused with saline ( bupi group; n = 20) or ketamine ( 2 mg/kg) + bupivacaine ( 0.5 mg/kg) infused with saline ( ket + bupi group; n = 20) at the end of the surgery. Additional , post-operative analgesia was infused with the aid of patient-controlled analgesia with morphine. A reduction in the levels of pain score ( verbal rating scale and visual analog scale) , opioid consumption , time of ambulation , hospital stay and adverse events were observed in the ket + bupi group compared with the other groups. Meanwhile , the satisfaction score and knee flexion degree were improved following treatment with the ket + bupi regimen. Therefore , the multimodal analgesic regimen ( ket + bupi) may be useful in mitigating post-operative pain as and improving knee mobilization following TKA.
