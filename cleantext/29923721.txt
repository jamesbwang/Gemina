  On the basis of our previous developments in the field of nonempirical double hybrids , we present here a new exchange-correlation functional based on a range-separated model for the exchange part and integrating a nonlocal perturbative correction to the electron correlation contribution. Named RSX-QIDH , the functional is free from any kind of empirical parametrization. Its range-separation parameter is set to recover the total energy of the hydrogen atom , thus eliminating the self-interaction error for this one-electron system. Subsequent tests on some relevant benchmark data sets confirm that the self-interaction error is particularly low for RSX-QIDH. This new functional provides also correct dissociation profiles for charged rare-gas dimers and very accurate ionization potentials directly from Kohn-Sham orbital energies. Above all , these good results are not obtained at the expense of other properties. Indeed , further tests on standard benchmarks show that RSX-QIDH is competitive with the more empirical Ï‰B97X-2 double hybrid and outperforms the parent LC-PBE long-range corrected hybrid , thus underlining the important role of the nonlocal perturbative correlation.
