  At the global scale , species diversity is known to strongly increase towards the equator for most taxa. According to theory , a higher resource specificity of consumers facilitates the coexistence of a larger number of species and has been suggested as an explanation for the latitudinal diversity gradient. However , only few studies support the predicted increase in specialisation or even showed opposite results. Surprisingly , analyses for detritivores are still missing. Therefore , we performed an analysis on the degree of trophic specialisation of dung beetles. We summarised 45 studies , covering the resource preferences of a total of 994503 individuals , to calculate the dung specificity in each study region. Our results highlighted a significant ( 4.3-fold) increase in the diversity of beetles attracted to vertebrate dung towards the equator. However , their resource specificity was low , unrelated to diversity and revealed a highly generalistic use of dung resources that remained similar along the latitudinal gradient.
