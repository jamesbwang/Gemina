  The restoration of dentine-pulp complex remains a challenge for dentists; nonetheless , it has been poorly addressed. An ideal system should modulate the host response , as well as enable the recruitment , proliferation and differentiation of relevant progenitor cells. Herein was proposed a photocrosslinkable hydrogel system based on hyaluronic acid ( HA) and platelet lysate ( PL). PL is a cocktail of growth factors ( GFs) and cytokines involved in wound<disease> healing orchestration , obtained by the cryogenic processing of platelet concentrates , and was expected to provide the HA hydrogels specific biochemical cues to enhance pulp cells ' recruitment , proliferation and differentiation. Stable HA hydrogels incorporating PL ( HAPL) were prepared after photocrosslinking of methacrylated HA ( Met-HA) previously dissolved in PL , triggered by the Ultra Violet activated photoinitiator Irgacure 2959. Both the HAPL and plain HA hydrogels were shown to be able to recruit cells from a cell monolayer of human dental pulp stem cells ( hDPSCs) isolated from permanent teeth. The hDPCs were also seeded directly over the hydrogels ( 5 Ã— 10
