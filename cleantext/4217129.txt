  To determine the prevalence of ABO and Rh blood groups based on the antigenic presence on the surface of red blood cells with respect to gender and calculate allele frequency of the blood groups. Globally , approximately 700 type red cell antigens have been identified till now. ABO and Rh blood groups play an important role in the process of blood transfusion , resolving certain medicolegal issues , parental testing , and various genetic studies. This study was conducted in H.N.B. Base Hospital , Srinagar , Uttarakhand , from January 2012 to December 2016. Relevant data of blood donors were collected from blood bank department of the hospital. Blood grouping was conducted using commercially available standard monoclonal antisera applying test tube and column agglutination techniques. Out of 9883 individuals , 9333 ( 92.4 %) were males and 750 ( 7.6 %) were female individuals. The most common blood group found was B ( 31.68 %) and least common being AB ( 11.70 %). The prevalence of Rhesus positive and negative distribution in the present studied population was found as 93.51 % and 6.49 % , respectively. Overall , male ABO group pattern found was shown by formula B > A > O > AB which was similar among Rh-positive male individuals while Rh-negative males ' pattern was found as A > B = O > AB. In females , ABO group pattern was B > O > A > AB which was similar to Rh-positive female pattern while differs in Rh negative. The estimated allele frequencies were found as 0.2403 , 0.2475 , and 0.5122 for I The most common blood group found among the Gharwali donors was B positive while the least common was AB negative , which plays an important contribution for making government policies to develop National Health Program.
