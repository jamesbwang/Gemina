  The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence that different frequencies of deceleration and acceleration actions had on the physiological demands in professional soccer players. Thirteen players were monitored via microelectromechanical devices during shuttle running protocols which involved one , three , or seven 180 degree directional changes. Heart rate exertion ( HRE) ( 1.1 ± 0.7) and rating of perceived exertion ( RPE) ( 5 ± 1) were significantly higher for the protocol which included seven directional changes when compared to the protocols which included one ( HRE 0.5 ± 0.3 , ES = 1.1 , RPE 3 ± 0 , ES = 2.7) or three ( HRE 0.5 ± 0.2 , ES = 1.1 , RPE 3 ± 1 , ES = 1.9) directional changes (
