  Lynch syndrome<disease> ( LS) is caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair ( MMR) genes , which accounts for 3-5 % of colorectal cancer. The risks of several types of cancer are greatly increased among individuals with LS. In this study , 4 members of a Chinese family with a MLH1 pathogenic variant , resulting in colonic carcinoma , was reported. A 52-year-old colon cancer female was brought to us with a family history of colon cancer. Genetic counseling traced 4 members in her family with colon cancer ( mother and 3 siblings including the proband) as well as other cancer types. Next generation sequencing ( NGS) with a multiple gene panel including MMR genes showed a germline mutation in MLH1 ( c. 1852_1854delAAG , p.K618del) in all 3 affected family members and confirmed the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome<disease>. In addition , this mutation was also identified in a asymptomatic offspring , who was then recommended to a prophylactic measure against cancer. A personalized health care plan was implemented for monitoring the condition and progression of the affected individuals. Based on public database searching followed by pedigree verification , p.K618del variant in MLH1 is a pathogenic mutation , which supported the diagnosis of LS. This case highlights the importance of diagnosis and management in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes<disease> , particularly for asymptomatic family members.
