  Both hypercholesterolemia and aging are related to cognitive decline or Alzheimer 's disease. However , their interactive influence on the neurodegenerative progress remains unclear. To address this issue , 6-month-old and 16-month-old female mice were fed a 3 % cholesterol diet for 8 weeks , followed by hippocampus-related functional , pathological , biochemical and molecular analyses. The high cholesterol diet did not exacerbate age-dependent cognitive decline and hippocampal neuronal death , and even greatly mitigated decreases of synaptophysin and growth associated protein 43 expression in the hippocampus of aged mice. Compared with young controls , aged mice fed normal diet showed mild activation of hippocampal microglia with increased expression of CD68 , a marker of the microglial M1 phenotype , and decreased expression of CD206 , a marker of the microglial M2 phenotype. More interestingly , the high cholesterol diet not only improved NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1Î² expression , but also increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 in the hippocampus of old mice , suggesting playing pro- and anti-neuroinflammatory effects. In addition , the cholesterol rich diet resulted in a defect of the blood-brain barrier of aged hippocampus , as revealed by increased brain albumin content. These results have revealed both harmful and protective effects of high cholesterol diet on aged brain , which helps us to understand that hypercholesterolemia in the aged population is not associated with dementia and cognitive impairment.
