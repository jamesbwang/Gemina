  Anxiety<symptom> in bipolar disorder ( BD) exacerbates emotion dysregulation and reduces treatment response. We recently conducted a pilot trial of transdiagnostic CBT to target anxiety<symptom> and emotion dysregulation in BD adjunctive to pharmacotherapy. Reductions in depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> symptoms were significantly predicted by baseline levels of neuroticism and perceived affective control , as well as changes over time in emotion regulation skills. The present study investigates mechanism of treatment response by examining the relationship between baseline emotion regulation-related neural circuitry and trial outcomes. Nineteen patients completed baseline resting state fMRI scans prior to treatment randomization. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula ( AI) and regions in the salience network ( SN) , default mode network ( DMN) , and executive control network ( ECN) were examined as predictors of baseline and treatment-related changes in emotion regulation. Greater improvements in emotion regulation were predicted by weaker right dorsal AI- right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( VLPFC; SN) and stronger bilateral dorsal AI- bilateral amygdala functional connectivity. Baseline neuroticism was negatively correlated with right dorsal AI- inferior parietal lobule ( ECN) functional connectivity , and baseline deficits in perceived affective control were positively associated with ventral AI- bilateral dACC ( SN) connectivity. Small sample limits interpretability of treatment-specific effects. Baseline functional connectivity of emotion-regulation related neural circuitry significantly predicted change in emotion regulation-related dimensions associated with anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptom reduction. Future studies are needed to determine if employing methods such as neuromodulation to rehabilitate relevant neural circuitry may improve ultimate treatment outcomes of transdiagnostic CBT for BD and
