  This paper investigated the effect of co-composting of lincomycin mycelia dregs ( LMDs) with furfural slag on the degradation of lincomycin , maturity and microbial communities. Results showed that after 66 days composting , the concentration of lincomycin was removed above 99 %. The final pH , C/N and germination index ( GI) all met the national standards in maturity. Enumeration of total cultivable microbes showed the composting process was not inhibited by the addition of LMDs. Microbial diversity suggested that co-composting was beneficial to increase the abundance and diversity of bacterial communities for LMDs ' treatment. Canonical correlation analysis ( CCA) indicated the bacteria communities were strongly affected by residual lincomycin , with lincomycin reduced greatly , microbial communities of T and CK became similar at the end of composting. The potential bacteria to degrade lincomycin were Anaerococcus , Peptostreptococcus<pathogen> , and Lactobacillus. Based on these results , this research indicated that the co-composting was a feasible treatment for LMDs.
