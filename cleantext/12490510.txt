  The aim was to investigate the feasibility of a cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR) black-blood thrombus imaging ( BBTI) technique , based on delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation black-blood preparation and a variable flip angle turbo-spin-echo readout , for the diagnosis of acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) at 1.5 T. BBTI was conducted in 15 healthy subjects and 30 acute DVT patients. Contrast-enhanced CMR venography ( CE-CMRV) was conducted for comparison and only performed in the patients. Apparent contrast-to-noise ratios between the thrombus and the muscle/lumen were calculated to determine whether BBTI could provide an adequate thrombus signal for diagnosis. Two blinded readers assessed the randomized BBTI images from all participants and made independent decisions on the presence or absence of thrombus at the segment level. Images obtained by CE-CMRV were also randomized and assessed by the two readers. Using the consensus CE-CMRV as a reference , the sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values , and accuracy of BBTI , as well as its diagnostic agreement with CE-CMRV , were calculated. Additionally , diagnostic confidence and interobserver diagnostic agreement were evaluated. The thrombi in the acute phase exhibited iso- or hyperintense signals on the BBTI images. All the healthy subjects were correctly identified from the participants based on the segment level. The diagnostic confidence of BBTI was comparable to that of CE-CMRV ( 3.69 ± 0.52 vs. 3.70 ± 0.47). High overall sensitivity ( 95.2 %) , SP ( 98.6 %) , positive predictive value ( 96.0 %) , negative predictive value ( 98.3 %) , and accuracy ( 97.7 %) , as well as excellent diagnostic and interobserver agreements , were achieved using BBTI. BBTI is a reliable , contrast-free technique for the diagnosis of acute DVT at 1.5 T.
