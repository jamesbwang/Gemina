  Single cell sequencing ( SCS) can be harnessed to acquire the genomes , transcriptomes and epigenomes from individual cells. Next generation sequencing ( NGS) technology is the driving force for single cell sequencing. scRNA-seq requires a lengthy pipeline comprising of single cell sorting , RNA extraction , reverse transcription , amplification , library construction , sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. Computational algorithms are essential to fulfill many tasks of interest using scRNA-seq data. scRNA-seq has already enabled researchers to revisit long-standing questions in cancer biology , including cancer metastasis , heterogeneity and evolution. Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTC) are not only an important mechanism for cancer metastasis , but also provide a possibility to diagnose and monitor cancer in a convenient way independent of surgical resection of the cancer.
