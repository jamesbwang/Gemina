  A novel cyclodextrin-functionalized hybrid silicon nano-adsorbent material ( 6-EA- & beta;- CD-Si) was synthesized via the nucleophilic substitution method. The structure was detected by Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) , X-ray , thermogravimetric analysis , and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET) analysis. Results reveal that the BET surface area of 6-EA- & beta;- CD-Si is 240 m Â²/ g and the average pore size is 4.16 nm. The adsorption properties of 6-EA- & beta;- CD-Si onto methylene blue ( MB) were studied and fitted with adsorption kinetic models. Both the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model were fitted with well shows that the multi-layer adsorption with chemisorption and physisorption co-existing in the system. The maximum adsorption capacities are 39.37 , 39.21 , 36.90 , and 36.36 mg/g at temperatures 303 , 313 , 323 , and 333 K , respectively. The maximum removal rate of MB could reach 99.5 % , indicating the potential application value of 6-EA- & beta;- CD-Si in wastewater treatment. The adsorption mechanisms of 6-EA- & beta;- CD-Si showed that the hydrophobic cave of & beta;- CD plays an important role on the adsorption of MB.
