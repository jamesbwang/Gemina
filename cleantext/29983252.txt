  Bilateral internal thoracic artery ( BITA) grafting is underused in women. Outcomes of 798 consecutive women with multivessel coronary disease who underwent isolated coronary surgery ( 1999-2016) using BITA ( n = 530 , 66.4 %) or single internal thoracic artery ( SITA) grafting ( n = 268 , 33.6 %) were reviewed retrospectively. Differences between BITA and SITA cohort were adjusted by propensity score matching. For both series , late survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. One-to-one propensity score matching resulted in 247 BITA/SITA pairs with similar baseline characteristics and risk profile. According to the propensity matching , BITA grafting was associated with a trend towards reduced in-hospital mortality ( 3.2 % vs. 5.7 % , p = 0.19). However , BITA women had an increased chest tube output ( p = 0.0076) as well as higher rates of any ( 13 % vs. 5.3 % , p = 0.003) and deep sternal<disease> wound<disease> infections<disease> ( 9.3 % vs. 4.9 % , p = 0.054) , this translating in a longer in-hospital stay ( 10 vs. 9days , p = 0.029). Test for interaction showed that body mass index > 30kg/m When routinely performed , BITA grafting does not increase in-hospital mortality in women and could improve long-term survival. However , its use should be avoided in obese women with extracardiac arteriopathy because of increased risk of deep
