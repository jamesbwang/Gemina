  Studies on evaluative conditioning show that a change in liking can occur whenever stimuli are paired. Such instances of attitude change are known to depend on the type of relation established between stimuli ( e.g. , `` Bob is a friend of Mike '' vs. `` Bob is an enemy of Mike ''). Research has so far only compared assimilative and contrastive relational qualifiers ( e.g. , friend vs. enemy). For the first time , we compared the effect of nonoppositional qualifiers on attitude change in an evaluative conditioning procedure ( e.g. , `` Bob causes Positive Outcomes '' vs. `` Bob predicts Positive Outcomes ''). Differential effects of nonoppositional relational qualifiers were observed on explicit and implicit evaluations. We discuss the implications of our findings for attitude research , theories of attitude change , and optimizing evaluative conditioning for changing attitudes in applied settings.
