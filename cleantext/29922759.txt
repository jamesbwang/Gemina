  The disease course of primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC) is variable and difficult to predict. MicroRNA-122 ( miR-122) is associated with various liver diseases. We investigated the value of miR-122 as a biomarker for the disease course of PSC. We determined serum miR-122 levels in a long-term , prospective cohort of 114 PSC patients and a second validation cohort. Based on miR-122 levels , PSC patients were assigned to low or high level miR-122 groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly impaired actuarial transplant-free survival for PSC patients in the low miR-122 group ( mean: 46.1 +/- 4.1 months; 95 % confidence intervals ( CI): 38.1-54.2) compared to the high miR-122 group ( mean: 95.2 +/- 7.9 months; 95 % CI: 79.5-110.8; p = 0.034). Using a multivariate Cox 's proportional hazards model approach , Mayo-Risk score ( odds ratio ( OR): 1.47; 95 % CI: 1.13 1.92; p = 0.004) , the presence of dominant strictures ( OR: 2.62; 95 % CI: 1.00 5.55; p = 0.004) , and serum miR-122 levels ( OR: 1.19; 95 % CI: 1.00 1.43; p = 0.045) were independent risk factors associated with reduced actuarial transplant-free survival. We were able to confirm this finding in a second , independent cohort of PSC patients ( low miR-122 group: mean survival: 13.1 +/- 5.2 months; 95 % CI: 2.8-23.4; high miR-122 group: mean: 28.62 +/- 4.2 months; 95 % CI: 20.3-37.0; p = 0.018). We identified miR-122 as a novel , independent prognostic biomarker associated with improved survival in PSC patients. It is unknown whether exogenous miR-122 might influence the disease course of PSC patients..
