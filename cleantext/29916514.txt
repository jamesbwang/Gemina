  Xanthate complexes are used in the low temperature atom efficient synthesis of some geological and technologically important ternary compounds. The process involves direct heating of a stoichiometric mixture of the metal xanthate complexes. The reactive melts of the xanthates , generated in the transition state , cleanly decompose to ternary metal sulfides. The method has great potential for the facile scalable synthesis of ternary materials of composition ABX2 ( such as AI = Ag , Cu; BIII = Bi , Cr , Fe , In , Sb and X = S) or AB2X4 ( AII = Cd , Co , Cu , Ni; BIII = Co , Cr , Ni , Fe , and X = S).
