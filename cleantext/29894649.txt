  Transposition is a tendency for organisms to generalize relationships between stimuli in situations where training does not objectively reward relationships over absolute , static associations. Transposition has most commonly been explained as either conceptual understanding of relationships ( KÃ¶hler , 1938) as nonconceptual effects of neural memory gradients ( as in Spence 's stimulus discrimination theory , 1937). Most behavioral evidence can be explained by the gradient account , but a key finding unexplained by gradients is intermediate transposition , where a central ( of three) stimulus , `` relationally correct response , '' is generalized from training to test. Here , we introduce a dynamic neural field ( DNF) model that captures intermediate transposition effects while using neural mechanisms closely resembling those of Spence 's original proposal. The DNF model operates on dynamic rather than linear neural relationships , but it still functions by way of gradient interactions , and it does not invoke relational conceptual understanding in order to explain transposition behaviors. In addition to intermediate transposition , the DNF model also replicates the predictions of stimulus discrimination theory with respect to basic two-stimulus transposition. Effects of wider test item spacing were additionally captured. Overall , the DNF model captures a wider range of effects in transposition than stimulus discrimination theory , uses more fully specified neural mechanics , and integrates transposition into a wider modeling effort across cognitive tasks and phenomena. At the same time , the model features a similar low-level focus and emphasis on gradient interactions as Spence 's , serving as a conceptual continuation and updating of Spence 's work in the field of transposition.
