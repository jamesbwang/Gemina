  Computed tomography-measured visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) and the distribution of VAT are highly correlated with the severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP). To date , all available data are from the overall AP patient population; no subgroup analysis has been conducted to evaluate patients with moderately severe AP or patients with hyperlipidemia acute pancreatitis<disease> ( HLAP) as independent populations. Currently , studies on the relationship between VAT and HLAP are lacking. A total of 235 patients with moderately severe AP or severe acute pancreatitis<disease> were divided into 2 groups according to whether hyperlipidemia was present: the HLAP group and the non-HLAP group. The general inpatient information was collected , and computed tomography was used to measure VAT , subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT) , total adipose tissue , and VAT/SAT ( V/S). The data were subjected to t test , Ï‡ test , matrix scatter plot , logistic regression , and receiver operating characteristic analyses to evaluate the relationship between VAT and HLAP severity. Significant differences were observed in VAT , SAT , total adipose tissue , and triglycerides ( TGs) between the HLAP group and the non-HLAP group ( P < 0.001). Significant correlations were observed between VAT and body mass index ( r = 0.425 , P = 0.017) and between VAT and TG ( r = 0.367 , P = 0.042). In the HLAP group , VAT , V/S , TG , and local complications may have significant effects on disease severity. The receiver operating characteristic curves showed that VAT and V/S were more reliable than TGs in evaluating disease severity ( area under the curve ( AUC) of VAT: 0.819 , P < 0.001; AUC of V/S: 0.855 , P < 0.001; AUC of TG: 0.671 , P = 0.04). Disease severity was reliably evaluated at 139 cm , the cut-off value of VAT. The cut-off value of V/S was 1.145; high V/S was associated with extended intensive care unit stay. VAT and its distribution had no significant effects on mortality. For patients with moderately severe to severe HLAP , VAT was correlated with body mass index and TG. VAT and V/S were valuable factors for evaluating disease severity and prognosis. However , VAT had no effect on mortality , and VAT could not be used to evaluate patients with moderately severe to severe non-HLAP.
