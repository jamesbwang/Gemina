  The knotless barbed sutures ( KBS) are an innovative type of suture that can accelerate the placement of sutures and eliminate knot tying. Whether the KBS are safe and efficient in total joint arthroplasty ( TJA) remains controversial. Therefore , we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Randomized-controlled trials ( RCTs) were identified from the PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library databases up to October 2017. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess methodological quality. The statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3.5 software. A total of five RCTs ( 600 participants) were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that KBS reduced wound<disease> suture time ( MD- 4.51 , 95 % CI- 5.37 to- 3.66 , P < 0.00001) and the wound<disease> suture cost ( MD- 282.63 , 95 % CI- 445.32 to- 119.95 , P < 0.00001) , and did not significantly increase the rate of complications ( OR 0.77 , 95 % CI 0.42-1.39 , P = 0.13) or intraoperative events ( OR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.04-17.28 , P = 0.92). There were no significant differences in ROM at postoperative 6 weeks and 3 months ( MD- 0.74 , 95 % CI- 4.19 to 2.71 , P = 0.67; MD- 0.30 , 95 % CI- 2.62 to 2.02 , P = 0.80; respectively). Our findings suggest that KBS are a safe and effective method for TJA. Given the possible biases , adequately powered and better designed studies with longer follow-up are required to reach a firmer conclusion.
