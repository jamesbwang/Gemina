  Effective secondary prevention of HIV<pathogen> infections requires knowledge about changes in sexual behaviors after diagnosis among people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) , yet there is a dearth of literature assessing gender-specific patterns and correlates of such changes among heterosexual PLHIV in China. Data used in the current study were derived from a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 among 1212 heterosexual sexually active PLHIV in Guangxi , China. Most participants reduced sexual frequency ( 71.2 %) , reduced or maintained the same number of sexual partners ( 96.6 %) , and increased or maintained same frequencies of condom use ( 80.6 %). Gender difference was found in changes in sexual frequency , but not in the number of sexual partners or condom use. For males , decrease in sexual frequency was associated with having no desire to have children ( OR = 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.20 , 3.44) , being virally suppressed ( OR = 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.079 , 0.94) , and social support ( OR = 1.44 , 95 % CI 1.06 , 1.96). Health promoting behaviors in condom use ( i.e. , increased or maintained same frequencies of condom use) for males was associated with being 45 years of age or older ( OR = 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.21 , 0.61) , having an HIV-negative main partner ( OR = 1.80 , 95 % CI 1.11 , 2.92) , and physical health-related quality of life ( OR = 1.02 , 95 % CI 1.00 , 1.04). For females , decrease in sexual frequency was associated with having no desire to have children ( OR = 1.58 , 95 % CI 1.01 , 2.47). Health promoting behaviors in condom use for females was associated with having an HIV-negative main partner ( OR = 3.24 , 95 % CI 1.63 , 6.45) and social support ( OR = 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.57 , 0.99). Future intervention efforts need to target PLHIV who need extra support in making health-improvement efforts and to facilitate gender-specific behavioral changes in sexual risk reduction after HIV<pathogen> diagnosis.
