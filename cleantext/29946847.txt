  In this study , the dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) concentrations , chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) absorption coefficient a ( 254) , and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence ( EEM) were examined in the Songhua River ( SHR) and its highly polluted tributary of Northeast China. Fluorescence regional integration ( FRI) was used to identify five fluorescent regions: one tyrosine-like ( R1) , one tryptophan-like ( R2) , one fulvic-like ( R3) , one microbial by-product-like ( R4) , and one humic-like ( R5) regions. The five EEM-FRI regions for all water samples have site-specific properties. Principle component analysis ( PCA) was conducted to assess variations in the five FRI regions and the humification index ( HIX) for all water samples. For the water samples from the mainstream of SHR , CDOM absorption coefficient a ( 254) was correlated with either DOC or FRI fluorescent regions ( R3 and R5) , respectively. FRI R3 region was also correlated with R5 region for the water samples in the mainstream of SHR. However , the determination coefficients ( R
