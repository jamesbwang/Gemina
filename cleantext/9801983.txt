  The role for kidney TLR9 in ischemic acute kidney injury ( AKI) remains unclear. In this study , we tested the hypothesis that renal proximal tubular TLR9 activation exacerbates ischemic AKI by promoting renal tubular epithelial apoptosis and inflammation<symptom>. To test this hypothesis , we generated mice lacking TLR9 in renal proximal tubules ( TLR9
