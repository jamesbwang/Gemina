  Graves ' disease is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland , with some extra-thyroidal complications like eye and skin abnormalities in some patients. GD is more prevalent in women than men and is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism worldwide. A complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors is the proposed cause which triggers immune system to produce autoantibodies stimulating the TSH receptor , leading to clinical manifestations such as hyperthyroidism , diffuse thyroid enlargement ( goiter) and often ophthalmopathy in affected individuals. Various Single nucleotide gene polymorphisms ( SNPs) have been associated with the risk of GD development including promoter SNPs in Forkhead Box P3 ( FOXP3). FOXP3 is an important regulatory factor for T cell development and differentiation and therefore has a prominent role in suppression of autoimmune reactions which may lead to predisposition of GD. There have been some studies on the association of FOXP3 SNPs with GD , but no such investigation has been carried out in ethnic Kashmiri population. So , we aimed to study a possible association of FOXP3 promoter SNPs ( -3279 C/A , -2383 C/T & -3499 A/G) with GD. Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP) was used to genotype 285 individuals ( 135 GD cases and 150 healthy controls) and the results showed statistically significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies of cases and controls for -3279 C/A SNP ( OR , 3.48; 95 % CI ( 2.05-5.92); P < 0.001) and -2383 C/T SNP ( OR , 5.62; 95 % CI ( 2.43-13.00); P < 0.001) , while no significant association was seen in case of -3499 A/G SNP. We conclude that -3279 C/A and -2383 C/T SNPs have a highly significant association with the risk of GD development in Kashmiri population.
