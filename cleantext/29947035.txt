  Severe geographic inequities in liver transplantation have persisted for years. Previous investigators have demonstrated 90-day transplant rates varying from 14 % to 82 % and death rates varying from 18 % to 86 %. The aim of this analysis was to utilize a robust multivariate analysis to investigate whether geographic inequities affected the length of stay after liver transplantation. We conducted a unique Kaplan-Meier analysis with the event being discharge from the hospital and length of stay as the time to the event , using a cohort of 66 674 recipients listed in the UNOS database from 2002 to 2016. Multivariate Cox regression using 43 covariates was used for time-to-event analysis. Region 9 ( 0.82; CI 0.79-0.85) , Region 2 ( 0.85; CI 0.83-0.88) , and Region 10 ( 0.96; CI 0.93-0.99) were statistically significant factors for prolonged hospital stay. The following covariates were the most significant factors for prolonged hospital stay: serum sodium > 150 mEq/L ( 0.70; CI 0.62-0.78) , ICU admission ( 0.77; CI 0.74-0.80) , hospital admission ( 0.81; 0.79-0.83) , region 9 ( 0.82; CI 0.79-0.85) , and ventilator dependence ( 0.82; CI 0.76-0.88). In this analysis , we demonstrate regional disparities in hospital length of stay that are significant in robust multivariable Cox regression analysis. We hope the transplant community will take immediate measures to correct geographic inequities.
