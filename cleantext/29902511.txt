  Intestinal permeability assessment is an important aspect of drug development , which strongly depends on the solvent system used in the intestinal donor compartment. For this purpose , human intestinal fluids ( HIF) can be considered as the golden standard. A recent study demonstrated a reduced apparent permeation across rat intestinal tissue from fed versus fasted state HIF for 9 out of 16 compounds tested. Commercially available fed and fasted state simulated fluids ( FeSSIF and FaSSIF) reproduced this food effect for only 3 out of 16 compounds. To elucidate this observed difference , the current study assessed the impact of relevant intestinal fluid factors ( bile salt , phospholipids , cholesterol , free fatty acids ( FFA) , monoacylglycerides ( MAG)) and 2-factor interactions at a fixed pH of 6.5 on drug permeation across both rat tissue ( Ussing chambers setup) and an artificial membrane ( dialysis setup). Four representative compounds were selected for the permeation experiments: for propranolol and indomethacin , a food-induced permeation reduction was previously seen in both HIF and SIF; for metoprolol and darunavir , a reduction was only seen in HIF.
