  Infectious bronchitis<symptom> ( IB) is an acute , highly contagious disease , which causes economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. To control the disease , biosecurity and vaccination are required. In the current research , we rapidly attenuated a QX-like IBV field strain ZYY-2014 using passage in embryos at limiting dilution and tested the safety and efficacy of the attenuated Chinese QX-like IBV strain ZYYR-2014 in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free ( SPF) chickens through spray route. Our result revealed that the attenuated strain presented a decreased pathogenicity in 1-day-old chickens. The strain ZYY-2014 inoculated birds presented typical IBV clinical signs with a mortality of 43 % , while the attenuated strain ZYYR-2014 inoculated birds remained healthy. The strain ZYYR-2014 also presented stronger antibody responses and lower viral loads in tracheas , lungs and kidneys. When vaccinated through spray route into 1-day-old SPF chickens , our data suggest a potential of the attenuated ZYYR-2014 strain as a vaccine candidate applied in hatchery , which can contribute in preventing the QX-like IBV infections. Furthermore , attenuation by passage at limiting dilution could be applied for rapid vaccine development against emerging strains.
