  Very little is known about how waterpipe tobacco smokers and nonsmokers compare on harm beliefs about waterpipe tobacco smoking ( WTS) and how these beliefs are related to risk appraisals and intentions to engage in WTS. We investigated these issues among young adult waterpipe tobacco smokers , susceptible nonsmokers , and non-susceptible nonsmokers. Young adults ages 18 to 30 who smoked waterpipe tobacco during the last 30 days or never used waterpipe tobacco were recruited online through Turkprime. Nonsmokers were grouped as susceptible or not. Participants completed measures of harm beliefs , risk appraisals ( i.e. , perceived risks and worry) , and desire to quit among smokers or willingness/curiosity to try waterpipe among nonsmokers. Analyses were based on 247 smokers and 418 nonsmokers. Smokers endorsed most strongly harm beliefs that portrayed WTS as safe , followed by susceptible and then non-susceptible nonsmokers. Most harm beliefs were significantly related to risk appraisals , yet weakly associated with desire to quit or willingness/curiosity to try waterpipe tobacco , except among susceptible nonsmokers. Greater efforts are needed to correct maladaptive beliefs about WTS harms , especially among smokers. Among susceptible nonsmokers , harm beliefs may be more influential in predicting willingness to try WTS than risk appraisals.
