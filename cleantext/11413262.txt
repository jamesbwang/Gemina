  To systematically review the symptoms reported by patients with bilateral vestibulopathy ( BV) in clinical studies and case reports. This would serve as the first step in establishing a validated patient-reported outcome measures ( PROM) for BV. A search on symptoms reported by patients with BV was performed in PubMed , and all publications covering these symptoms were included. Exclusion criteria comprised reviews and insufficient details about the frequency of occurrence of symptoms. 1,442 articles were retrieved. 88 studies were included ( 41 clinical studies , 47 case reports). In consensus , 68 descriptions of symptoms were classified into 6 common and generic symptoms. Frequency of symptoms in clinical studies and case reports were reviewed , respectively; imbalance ( 91 and 86 %) , chronic dizziness<symptom> ( 58 and 62 %) , oscillopsia ( 50 and 70 %) , and recurrent vertigo<symptom> ( 33 and 67 %). BV could be accompanied by hearing loss ( 33 and 43 %) and tinnitus<symptom> ( 15 and 36 %). 15 clinical studies and 10 case reports reported symptoms beyond vestibular and hearing deficits such as limited social activities , depression<symptom> , concentration , and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> and reduced quality of life in general. The literature on BV symptomatology mainly focuses on classic symptoms such as imbalance and oscillopsia , while only few report additional symptoms such as cognitive memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> and performing dual tasks. In fact , none of the reviewed clinical studies and case reports provided a comprehensive overview of BV symptoms. To develop a validated PROM , qualitative research using semi-structured and unstructured interviews is needed to explore the full spectrum of BV symptoms.
