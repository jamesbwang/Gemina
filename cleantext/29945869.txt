  Tissue growth has to be carefully controlled to generate well-functioning organs. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that modulate the activity of target genes and play a pivotal role in animal development. Understanding the functions of microRNAs in development requires the identification of their target genes. Here , we find that
