  Cyst<symptom> abundance and identity are essential for understanding and predicting blooms , and for assessing the dispersal of toxic target dinoflagellate species by natural or human mediated ways , as with ballast waters. The aim of this study was to apply rapid , specific and sensitive qPCR assays to enumerate toxic dinoflagellate cysts<symptom> in sediment samples collected from Adriatic harbours. The molecular standard curves of various target species allowed obtaining the rDNA copy number per cyst<symptom>. The analytical sensitivity for specific standard curves was determined to be 2 or 10 rDNA copies per reaction. The abundance varied in the range of 1-747 dinoflagellate cysts<symptom> g
