  Hypophysectomy specimens from 16 dogs with pituitary adenoma were evaluated with periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS) , reticulin , and immunohistochemistry for adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH) , melanocyte stimulating hormone ( MSH) , growth hormone ( GH) , and Ki-67. The reticulin network was obliterated in all adenomas. One adenoma expressed ACTH and GH. Eight corticotroph adenomas were basophilic to chromophobic , and PAS- and ACTH-positive. Seven melanotroph adenomas were distinguished from corticotroph adenomas by expression of MSH. Pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism was diagnosed in 5 of 8 dogs with corticotroph and 4 of 7 with melanotroph adenoma. Pituitary height/brain area ( P/B) ratio was elevated in all dogs. Previous canine hypophysectomy studies suggested that melanotroph adenomas were larger and carried a worse prognosis than corticotroph adenomas; however , in this study , corticotroph adenomas in comparison to melanotroph adenomas were larger ( median P/B ratio: 1.06 versus 0.76) , more proliferative ( median Ki-67 index: 9.47 % versus 1.99 %) , and associated with shorter survival ( median: 300 versus 793 days). Recommended immunohistochemistry for PAS-positive pituitary adenomas includes ACTH and MSH to distinguish corticotrophs from melanotrophs and Ki-67 for proliferation index.
