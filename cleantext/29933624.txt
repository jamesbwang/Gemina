  This paper introduces a methodology applying an imaging sonar for three-dimensional ( 3D) target tracking underwater. The key process in this work involves obtaining the target & rsquo; s position in space using two images of the same scene , acquired by an adaptive resolution imaging sonar ( ARIS) at different positions. A data association algorithm was designed to connect the same target in image sequences. The goal of this work was to track multiple targets in 3D space. The ARIS provides sequences of bi-dimensional images from the backscattered energy according to the range and azimuth. The challenge involved determining the missing elevation information for the observed object within the sonar detection range. By computing the geometrical transformation between the acquisition planar images and the cubical space , using only the sonar information that included the posture<symptom> and moving speed of the ARIS , the target & rsquo; s elevation information was obtained. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method , an indoor experiment was conducted using the ARIS. On the basis of the experimental results , we confirmed that the proposed method effectively obtained the target & rsquo; s position in 3D space. A moving target simulation was also conducted , and the results showed that this method was effective for moving targets. Finally , a field experiment was performed to obtain the vertical distribution and track the 3D trajectories of fish.
