  This study analyzed patients ' perspectives about a measure of current , usual , and extreme<symptom> pain<symptom> and a measure of activity-related pain. Thirty-one patients with osteoarthritis participated in focus groups. Researchers completed thematic analysis of transcripts using coding software and an inductive approach. Three emerging themes were that many factors affected patients ' perceptions and ratings of pain intensity , patients used different approaches to construct pain ratings , and patients interpreted maximal response anchors differently. Particularly , novel findings were that patients evaluated pain fluctuation , location , duration , and quality when constructing pain intensity ratings. Also , activity items helped patients to remember pain and provided a valued context for communicating pain experiences. However , the activities needed to be sufficiently described and personally relevant. These findings further clarify the challenges patients face and the workarounds they use when rating pain intensity. The patients ' suggestions for improved administration methods and items warrant future investigation.
