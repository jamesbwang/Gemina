  Deletions of chromosome arm 13q belong to the most frequent molecular alterations in prostate cancer. To better understand the role of 13q deletion in prostate cancer we took advantage of our large prostate cancer tissue microarray comprising more than 12,000 cancer samples with full pathological and clinical follow up data. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes for ENOX1 ( 13q14 .11) and the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 , 13q14 .2) was employed. A 13q deletion was found in 21 % of 7,375 analyzable cancers. Deletions were always heterozygous and associated with high Gleason grade ( P < 0.0001) , advanced tumor stage ( P < 0.0001) , high preoperative PSA levels ( P = 0.0125) , lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.0377) , positive resection margin ( P = 0.0064) , and early biochemical recurrence ( P < 0.0001). 13q deletions were marginally more frequent in prostate cancers with negative ERG status ( 22.9 %) than in ERG-positive tumors ( 18.7 %; P < 0.0001). Loss of 13q predicted patient prognosis independently from established prognostic parameters that are available at the time of biopsy ( P = 0.0004) , including preoperative PSA level , clinical tumor stage , and biopsy Gleason grade. In summary , the results of our study identify 13q deletion as a frequent event in prostate cancer , which is linked to an adverse phenotype and poor prognosis in this disease.
