  The will is a word that nurses may use to describe their patients ' actions or inactions. This concept has been extensively addressed by religions , psychologists , and philosophers. Ricoeur offered a phenomenology of the will in which three overarching key concepts were uncovered: decision , action , and consent. In this article , Ricoeur 's elaborative and exhaustive description of these three concepts is summarized. Examples as to how a phenomenology of the will may guide nurses in their day-to-day clinical practice in caring are provided. In research , Ricoeur 's phenomenology of the will may be used as a heuristic to guide phenomenological studies. An introduction to the will may act as a bridge between the art and science of nursing , providing nursing students with a greater understanding of the meaning of and need to provide holistic care.
