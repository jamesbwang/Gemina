  Low social support is consistently associated with postpartum depression<symptom> Previous studies do not always control for previous mental health and do not consider what type of support ( tangible , emotional , informational or positive social interaction) is most important. The objectives are: to examine if low social support contributes to subsequent risk of depressive or anxiety<symptom> symptoms and to determine which type of support is most important. Data from the All Our Families longitudinal pregnancy cohort were used ( n = 3057). Outcomes were depressive or anxiety<symptom> symptoms at 4 months and 1 year postpartum. Exposures were social support during pregnancy and at 4 months postpartum. Log binomial models were used to calculate risk ratios ( RRs) and absolute risk differences , controlling for past mental health. Low total social support during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms ( RR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.24 to 1.82) and anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( RR 1.63 , 95 % CI 1.38 to 1.93) at 4 months postpartum. Low total social support at 4 months was associated with an increased risk of anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( RR 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.31 to 2.09) at 1 year. Absolute risk differences were largest among women with previous mental health challenges resulting in a number needed to treat of 5 for some outcomes. Emotional/informational support was the most important type of support for postpartum anxiety<symptom>. Group prenatal care , prenatal education and peer support programmes have the potential to improve social support. Prenatal interventions studies are needed to confirm these findings in higher risk groups.
