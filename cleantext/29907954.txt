  Plant heterotrimeric G proteins modulate numerous developmental stress responses. Recently , receptor-like kinases ( RLKs) have been implicated as functioning with G proteins and may serve as plant G-protein-coupled-receptors. The RLK FERONIA ( FER) , in the Catharantus roseus RLK1-like subfamily , is activated by a family of polypeptides called rapid alkalinization factors ( RALFs). We previously showed that the Arabidopsis G protein Î² subunit , AGB1 , physically interacts with FER , and that RALF1 regulation of stomatal movement through FER requires AGB1. Here , we investigated genetic interactions of AGB1 and FER in plant salinity response by comparing salt responses in the single and double mutants of agb1 and fer. We show that AGB1 and FER act additively or synergistically depending on the conditions of the NaCl treatments. We further show that the synergism likely occurs through salt-induced ROS production. In addition , we show that RALF1 enhances salt toxicity through increasing Na
