  Sarcomas<disease> are malignant tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues and may harbor a subset of cells with cancer stem-like cell ( CSC) properties. Platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β ( PDGFR-α/β) play an important role in the maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells. Here we examine the role of PDGFR-α/β in sarcoma<disease> CSCs. PDGFR-α/β activity and the effects of PDGFR-α/β inhibition were examined in 3 human sarcoma<disease> cell lines using in vitro assays and mouse xenograft models. In all three cell lines , PDGFR-α/β activity was significantly higher in cells grown as spheroids ( to enrich for CSCs) and in cells sorted for CD133 expression ( a marker of sarcoma<disease> CSCs). Self-renewal transcription factors Nanog , Oct4 , and Slug and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) proteins Snail , Slug , and Zeb1 were also significantly higher in spheroids cells and CD133 (
