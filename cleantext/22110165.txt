  Migraine is a common type of headache<symptom> in young adults , with an estimated prevalence of 4 % before puberty and as high as 25 % in women by their mid to late 30s. About one third of migraineurs experience transient neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> known as auras , which characterize a variant known as migraine with aura. Many evidences have shown an increased risk of vascular events in patients affected by migraine , particularly among women and among migraine patients with aura. Potential underlying mechanisms include endothelial dysfunction , hypercoagulability , platelet aggregation , vasospasm , cardiovascular risk factors , paradoxical embolism , spreading depolarization , shared genetic risk , use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , and immobilization. The risk of vascular events in migraine patients is also linked by concomitant oral contraception; moreover , the common finding of increased incidence of right to left cardiac shunt in migraine patients might have a pathogenetic role. Finally , many MRI studies in migraine patients , particularly in migraine with aura , have shown subcortical lesions<symptom> particularly in the cerebellum as a common finding. In this review , we analyzed the more recent findings regarding the topic of migraine as a risk factor in stroke.
