  The purpose of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) of women with epilepsy during their reproductive years. A cross-sectional study comparing two groups , one with and another without epilepsy , was conducted. Semistructure questionnaires regarding socioeconomic , demographic , and clinical profiles were used. The HRQoL was measured using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory ( QOLIE-31) , for comparison within the group with epilepsy , and World Health Organization of Quality of Life ( WHOQOL)- bref , for comparison between the groups with and without epilepsy. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher 's exact test , Mann-Whitney test , and multivariate linear regression. A measure of significance was considered as p < 0.05. Eighty women were included ( 40 with epilepsy and 40 without epilepsy) with mean age of 28.2 ± 6.51 years. Women of childbearing age with epilepsy tend to have lower quality of life than those without epilepsy ( with epilepsy: 85.15 ± 13.50 vs. without epilepsy: 90.75 ± 12.17 , p = 0.051). The groups were similar in relation to most sociodemographic characteristics , with the exception of the percentage of women with epilepsy outside the labor market ( with epilepsy: 57.5 % vs. without epilepsy: 30 % , p = 0.012) and with clinical ( with epilepsy: 27.5 % vs. without epilepsy: 7.5 % , p = 0.018) and psychiatric comorbidities ( with epilepsy: 20 % vs. without epilepsy: 0 % , p = 0.003). However , logistic regression showed no influence of these variables on the HRQoL of women with epilepsy. The clinical variables associated with the worsening of HRQoL were seizure<symptom> control and antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) adverse effects. Epilepsy has a negative impact on the HRQoL of women of childbearing age , and the clinical variables controlling seizures<symptom> and adverse effects of AEDs influenced HRQoL in this population.
