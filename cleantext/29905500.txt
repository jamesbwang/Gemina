  Wild-living animals are subject to weather variability that may cause the generation of reactive oxygen species , resulting in oxidative stress and tissue damage , potentially driving demographic responses. Our 3-yr field study investigated the effects of seasonal weather conditions on biomarkers for oxidative stress , oxidative damage , and antioxidant defense in the European badger ( Meles meles). We found age class effects: cubs were more susceptible to oxidative stress and oxidative damage than adults , especially very young cubs in the spring , when they also exhibited lower antioxidant biomarkers than adults. Although previous studies have found that intermediate spring and summer rainfall and warmer temperatures favor cub survival , counterintuitively these conditions were associated with more severe oxidative damage. Oxidative damage was high in cubs even when antioxidant biomarkers were high. In contrast , adult responses accorded with previous survival analyses. Wetter spring and summer conditions were associated with higher oxidative damage , but they were also associated with higher antioxidant biomarkers. Autumnal weather did not vary substantially from normative values , and thus effects were muted. Winter carryover effects were partially evident , with drier and milder conditions associated with greater oxidative damage in the following spring but also with higher antioxidant capacity. Plausibly , warmer conditions promoted more badger activity , with associated metabolic costs at a time of year when food supply is limited. Modeling biomarkers against projected climate change scenarios predicted greater future risks of oxidative damage , although not necessarily exceeding antioxidant capacity. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates that individual adaptive physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> are associated with variation in natural environmental conditions.
