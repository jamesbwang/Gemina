  There are conflicting data to date on the causal relationship between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia<disease> and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA): ( 1) myeloperoxidase-ANCA may play a pathogenetic role in pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , or ( 2) pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> may induce production of the antibody. In this article , we describe a case of an elderly female patient with microscopic polyangiitis that developed after positive conversion of myeloperoxidase-ANCA during the course of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia<disease> Our experience as well as similar case reports may suggest that idiopathic interstitial pneumonia<disease> may induce production of ANCAs and even ANCA-associated vasculitis.
