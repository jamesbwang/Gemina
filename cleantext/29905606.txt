  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer challenges wound<disease> healing. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , has been shown to work synergistically with paclitaxel in vitro and in preclinical studies. In addition , our laboratory has demonstrated that SAHA treatment decreases paclitaxel-associated stem cell toxicity , modulates inflammatory response , and promotes wound<disease> healing in injured fibroblast cells. Our goal was to determine if combined SAHA and paclitaxel treatment would improve wound<disease> healing in an in vivo full-thickness murine model , without altering antitumor effect. Thirty-two nude athymic mice received intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel ( 20 mg/kg) , SAHA ( 25 mg/kg) , paclitaxel + SAHA ( 20 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg) , or no treatment for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Under general anesthesia , 8-mm full-thickness dorsal wounds<disease> were created in all animals , and a silicone splint was attached to minimize wound<disease> contraction. The wounds<disease> were measured twice a week with a surgical caliper until healing was complete. To evaluate the in vivo effect of drug treatment , 16 athymic nude mice with MDA-MB-231 xenografts received the treatments described previously , following which tumor volumes were compared between groups. Average wound<disease> healing time was prolonged in mice treated with paclitaxel ( 20 ± 1.9 days) , and combination SAHA + paclitaxel therapy improved average wound<disease> healing time ( 17.0 ± 1.8 days). In the xenograft model , the antitumor effect of SAHA and paclitaxel ( average tumor volume 43.9 ± 34.1 mm) was greater than paclitaxel alone ( 105.8 ± 73.8 mm). The addition of SAHA to taxane chemotherapy improves the therapeutic effect on triple-negative breast cancer while decreasing the detrimental effect of paclitaxel on wound<disease> healing. This may have substantial implications on improving outcomes in breast reconstruction following chemotherapy.
