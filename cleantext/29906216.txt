  Nematodes are common in the parasite communities of North American freshwater fishes , and the majority of them belong to 1 conventional order , Spirurida Chitwood , 1933. Within the Spirurida , the superfamilies Habronematoidea Chitwood and Wehr , 1932 and Thelazioidea Sobolev , 1949 have undergone considerable diversification. The dominant families of these 2 superfamilies , Cystidicolidae Skrjabin 1946 and Rhabdochonidae Railliet , 1916 , respectively , are particularly common , widely distributed and diverse , especially in North<pathogen> America , yet their phylogenetic relationships remain largely unexplored. In this study , we use near complete sequences of the 18S rRNA genes ( SSUrDNA) from species in 6 genera ( Capillospirura Skrjabin , 1924 , Cystidicola Fischer , 1798 , Salmonema Moravec , Santos and Brasil-Sato , 2008 , Rhabdochona Railliet , 1916 , Spinitectus Fourment , 1883 , and a putative new cystidicolid in mooneyes , Hiodontidae) along with a species of Hedruris Nitzsch , 1812 from newts as a surrogate for the fish parasite Hedruris tiara VanCleave and Mueller , 1932 , to explore their phylogenetic relationships. These sequences , together with available sequences from a range of other nematodes , including fish nematodes in other groups ( Camallanoidea and ` Seuratoidea ') , were analyzed using Bayesian Inference and maximum likelihood. The results from both analyses indicate , for the first time , support for the close relationships of the sturgeon parasite Capillospirura with Ascarophis van Beneden , 1871 and Cystidicola , the relationship of the cystidicolid from Hiodontidae with Salmonema of salmonid fishes , the monophyly of the 2 dominant spiruridan genera of fishes , Rhabdochona and Spinitectus and for previous relationships among Nearctic Spinitectus spp.. The results also indicate a closer relationship of Rhabdochona and Spinitectus than is suggested by their conventional classification and reject the monophyly of Habronematoidea , Thelazioidea and Cystidicolidae. Hedruridae appears to be an early branching lineage of spirurins. Finally , the pattern of association between the fish parasites in this study and their hosts indicates , with few exceptions , ecologically-driven diversification events involving host-shifting not related to the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts.
