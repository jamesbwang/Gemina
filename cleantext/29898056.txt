  This study evaluated comparatively two configurations ( powder and putty) of a composite biomaterial based on PLGA ( Poly ( lactide-co-glycolide)/ nanoescale hydroxyapatite ( ReOss ® , Intra-Lock International) through microscopic morphology , in vitro cytotoxicity , biocompatibility and in vivo response as a bone substitute. SEM and EDS characterized the biomaterials before/after grafting. Cytocompatibility was assessed with murine pre-osteoblasts. Osteoconductivity and biocompatibility were evaluated in White New Zealand rabbits. Both configurations were implanted in the calvaria of eighteen animals in non-critical size defects , with blood clot as the control group. After 30 , 60 and 90 days , the animals were euthanized and the fragments containing the biomaterials and controls were harvested. Bone blocks were embedded in paraffin ( n = 15) aiming at histological and histomorphometric analysis , and in resin ( n = 3) aiming at SEM and EDS. Before implantation , the putty configuration showed both a porous and a fibrous morphological phase. Powder revealed porous particles with variable granulometry. EDS showed calcium , carbon , and oxygen in putty configuration , while powder also showed phosphorus. After implantation EDS revealed calcium , carbon , and oxygen in both configurations. The materials were considered cytotoxic by the XTT test. Histological analysis showed new bone formation and no inflammatory reaction at implant sites. However , the histomorphometric analysis indicated that the amount of newly formed bone was not statistically different between experimental groups. Although both materials presented in vitro cytotoxicity , they were biocompatible and osteoconductive. The configuration of ReOss ® affected morphological characteristics and the in vitro cytocompatibility but did not impact on the in vivo biological response , as measured by the present model.
