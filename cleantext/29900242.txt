  This article provides laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA-ICP-MS) and secondary ionization mass spectrometry ( SIMS) U-Pb and U-Th zircon dates for crystals separated from Late Pleistocene dacitic lava dome rocks of the Ciomadul Volcanic Dome Complex -LRB- Eastern Carpathians , Romania). The analyses were performed on unpolished zircon prism faces ( termed rim analyses) and on crystal interiors exposed through mechanical grinding an polishing ( interior analyses).
