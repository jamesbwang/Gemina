  This study aimed to investigate the optimum preparation condition of casein- carrageenan conjugate by ultrasonic Maillard dry treatment. The stable microcapsule was self-assembly prepared by the conjugates applied to protect red pigment from paprika. The optimum substrate ratio of Cas-Ca is 1:2 , the reaction time and temperature were 24 h and 60 Â°C. Finally , the optimal degree of grafting reached 78.05 %. Conjugation with carrageenan could further enhance solubility and emulsifying properties of casein. Glycosylation self-assembly nanoparticles were prepared with ultrasonic treatment , and the stability of the nanoparticles were excellent. Cas-Ca was effectively used to encapsulate PRP , and the PRP and PRP-microcapsule were stored for six days under the condition of high temperature , lighting , and food additives to observe the PRP retention rate. These results indicated the outstanding protective effect of microcapsule on PRP. Cas-Ca could be used as an effective carrier of PRP. They could effectively control release behavior in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. Cas-Ca microcapsule was disintegrated and released slowly within 3 h in simulated gastric fluid , but released rapidly within 1 h in intestinal environments , and the total release rate reached 76.6 %.
