  Innate B cells and natural antibodies ( Nabs) have been extensively studied in normal physiological conditions as well as in several diseases. However , their significance in the context of ABO-compatible solid organ transplantation is only emerging. This review summarizes recent studies exploring these often neglected innate immune elements in situations related to sensitization and clinical graft rejection. A focus is placed on class-switched IgG Nabs that develop amidst inflammation<symptom> , rather than IgM Nabs abundant at the steady state , as new evidence point to their implication in serum reactivity to HLA and kidney graft failure. The involvement of innate B cells in the pathophysiology of CAV is also presented. Lastly , we discuss key questions that need answering to understand whether and how innate B-cell immunity contributes to the outcome of solid organ transplantation.
