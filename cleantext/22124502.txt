  To analyze the prevalence of breastfeeding and the introduction of complementary food for zero to 24-month-old infants. This is a population-based cross-sectional study of children aged less than 24 months in Montes Claros , Minas Gerais , Brazil. Data were collected in 2015 , by interviews with people in charge of infant care in the house. The questionnaire administered assessed the sociodemographic status of the family , maternal and infant characteristics and food consumption habits. Survival analysis was used to calculate median prevalence and duration of breastfeeding and the introduction of complementary feeding. With 180 days of life , 4.0 % of the children were exclusively breastfed , 22.4 % were mostly breastfed and 43.4 % were fed breast milk as complementary food. In the third month of life , children were consuming water ( 56.8 %) , fruit juice or formula ( 15.5 %) and cow 's milk ( 10.6 %). At the age of 12 months , 31.1 % were consuming artificial juice and 50.0 % were eating candies. Before the age of 1 year , 25.0 % of them had already eaten instant noodles. The introduction of drinks , honey , sugar and candies as complementary food was found to be premature; and solid and semi-solid foods were almost appropriate. The habits described can directly affect the success of breastfeeding. Given that the inadequate eating practices identified can compromise the infant 's health , actions that promote breastfeeding and provide guidance on the introduction of complementary foods are important.
