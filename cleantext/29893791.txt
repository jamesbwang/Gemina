  Trastuzumab improves the outcome of women with HER2 positive breast cancer. We aimed to assess whether trastuzumab decreases the detection rate of Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs) in women with high risk , HER2 non-amplified , early breast cancer. Patients and Methods: The EORTC 90091-10093 BIG 1-12 Treat CTC is a phase 2 trial , conducted in 70 hospitals and 6 CTC laboratories across 5 European countries. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2 non-amplified breast cancer and ≥ 1 centrally confirmed CTC per 15mL of blood by CellSearch ® following surgery and ( neo) adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized ( 1:1) to 6 cycles of trastuzumab intravenously versus 18 weeks of observation. Randomization was stratified for center , locally confirmed estrogen receptor ( ER) status and adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was rate of detection of ≥ 1 CTC per 15mL of blood at week 18. Secondary endpoints were invasive disease-free survival ( iDFS) and cardiac safety. Between 30 April 2013 and 17 October 2016 , 1317 patients were screened; 95 ( 7.2 %) had detectable CTC ( s) , and 63 ( 4.8 %) were randomized to trastuzumab ( n = 31) or observation ( n = 32). Fifty-eight patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint , 29 in each arm. In 9 of the 58 patients , CTC ( s) were still detected at week 18: 5 in the trastuzumab and 4 in the observation arm ( one-sided Fisher exact test , p = 0.765). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping further accrual for futility for the primary endpoint. Median follow-up at database lock was 13 months ( IQR 4-16.5). The 1-year iDFS was 93.8 % ( 95 % CI 77.3-98.4) in the observation versus 84.8 % ( 95 % CI 63.4-94.2) in the trastuzumab arm. No grade 2-4 cardiac events were observed in the trastuzumab arm. Trastuzumab does not decrease the detection rate of CTCs in HER2 non-amplified , non-metastatic breast cancer.
