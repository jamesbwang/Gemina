  To analyze the prognostic role of positive cultures in patients with sepsis<disease>. A prospective cohort study in a tertiary referral hospital in Medell√≠n , Colombia. Adults older than 18 years of age with a bacterial infection diagnosis according to Centers for Disease Control criteria and sepsis<disease> ( evidence of organ dysfunction) were included. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between positive cultures and hospital mortality , and a Cox regression with a competing risk modeling approach was used to determine the association between positive cultures and hospital stay as well as secondary infections. Overall , 408 patients had positive cultures , of which 257 were blood culture , and 153 had negative cultures. Patients with positive cultures had a lower risk of mortality ( odds ratio ( OR) , 0.43; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.27-0.68) , but this association was not maintained after adjusting for confounding factors ( OR , 0.56; 95 % CI , 0.31-1.01). No association was found with the hospital stay ( adjusted subhazard ratio ( SHR) , 1.06; 95 % CI , 0.83-1.35). There was no association between positive cultures and the presence of secondary infections ( adjusted SHR , 0.99; 95 % CI , 0.58-1.71). Positive cultures are not associated with prognosis in patients with
