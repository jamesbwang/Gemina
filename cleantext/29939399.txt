  Microwave imaging/sensing is an emerging technology that shows potential for healthcare diagnostic applications , particularly in breast cancer detection. This technique estimates the anatomically variant dielectric properties of the breast. Similar to other imaging modalities , nanoparticles ( NPs) could potentially be utilized as contrast agents to increase contrast between healthy and malignant tissues. In this study , aqueous suspensions of NPs such as surface-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes , zinc oxide , and silicon dioxide are studied to assess their potential effective contrast for microwave imaging. Morphology characterization of the NPs has been achieved using atomic force microscopy ( AFM) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). The size and stability of colloidal dispersions have been characterized by dynamic light scattering technique ( DLS) and Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry ( UV-Vis). The dielectric characterization of the aqueous-based colloidal suspensions is recorded over the microwave frequency range between 1 and 4 GHz. Zinc oxide NP dispersion has shown an increase in the dielectric constant compared to the background medium. Furthermore , PEGylation of ZnO NPs can achieve a valid increase in the dielectric constant compared to water , which was shown to be concentration dependent. These results suggest that ZnO nanomaterials have the potential to be used in biomedical applications such as breast imaging to improve diagnostic capabilities.
