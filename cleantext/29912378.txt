  The human gut microbiota , a complex , dynamic and biodiverse community , has been increasingly shown to influence many aspects of health and disease. Metaproteomic analysis has proven to be a powerful approach to study the functionality of the microbiota. However , the processing and analyses of metaproteomic mass spectrometry ( MS) data remains a daunting task in metaproteomics data analysis. We developed iMetaLab , a web based platform to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive data analysis pipeline with a focus on lowering the technical barrier for metaproteomics data analysis. iMetaLab is freely available through at http://imetalab.ca. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
