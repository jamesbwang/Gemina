  We aimed to determine whether late adolescent visual impairment is associated with later psychosis. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of Swedish male military conscripts aged 18 or 19 years from January 1 , 1974 , through December 31 , 1997 ( N = 1140710). At conscription , uncorrected and optometry-lens-corrected distance visual acuity was measured. Participants were then followed up to see if they received an inpatient diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorder , including schizophrenia ( N = 10769). Multivariable Cox modeling was used to estimate differences between groups. After adjustment for confounders , those with severe impairment before optical correction in their best eye ( decimal fraction < 0.3) had an increased psychosis rate compared to those with normal uncorrected vision ( decimal fraction 1.0) ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.26 , 95 % CI 1.16-1.37). Larger interocular visual acuity difference was associated with an increased psychosis rate ( adjusted HR 1.49 , 95 % CI 1.37-1.63 in those with differences > 0.5 compared to those with no between eye acuity difference). Individuals with impaired<symptom> vision<symptom> that could not be corrected to normal with lenses had highest rates of psychosis ( best eye adjusted HR 1.56; 95 % CI 1.33-1.82) , those with imperfect , but correctable vision also had elevated rates ( best eye adjusted HR 1.21; 95 % CI 1.15-1.28). Individuals with visual impairment had higher rates of psychosis than their full siblings with normal vision ( adjusted HR 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.07-1.35). Impaired visual acuity is associated with non-affective psychosis. Visual impairment as a phenotype in psychosis requires further consideration.
