  Gastric cancer ( GC) is one of the most common malignancies with high mortality rate. MiR-152 may exert the function of tumor suppressor by regulating its target gene , including PIK3CA. Nevertheless , all of the described functions are referred explicitly to miR-152-3p , while miR-152-5p as a passenger strand is poorly realized and entirely ignored. We previously selected miR-152-5p as a candidate using cell migration inhibition screening for GC cells and predicted that miR-152-5p might also target PIK3CA. In this study , we found an abnormal proportion of miR-152-3p/ miR-152-5p in GC ( gastric cancer) tissues and cells and demonstrated that miR-152-5p had poorer stability in GC cells , revealing the possibility that miR-152-5p is abnormally `` suppressed '' in gastric cancer. We also investigated and confirmed the role of miR-152-5p in GC by a series of experiments , and found that miR-152-5p modulated cell viability , migration , invasion , and cell-cycle progression of human GC cells , and also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis
