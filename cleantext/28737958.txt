  None Circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and sleep-wake pattern were tested in constant darkness , and four strains of fruit flies originating from three wild populations of Africa , Europe , and the USA were selected to represent four distinct chronotypes: `` larks '' ( early morning and evening activity peaks) , `` owls '' ( late morning and evening peaks) , `` swifts '' ( early morning and late evening peaks) , and `` woodcocks '' ( late morning and early evening peaks). The circadian rhythms and sleep efficiency of the selected chronotypes were further tested under such extreme conditions as either long day ( LD20: 4 at 20 °C) or a combination of LD20: 4 with hot temperature ( 29 °C). Despite the identity of such experimental conditions for four chronotypes , their circadian rhythms and sleep timing showed significantly distinct patterns of response to exposure to heat and/or long days. All two-way repeated measures analysis of variances yielded a significant interaction between chronotype and time of the day ( An experimental study of heritable chronotypes in the fruit fly can facilitate a search for genetic underpinnings of individual variation in vulnerability to circadian misalignment , maladaptive sleep-wake behavior , and sleep disorders.
