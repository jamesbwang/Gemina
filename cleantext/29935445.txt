  The selective extraction and concentration of salt from coal gasification brine ( CGB) by nanofiltration membranes<symptom> is a promising technology to achieve near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification wastewater. To investigate the feasibility of recovery of salts and the interaction of organic compounds , multivalent ions and monovalent ions on the rejection ratio , three nanofiltration membranes<symptom> ( OWNF1 , NF270 and Desal-5 DK) with an 1812 spiral-wound module were used in crossflow filtration. The rejection mechanism was analyzed by comparing the rejection performance as a function of the operation pressure ( increasing from 1.0 MPa to 2.5 MPa) , the concentration ( increasing from 10,000 mg/L to 25,000 mg/L) and pH values ( increasing from 3.0 to 10.0). The concentrations of anions and cations were determined using an ion chromatographic analyzer and an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer , respectively. The results show that the rejection of sulfate and the chemical oxygen demand were higher than 92.12 % and 78.84 % , respectively , at appropriate operation , while negative rejection of chloride was observed in the CGB. The decreasing rejection of organic compounds was due to swelling of the membrane pore in high-concentration solutions. Meanwhile , the organic compounds weakened the negative charge of the membrane active layer , consequently decreasing the ion rejection. More than 85 % of the sodium chloride could be recovered , indicating that this technology is suitable for resource recovery from CGB and near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification industry.
