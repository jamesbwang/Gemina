  The purpose of this study was to analyse the results of hybrid loop endarterectomy from the superficial femoral artery ( SFA) in its occlusion , preformed in a total of forty-two patients. Of these , 27 patients had prior to the intervention been diagnosed with stage II B ischaemia and 15 patients had been diagnosed as having critical ischaemia. Technical success of the operation amounted to 88 % , with the frequency of early thromboses equalling 2.7 %. In the early postoperative period , one patient died of acute myocardial infarction. The 1- , 2- and 3-year remote cumulative primary patency rate amounted to 81 , 74 and 74 % , respectively. There were no amputations performed within the timeframe of the follow-up period. The technique of hybrid loop endarterectomy with the MultiTASC loop followed by stenting of the proximal portion of the popliteal artery in occlusion of the SFA and stenoses of the common femoral artery has proved to be a highly efficient intervention yielding good immediate and remote results.
