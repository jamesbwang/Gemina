  An opportunistic oral pathogen , Treponema<pathogen> denticola<pathogen> ( Td) , has been linked to orodigestive carcinogenesis , but its role in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC) has remained open. We evaluated the presence of Td chymotrypsin-like protease ( Td-CTLP) in a series of 201 unselected consecutive OPSCC patients , and the relation of the Td-CTLP to human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) status , to expression of toll-like receptors ( TLR) 5 , 7 , and 9 , and to clinical parameters and patient outcome. Clinicopathological data came from hospital registries. The expression of cell surface-bound Td-CTLP was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Immunoexpression of TLRs 5 , 7 , and 9 , and HPV<pathogen> status we studied earlier in this patient series. We detected Td-CTLP in 81 % of the OPSCC , and especially in HPV-negative tumours ( 48 % of all OPSCCs). Among the HPV-positive tumours ( 52 % of all OPSCCs) , low Td-CTLP expression associated with low TLR 5 and high TLR 7 expression. Among those HPV-negative , higher TLR 5 and lower TLR 7 expression associated with high Td-CTLP expression. Strong Td-CTLP expression associated with poor disease-specific survival , but no similar association among HPV-positive and HPV-negative subgroups emerged. Td-CTLP was highly expressed in OPSCC and was associated with the HPV<pathogen> status of tumour tissue.
