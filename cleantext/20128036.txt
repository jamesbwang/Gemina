  Objectives This study seeks to delineate trends in esophageal cancer patients in an American cohort and , in particular , examine the impact of race and histology on survival. Methods The association between over 50 variables between histology and race subgroups was evaluated. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariable Cox regression analysis ( MVA) was performed. Results Poorer survival was noted in black vs. white ( 193 ± 65 days vs. 254 ± 39 , 95 % CI 205-295 , p = 0.07) and squamous cell cancer ( SCC) vs. adenocarcinoma ( AC) ( 233 ± 24 days vs. 303 ± 48 , 95 % CI 197-339 , p = 0.01) patients. In patients with resectable cancer , blacks had poorer survival than whites ( 253 ± 46 days vs. 538 ± 202 , 95 % CI 269-603 , p = 0.03) , and SCC had poorer survival than AC ( 333 ± 58 vs. 638 ± 152 days , 95 % CI 306-634 , p = 0.006). A higher percentage of white patients received surgery compared to black patients ( 36 % vs. 8 % , p = 0.08). MVA revealed that only surgery was an independent predictor of mortality ( p = 0.001). Conclusion Black race and SCC were associated with poorer survival. On MVA , surgery was an independent predictor of mortality. Clinicians should be aggressive in offering potentially curative procedures to patients and eliminating socioeconomic barriers.
