  Vitamins are a class of essential nutrients in the body; thus , they play important roles in human health. The chemicals are involved in many physiological functions and both their lack and excess can put health at risk. Therefore , the establishment of methods for monitoring vitamin concentrations in different matrices is necessary. In this review , an updated overview of the main pretreatments and determination methods that have been used since 2010 is given. Ultrasonic assisted extraction , liquid ⁻ liquid extraction , solid phase extraction and dispersive liquid ⁻ liquid microextraction are the most common pretreatment methods , while the determination methods involve chromatography methods , electrophoretic methods , microbiological assays , immunoassays , biosensors and several other methods. Different pretreatments and determination methods are discussed.
