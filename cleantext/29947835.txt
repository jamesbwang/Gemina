  Several Bacillus<pathogen> strains have been well studied for their ability to control soil-borne plant diseases. This property is linked to the production of several families of lipopeptides. Depending of their structure , these compounds show antifungal and/or plant systemic resistance inducing activities. In this work , the biodiversity of lipopeptides produced by different antifungal Bacillus<pathogen> strains isolated from seeds , rhizospheric , and non-rhizospheric soils in Algeria was analyzed. Sixteen active strains were characterized by PCR for their content in genes involved in lipopeptide biosynthesis and by MALDI-ToF for their lipopeptide production , revealing a high biodiversity of products. The difficulty to detect kurstakin genes led us to design two new sets of specific primers. An interesting potential of antifungal activity and the synthesis of two forms of fengycins differing in the eighth amino acid ( Gln/Glu) were found from the strain 8. Investigation of its genome led to the finding of an adenylation domain of the fengycin synthetase predicted to activate the glutamate residue instead of the glutamine one. According to the comparison of both the results of MALDI-ToF-MS and genome analysis , it was concluded that this adenylation domain could activate both residues at the same time. This study highlighted that the richness of the Algerian ecosystems in Bacillus strains is able to produce: surfactin , pumilacidin , lichenysin , kurstakin , and different types of fengycins.
