  Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC) , the fourth most common nonsurgical retinopathy , is characterized by serous retinal detachment most commonly involving the macular region. Although natural history of CSC shows a self-limiting course , patients are known to present with persistent , recurrent , or even bilateral CSC with distressing visual loss. Multimodal imaging techniques for CSC include optical coherence tomography ( OCT) with enhanced depth imaging , fundus autofluorescence , fluorescein angiography , indocyanine green angiography , and OCT angiography. Evolution of new imaging techniques in addition to conventional imaging modalities has revolutionized the understanding about the pathophysiology of CSC and hence the diagnosis and management. This review article elaborates on current understanding about pathophysiology and risk factors , as well as multimodal imaging-based features of CSC.
