  Highly periodic and uniform nanostructures , based on a genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage , displayed unique properties at the nanoscale that have the potential for a variety of applications. In this work , we report a multilayer biofilm with self-assembled nanoporous surfaces involving a nanofiber-like genetically engineered 4E-type M13 bacteriophage , which was fabricated using a simple pulling method. The nanoporous surfaces were effectively formed by using the networking-like structural layers of the M13 bacteriophage during self-assembly. Therefore , an external template was not required. The actual M13 bacteriophage-based fabricated multilayered biofilm with porous nanostructures agreed well with experimental and simulation results. Pores formed in the final layer had a diameter of about 150 ⁻ 500 nm and a depth of about 15 ⁻ 30 nm. We outline a filter application for this multilayered biofilm that enables selected ions to be extracted from a sodium chloride solution. Here , we describe a simple , environmentally friendly , and inexpensive fabrication approach with large-scale production potential. The technique and the multi-layered biofilms produced may be applied to sensor , filter , plasmonics , and bio-mimetic fields.
