  BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine whether the specific season of the year during which the first trimester of pregnancy takes place is significantly associated with the course ( intensification and frequency of occurrence) of an episode of recurrent depressive disorder in adult life. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 184 patients treated for recurrent depressive disorders. RESULTS An analysis of the results obtained indicates that the greatest number of people suffering from a major depressive episode were born in the spring and summer ( from April to September) , meaning that the first trimester of pregnancy occurred between October and March. However , our results were not statistically significant , perhaps due to the small size of the examined group. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained indicate that birth month may be significantly associated with the course of recurrent depressive disorders. In patients from Central Europe , the first trimester of pregnancy falling in autumn and winter seems to be significant. These results need to be interpreted with caution due to the small size of the examined group.
