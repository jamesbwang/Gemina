  In order to facilitate/expedite the production of effective and affordable snake antivenoms , a novel in vitro potency assay was previously developed. The assay is based on an antiserum 's ability to bind to postsynaptic neurotoxin ( PSNT) and thereby inhibit the PSNT binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR). The assay was shown to work well with antiserum against Thai Naja kaouthia which produces predominantly the lethal PSNTs. In this work , the assay is demonstrated to work well with antiserum/antivenom against Bungarus candidus<pathogen> ( BC) , which also produces lethal presynaptic neurotoxins , as well as antivenom against Sri Lankan Naja naja ( NN) , which produces an abundance of cytotoxins. The in vitro and in vivo median effective ratios ( ER
