  AF and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) frequently coexist. Catheter ablation is an increasingly utilised treatment strategy for patients with AF and can be safely performed and is effective in achieving sinus rhythm for patients with HFrEF. Successful ablation may result in improved LV function , clinical heart<symptom> failure<symptom> status , quality of life and possibly even mortality. This review summarises the literature analysing efficacy , safety and outcomes of AF ablation for patients with HFrEF.
