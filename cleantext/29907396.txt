  A new chemical exchange MRI method is proposed which allows for direct detection of exchanging solute protons with concurrent water background suppression. The proposed method , RACETE ( Refocused Acquisition of Chemical Exchange Transferred Excitations) , is based on a stimulated-echo-technique , where the first two excitation pulses are replaced by a train of N solute-selective excitation-transfer modules. This excitation cycle is then followed by a stimulated echo acquisition via selective refocusing of exchanged solute protons now present in the solvent pool. The obtained magnitude and phase phantom images demonstrate that with only one RACETE-imaging experiment two different chemical exchange active substances with mMol-concentrations can be detected and distinguished simultaneously. The proposed RACETE-approach allows for true positive chemical exchange contrast imaging with the proven ability to exploit magnitude as well as phase image data.
