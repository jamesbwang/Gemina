  Phenomenology , clinical diagnostics and treatment of hallucinations Abstract. Hallucinations are perceptions without any stimulus. They occur typically in schizophrenia , but they can be found in other psychiatric or medical disorders as well. Recently , hallucinations have been increasingly reported to occur with a high prevalence in the general population and they are conceptualised as continuum from a physiological to pathological especially psychotic phenomenon. Schizophrenic hallucinations exhibit a special proximity to language and for this they can be considered as diagnostic. Clinically , physicians should explore detailed the semiology of hallucinations in the diagnostic workup. Neurobiology of acoustic hallucinations involve brain regions which are important for hearing , speaking and understanding. This observation is independent of the underlying aetiology of the hallucinations. Standard treatment of psychotic hallucinations consists of antipsychotic substances. In case of resistance electrical brain stimulation methods are increasingly applied. Especially repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) are used.
