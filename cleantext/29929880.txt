  Aberrant expansion of GGGGCC ( G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat ( HNR) in the first intron of C9ORF72 has been found in frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( FTD/ALD). The non-canonical DNA structures of the expanded repeats are causative to repeat instability leading to contraction and expansion. We demonstrate that 1,3-di ( quinolin-2-yl) guanidine ( DQG) binds to GGCCCC/GGCCCC ( G2C4/G2C4) motif in double stranded DNA and also antisense G2C4 HNR DNA in C9ORF72. Large increase in the melting temperature of dsDNA containing the G2C4/G2C4 motif was confirmed by the binding of DQG. The marked CD spectral changes indicated structural transition of d ( G2C4)
