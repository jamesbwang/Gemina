  Schistosomiasis mansoni is involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and portal hypertension. Previous studies proved that blockade of some components of the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) reduce liver fibrogenesis. However , the effects of inhibition of early stages of RAS pathway in schistosomal fibrosis<disease> have not been studied yet. Thus , the aim of this study was to compare the role of different antihypertensive drugs on hepatic fibrosis<disease> in murine schistosomiasis. BALB/c mice ( n = 50) weighing 20g were subjected to inoculation of 50 cercariae and submitted to different treatments: aliskiren , 50 mg/kg ( n = 10); bradykinin , 2 μg/kg ( n = 5); losartan , 10 mg/kg ( n = 10); lisinopril 10 mg/kg ( n = 5) and control , proportional volume vehicle ( n = 5); daily for 14 weeks. Six animals were not subjected to cercariae inoculation or any type of treatment. Ultrasound , histological , immunohistochemical and proteomic analyzes were performed to evaluate markers associated with hepatic fibrogenesis. The hepatic areas stained with Sirius red and thenumber of cells marked by α-SMA in animals treated with aliskiren , bradykinin , lisinopril and losartan were diminished when compared to control group , demonstrating reduced hepatic fibrosis<disease> after RAS blockade. These results were reinforced by ultrasonography analysis and protein expression of TGFβ. These findings demonstrated the effect of RAS inhibition on hepatic fibrosis<disease> in murine schistosomiasis , with the most evident results being observed in the losartan and aliskiren treated groups. The main mechanisms underlying this process appear to involve anti-fibrogenic activity through the inhibition of collagen and TGFβ synthesis.
