  A simple protocol to synthesize d-phenylalanine ( d-PHE)- functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs) via the one-pot method was established by grafting d-PHE onto MWCNTs to obtain d-PHE-MWCNTs under mild reaction conditions. The resulting d-PHE-MWCNTs were characterized in detail via spectroscopy and surface analysis. The electroreduction of 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone at the d-PHE-MWCNTs cathode afforded ( S)- Î±- ( trifluoromethyl) benzyl alcohol whose yield was 65 % and the enantiomeric excess was 40 %. No extra catalysts were required in this electrochemical reaction solution compared with other reactions requiring homogeneous catalysis. The metal-free chiral material also showed acceptable asymmetric electroreduction performance , considerable stability , and favorable reusability.
