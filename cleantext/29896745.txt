  To perform prenatal diagnosis for a fetus with endocardial cushion defect and explore its mechanism. The karotypes of the fetus and its parents were analyzed by routine G-banding. Their genomic DNA was also analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH). The fetus and its mother were found to have a karyotype of 46 , XX , inv ( 8) ( p21q24 .1) , while no karyotypic abnormality was detected for the father. aCGH has detected a 15.14 Mb deletion at 8p23.3-p22 and a 6.87 Mb duplication at 8q24.23-q24.3 in the fetus. The fetus was diagnosed with Rec8 syndrome<disease>. Its abnormal chromosomes have derived from the inv ( 8) carried by its mother. GATA4 and SOX7 may be the key genes for the endocardial cushion defect found in the fetus.
