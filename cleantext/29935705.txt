  Patient safety events ( PSEs) occurring during interfacility transport have not been studied comprehensively in critical care transport ( CCT) teams in the United States. The purpose of this research was to investigate the type and frequency of PSEs during CCT between hospitals; to explore the impact of patient stability , vulnerability , complexity , predictability , and resiliency; and to examine if the nurse factors of licensure or experience and transport factors of duration or mode of transport influence the frequency of PSEs. The study was conducted at a large hospital-based quaternary health care system in the Midwestern United States. This was a retrospective , descriptive correlational study using chart review. The study selected 50 sequential qualifying cases with PSEs and randomly selected control cases reviewed at a single site over a 5-month period. The rate of PSEs was 27.7 events per 1,000 patient contacts. Of 9 reported adverse event types , new or recurrent hypoxia had the greatest frequency. Hypoxia , when present at the time of initial CCT contact , was associated with the PSE occurrence ( P = .046). Duration of transport was a significant predictor of PSEs ( P = .025). Pretransport hypoxia and duration of transport are independent predictors for intratransport PSEs , particularly intratransport hypoxia.
