  To investigate the uptake of HCV therapy among HIV/HCV coinfected patients in the pan-European EuroSIDA study between 2011-2016. All HCV-RNA + patients were included. Baseline was defined as latest of anti-HCV + , January 2011 or enrolment in EuroSIDA. The incidence of starting first IFN-free direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) therapy was calculated. Factors associated with starting IFN-free DAA were determined by Poisson regression. Among 4308 HCV-RNA + patients ( 1255 , 970 , 663 , 633 , 787 from South , West , North , Central East and East Europe , respectively) with 11863 person years of follow up ( PYFU) , 1113 ( 25.8 %) started any HCV therapy. Among patients with ≥ F3 fibrosis<disease> , > 50 % in all regions remained untreated. The incidence ( per 1000 PYFU , 95 % CI) of starting DAA increased from 7.8 ( 5.9- 9.8) in 2014 to 135.2 ( 122.0- 148.5) in 2015 and 128.9 ( 113.5- 144.3) in 2016. The increase was highest in North and West and intermediate in South , but remained modest in Central East and Eastern Europe. After adjustment , females , individuals from Central East or East , genotype 3 , antiretroviral therapy naïve and those with detectable HIV-RNA were less likely to start DAA. Older persons , those with HCV-RNA > 500.000 IU/ml and those with more advanced liver fibrosis<disease> were more likely to start DAA. Uptake of DAA therapy among HIV/HCV coinfected patients increased considerably in Western Europe between 2014 and 2016 , but was modest in Central East and East. In all regions more than 50 % with ≥ F3 fibrosis<disease> remained untreated. Women were less likely to start DAA.
