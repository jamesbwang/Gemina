  Autoimmune liver disease is a refractory disease clinically , and there is no particularly effective drug at present. Therefore , it is of important clinical value to develop new effective intervention drugs for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune liver disease. In order to investigate the potential protective effect of artesunate ( Art) on concanavalin A ( Con A)- induced autoimmune liver injury , different doses of Art ( 27 , 54 , 108 mg · kg ⁻¹) were orally administered to mice for consecutive 7 days , respectively. Then the Con A was injected into mice via tail vein to induce liver injury models. 8 h after modeling , the mice were sacrificed. The serum and liver tissue were collected for detecting the level of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , and aspartate transaminase ( AST) , liver pathological histopathology , inflammatory cytokines and nuclear factor ( NF-κB) key protein expression level. The results showed that 108 mg · kg ⁻¹ Art remarkably reduced Con A-induced liver indexes and serum transaminase levels ( ALT and AST) as compared with model group (
