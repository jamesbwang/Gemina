  Multiple languages can be used at command , if those language abilities were acquired in childhood. In this article , we report the possibility that such abilities are retained throughout adulthood for linguistic savants. We focus on Emil Krebs , a speaker of dozens of languages , and argue about the vast capacity of the multilingual brain. Moreover , we introduce the asymmetry of the grammar center and brain activation changes due to linguistic proficiency , both of which are findings from research on the second language acquisition capability of the brain. It is plausible that research on multilingualism will shed light on the mystery of human creativity in fine arts.
