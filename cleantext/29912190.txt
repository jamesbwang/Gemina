  Organ-to-organ communication by endocrine signaling , for example , from the periphery to the brain , is essential for maintaining homeostasis. As a model animal for endocrine research , Drosophila melanogaster , which has sophisticated genetic tools and genome information , is being increasingly used. This article describes a method for the calcium imaging of Drosophila brain explants. This method enables the detection of the direct signaling of a hormone to the brain. It is well known that many peptide hormones act through G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) , whose activation causes an increase in the intracellular Ca
