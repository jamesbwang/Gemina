  In this paper , we introduce a newly developed multi-scale wavelet model for the interpretation of surface electromyography ( SEMG) signals and validate the model 's capability to characterize changes in neuromuscular activation in cases with myofascial pain syndrome<disease> ( MPS) via machine learning methods. The SEMG data collected from normal ( N = 30; 27 women , 3 men) and MPS subjects ( N = 26; 22 women , 4 men) were adopted for this retrospective analysis. SMEGs were measured from the taut-band loci on both sides of the trapezius muscle on the upper back while he/she conducted a cyclic bilateral backward shoulder extension movement within 1 min. Classification accuracy of the SEMG model to differentiate MPS patients from normal subjects was 77 % using template matching and 60 % using K-means clustering. Classification consistency between the two machine learning methods was 87 % in the normal group and 93 % in the MPS group. The 2D feature graphs derived from the proposed multi-scale model revealed distinct patterns between normal subjects and MPS patients. The classification consistency using template matching and K-means clustering suggests the potential of using the proposed model to characterize interference pattern changes induced by MPS.
