  Most two-dimensional ( 2D) covalent organic frameworks ( COFs) are non-fluorescent in the solid state even when they are constructed from emissive building blocks. The fluorescence quenching is usually attributed to non-irradiative rotation-related or π-π stacking-caused thermal energy dissipation process. Currently there is a lack of guiding principle on how to design fluorescent , solid-state material made of COF. Herein , we demonstrate that the eclipsed stacking structure of 2D COFs can be used to turn on , and tune , the solid-state photoluminescence from non-emissive building blocks by the restriction of intramolecular bond rotation via intralayer and interlayer hydrogen bonds among highly organized layers in the eclipse-stacked COFs. Our COFs serve as a platform whereby the size of the conjugated linkers and side-chain functionalities can be varied , rendering the emission colour-tuneable from blue to yellow and even white. This work provides a guide to design new solid-state emitters using COFs.
