  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of high-fidelity simulators with multidisciplinary teaching on self-reported confidence in residents. A total of 26 residents participated in a session led by a pediatric faculty member and a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit transport nurse using a high-fidelity pediatric simulator. Multiple scenarios were presented and each resident took turns in various roles. Pre-intervention surveys based on a 5-point Likert-type scale were given before the scenarios and were compared to the results of identical post-intervention surveys. Statistically significant ( p < 0.05) pre to post gains for self-confidence were observed. Improvements in confidence were analyzed using the mean difference. The largest improvement in confidence was seen in the ability to treat neonatal respiratory arrest. This was followed by the ability to supervise/run a code , and the ability to place an umbilical venous catheter. These results revealed that high-fidelity simulation-based training has significant positive gains in residents ' self-reported confidence.
