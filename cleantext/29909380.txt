  Schwannomatosis is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to schwannomas of mainly spinal and peripheral nerves with some diagnostic overlap with neurofibromatosis-2 ( NF2) , but the underlying epidemiology is poorly understood. We present the birth incidence and prevalence allowing for overlap with NF2. Schwannomatosis and NF2 cases were ascertained from the Manchester region of England ( population = 4.8 million) and from across the UK. Point prevalence and birth incidence were calculated from regional birth statistics. Genetic analysis was also performed on Regional prevalence for schwannomatosis and NF2 were 1 in 126 315 and 50 500 , respectively , with calculated birth incidences of 1 in 68 956 and 1 in 27 956. Mosaic Within the highly ascertained North-West England population , schwannomatosis has less than half the birth incidence and prevalence of NF2.
