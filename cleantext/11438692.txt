  Coconuts ( Cocos nucifera L.) are divided by the height into tall and dwarf types. In many plants the short phenotype was emerged by mutation of the GA20ox gene encoding the enzyme involved in gibberellin ( GA) biosynthesis. Two CnGA20ox genes , CnGA20ox1 and CnGA20ox2 , were cloned from tall and dwarf types coconut. The sequences , gene structures and expressions were compared. The structure of each gene comprised three exons and two introns. The CnGA20ox1 and CnGA20ox2 genes consisted of the coding region of 1110 and 1131 bp , encoding proteins of 369 and 376 amino acids , respectively. Their amino acid sequences are highly homologous to GA20ox1 and GA20ox2 genes of Elaeis guineensis , but only 57 % homologous to each other. However , the characteristic amino acids two histidines and one aspartic acid which are the two iron ( Fe
