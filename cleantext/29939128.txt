  The Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile) is a highly invasive pest , yet very little is known about its viruses. We analysed individual RNA-sequencing data from 48 Argentine ant queens to identify and characterisze their viruses. We discovered eight complete RNA virus genomes- all from different virus families- and one putative partial entomopoxvirus genome. Seven of the nine virus sequences were found from ant samples spanning 7 years , suggesting that these viruses may cause long-term infections within the super-colony. Although all nine viruses successfully infect Argentine ants , they have very different characteristics , such as genome organization , prevalence , loads , activation frequencies and rates of evolution. The eight RNA viruses constituted in total 23 different virus combinations which , based on statistical analysis , were non-random , suggesting that virus compatibility is a factor in infections. We also searched for virus sequences from New Zealand and Californian Argentine ant RNA-sequencing data and discovered that many of the viruses are found on different continents , yet some viruses are prevalent only in certain colonies. The viral loads described here most probably present a normal asymptomatic level of infection; nevertheless , detailed knowledge of Argentine ant viruses may enable the design of viral biocontrol methods against this pest.
