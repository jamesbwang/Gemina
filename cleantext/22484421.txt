  We prospectively examined whether surface expression of Cytokine Receptor-Like Factor 2 ( CRLF2) on leukemic blasts is associated with survival and induction treatment response in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( BCP-ALL) patients. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow-derived leukemia<disease> cells revealed that 7.51 % ( 29/286) of 386 pediatric BCP-ALL patients were CRLF2-positive ( CRLF2pos) at diagnosis. The median minimal residual disease ( MRD) was lower in CRLF2pos than CRLF2-negative ( CRLF2neg) patients on day 15 ( MRD15) after induction therapy ( 0.01 % ( 0.001-0.42 %) vs. 0.45 % ( 0.05-3.50 %); p = 0.001). By contrast , the MRD15 was higher in Ikaros family Zinc Finger Protein 1 (
