  The duration of the infectious period is a crucial determinant of the ability of an infectious<disease> disease<disease> to spread. We consider an epidemic model that is network based and non-Markovian , containing classic Kermack-McKendrick , pairwise , message passing , and spatial models as special cases. For this model , we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious period ( with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of distributions , this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove , with a fixed basic reproductive ratio ( R _ ( 0)) , a monotonic relationship between the variability of the posterior transmission probability ( which is a function of the infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. Thus again , even when R _ ( 0) is fixed , variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show how our results apply to message passing , pairwise , and Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models , even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic dynamics. For Poissonian contact processes , and arbitrarily distributed infectious periods , we demonstrate how systems of delay differential equations and ordinary differential equations can provide upper and lower bounds , respectively , for the probability that any given individual has been infected by any given time.
