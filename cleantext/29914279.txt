  Discrepancies between automatically activated associations ( i.e. , implicit evaluations) and explicit evaluations of motives ( measured with a questionnaire) could lead to greater information processing to resolve discrepancies or self-regulatory failures that may affect behavior. This research examined the relationship of health and appearance exercise-related explicit-implicit evaluative discrepancies , the interaction between implicit and explicit evaluations , and the combined value of explicit and implicit evaluations ( i.e. , the summed scores) to dropout from a yearlong exercise program. Participants ( N = 253) completed implicit health and appearance measures and explicit health and appearance motives at baseline , prior to starting the exercise program. The sum of implicit and explicit appearance measures was positively related to weeks in the program , and discrepancy between the implicit and explicit health measures was negatively related to length of time in the program. Implicit exercise evaluations and their relationships to oft-cited motives such as appearance and health may inform exercise dropout.
