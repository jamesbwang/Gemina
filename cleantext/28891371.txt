  Long-term combination antiretroviral therapy often results in toxicity/tolerability problems , which are one of the main reasons for switching treatment. Despite the favorable profile of raltegravir ( RAL) , data on its combination with abacavir/lamivudine ( ABC/3TC) are scarce. Based on clinical data , we evaluated this regimen as a switching strategy. Multicenter , non-controlled , retrospective study including all virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients who had switched to RAL+ABC/ 3TC. We evaluated effectiveness ( defined as maintenance of HIV-1-RNA < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks) safety , tolerability , laboratory data , and CD4 + count at week 48 of this switching strategy. The study population comprised 467 patients. Median age was 49 years ( IQR: 45-53). Males accounted for 75.4 %. Median CD4 + count at baseline was 580 cells/Î¼L ( IQR , 409). The main reasons for switching were toxicity/tolerability problems ( 197; 42.2 %) and physician 's criteria ( 133; 28.5 %). At week 48 , HIV-1 RNA remained at < 50 copies/mL in 371/380 ( 97.6 %; 95 % CI: 96.4-99.0) when non-virological failure was censured. Virological failure was recorded in 1.9 % patients and treatment failure in 20.5 % of patients ( 96/467 ( 95 % CI , 16.9-24.2)). The main reasons for treatment failure included switch to fixed-dose combination regimens ( 31; 6.6 %) , toxicity/poor tolerability ( 27; 5.8 %) , and physician 's decision ( 17; 3.6 %). A total of 73 adverse events were detected in 64 patients ( 13.7 %). These resolved in 43 patients ( 67.2 %). Of the 33 cases related or likely related to treatment , 30 were Grade-1 ( 90.9 %). CD4 + count and renal , hepatic , and lipid profiles remained clinically stable over the 48 weeks. Our findings suggest that RAL+ABC/ 3TC could be an effective , safe/tolerable , and low-toxicity option for virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients.
