  Many renaturation projects and compensation areas are based on the use of seeds from regional indigenous wild plants; in the following: native or regional seeds. Despite this , such seeds make up only a small proportion of the total number of seeds used for greening projects; in Germany , for example , it is only around 1 % ( = 200 t per year). Although the market for regional seeds is small , it is highly competitive. High-priced native seeds compete with flower mixes of unspecified origin and can only be differentiated from them by reliable quality seals. A quality assurance system based on seed legislation ( EU Directive 2010/60 , preservation mixtures) has been developed in a few European countries. However , quality assurance ends with the sale of the seeds. Thus , seed use remains unmonitored , and often unsuitable material , or material foreign to the region , is planted in restoration areas. Unfortunately , nature conservation has not made seed-based restoration one of its key issues , neither at the European nor at the national level. Currently there are many different local and regional standards , methods and private certificates that are confusing for users and which provide little continuity and predictability for producers. We recommend the establishment of an EU directive or a broadly agreed recommendation to the EU member states , spearheaded by nature conservation , which would define the standards for producing and using native seeds ( e.g. harmonised regions that cross national borders , quality regulations). At the same time , wild plant interest groups should combine existing structures in order to strengthen seed-based restoration through international cooperation.
