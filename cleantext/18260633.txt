  To date , special interest has been paid to composite scaffolds based on polymers enriched with hydroxyapatite ( HA). However , the role of HA containing different trace elements such as silicate in the structure of a polymer scaffold has not yet been fully explored. Here , we report the potential use of silicate-containing hydroxyapatite ( SiHA) microparticles and microparticle aggregates in the predominant range from 2.23 to 12.40 µm in combination with polycaprolactone ( PCL) as a hybrid scaffold with randomly oriented and well-aligned microfibers for regeneration of bone tissue. Chemical and mechanical properties of the developed 3D scaffolds were investigated with XRD , FTIR , EDX and tensile testing. Furthermore , the internal structure and surface morphology of the scaffolds were analyzed using synchrotron X-ray µCT and SEM. Upon culturing human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC) on PCL-SiHA scaffolds , we found that both SiHA inclusion and microfiber orientation affected cell adhesion. The best hMSCs viability was revealed at 10 day for the PCL-SiHA scaffolds with well-aligned structure ( ~ 82 %). It is expected that novel hybrid scaffolds of PCL will improve tissue ingrowth in vivo due to hydrophilic SiHA microparticles in combination with randomly oriented and well-aligned PCL microfibers , which mimic the structure of extracellular matrix of bone tissue.
