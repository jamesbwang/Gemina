  A 72-year-old male patient with a history of polycystic kidney disease and lung malignancy underwent F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( FDG PET/CT) for the evaluation of tumor recurrence. The FDG PET/CT and subsequent non-enhanced CT scans revealed a hemorrhage<symptom> in the peri-renal space of the left original kidney. Interesting in this case was the incidental detection of unexpected peri-renal hemorrhage<symptom> during an oncologic assessment with FDG PET/CT.
