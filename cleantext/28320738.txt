  Natural killer ( NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play essential roles in mediating antitumor immunity. NK cells respond to various inflammatory stimuli including cytokines and stress-induced cellular ligands which activate germline-encoded activation receptors ( NKRs) , such as NKG2D. The signaling molecules activated downstream of NKRs are well defined; however , the mechanisms that regulate these pathways are not fully understood. IQ domain-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1) is a ubiquitously expressed scaffold protein. It regulates diverse cellular signaling programs in various physiological contexts , including immune cell activation and function. Therefore , we sought to investigate the role of IQGAP1 in NK cells. Development and maturation of NK cells from mice lacking IQGAP1 (
