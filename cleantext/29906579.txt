  Cavernous sinus ( CS) invasion is an unfavorable factor hindering the remission of growth hormone ( GH)- secreting pituitary adenomas. Little data exist on aggressive surgical resection , however. We investigated the role of CS exploration for GH-secreting pituitary adenomas with CS invasion. We classified 132 patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenomas invading CS into 4 groups. The patients underwent surgery using a microsurgical transsphenoidal approach ( TSA) with endoscopic assistance. Adenomas with CS invasion confined to the medial compartment of the internal carotid artery ( ICA) were classified as type A ( without radiologic evidence) or type B ( with radiologic evidence). Adenomas with ICA encasement were classified according to the surgical approach as type C ( standard TSA) or type D ( far-lateral TSA). Surgical and endocrinologic outcomes were compared across groups. For type A , B , C , and D tumors , the rates of gross total resection were 100 % , 73.6 % , 14.7 % , and 0 % , respectively , and the rates of endocrinologic remission by surgery alone were 100 % , 62.3 % , 26.5 % , and 0 % , respectively. There was no endocrinologic remission by surgery alone for type D tumors; nevertheless , compared with type C tumors , type D tumors showed marked reductions in the postoperative nadir of GH at 1 week , 6 months , and 1 year and of insulin-like growth factor I at 1 year. For tumors with CS invasion confined to the medial compartment of the ICA , total resection should be attempted by direct visualization of the entire medial wall of the CS. Even for tumors with ICA encasement , aggressive tumor resection by far-lateral TSA can increase the chance of remission with the help of adjuvant treatment.
