  Chronotype , reflecting interindividual differences in daily activity patterns and sleep-wake cycles , is intrinsically connected with well-being. Research indicates increased risk of many adverse mental health outcomes for evening-type individuals. Here , we provide an overview of the current evidence available on the relationship between chronotype and psychiatric disorders. The association between eveningness and depression<symptom> is well established cross-sectionally , with preliminary support from longitudinal studies. The mechanisms underlying this relationship warrant further research; deficient cognitive-emotional processes have recently been implicated. Eveningness is associated with unhealthy lifestyle habits , and the propensity of evening types to addiction has been recognized. Chronotype may also be implicated in disordered eating. Eveningness is associated with depression-including seasonal affective disorder ( SAD)- and substance dependence , while support for a relation with anxiety<symptom> disorders and psychosis is lacking. In bipolar disorder , chronotype is linked to depression<symptom> but not mania. Eveningness is also related to sleep disturbances and poor lifestyle habits , which may increase risk for psychiatric disorders.
