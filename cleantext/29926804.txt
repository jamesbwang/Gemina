  Maintaining the epithelial status of cells in vitro and fabrication of a multilayered epithelial lining is one of the key problems in the therapy using cell technologies. When cultured in a monolayer , epithelial cells change their phenotype from epithelial to epithelial-mesenchymal or mesenchymal that makes it difficult to obtain a sufficient number of cells in a 2D culture and to use them in tissue engineering. Here , using buccal epithelial cells from the oral mucosa , we developed a novel approach to recover and maintain the stable cell phenotype and form a multilayered epithelial lining in vitro via the 2D/3D cell self-assembling. Transitioning the cells from the monolayer to non-adhesive 3D culture conditions led to formation of self-assembling spheroids , with restoration of their epithelial characteristics after epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In 7 days , the cells within spheroids restored the apical-basal polarity , and the formation of both tight ( ZO1) and adherent ( E-cadherin) intercellular junctions was shown. Thus , culturing buccal epithelial cells in a 3D system allowed us to recover and durably maintain the morphological and functional characteristics of epithelial cells. The multilayered epithelial lining formation was achieved after placing spheroids for 7 days onto a hybrid matrix , which consisted of collagen layers and reinforcing poly ( lactide-co-glycolide) fibers and was proven promising for replacement of the urothelium. Thus , we offer an effective technique of forming multilayered epithelial linings on carrier-matrices using cell spheroids that was not previously described elsewhere and can find a wide range of applications in tissue engineering , replacement surgery , and regenerative medicine.
