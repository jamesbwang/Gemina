  The SLIT2 ligand and ROBO receptors of the SLIT/ROBO pathway are expressed in hen ovarian follicles and have been shown to play critical roles in ovary development , cell proliferation and apoptosis in mammals. However , the exact roles of SLIT2 and the molecular mechanisms of chicken follicle development remain poorly understood. Here , we discovered that high levels of SLIT2 suppress FSHR , GDF9 , STAR and CYP11A1 mRNA and protein expression in granulosa<pathogen> cells ( GCs) and cell proliferation ( p < 0.01). However , these inhibitory effects can be abolished by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors. Furthermore , the activity of CDC42 , which is a key Rho GTPase in the SLIT/ROBO pathway , is regulated by the ligand SLIT2 because the intrinsic GTPase activation activity of CDC42 is activated or repressed by regulating SRGAP1 expression ( p < 0.01). The effects of the SLIT2 overexpression on GC proliferation and phosphorylation of the B-RAF , RAF1 and ERK1/2 kinases were completely abrogated by knocking down endogenous PAK1 and partially abrogated by the knockdown of PAK2 and PAK3 in the GCs. Collectively , our findings indicate that SLIT2 suppresses GC proliferation , differentiation and follicle selection mainly by a mechanism involving ROBO1 and ROBO2 and that this suppression is mediated by the CDC42-PAKs-ERK1/ 2 MAPK signaling cascade in the prehierarchical follicles of the chicken ovary.
