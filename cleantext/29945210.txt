  The ability to self-renew is one of the most important properties of embryonic stem ( ES) cells. Pluripotin ( SC1) , a small molecule with high activity and low toxicity , promotes self-renewal in mouse ES cells. SC1 can noticeably change the morphology of retinoic acid ( RA)- induced F9 embryonic carcinoma cells ( F9 cells). However , in the long term , RA and SC1 together cause cell apoptosis. When being added after 18-24 h of RA-induced F9 cell differentiation , SC1 transitorily activated Nanog and Oct4. Both Nanog and Oct4 were downregulated when SC1 and RA were added simultaneously. On the other hand , Klf4 was continually activated when SC1 was added between 6 and 24 h. Phosphorylated Erk1/2 protein levels were reduced from 6 to 24 h , whereas unphosphorylated Erk1 protein levels remained unchanged. A higher concentration of SC1 promoted cell self-renewal by strengthening the inhibition of Erk1/2 protein phosphorylation in F9 cells. Furthermore , SC1 and RA affect global DNA methylation by influencing the expressions of methylation-associated proteins , including Dnmt3b , Dnmt3l , Tet1 , Tet2 , and Tet3. In conclusion , SC1 inhibits the differentiation of RA-induced F9 cells mainly by reducing the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and enhancing the expression of Klf4 , although it also reduces DNA methylation , which may have an additional effect on ES cell differentiation.
