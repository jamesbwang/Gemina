  The interplay between human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) and the innate immune response is a critical process that has attracted the attention of many research groups. The emerging scenario is that the immune response of an HCMV-infected host is mediated by a plethora of viral DNA sensors acting as pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs) , which are capable of inhibiting indirectly viral<disease> infection<disease> through the activation of two distinct downstream signaling cascades. The first one triggers the production of cytokines , chemokines and interferons ( IFNs) , while the second one leads to inflammasome complex formation , which in turn promotes the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β ( IL-1β). An additional first line of defense against HCMV is represented by a multiplicity of constitutively expressed restriction factors that inhibit viral replication by directly interfering with the activity of essential viral/cellular genes. Here , we take a closer look at some of the most representative intrinsic restriction factors involved in HCMV infection ( e.g. IFI16 , ND10 complex , viperin and APOBEC3) and review our current understanding of the mechanisms that HCMV has evolved to counteract both IFN and inflammasome responses.
