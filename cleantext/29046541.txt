  For over a century , physiological tools and techniques have been allowing researchers to characterize how organisms respond to changes in their natural environment and how they interact with human activities or infrastructure. Over time , many of these techniques have become part of the conservation physiology toolbox , which is used to monitor , predict , conserve , and restore plant and animal populations under threat. Here , we provide a summary of the tools that currently comprise the conservation physiology toolbox. By assessing patterns in articles that have been published in ` Conservation Physiology ' over the past 5 years that focus on introducing , refining and validating tools , we provide an overview of where researchers are placing emphasis in terms of taxa and physiological sub-disciplines. Although there is certainly diversity across the toolbox , metrics of stress physiology ( particularly glucocorticoids) and studies focusing on mammals have garnered the greatest attention , with both comprising the majority of publications ( > 45 %). We also summarize the types of validations that are actively being completed , including those related to logistics ( sample collection , storage and processing) , interpretation of variation in physiological traits and relevance for conservation science. Finally , we provide recommendations for future tool refinement , with suggestions for: ( i) improving our understanding of the applicability of glucocorticoid physiology; ( ii) linking multiple physiological and non-physiological tools; ( iii) establishing a framework for plant conservation physiology; ( iv) assessing links between environmental disturbance , physiology and fitness; ( v) appreciating opportunities for validations in under-represented taxa; and ( vi) emphasizing tool validation as a core component of research programmes. Overall , we are confident that conservation physiology will continue to increase its applicability to more taxa , develop more non-invasive techniques , delineate where limitations exist , and identify the contexts necessary for interpretation in captivity and the wild.
