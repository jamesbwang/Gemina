  Gynecologic cancers comprise of mostly uterine , ovarian , and cervical malignancies and are responsible for 95,000 new cases annually in the United States. Uterine cancer is the most common and the number of new cases and mortality has been increasing. Cervical cancer has decreased due to screening , early detection , and treatment of pre-invasive cancers. However , ovarian cancer remains the most lethal because of advanced stage at diagnosis and drug resistance. The metastatic spread pattern differs amongst these cancers , with uterine and cervical cancer found mostly in the primary organ and ovarian cancer disseminating throughout the peritoneum and upper abdomen at presentation. The primary treatment of ovarian cancer typically involves surgery followed by systemic therapy for more advanced disease. Previously , systemic chemotherapy with platinums , taxanes , doxorubicin , topotecan , and gemcitabine has been the standard in either upfront or recurrent setting. With molecular and genetic breakthroughs , we now have over eight new indications and five novel biologic therapies including antiangiogenics , poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors , and immunotherapies approved over the last 3 years. In this review , we will examine the biology of gynecologic cancer metastasis and focus on new treatment options for these cancers with a focus on ovarian cancer.
