  Tissue transplantation is an important tool for in vivo studies of pattern organization and axis establishment or maintenance in planarians. Further , transplants can inform on cell movements under different regenerative conditions or genetic backgrounds. Here , we detail classical grafting strategies that have been variously employed in planarian research over the last few decades. These protocols remain similarly useful for addressing current and future questions in the field and the step-by-step protocol that we provide allows facile adaptation of this important method into the experimental repertoire of a laboratory.
