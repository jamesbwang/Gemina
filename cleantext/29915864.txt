  Chronic lymphatic leukaemia ( CLL) is one of the most common leukaemic diseases in middle Europe. Pathological fractures are rare findings in patients with CLL. The diagnosis of CLL is in most cases an incidental finding as it often stays asymptomatic for years. This article presents an interesting case of a 65-year-old male patient with known asymptomatic CLL for 5 years and fractures of the proximal femur and proximal radius after trauma. During the hospital stay the patient suffered multiple pathological fractures with histological findings of bony infiltration of the CLL and an acute phase , which was treated by combination chemotherapy.
