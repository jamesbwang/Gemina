  Human carbonic anhydrase ( CA) IX has emerged as a promising anticancer target and a diagnostic biomarker for solid hypoxic tumors. Novel fluorinated CA IX inhibitors exhibited up to 50 pM affinity towards the recombinant human CA IX , selectivity over other CAs , and direct binding to Zn ( II) in the active site of CA IX inducing novel conformational changes as determined by X-ray crystallography. Mass spectrometric gas-analysis confirmed the CA IX-based mechanism of the inhibitors in a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CA IX knockout in HeLa cells. Hypoxia-induced extracellular acidification was significantly reduced in HeLa , H460 , MDA-MB-231 , and A549 cells exposed to the compounds , with the
