  Unilateral condylar hyperplasia<disease> is a rare growth disorder originating in the growth centre of the mandibular condyles and resulting in facial asymmetry. Primary treatment consists of condylectomy. In this cross-sectional research , limitations in mandibular function and oral health related quality of life were measured with the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire and the Oral Health Impact Profile ( NL49). The study included 17 patients who underwent treatment for unilateral condylar hyperplasia<disease> with a condylectomy in the University Medical Center Groningen between 1997 and 2012. The median ( IQR) scores of the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire ( 8,0 ( 1,0; 15,0)) and the Oral Health Impact Profile ( 25,0 ( 3,0; 53,0) were low compared to other conditions involving the mandible. A higher age was associated with increased limitations in mandibular function ( rs = 0,588 ( p = 0,013)). After a condylectomy for unilateral condylar hyperplasia<disease> the functional impairment of the mandible and the decrease in oral health related quality of life are low.
