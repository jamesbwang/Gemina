  Diet supplementation with polyphenols is a novel strategy to improve meat quality in livestock , by preventing oxidative deterioration of lipids and protein. Polyphenols have beneficial effects on both human and animal health and can be obtained from several sources , such as olive mill wastewaters ( OMWW). These are severe environmental pollutants and therefore may be recycled and utilized in other sectors. The aim of this study was to evaluate growth performance , meat characteristics , fatty acid composition , antioxidant status , different forms of myoglobin and malondialdehyde formation in kids who received a diet supplemented with polyphenols obtained from OMWW. Weaned goat kids ( n = 18) were divided into two homogenous groups: control ( C) group ( n = 9) received a fattening standard diet while the other group ( n = 9) received the same diet , supplemented with 3.2 mg/day of polyphenols powder extract ( PE group). Average daily gain ( ADG) was calculated 10 days apart throughout the study. After 78 days , the kids were slaughtered and pH and carcass yield were evaluated. Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle was collected and utilized for chemical analysis , meat quality evaluation and oxidative stability. No differences were recorded in ADG , carcass weight , pH and dressing between the two groups. Furthermore a similar meat proximate composition , texture and color was observed. Dietary polyphenols supplementation significantly ( P < 0.01) decreased short chains ( < C12: 0) ( 2.93 + 0.50 and 0.35 + 0.40 g/100 g of fatty acids , for C and PE Group , respectively) , and saturated ( 49.22 ± 2.39 and 39.51 ± 1.95 g/100 g , in C and PE Group , respectively) fatty acids. Furthermore , a higher ( P < 0.05) proportion of monounsaturated ( 34.35 ± 2.84 and 42.22 ± 2.32 g/100 g , in C and PE Group , respectively) fatty acids was recorded. Malondialdehyde formation was significantly ( P < 0.05) lower in PE compared to C Group ( 0.25 ± 0.005 and 0.15 ± 0.005 , in C and PE Group , respectively). Polyphenols dietary supplementation has positive effects on kid meat , improving fatty acid profile and reducing malondialdehyde contents. Furthermore the utilization of OMWW as the source of polyphenols may represent an innovative strategy to re-utilize agri-food industry wastes.
