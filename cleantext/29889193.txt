  Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of many diseases , including cancer , cardiovascular diseases and infection. The metabolic motor units of cells are enzymes and their activity is heavily regulated at many levels , including the transcriptional , mRNA stability , translational , post-translational and functional level. This complex regulation means that conventional quantitative or imaging assays , such as quantitative mRNA experiments , Western Blots and immunohistochemistry , yield incomplete information regarding the ultimate activity of enzymes , their function and/or their subcellular localization. Quantitative enzyme cytochemistry and histochemistry ( i.e. , metabolic mapping) show in-depth information on in situ enzymatic activity and its kinetics , function and subcellular localization in an almost true-to-nature situation. We describe a protocol to detect the activity of dehydrogenases , which are enzymes that perform redox reactions to reduce cofactors such as NAD ( P)
