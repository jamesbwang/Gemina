  Many studies have reported an increased mortality risk from heat waves comparing with non-heat wave days. However , how much the mortality rate change with the heat intensity-vulnerability curve-is still unknown. Such unknown information makes the related managers impossible to assess scientifically life losses from heat waves , consequently fail in conducting suitable integrated risk management measures. We used the heat wave intensity index ( HWII) to characterize quantitatively the heat waves , then applied a distributed lag non-linear model to explore the area-specific definition of heat wave , and developed the vulnerability models on the relationships between HWII and mortality by age and by area. Finally , Monte Carlo method was run to assess and compare the event-based probabilistic heat wave risk during the periods of 1971-2015 and 2051-2095. We found a localized definition of heat wave for each corresponding area based on the minimum AIC ( Akaike information criterion). Under the local heat wave events , the expected life loss during 1971-2015 does distinguish across areas , and decreases consistently in the order of WZ Chongqing , PK Nanjing and YX Guangzhou for each age group. More specifically , for the elders ( â‰¥ 65) , the average annual loss ( AAL) ( and 95 % confidence interval) would be 61.3 ( 30.6-91.9) , 38 ( 3.8-72.2) and 18.7 ( 7.3-30) deaths per million people. With two stresses from warming and aging in future China , the predicted average AAL of the elders under four Representative Carbon Pathways ( 2.6 , 4.5 , 6.0 , and 8.5) during 2051-2095 would be 2460 , 1675 , 465 deaths per million for PK Nanjing , YX Guangzhou and WZ Chongqing , respectively , approximately becoming 8 ~ 90 times of the AAL during 1971-2015. This study found that the non-linear HWII-mortality relationships vary by age and area. The heat wave mortality losses are closely associated with the social-economic level. With the increasing extreme climatic events and a rapid aging trend in China , our findings can provide guidance for policy-makers to take appropriate regional adaptive measures to reduce health risks in China.
