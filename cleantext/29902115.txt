  Enzymes are indispensable biocatalysts required in various steps of textile processing to minimize various chemical-induced hazards. The present work focuses on the applications of the truncated α-amylase in textile industry for desizing of fabrics by starch hydrolysis. The multiple sequence alignment was performed to find homology and the possible truncation region in Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> MTCC 121 α-amylase with same bacilli family α-amylase. Two constructs were generated for α-amylase gene of Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> MTCC 121 ( Amy_F , full-length and Amy_T , C-terminal truncated) were cloned , overexpressed , purified , and characterized. Results revealed that activity of Amy_T was found to be 2.87-fold better than Amy_F. Further , the optimum temperature of Amy_F and Amy_T was obtained at 45 °C and 55 °C , respectively , whereas optimum pH was recorded at pH 7 and pH 8 , respectively. Improved thermostability of Amy_T was further confirmed through thermal shift assay. Subsequently , starch-coated fabrics were tested for starch removal using the α-amylases. Comparative analysis revealed that Amy_T performed better in starch removal from polystyrene ( 85 %) , silk ( 75 %) , and cotton ( 70 %) fabrics. The removal of starch from the fabrics was further confirmed by FESEM. Conclusively , this work presents one truncated α-amylase as an improved candidate over its full-length counterpart for textile desizing.
