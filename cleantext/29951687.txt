  The tripodal ligand TREN- ( 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene) 3 ( H3L) was synthesized and its tris ( phenolato) lanthanide complexes L-Ln ( Ln = NdIII , EuIII , TbIII , GdIII , ErIII , YbIII and LuIII) were prepared. The X-Ray crystal structures confirm that each metal ion resides in a similar monocapped octahedral geometry , excluding water molecules from the coordination sphere. The coordination bond distances are in agreement with the lanthanide contraction , with Ln-O bond lengths in the range 2.139-2.216 Å. The complexes show three reversible monoelectronic oxidation waves , which are assigned to the successive oxidation of the phenolate moieties to phenoxyl radicals. The L-Nd complex is the easiest to oxidize , with E11/2 = 0.11 , E21/2 = 0.21 and E31/2 = 0.34 V vs. Fc +/ Fc , due to the larger size of the lanthanide ion. The ΔE1/2 value ( ΔE1/2 = E21/2- E11/2) is correlated to the lanthanide radius , with values of 0.10 V for L-Nd and 0.22 V for L-Lu. The monoradical species were persistent in solution , allowing for their characterisation. All exhibit a distinct absorption band at around 445 nm due to the phenoxyl π-π * transitions. The EPR spectrum of L-Lu + consists of a single resonance at giso = 1.999 , confirming the radical nature of the oxidized product. Most of the other complexes ( L-Gd , L-Er , L-Yb) show a quenching of the LnIII-based resonances upon oxidation , indicative of magnetic interactions between the metal and the radical spins. The L-Ln ( L = Nd , Er , Yb) complexes exhibit a metal-based luminescence upon excitation of the ligand. A significant quenching of the luminescence was observed upon radical formation: 92 % , 83 % and 79 % respectively for L-Nd + , L-Er + and L-Yb +.
