  Calcineurin inhibitors are an established first-line corticosteroid-sparing therapy for patients with corticosteroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome<disease> ( CDNS) , whereas B-lymphocyte-depleting therapy is mostly used as a rescue for calcineurin inhibitor-resistant cases. The positive efficacy and safety profile of rituximab raises the question of whether it could be used as a first-line alternative to calcineurin inhibitor therapy. To compare the efficacy of rituximab and tacrolimus in maintaining relapse-free survival among children with CDNS. A parallel-arm , open-label , randomized clinical trial was performed from May 8 , 2015 , to September 20 , 2016 , with 1-year follow-up in a single-center , tertiary care unit. A total of 176 consecutive children aged 3 to 16 years with CDNS not previously treated with corticosteroid-sparing agents were screened for eligibility. The children received either tacrolimus ( along with tapering alternate-day prednisolone) for 12 months or a single course of rituximab ( 2 infusions of 375 mg/m2). Twelve-month relapse-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Of the 176 children screened for eligibility , 120 were randomized and all but 3 patients completed 1 year of follow-up. The groups were comparable , with mean ( SD) age of 7.2 ( 2.8) years , 32 boys ( 53.3 %) in each group , mean ( SD) disease duration of 2.5 ( 1.5) years and 2.3 ( 1.7) in the tacrolimus and rituximab groups , respectively , disease duration less than 1 year among 15 children ( 25.0 %) in each group , median ( interquartile range) of 4 ( 3-5) relapses in each group , and mean ( SD) cumulative prednisolone dose of 246 ( 48) mg/kg and 239 ( 52) mg/kg in the prestudy year in the tacrolimus and rituximab groups , respectively. Rituximab therapy was associated with a higher 12-month relapse-free survival rate than tacrolimus ( 54 ( 90.0 %) vs 38 ( 63.3 %) children; P < .001; odds ratio , 5.21; 95 % CI , 1.93-14.07). Among the patients who experienced relapse , median time to first relapse was 40 weeks in the rituximab group and 29 weeks in the tacrolimus group. Only 2 patients in the rituximab group had more than 1 relapse during the study period compared with 10 patients in the tacrolimus group. The cumulative corticosteroid dose during the 12-month study period was lower with rituximab compared with tacrolimus ( mean ( SD) , 25.8 ( 27.8) vs 86.3 ( 58.0) mg/kg). Although both treatments were well tolerated , mild to moderate infections were twice as common in the tacrolimus group ( 26 ( 43.3 %) vs 13 ( 21.7 %) events). In children with CDNS , rituximab appears to be more effective than tacrolimus in maintaining disease remission and minimizing corticosteroid exposure and , given its good tolerability and lack of nephrotoxic effects , may be considered as first-line corticosteroid-sparing therapy.
