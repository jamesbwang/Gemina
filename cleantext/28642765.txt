  Plants are continually facing biotic and abiotic stresses , and hence , they need to respond and adapt to survive. Plant response during multiple and combined biotic and abiotic stresses is highly complex and varied than the individual stress. These stresses resulted alteration of plant behavior through regulating the levels of microRNA , heat shock<symptom> proteins , epigenetic variations. These variations can cause many adverse effects on the growth and development of the plant. Further , in natural conditions , several abiotic stresses causing factors make the plant more susceptible to pathogens infections and vice-versa. A very intricate and multifaceted interactions of various biomolecules are involved in metabolic pathways that can direct towards a cross-tolerance and improvement of plant 's defence system. Systems biology approach plays a significant role in the investigation of these molecular interactions. The valuable information obtained by systems biology will help to develop stress-resistant plant varieties against multiple stresses. Thus , this review aims to decipher various multilevel interactions at the molecular level under combinatorial biotic and abiotic stresses and the role of systems biology to understand these molecular interactions.
