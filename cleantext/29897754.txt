  A functional metagenomic approach identified novel and diverse soil-derived DNAs encoding inhibitors to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). A metagenomic DNA soil library containing 19200 recombinant Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BAC clones with 100 Kb average insert size was screened for antibiotic activity. Twenty-seven clones inhibited MRSA , seven of which were found by LC-MS to possess modified chloramphenicol ( Cm) derivatives , including three new compounds whose structures were established as 1-acetyl-3-propanoylchloramphenicol , 1-acetyl-3-butanoylchloramphenicol , and 3-butanoyl-1-propanoylchloramphenicol. Cm was used as the selectable antibiotic for cloning , suggesting that heterologously expressed enzymes resulted in derivatization of Cm into new chemical entities with biological activity. An esterase was found to be responsible for the enzymatic regeneration of Cm , and the gene trfA responsible for plasmid copy induction was found to be responsible for inducing antibacterial activity in some clones. Six additional acylchloramphenicols were synthesized for structure and antibacterial activity relationship studies , with 1- p-nitrobenzoylchloramphenicol the most active against Mycobacterium<pathogen> intracellulare<pathogen> and Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> , with MICs of 12.5 and 50.0 Î¼g/mL , respectively.
