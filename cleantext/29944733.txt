  Iridoid synthases belong to the family of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase involved in the biosynthesis of iridoids. Despite having high sequence and structural homology with progesterone 5Î²-reductase , these enzymes exhibit differential substrate specificities. Previously , two loops , L1 and L2 at substrate-binding pocket , were suggested to be involved in generating substrate specificity. However , the structural basis of specificity determinants was elusive. Here , combining sequence and structural analysis , site-directed mutagenesis , and molecular dynamics simulations , we have shown that iridoid synthase contains two channels for substrate entry whose geometries are altered by L1-L2 dynamics , primarily orchestrated by interactions of residues Glu161 and Gly162 of L1 and Asn358 of L2. A complex interplay of these interactions confer the substrate specificity to the enzyme.
