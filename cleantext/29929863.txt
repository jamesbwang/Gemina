  To investigate the rates of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP) uptake and adherence amongst Singaporean patients diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA) , and to evaluate factors correlated with CPAP uptake and adherence. Retrospective review of medical records. Medical records were reviewed for baseline demographics , daytime sleepiness , presence of nasal symptoms and OSA severity , initial treatment choice , the rate of CPAP treatment uptake and CPAP adherence at 1 and 12 months. 2160 patients were diagnosed with OSA within the 5-year period ( 2011-2015). 463 ( 21.4 %) had mild OSA , 583 ( 27.0 %) had moderate OSA and 1114 ( 51.6 %) had severe OSA. For initial therapy , 751 ( 34.8 %) patients opted for a 1-month CPAP trial , 288 ( 13.3 %) patients chose surgery upfront , 291 ( 13.5 %) patients chose adjunctive treatments ( weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , positional therapy , dental appliance , intranasal steroid spray for allergic rhinitis) and 830 ( 38.4 %) patients rejected all forms of treatment. 337 out of 751 patients ( 44.9 %) were adherent to CPAP therapy during the 1 month trial. 381 out of 751 ( 50.7 %) patients took up CPAP therapy following the trial period , of which 299 out of 381 ( 78.5 %) patients were adherent to CPAP therapy at 1 year. CPAP adherence during the 1-month trial was a predictor for eventual CPAP treatment uptake and CPAP adherence at 1 year ( p < 0.001). Age ( p < 0.001) , BMI ( p < 0.001) and normal ESS ( p = 0.01) were predictors of treatment rejection. 24 patients underwent upper airway surgery during their first year of using CPAP. 21 out of the 24 patients ( 87.5 %) were adherent to CPAP at 1 year after undergoing surgery. These patients had a higher rate of CPAP adherence compared to the overall cohort ( 87.5 % versus 78.5 %) , but this was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05). Singaporean patients who accept CPAP therapy after an initial 1-month CPAP trial will generally be adherent to CPAP therapy. Initial patterns of CPAP usage are predictive of long term CPAP adherence. However , there is a high rate of CPAP treatment rejection both at the time of diagnosis and after the CPAP trial. Upper<symptom> airway surgery in selected patients may improve CPAP adherence.
