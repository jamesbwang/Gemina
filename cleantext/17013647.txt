  The Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx) is a strictly protected species of large carnivore in Poland. It inhabits forest<disease> complexes in north-eastern Poland and the Carpathian region in southern Poland. The status of the lynx within Poland requires special attention because its range decreased between 1980 and 2001 and has not yet recovered. One of the factors negatively affecting lynx populations is diseases , particularly parasites. The helminth fauna of the Eurasian lynx is not fully known in Poland. Previous coprological studies revealed that Polish lynx have been infected with seven species of nematodes , three species of cestodes , and one species of trematode. In this study , we present new data based on examination of opportunistically collected lynx carcasses. The aim of the study was to complement data on the helminth fauna of Eurasian lynx inhabiting Poland based on morphological and molecular analysis of parasites. Four species of cestodes-Taenia lynciscapreoli , Mesocestoides lineatus , Spirometra sp. , and Taenia krabbei-were found for the first time in Eurasian lynx from Poland and three previously reported species of nematodes-Ancylostoma tubaeforme , Toxascaris leonina , and Toxocara cati-were confirmed. Larvae of Trichinella britovi were also detected in Eurasian lynx in Poland for the first time.
