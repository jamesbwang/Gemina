  To evaluate clinical outcomes and possible MR imaging predictors of clinical success after prostatic artery embolization ( PAE) with 250-μm hydrogel particles. During a span of 1.5 years , 30 patients with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms were included in a prospective , nonrandomized study. Embolization of at least one prostatic artery was considered as technical success. International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS) , quality of life ( QOL) , peak urinary flow rate ( Q PAE was technically successful in 90 % of patients ( n = 27). Clinical success ( IPSS < 18 with decrease > 25 % and QOL score < 4 with decrease ≥ 1 or Q PAE with 250-μm hydrogel microspheres led to good clinical success after 6 months with a low complication rate. Significant MR imaging predictors of clinical success were not identified.
