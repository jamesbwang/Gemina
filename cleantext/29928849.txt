  Cessation versus continuation of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing dental implant surgery is a controversial issue. The present study evaluated postoperative bleeding during and after dental implant surgery in patients taking aspirin ( ASA) or clopidogrel. The present study is a case-and-crossover study. Patients who were using antiplatelet drugs and receiving 2 bilateral dental implants in the posterior region of the mandible were studied. During session 1 , dental implants were placed without stopping the intake of antiplatelet drugs. During session 2 , antiplatelet drugs were stopped for 5 days. In group 1 , platelet activity was measured by an assay based on flow cytometry and represented the platelet reactivity index. In group 2 , platelet function analysis was used to monitor the antiplatelet effect of ASA. Bleeding severity was assessed using a visual analog scale for 72 hours after dental implant placement during sessions 1 and 2. Use of antiplatelet drugs was the predictive factor of the study and bleeding severity and platelet function were the outcomes of the study. Twenty-two patients composed group 1 ( clopidogrel 75 mg) and 20 composed group 2 ( ASA 80 mg). In group 1 , bleeding severity was 4.86 ± 0.77 during session 1 and 4.59 ± 0.66 during session 2. Data analysis showed no difference in bleeding severity between sessions 1 and 2 in group 1 ( P = .72). In group 2 , bleeding severity was 4.05 ± 0.94 during session 1 and 3.9 ± 0.85 during session 2. There was no difference in bleeding severity between sessions 1 and 2 in patients taking ASA ( P = .19). The results suggest that continuing the intake of antiplatelet drugs did not increase bleeding after placement of dental implants.
