  Different subtypes of macrophages have been shown to participate in different stages of inflammation<symptom> and tissue repair. In the late stage of tissue repair , the macrophages , following their engulfment of apoptotic neutrophils , acquire a new phenotype termed alternatively activated macrophages. These macrophages produce growth factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , that facilitate the angiogenic response as part of tissue restoration. Then , in the later stages of tissue healing , capillary regression takes place. It is presently unknown whether macrophages play an antiangiogenic role in the final stages of tissue repair. Here , we examined whether soluble mediators secreted by pro-resolving CD11b
