  Heliothis viriplaca ( Hüfnagel) ( Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is worldwide an important economic pest of major agricultural crops. The effect of temperature on the biology , in particular the duration of the different developmental stages , of this insect pest was examined. The development , survival , and fecundity of H. viriplaca at five different temperatures ( 22 , 25 , 28 , 31 , and 34 °C) were investigated , and experimental population life tables calculated. The results show that the developmental time of larvae , pupae , pre-oviposition , adults , and the entire generation decreases with increasing temperature. Larvae emerged fastest from the eggs at 28 °C. The percentage of larvae that reached the seventh instar stage was 32.69 , 38.60 , 19.67 , 3.61 , and 20.88 % at 22 , 25 , 28 , 31 , and 34 °C , respectively. The developmental threshold temperature of the eggs , larvae , pupae , pre-oviposition and total pre-oviposition period was 10.53 , 12.34 , 5.60 , 11.47 , and 10.01 °C , respectively. The effective accumulative temperature was 42.90 , 239.68 , 309.19 , 77.72 , and 767.64 degree-days , respectively. The population trend index ( I) and the intrinsic rate of increase ( r) of H. viriplaca were the highest at 31 °C ( 133.97 and 0.12 d-1 , respectively). The results of this study may be useful for predicting the population dynamics of H. viriplaca and thus provides information on this important insect pest that may assist in its management.
