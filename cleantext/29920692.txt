  Eosinophils are traditionally associated with the immune response against helminth parasites. However , several studies have demonstrated that these cells have a role regarding protective immunity in leishmaniasis<disease> Here , we examined the relationship between the presence of eosinophils and parasite load in biopsy samples from dogs , obtained through fine needle puncture and aspiration of lymph nodes. Histological slides containing biopsy material from lymph nodes of dogs with canine visceral leishmaniasis<disease> and healthy dogs were used to obtain baseline eosinophil counts. Subsequently , scrapings were taken from slides for DNA extraction and determination of parasite load , using real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). Additionally , production of nitric oxide ( NO) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) levels by eosinophils in the peripheral blood of dogs with canine visceral leishmaniasis<disease> and healthy dogs was measured. The eosinophil percentage were higher in lymph nodes of infected group , and the parasite load showed a significant negative correlation with the eosinophil count. The production of NO and ROS by eosinophils in the peripheral blood was higher in the dogs with canine visceral leishmaniasis<disease> All the results together suggest that eosinophils may participate in antileishmanial immunity in canine visceral
