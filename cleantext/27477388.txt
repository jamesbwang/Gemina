  Sepsis<disease> is a common and often deadly systemic response to an infection , usually caused by bacteria. The gold standard for finding the causing pathogen in a blood sample is blood culture , which may take hours to days. Shortening the time to diagnosis would significantly reduce mortality. To replace the time-consuming blood culture we are developing a method to directly separate bacteria from red and white blood cells to enable faster bacteria identification. The blood cells are moved from the sample flow into a parallel stream using acoustophoresis. Due to their smaller size , the bacteria are not affected by the acoustic field and therefore remain in the blood plasma flow and can be directed to a separate outlet. When optimizing for sample throughput , 1 ml of undiluted whole blood equivalent can be processed within 12.5 min , while maintaining the bacteria recovery at 90 % and the blood cell removal above 99 %. That makes this the fastest label-free microfluidic continuous flow method per channel to separate bacteria from blood with high bacteria recovery ( > 80 %). The high throughput was achieved by matching the acoustic impedance of the parallel stream to that of the blood sample , to avoid that acoustic forces relocate the fluid streams.
