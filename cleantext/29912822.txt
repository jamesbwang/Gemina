  Stapes surgery is performed for hearing restoration in patients with otosclerosis. Results from stapes surgery are good , although a small proportion will have a persistent conductive hearing loss and will consider revision surgery. The timing of such surgery depends on expected changes to hearing thresholds during the postoperative period. We performed a retrospective case series analysis of a database of outcomes from stapes surgery performed between July 26 , 2013 and March 11 , 2016 at one center. Hearing outcomes over the year subsequent to surgery were recorded. There was a significant improvement in hearing outcomes between the postoperative visit at 6 weeks ( mean air-bone gap 6.0 dB) and the hearing outcome at 6 months ( mean air-bone gap 3.3 dB) ( p < 0.01). This improvement was maintained at 12 months ( mean air-bone gap 3.1 dB) , although there were individual patients whose hearing outcome improved or deteriorated during this period. Improvements in air conduction thresholds mirrored improvements in air-bone gap measurements. Patients with an initial suboptimal or poor result after stapes surgery may observed improvement in their hearing thresholds in the year after surgery. These patients may have large preoperative air-bone gaps , and have a trend to have obliterated footplates. Revision surgery should not be considered until at least 6 months after primary surgery.
