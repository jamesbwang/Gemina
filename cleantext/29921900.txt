  Oncocytic adrenocortical tumors are a rare subtype of adrenal tumors with challenging diagnosis and histoprognostic assessment. It is usually believed that oncocytic adrenocortical tumors have a more indolent clinical behavior than conventional adrenocortical tumors. As the Weiss score overestimates the malignancy of oncocytic adrenocortical tumors owing to intrinsic parameters , alternative scores have been proposed. The Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia score is currently recommended. We performed a large nationwide multicenter retrospective clinicopathologic study of oncocytic adrenocortical tumors. Among the 43 patients in our cohort , 40 patients were alive without disease , 2 patients died of their disease and 1 patient was alive with relapse after a median follow-up of 38 months ( 20-59). Our data revealed that over 50 % of the oncocytic adrenocortical tumor cases were diagnosed as carcinoma whatever the classification systems used , including the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia score. The exception is the Helsinki score , which incorporates the Ki-67 proliferation index and was the most specific prognostic score for oncocytic adrenocortical tumor malignancy without showing a loss in sensitivity. A comparison of malignant oncocytic adrenocortical tumors with conventional adrenocortical carcinomas matched for age , sex , ENS @T stage and surgical resection status showed significant better overall survival of malignant oncocytic adrenocortical tumors.
