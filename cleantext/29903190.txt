  To establish a method for detecting 21 semi-volatile organic compounds in the source of drinking water by gas chromatography triple quadruples mass spectrometry ( GC-MS/MS). To process multiple samples at the same time , using large volume solid-phase extraction device for continuous injection. The water samples were extracted by C _ ( 18) solid phase column , eluted with methylene chloride and ethylacetate , and then separated by DB-5MS capillary column. The target substance in the extractions was selected by gas chromatography triple quadruples spectrometry in selectedreaction monitoring ( SRM) mode. Retention time and selected ions were used for qualitative analysis , acenaphthene-d _ ( 10) , phenanthrene-d _ ( 10) and chrysene-d _ ( 12) were used as internal standard for qualitative analysis of 21 semi-volatile organic compounds. The method was good sensitivity , stability and high selectivity , which could improve the sensitivity of target compounds by secondary mass spectrum scanning through reducing the background interference. The separate rates of 21 kinds of compounds were well , and the correlation coefficients were more than 0. 9902. The minimum detection concentration was 5. 0 Ã— 10 ~ ( -5) mg/L , the average recovery rates were 72. 6 % -127. 3 % and the relativestandard deviation were 1. 05 % -9. 89 %. This method is simple , rapid with high accuracy and reliable , so it is suitable for detecting semi-volatile organic compounds in water.
