  American Foulbrood is a worldwide distributed , fatal disease of the brood of the Western honey bee ( Apis mellifera). The causative agent of this fatal brood disease is the Gram-positive , spore-forming bacterium<pathogen> Paenibacillus<pathogen> larvae , which can be classified into four different genotypes ( ERIC I-IV) , with ERIC I and II being the ones isolated from contemporary AFB outbreaks. P. larvae is a peritrichously flagellated bacterium<pathogen> and , hence , we hypothesized that P. larvae is capable of coordinated and cooperative multicellular behaviors like swarming motility and biofilm formation. In order to analyze these behaviors of P. larvae , we firstly established appropriate functional assays. Using these assays we demonstrated that P. larvae ERIC II , but not P. larvae ERIC I , was capable of swarming. Swarming motility was hampered in a P. larvae ERIC II-mutant lacking production of paenilarvin , an iturin-like lipopeptide exclusively expressed by this genotype. Both genotypes were able to form free floating biofilm aggregates loosely attached to the walls of the culture wells. Visualizing the biofilms by Congo red and thioflavin S staining suggested structural differences between the biofilms formed. Biofilm formation was shown to be independent from paenilarvin production because the paenilarvin deficient mutant was comparably able to form a biofilm.
