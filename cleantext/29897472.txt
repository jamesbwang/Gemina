  Seeds exist in the vulnerable state of being unable to repair the chemical degradation all organisms suffer , which slowly ages seeds and eventually results in death. Proposed seed aging mechanisms involve all classes of biological molecules , and degradation of total RNA has been detected contemporaneously with viability loss in dry-stored seeds. To identify changes specific to mRNA , we examined the soybean ( Glycine max) seed transcriptome , using new , whole-molecule sequencing technology. We detected strong evidence of transcript fragmentation in 23-year-old , compared to 2-year-old , seeds. Transcripts were broken non-specifically , and greater fragmentation occurred in longer transcripts , consistent with the proposed mechanism of molecular fission by free radical attack at random bases. Seeds died despite high integrity of short transcripts , indicating that functions encoded by short transcripts are not sufficient to maintain viability. This study provides an approach to probe the asymptomatic phase of seed aging , namely , by quantifying transcript degradation as a function of storage time.
