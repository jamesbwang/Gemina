  To investigate the clinical effectiveness of intravenous ( IV) and topical tranexamic acid ( TXA) in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) by comparing safety , efficacy and patient-reported outcomes. In this prospective single-blind clinical trial , 64 patients were randomized into two groups ( n = 32 each). The Intravenous Group was administered TXA 10 mg/kg IV ( Reyong , Shandong , China) 10 min prior to tourniquet deflation. In the Topical Group , 1.0 g TXA diluted in 50 ml of normal saline was injected into the surgical site , which was bathed in the solution for at least 5 min prior to tourniquet deflation. Outcomes included changes in hemoglobin levels , intra-operative , post-operative , and total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , number of transfusions and number of transfused units , patient-reported postoperative Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) score for knee pain , and complications. There were no significant differences in intra-operative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , post-operative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , or post-operative decrease in hemoglobin in the Intravenous Group versus the Topical Group. The number of transfused red blood cell units was significantly greater and-post-operative VAS score was significantly lower in the Intravenous Group. There were no differences in post-operative thromboembolic complications between groups. Topical TXA is not inferior to IV administration in reducing perioperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in primary TKA. However , the influence of injection volume of locally applied TXA on post-operative knee pain warrants further investigation.
