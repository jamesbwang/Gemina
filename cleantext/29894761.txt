  Laboratory rats are frequently used as animal models in research. Since the 1920s rats are bred and reared in laboratories which affects anatomy , physiology , and behavior responses. In the present study we exposed laboratory and wild rats to predator odor and comparatively analyzed their behavioral and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom>. In detail , Warsaw Wild Captive Pisula Stryjek ( WWCPS) rats and Lister Hooded ( LH) rats were exposed to the predator odor 2,3,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline ( TMT) , their behavior was videotaped and blood samples were collected for subsequent serum corticosterone analysis. In both rat stocks , exposure to TMT induced avoidance behavior and increased freezing behavior. Notably , the increase in freezing was based on an increase number of freezing events in LH rats whereas WWCPS rats prolonged the mean duration of the single freezing events. Interestingly , TMT exposure lead to a serum corticosterone increase in WWCPS rats but not in LH rats. Furthermore , WWCPS rats generally expressed decreased but faster locomotor activity , as well as more grooming behavior than LH rats. Taken together , these data indicate differences in behavioral and physiological defensive responses to predator odors in the two rat stocks.
