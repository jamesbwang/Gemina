  Direction-dependent interaction rules are incorporated into a one-dimensional discrete-time stochastic individual-based model ( IBM) of collective behavior to compare pattern formation with an existing partial differential equation ( PDE) model. The IBM is formulated in terms of three social interaction forces: repulsion , alignment , and attraction , and includes information regarding conspecifics ' direction of travel. The IBM produces a variety of spatial patterns which qualitatively match patterns observed in a PDE model. The addition of direction-dependent interaction rules exemplifies how directional information transfer within a group of individuals can result in enriched pattern formation. Our individual-based modelling framework reveals the influence that direction-dependent interaction rules such as biological communication can have upon individual movement trajectories and how these trajectories combine to form group patterns.
