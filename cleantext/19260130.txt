  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) is usually diagnosed accompanied by lymph node metastasis. C-C chemokine receptor type 7 ( CCR7) is associated with the invasion and metastasis of tumors in HNSCC through various signaling pathways. The role of hsa-miR-125a-5p in HNSCC remains unclear. The present study was performed to investigate the association between hsa-miR-125a-5p and CCR7 in HNSCC. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied to analyze the expression of hsa-miR-125a-5p in clinical samples. Cell Counting Kit-8 , Transwell and wound<disease> healing assays were used to detect cell proliferation , invasion , and metastasis , respectively , following overexpression of hsa-miR-125a-5p. Changes in protein expression of CCR7 were observed using western blotting. In the survival analysis , Student 's t-tests and log rank tests were performed to analyze the association between the expression of hsa-miR-125a-5p , and HNSCC according to the Cancer Genome Atlas database. The expression of hsa-miR-125a-5p was identified to be significantly lower in cancer tissue compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissues in clinical samples ( P = 0.038). The results of western blotting indicated that there was a positive regulatory association between hsa-miR-125a-5p and CCR7. Furthermore , overexpression of hsa-miR-125a-5p significantly enhanced the ability of cell proliferation , migration and invasion in HNSCC , with upregulation of CCR7. The results of survival analysis revealed that patients in the low expression group of hsa-miR-125a-5p tended to have longer survival times compared with the high expression group ( P = 0.045). Altogether , the data raised the possibility that hsa-miR-125a-5p has a significant role in promoting cancer in HNSCC , which may provide a basis for the treatment of HNSCC in molecular targeted therapy. Further studies are required to ascertain the role of hsa-miR-125a-5p in other HNSCC cell lines and
