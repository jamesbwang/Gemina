  Hydrochlorothiazide use has been associated with markedly increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. No previous studies have investigated the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC) and malignant adnexal skin tumors ( MAST). To examine the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk of MCC and MAST. Using Danish nationwide health registries , we identified all patients with incident MCC or MAST during 2004-2015 and matched cases individually to cancer-free population controls by risk set sampling. Using conditional logistic regression , we estimated odds ratios ( ORs) associated with cumulative use of hydrochlorothiazide. The adjusted ORs for MCC and MAST associated with high use ( ≥ 50,000 mg) of hydrochlorothiazide was 2.3 ( 95 % CI , 1.1-4.8) and 3.6 ( 95 % CI , 1.9-7.0) , respectively , increasing to 3.3 ( 95 % CI 1.3-8.3) and 5.6 ( 95 % CI 2.4-13.3) with highest use ( ≥ 100,000 mg). We found no increase in risk of the tumors in analyses of drugs with similar indications as hydrochlorothiazide , except a tendency toward an increased risk of MCC associated with use of furosemide ( OR 1.9 , 95 % CI 0.9-4.0). No data on sun exposure was available. Hydrochlorothiazide use is associated with an increased risk of MCC and MAST.
