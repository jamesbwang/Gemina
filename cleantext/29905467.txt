  In nature , a multitude of mechanisms have emerged for regulating biological processes and , specifically , protein activity. Light as a natural regulatory element is of outstanding interest for studying and modulating protein activity because it can be precisely applied with regard to a site of action , instant of time , or intensity. Naturally occurring photoresponsive proteins , predominantly those containing a light-oxygen-voltage ( LOV) domain , have been characterized structurally and mechanistically and also conjugated to various proteins of interest. Immediate advantages of these new photoresponsive proteins such as genetic encoding , no requirement of chemical modification , and reversibility are paid for by difficulties in predicting the envisaged activity or type and site of domain fusion. In this article , we summarize recent advances and give a survey on currently available design concepts for engineering photoswitchable proteins.
