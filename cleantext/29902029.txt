  A crucial question within science and academia , and cognitive science specifically , is whether there is gender disparity in opportunity and advancement over the professional life span ( e.g. , Ceci , Ginther , Kahn , & Williams , 2014; Geraci , Balsis , & Busch , 2015; Valian , 1998). To investigate this question , we analyzed gender distributions in publicly available federal funding data from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council ( NSERC) of Canada that are specific to cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. There were three key results. First , the proportion of women cognitive scientists progressively diminished at each career stage , particularly at the transition between graduate and postdoctoral studies. Second , female principal investigators ( PI) received smaller average Discovery Grant amounts and were less likely to receive Discovery Accelerator Supplements as a proportion of all Discovery Grants funded. Finally , at the PI level , gender differences were relatively smaller for institution-initiated grants ( i.e. , Canada Research Chairs) versus investigator-initiated grants ( i.e. , Discovery Grants). It is our hope that presentation of such data , in concert with other recent reports for our field ( e.g. , Klatzky , Holt , & Behrmann , 2015; Peelle , 2016; Vaid & Geraci , 2016) , continues to raise awareness that gender parity issues remain a concern that deserves ongoing attention within the field of cognitive science in Canada.
