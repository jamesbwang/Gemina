  Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID) that has been used orally and intramuscularly in numerous avian species , but not studied to date , in African penguins ( Spheniscus demersus). The study describes the pharmacokinetic parameters of meloxicam after oral and intramuscular administration to African penguins. Several pilot studies were conducted initially where meloxicam ( 1 , 0.5 , and 0.25 mg/kg) was given intramuscularly to 4 birds , and orally ( 1 mg/kg) to 2 birds. Based on pilot study results , one group of 8 penguins was given meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly and one group of 8 penguins was given 1 mg/kg orally. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 11 time intervals per group after administration of meloxicam. Meloxicam time to maximum plasma concentration ( T
