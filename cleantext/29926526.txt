  Qualitative longitudinal research ( QLR) provides temporal understanding of the human response to health , illness , and the life course. However , little guidance is available for conducting QLR in the nursing literature. The purpose of this review is to describe the methodological status of QLR in nursing. With the assistance of a medical librarian , we conducted a thorough search circumscribed to qualitative , longitudinal nursing studies of patients ' and care-givers ' experiences published between 2006 and 2016. The methodological quality of the 74 reviewed studies varied tremendously; many reports lacked sufficient detail in reporting on sampling and attrition , retention strategies , and data collection and analysis , making it difficult for readers to evaluate the credibility and transferability of study findings. Based on the strengths and limitations of the studies reviewed and findings in the literature , we provide recommendations for enhancing the reporting of the research process as a supplement to the standards for qualitative research more broadly. These recommendations are offered in the spirit of encouraging dialogue among colleagues and assisting journal reviewers and editors in their evaluation of QLR.
