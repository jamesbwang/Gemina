  In a diabetic , uremic kidney transplant recipient that may receive a future pancreas after kidney ( PAK) transplant , the kidney is typically implanted on the left side in anticipation of the subsequent pancreas transplant on the right side. In this study , we sought to determine if ipsilateral PAK ( iPAK) is as safe as contralateral PAK ( cPAK). The 115 PAK transplants ( iPAK n = 57 , cPAK n = 58) were performed from 1997-2010 and results were compared between the groups. Kidney graft survival and pancreas graft survival was similar between the two groups. Kidney graft function according to serum creatinine and eGFR was not different between the cPAK and the iPAK groups and there were no episodes of kidney graft thrombosis in either group. Subgroup analyses focusing on donor source also did not show worse outcomes for graft survivals in iPAK group when compared to cPAK group. Pancreas and kidney graft survival in PAK transplants is unaffected by the surgical procedure and iPAK is safe.
