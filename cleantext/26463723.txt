  Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> is a fungal pathogen that causes serious biofilm-based infections. Here we have asked whether surface topography may affect C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilm formation. We tested biofilm growth of the prototypical wild-type strain SC5314 on a series of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) solids. The surfaces were prepared with monolayer coatings of monodisperse spherical silica particles that were fused together into a film using silica menisci. The surface topography was varied by varying the diameter of the silica particles that were used to form the film. Biofilm formation was observed to be a strong function of particle size. In the particle size range 4.0-8.0 μm , there was much more biofilm than in the size range 0.5-2.0 μm. The behavior of a clinical isolate from a clade separate from SC5314 , strain p76067 , showed results similar to that of SC5314. Our results suggest that topographic coatings may be a promising approach to reduce C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilm infections.
