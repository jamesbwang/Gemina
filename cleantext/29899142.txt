  Proper organization and orderly mitosis of radial glial progenitors ( RGPs) drive the formation of a laminated mammalian cortex in the correct size. However , the molecular underpinnings of the intricate process remain largely unclear. Here we show that RGP behavior and cortical development are controlled by temporally distinct actions of partitioning-defective 3 ( PARD3) in concert with dynamic HIPPO signaling. RGPs lacking PARD3 exhibit developmental stage-dependent abnormal switches in division mode , resulting in an initial overproduction of RGPs located largely outside the ventricular zone at the expense of deep-layer neurons. Ectopically localized RGPs subsequently undergo accelerated and excessive neurogenesis , leading to the formation of an enlarged cortex with massive heterotopia and increased seizure<symptom> susceptibility. Simultaneous removal of HIPPO pathway effectors Yes-associated protein ( YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ) suppresses cortical enlargement and heterotopia formation. These results define a dynamic regulatory program of mammalian cortical development and highlight a progenitor origin of megalencephaly with ribbon heterotopia and epilepsy.
