  WNK ( With No Lysine ( K)) kinases regulate renal epithelial ion transport to maintain homeostasis of electrolyte concentrations , extracellular volume and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. The SLC12 cation-chloride cotransporters , including the sodium-potassium-2-chloride ( NKCC) and sodium-chloride ( NCC) cotransporters , are targets of WNK regulation via the intermediary kinases SPAK ( Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 ( oxidative stress response). The pathway is activated by low dietary potassium intake , resulting in increased phosphorylation and activity of NCC. Chloride regulates WNK kinases in vitro by binding to the active site and inhibiting autophosphorylation , and has been proposed to modulate WNK activity in the distal convoluted tubule in response to low dietary potassium. WNK-SPAK/OSR1 regulation of NKCC-dependent ion transport is evolutionarily ancient , and occurs in the Drosophila Malpighian ( renal) tubule. Here , we review recent studies from the Drosophila tubule demonstrating cooperative roles for chloride and the scaffold protein Mo25 ( Mouse protein 25 , also known as calcium-binding protein 39) in the regulation of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling in a transporting renal epithelium. Insights gained from this genetically manipulable and physiologically accessible epithelium shed light on molecular mechanisms of regulation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway , which is important in human health and disease.
