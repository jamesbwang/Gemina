  Pulsed eddy current ( PEC) technology is another important non-contact nondestructive testing technology for defect detection. However , the temperature drift of the exciting coil has a considerable influence on the precision of PEC testing. The objective of this study is to investigate the temperature drift effect and reduce its impact. The temperature drift effect is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The temperature drift effect on the peak-to-peak values of the output signal is investigated , and a temperature compensation method is proposed to reduce the effect of temperature variation. The results show that temperature drift has a negative impact on PEC testing and the temperature compensation method can effectively reduce the effect of temperature drift.
