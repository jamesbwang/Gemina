  We determined the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of SRM-IV vestibular function diagnosis and treatment system on benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> ( BPPV). Overall , 120 patients with BPPV diagnosed in the outpatient and in-patient departments of the Vertigo<symptom> Treatment Center of the First People 's Hospital of Xuzhou from January 2013 to December 2015 were selected for this study. They were randomly divided into three groups. Automatic repositioning procedure was conducted for 40 patients in the equipment repositioning group by SRM-IV vestibular function diagnosis and treatment system , conventional manual repositioning procedure was used for 40 patients in the manual repositioning group , and combination of treatment drugs ( alprostadil and safflower injection) with acclimatization training was adopted in 40 patients in the drug therapy group. After 1 week of treatment , the cure rate and total effective rate in the equipment repositioning group and the manual repositioning group were significantly higher than those in drug therapy group ( The SRM-IV vestibular function diagnosis and treatment system are helpful in achieving effective and standard diagnosis and treatment of BPPV.
