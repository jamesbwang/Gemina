  Since the 1950 's , hydrocephalus<symptom> can be treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts , usually to the peritoneal cavity or to the right cardiac atrium. However , due to their siphoning effect , these shunts lead to non-physiological cerebrospinal fluid drainage , with possible co-morbidity and high revision rates. More sophisticated shunt valve systems significantly increase costs and technical complexity and remain unsuccessful in a subgroup of patients. In an attempt to obtain physiological cerebrospinal fluid shunting , many neurosurgical pioneers shunted towards the dural sinuses , taking advantage of the physiological anti-siphoning effect of the internal jugular veins. Despite several promising reports , the ventriculosinus shunts did not yet become standard neurosurgical practice. In this mono-centric prospective clinical study , we implanted the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt , as advocated by El-Shafei , in 10 patients. This article reports on our operation technique and long-term outcome , including 4 patients in whom this shunt was implanted as a rescue. Implantation of a ventriculosinus shunt proved to be a feasible technique , warranting physiological drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. However , only in 3 out of 14 patients , functionality of the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt was maintained during more than 6 years follow-up. In our opinion , these shunts fail because present venous access devices are difficult to implant correctly and get too easily obstructed. After discussing possible causes of this frequent obstruction , a new dural venous sinus access device is presented. An easy to implant and thrombogenic-resistant dural venous sinus access device needs to be developed before ventriculosinus shunting can become general practice.
