  The aim of this study was to compare the bone resorption rate , histomorphometry and immunohistochemical findings of bioactive glass ( Biogran; Biomet , Warsaw , IN , USA) mixed with autogenous bone grafts ( 1:1) and autogenous bone graft isolate in maxillary sinus elevation surgery. A total of 9 maxillary sinuses were grafted with Biogran with autogenous bone graft ( group 1) and 12 were mixed with autogenous bone graft ( group 2). Postoperative cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) was used to measure the initial graft volume after 15 days ( T1) , and 6 months later , another CBCT scan was performed to evaluate the final graft volume ( T2) and determine the graft resorption rate. The resorption outcomes were 37.9 % ± 18.9 % in group 1 and 45.7 % ± 18.5 % in group 2 ( P = 0.82). After 6 months , biopsies were obtained concurrent with the placement of dental implants; these implants were subjected to histomorphometric analysis and immunohistochemical analysis for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP). The average bone formation in group 1 was 36.6 % ± 12.9 in the pristine bone region , 33.2 % ± 13.3 in the intermediate region , and 45.8 % ± 13.8 in the apical region; in group 2 , the values were 34.4 % ± 14.4 , 35.0 % ± 13.9 , and 42.0 % ± 16.6 of new bone formation in the pristine bone , intermediate , and apical regions , respectively. Immunostaining for TRAP showed poor clastic activity in both groups , which can indicate that those were in the remodeling phase. The similarity between the groups in the formation and maintenance of the graft volume after 6 months suggests that the bioactive glass mixed with autogenous bone ( 1:1) can be used safely as a bone substitute for the maxillary sinus lift.
