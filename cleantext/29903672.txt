  Tranexamic acid ( TXA) has been shown to decrease mortality in adult trauma patients with or at significant risk of hemorrhage<symptom> when administered within 3 h of injury. The use and appropriateness of TXA in adult trauma patients presenting to Royal Columbian Hospital ( RCH) was investigated. This retrospective chart review utilized the British Columbia Trauma Registry to identify 100 consecutive trauma patients that presented to the emergency department at RCH between April 2012 to June 2015 and met the following indications for TXA: systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> < 90 mm Hg and/or heart rate > 110 bpm and presentation within 8 h of injury. Primary outcomes included: percentage that met indications for TXA , received TXA according to the CRASH-2 protocol , received a pre-hospital dose , and received TXA ≤ 1 , > 1 to ≤ 3 , or > 3 h from injury. During the given time period , 117 subjects ( 2.7 %) met indications for TXA. 67 patients ( 57 %) received TXA in any dose , with 10 subjects ( 8.5 %) receiving TXA according to the CRASH-2 protocol. Of the 67 patients who received any TXA , 76 % did so ≤ 3 h. 22 patients ( 19 %) received TXA as a pre-hospital dose. < 10 % of adult trauma patients that met the indication for TXA received it according to the CRASH-2 protocol. Of those patients that received TXA , 76 % did so within 3 h. Further inquiry to identify reasons trauma patients are not receiving TXA as well as quality improvement initiatives in trauma care are required. III STUDY TYPE: Therapeutic.
