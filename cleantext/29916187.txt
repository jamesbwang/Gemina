  Parents compare their children to one another; those comparisons may have implications for the way mothers and fathers treat their children , as well as their children 's behavior. Data were collected annually for three years with parents , firstborns , and secondborns from 385 families ( Time 1 age: firstborns , 15.71 , SD = 1.07 , 52 % female; secondborns , 13.18 , SD = 1.29 , 50 % female). Parents ' beliefs that one child was better behaved predicted differences in siblings ' reports of parent-child conflict. Additionally , for siblings close in age , mothers ' comparisons at Time 1 predicted youth 's problem behavior at Time 3 through siblings ' differential conflict with mothers. The results support and extend tenets from Social Comparison and Expectancy Value theories in regards to social comparison within families.
