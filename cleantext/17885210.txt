  In 2014 , the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Quality of Care Committee was asked to develop performance measures ( PMs) to assess program quality and aid in program improvement and certification. A 3-step process was used to prioritize , develop , and then validate new PMs for both cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. First , we surveyed national leadership , medical directors , and program directors to identify and rank various American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation potential PM topics. Then , the face validity of the drafted PMs was assessed in a second national survey. Finally , we assessed the inter- and intrarater reliability and feasibility of each PM by abstracting patient charts at programs throughout the United States. At each step , modifications were made to refine and improve the measures for clarity , reliability , and consistency. Through survey answers received from 302 people ( 19 % response rate) , we identified 5 categories for PM development: optimal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control , tobacco use cessation , and improvement in functional capacity , depression<symptom> , and sensation of dyspnea<symptom>. After drafting the PMs , a second survey with 82 respondents ( 57 % response rate) , found that the proposed PMs had good face validity. Finally , we found excellent inter- and intrarater reliability for the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , functional capacity , depression<symptom> , and dyspnea<symptom> measures ( Îº generally > 0.80.) However , validity concerns were raised about the tobacco intervention PM as written , and it continues to undergo further refinement and testing. We developed and validated 5 new PMs for use in cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation program quality assessment , improvement , and certification.
