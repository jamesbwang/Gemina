  Hybrid palliation , the concept to stabilize univentricular circulation with bilateral pulmonary artery banding and maintenance of ductal patency , has significantly widened the therapeutic spectrum for patients with single ventricle malformations or borderline hypoplasia. Although the concept has already been a part of early attempts to improve outcome in hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease> , it has not attracted much attention initially. Technical refinement and expertise have led to results that ultimately allowed the palliative strategy to gain traction and to be selectively adopted. By now , we have gained almost two decades of experience and , as much as hybrid palliation has changed our approach to single ventricle management , new strategies and indications have been formed by this experience. We therefore review concepts and patterns of use of hybrid palliation , as well as benefits and challenges of the respective pathways to highlight the current status of the hybrid procedure.
