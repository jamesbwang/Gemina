J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study aimed to establish whether a series of 3 apneas before a 400-m freestyle time-trial affected swimming performance when compared with and combined with a warm-up. Nine ( 6 males and 3 females) regional to national standard swimmers completed four 400-m freestyle time-trials in 4 randomized conditions: without warm-up or apneas ( CON) , warm-up only ( WU) , apneas only ( AP) , and warm-up and apneas ( WUAP). Time-trial performance was significantly improved after WUAP ( 275.79 ± 12.88 seconds) compared with CON ( 278.66 ± 13.31 seconds , p = 0.035) and AP ( 278.64 ± 4.10 seconds , p = 0.015). However , there were no significant differences between the WU ( 276.01 ± 13.52 seconds , p > 0.05) and other interventions. Spleen volume compared with baseline was significantly reduced after the apneas by a maximum of ∼ 45 % in the WUAP and by ∼ 20 % in WU. This study showed that the combination of a warm-up with apneas could significantly improve 400-m freestyle swim performance compared with a control and apnea intervention. Further investigation into whether long-term apnea training can enhance this response is justified.
