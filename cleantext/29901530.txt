  The purpose of this study was to identify bronchi on computed tomographic ( CT) images , manual analysis is more accurate than automatic methods. Nonetheless , manual bronchoscopic navigation is not preferred as it involves mentally reconstructing a route to a bronchial target by interpreting 2-dimensional CT images. Here , we established the direct oblique method ( DOM) , a form of manual bronchoscopic navigation that does not necessitate mental reconstruction , and compared it with automatic virtual bronchoscopic navigation ( VBN). Routes were calculated to 47 identical targets using 2 automatic VBNs ( LungPoint and VINCENT-BFsim) and the DOM , using 3 general application CT viewers ( Aquarius , Synapse Vincent , and OsiriX). Results of all analyses were compared. The DOM drew routes to more targets than the VBNs ( 94 % ( the DOM on any viewer) vs. 49 % ( LungPoint) vs. 62 % ( VINCENT-BFsim) , P < 0.0001). For the 44 targets with the CT-bronchus or CT-artery signs , 100 % of the DOM routes led to targets. In the bronchoscopic simulation phase , the DOM covered 100 % of the bifurcations identified on CT , whereas some bifurcations were skipped and some bronchial walls appeared partially transparent in the VBNs. Manual analysis identified more bronchi near the targets than the VBNs ( 32.1 ± 3.4 ( manual analysis) vs. 18.9 ± 2.1 ( LungPoint) vs. 22.9 ± 2.7 ( VINCENT-BFsim) , mean ± SEM , P < 0.0001). The DOM took around 5 minutes on average. On the basis of precise manual CT analysis using general application CT viewers , the DOM drew routes leading to more targets and provided better bronchoscopic simulation than the automatic route calculation of the VBNs.
