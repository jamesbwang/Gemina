  Vasoplegia is a clinical condition typically manifested by cardiovascular instability unresponsive to usual doses of inotropes or vasopressors. It can occur in a variety of clinical settings including liver transplantation ( LT). Immunoglobulins have been used to treat sepsis-related vasoplegia. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy of IgM-enriched immunoglobulin ( IgMIg) on 30-day mortality and its ability to reverse vasoplegia in patients undergoing LT. Between 5/2013 and 11/2017 , 473 LT were performed at our institution. We identified 21 patients who received IgMIg for 3 days to treat vasoplegia. Patients included in the study met the criteria for having vasoplegia and required noradrenaline administration greater than 1 μg/kg/min for more than 24 h to maintain a mean arterial pressure ( MAP) ≥ 70 mmHg. Procalcitonin ( PCT) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) levels were used as surrogate markers for inflammation<symptom> and were measured at the beginning and end of IgM treatment. After IgMIg administration , median noradrenaline infusion rates could be significantly reduced from 1.6 ( 1.3-2) μg/kg/min to 0.16 ( 0.08-0.34) μg/kg/min ( P < 0.001). In addition , after treatment , PCT levels decreased significantly from 44 ng/ml ( 24-158) to 26.1 ng/ml ( 10.9-48.7) ( P < 0.001) and IL-6 levels decreased significantly from 63 pg/ml ( 29-102) to 20 pg/ml ( 11-20) ( P < 0.001). Thirty-day morality was 14.3 %. The administration of IgMIg in patients with vasoplegia after LT is associated with a return of hemodynamic stability. Despite a predicted mortality of over 90 % by SOFA score , the mortality rate of patients receiving IgMIg in our study was less than 20 %.
