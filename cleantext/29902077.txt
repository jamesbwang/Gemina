  We aimed to summarize the up-to-date epidemiology evidence on biomarkers of long-chain ( LC) n-3 fatty acid ( FA) intake in relation to breast cancer ( BC). Epidemiology studies determining FA levels in biospecimen ( circulating blood or adipose tissue ( AT)) were identified from PubMed , EMBASE , and Cochrane Library databases until March 2018. Multivariate-adjusted risk ratios ( RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were pooled using a random-effect model. Difference in biospecimen proportions of LC n-3 FA between BC cases and non-cases were analyzed as a standardized mean difference ( SMD). Thirteen cohort and eleven case-control studies were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The estimated SMD was -0.14 ( 95 % CI: -0.27 , -0.11) for LC n-3 FA and -0.27 ( 95 % CI: -0.42 , -0.11) for LC n-3/ n-6 FA ratio. When comparing the top tertiles with the bottom baseline levels , circulating LC n-3 FA was significantly associated with a lower risk of BC ( RR: 0.84 , 95 % CI: 0.74 , 0.96) , but not AT ( RR: 1.02 , 95 % CI: 0.70 , 1.48). Significant inverse dose-response associations were observed for each 1 % increment of circulating 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3. This meta-analysis highlights that circulating LC n-3 FA as a biomarker of intake may be an independent predictive factor for BC , especially 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3.
