  Diabetes is a risk factor in infective endocarditis<disease> However , few studies have focused on the prognostic value of prediabetes in infective endocarditis<disease> This analysis aimed to explore the relationship between prediabetes and outcomes for people with infective endocarditis<disease> Diabetes and prediabetes definitions were based on the American Diabetes Association 2014 criteria. A total of 866 people who had been consecutively diagnosed with infective endocarditis<disease> between January 2009 and July 2015 were included in the analysis. They were divided into three groups: normoglycaemia ( n = 469) , prediabetes ( n = 246) and diabetes ( n = 151). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.5 % ( 74 of 866) , and differed significantly among the normoglycaemia , prediabetes and diabetes groups ( 3.4 % , 12.6 % and 17.9 % , respectively; P < 0.001). Compared with the normoglycaemia group , the adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital death was 2.42 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.11-5.31; P = 0.027) for prediabetes and 3.39 ( 95 % CI 1.48-7.80; P = 0.004) for diabetes. The cumulative long-term death rate was significantly higher in the prediabetes or diabetes groups than in the normoglycaemia group ( log-rank = 34.82; P < 0.001). In addition to diabetes , prediabetes was also associated with a higher risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality among people with infective endocarditis<disease> Therefore , attention should be paid to this population.
