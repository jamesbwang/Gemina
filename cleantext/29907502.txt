  Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid ( HIDA) scans provide global and regional assessments of liver function that can serve as a road map for functional avoidance in stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT) planning. Functional liver image guided hepatic therapy ( FLIGHT) , an innovative planning technique , is described and compared with standard planning using functional dose-volume histograms. Thresholds predicting for decompensation during follow up are evaluated. We studied 17 patients who underwent HIDA scans before SBRT. All SBRT cases were replanned using FLIGHT. The following dosimetric endpoints were compared for FLIGHT versus standard SBRT planning: functional residual capacity < 15 Gy ( FRC Compared with standard planning , FLIGHT significantly improved FRC FLIGHT with HIDA-based parameters may complement blood chemistry-based assessments of liver function and facilitate individualized , adaptive liver SBRT planning.
