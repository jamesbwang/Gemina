  The difference of enzymatic degradation behavior between Poly ( butylene succinate-co-diethylene glycol succinate) ( PBS-co-DEGS) and Poly ( butylene succinate-co-butylene diglycolic acid) ( PBS-co-BDGA) was studied in a Tetrahydrofuran ( THF)/ toluene mixed system by Novozym 435 ( N435 , immobilized Candida Antarctica lipase supported on acrylic resin) catalysis for 30 h. These two copolymers ( modified with alcoholic acid by ether linkage) were synthesized by melt polycondensation and characterized by
