  Triglyceride-Glucose ( TyG) is an emerging surrogate indicator of insulin resistance. We explored the role of TyG in development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM) and elucidated the mechanism for the relationship. 4109 subjects without baseline T2DM participated in a community screening programme in 2013-2016. TyG was calculated as Ln ( fasting triglyceride level ( mg/dl) × fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) ( mg/dl)/ 2). Outcome was T2DM defined as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/l; current treatment with anti-diabetes medication; and/or self-reported diabetes on follow-up screening. We used Cox proportion-hazard model to assess risk of T2DM by TyG quartiles at baseline. Binary mediation analysis was performed to examine extent of mediation by TyG between Body Mass Index ( BMI) and T2DM development. After 5734.23 person-years of follow-up , T2DM developed in 117 subjects with an incidence of 20.40/ 1000 person-years. Risk of T2DM incidence was increased with quartiles 2 , 3 and 4 versus quartile 1 of TyG ( adjusted HR 1.79 ( 95 % CI 0.80-3.99) , 2.54 ( 1.18-5.49) and 4.68 ( 2.19-10.01) , P TyG is potentially useful for predicting T2DM in clinical practice. It is a potential mediator of association between BMI and T2DM development.
