  A novel gas to particle conversion-gas exchange technique coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( GPD-GED-ICP-MS) was recently proposed for the direct analysis of ultra-trace levels of metallic compound gases such as metal carbonyl and semiconductor gases as well as gaseous mercury ( Hg) in ambient air. These metallic compound gases should reveal reactivity with respect to ozone and gas to particle conversion could be obtained in a gas to particle conversion device ( GPD) through metal oxides by oxidation. The particles converted were separated from non-reactive gases such as nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide in ambient air by a gas exchange device ( GED) and the particles in argon , otherwise ICP can not be maintained , were directly introduced and measured by ICP-MS. Since the technique detects the metallic compound gas directly without any sampling methods , it is expected to be applied to real-time monitoring. This article highlights the research progress and novelty on GPD-GED-ICP-MS for the direct analysis of ultra-trace metallic compound gas. It was also noted that the direct analysis of gaseous Hg at the concentration level of a few ng m
