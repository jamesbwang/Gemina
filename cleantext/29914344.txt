  This exploratory study employed correspondence analysis to examine how employees ' gender and marital status might affect levels of interpersonal and organizational deviant workplace behaviors in the workplace. The subjects were 122 employees from a large electricity supplier company in Israel. Four levels of deviant behaviors relating to interpersonal and organizational deviance behaviors were generated according to their `` typicality '' as follows: ( 1) `` untypical '' ( z-score less than -1.00) , ( 2) `` somewhat untypical '' ( -1.00-0) , ( 3) `` somewhat typical '' ( 0-1.00) , and ( 4) `` typical '' ( larger than 1.00). We assessed the marital status categories by gender: unmarried males and females , divorced males and females , and males and females who were married. Results indicated that married men and divorced women exhibited mostly typical types of deviance. Both married and divorced men reported untypical deviance for both types of deviant behaviors. Married women only reported somewhat untypical deviance for both types of deviant behaviors. Accordingly , we suggest that psychological stressors , as well as cultural and societal expectations , may account for the obtained differences. Yet , future research is needed to shed light on underlying mechanisms.
