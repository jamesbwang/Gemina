  Production of isoprostanes ( IsoPs) is enhanced after acute , intense , and prolonged exercise , in untrained subjects. This effect is greater in older subjects. The present study aims to delineate the profile of acute-exercise-induced IsoPs levels in young and older endurance-trained subjects. All included subjects were male , young ( n = 6; 29 yrs ± 5.7) or older ( n = 6; 63.7 yrs ± 2.3) , and competitors.
