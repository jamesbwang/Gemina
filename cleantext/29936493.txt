  To design and validate a questionnaire to measure medical students ' Public Health ( PH) knowledge , skills , social responsibility and applied learning as indicated in the four domains recommended by the Association of Schools & Programmes of Public Health ( ASPPH). A cross-sectional study was conducted to develop an evaluation tool for PH undergraduate education through item generation , reduction , refinement and validation. The 74 preliminary items derived from the existing literature were reduced to 55 items based on expert panel review which included those with expertise in PH , psychometrics and medical education , as well as medical students. Psychometric properties of the preliminary questionnaire were assessed as follows: frequency of endorsement for item variance; principal component analysis ( PCA) with varimax rotation for item reduction and factor estimation; Cronbach 's Alpha , item-total correlation and test-retest validity for internal consistency and reliability. PCA yielded five factors: PH Learning Experience ( 6 items); PH Risk Assessment and Communication ( 5 items); Future Use of Evidence in Practice ( 6 items); Recognition of PH as a Scientific Discipline ( 4 items); and PH Skills Development ( 3 items) , explaining 72.05 % variance. Internal consistency and reliability tests were satisfactory ( Cronbach 's Alpha ranged from 0.87 to 0.90; item-total correlation > 0.59). Lower paired test-retest correlations reflected instability in a social science environment. An evaluation tool for community-centred PH education has been developed and validated. The tool measures PH knowledge , skills , social responsibilities and applied learning as recommended by the internationally recognised Association of Schools & Programmes of Public Health ( ASPPH).
