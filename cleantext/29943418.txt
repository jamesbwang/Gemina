  Plasmonic metal nanostructures are widely used as subwavelength light concentrators to enhance light harvesting of organic solar cells through two photophysical effects , including enhanced local electric field ( ELEF) and antenna-amplified light scattering ( AALS) , while their adverse quenching effect from surface energy transfer ( SET) should be suppressed. In this work , a comprehensive study to unambiguously distinguish and quantitatively determine the specific influence and contribution of each effect on the overall performance of organic solar cells incorporated with Ag@SiO
