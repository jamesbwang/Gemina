  This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate dietary diversity and its associated factors in Chinese preschoolers and explore whether the daily food consumption of children with different dietary diversity-associated characteristics met recommended dietary amounts. A cross-sectional study covering seven cities and two villages was conducted and included 697 preschool children aged 3 ⁻ 7 years old. Dietary diversity score ( DDS) and DDS 10 were calculated based on 24-h dietary recall. The food-intake differences among children with different DDS 10 predictors were examined. The mean DDS and DDS 10 in Chinese preschool children were 7.4 ± 1.5 ( ranged from 3 to 9) and 7.0 ± 3 ( ranged from 3 to 9) respectively. Positive predictors of dietary diversity included residing in an urban environment , a higher household expenditure on children & rsquo; s food , and a higher frequency of eating outside. Food-intake differences existed among the predictors. Education and intervention should be strengthened to improve the dietary diversity of preschool children , especially in rural areas. The overall dietary pattern of children requires attention , which means not only increasing dietary diversity but also avoiding an unbalanced diet.
