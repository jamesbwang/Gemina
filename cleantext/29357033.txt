  Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes ( T2D). In vitro and animal studies have shown that resveratrol exerts an antioxidant effect , but clinical trials addressing this effect in patients with T2D are limited. The aim of this study was to determine whether resveratrol supplementation affects oxidative stress markers in a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind clinical trial.
