  The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of DRL_BZ with that of EU-approved ( reference medicinal product; RMP) and US-licensed ( reference product; RP) bevacizumab ( Avastin In this double-blind , parallel-group , Phase 1 study ( BZ-01-001) , men aged 20-45 years were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of 1 mg kg Primary PK parameters were comparable across groups , and 90 % confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratios of the primary PK endpoints were within the pre-specified equivalence margins ( 80-125 %) for all pairwise comparisons ( DRL_BZ vs. RMP , DRL_BZ vs. RP and RMP vs. RP). No deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Similar numbers of subjects reported similar numbers of treatment-emergent adverse events in the three treatment groups. One subject who received DRL_BZ had anti-drug antibodies at the Day 85 visit; however , no anti-drug antibodies were detected in this subject at the 12-month follow-up visit. PK , safety and immunogenicity of DRL_BZ were comparable to EU-approved and US-licensed bevacizumab in healthy male subjects.
