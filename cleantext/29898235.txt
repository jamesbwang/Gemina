  Eating disorders affect millions of children , adolescents , and their families worldwide , and the pediatric primary care provider is often the first line of evaluation for these patients. Eating disorders affect nearly every system in the body , and signs and symptoms vary depending on patient behaviors ( restrictive eating , binge eating , purging). Because the diagnosis is not always straightforward , a clinician 's ability to recognize the potential medical complications of eating disorders early in their course can help facilitate timely treatment and an appropriate level of support. Most of these medical complications improve or resolve with nutritional rehabilitation and cessation of eating disorder behaviors. Refeeding severely underweight patients should be approached with caution as there is potential for significant fluid and electrolyte derangement that may worsen a patient 's clinical status. Prompt recognition of the medical complications of eating disorders can improve short-term and long-term health in these children and adolescents. ( Pediatr Ann. 2018; 47 ( 6): e238-e243.).
