  We conducted a 3-year longitudinal serologic survey on an open cohort of poultry workers , swine workers , and general population controls to assess avian influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( AIV) seroprevalence and seroincidence and virologic diversity at live poultry markets ( LPMs) in Wuxi City , Jiangsu Province , China. Of 964 poultry workers , 9 ( 0.93 %) were seropositive for subtype H7N9 virus , 18 ( 1.87 %) for H9N2<pathogen> , and 18 ( 1.87 %) for H5N1<pathogen>. Of 468 poultry workers followed longitudinally , 2 ( 0.43 %) , 13 ( 2.78 %) , and 7 ( 1.5 %) seroconverted , respectively; incidence was 1.27 , 8.28 , and 4.46/ 1,000 person-years for H7N9 , H9N2<pathogen> , and H5N1<pathogen> viruses , respectively. Longitudinal surveillance of AIVs at 9 LPMs revealed high co-circulation of H9 , H7 , and H5 subtypes. We detected AIVs in 726 ( 23.3 %) of 3,121 samples and identified a high diversity ( 10 subtypes) of new genetic constellations and reassortant viruses. These data suggest that stronger surveillance for AIVs within LPMs and high-risk populations is imperative.
