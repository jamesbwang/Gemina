  Given the constant pressures of overflowing clinics , hospital wards , and emergency departments; shortened duty hours; and increased accreditation requirements , over-burdened clinician teachers ask , `` how does one teach for humanism and justice? '' How does one step away-even momentarily-and focus teaching on the individual in front of us , the person who requires our attention and care? This approach must not only involve content ( the patient 's perspective of illness , social context , and life story) but it also must be tightly linked with the ways in which these lessons in living are learned and taught. In this article , the authors propose recognition and use of a style of communication that is already implicitly present in clinical conversations and that is uniquely capable of stimulating reflection on the human dimensions of medicine: that of dialogue.Dialogue involves committing one 's whole self to communicative exchange and emphasizes interpersonal relationships and trust. Its result is often not a specific answer; rather it is enhanced understanding through the generation of new questions and possibilities and action in implementing solutions. It requires a reorientation of the teacher-learner relationship from top-down to one of open exchange and shared authority and responsibility. In the context of professional identity development , these conversations become dialogues on the threshold of transformative change. Through an exploration of dialogical teaching , the authors envision clinical education as constantly stepping in and out of goal-oriented discussions and reflective dialogues , all with the overall goal to educate physicians who practice with excellence , compassion , and justice.
