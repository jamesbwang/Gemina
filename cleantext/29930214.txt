  Primary meningiomas arising outside the intracranial component are rather rare and have been termed primary extradural meningiomas ( PEMs). We present a case of an intraosseous-type PEM occurring at a high convexity location and discuss the clinical characteristics of PEMs. An 80-year-old woman presented with a soft and painless subcutaneous mass of approximately 10 cm in diameter in the right parietal region , which had appeared 1 year previously. Mild cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis<symptom> were observed upon admission. A skull radiograph and a bone window computed tomography scan revealed an osteolytic lesion<symptom> at the above-mentioned site. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated that the mass was inhomogeneously enhanced and seemed to extend through the skull defect both intra- and extra-cranially. The preoperative diagnosis was a metastatic skull bone tumor due to the patient 's history of breast cancer. During surgery , the tumor was found to be solid and had expanded through both the inner and outer tables of the skull , destroyed the inner table at one location , and perforated into the subdural space via the thinned , but not infiltrated , dura mater. The tumor was removed along with a wide margin of surrounding healthy bone and a cranioplasty was performed using a titanium plate. The histopathological diagnosis was atypical meningioma ( World Health Organization grade II). Postoperatively , no adjuvant therapies ( radiation and/or chemotherapy) were administered and the patient was reported to be well at 8 months post-surgery with no evidence of tumor recurrence. Although PEMs are rather rare , clinicians should consider the differential diagnosis of osteolytic skull vault tumors.
