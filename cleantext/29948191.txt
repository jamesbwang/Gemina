  The multilingual brain implements mechanisms that serve to select the appropriate language as a function of the communicative environment. Engaging these mechanisms on a regular basis appears to have consequences for brain structure and function. Studies have implicated the caudate nuclei as important nodes in polyglot language control processes , and have also shown structural differences in the caudate nuclei in bilingual compared to monolingual populations. However , the majority of published work has focused on the categorical differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals , and little is known about whether these findings extend to multilingual individuals , who have even greater language control demands. In the present paper , we present an analysis of the volume and morphology of the caudate nuclei , putamen , pallidum<pathogen> and thalami in 75 multilingual individuals who speak three or more languages. Volumetric analyses revealed a significant relationship between multilingual experience and right caudate volume , as well as a marginally significant relationship with left caudate volume. Vertex-wise analyses revealed a significant enlargement of dorsal and anterior portions of the left caudate nucleus , known to have connectivity with executive brain regions , as a function of multilingual expertise. These results suggest that multilingual expertise might exercise a continuous impact on brain structure , and that as additional languages beyond a second are acquired , the additional demands for linguistic and cognitive control result in modifications to brain structures associated with language management processes.
