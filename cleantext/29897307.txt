  In past efforts , input weather variables for Fusarium<pathogen> head blight ( FHB) prediction models in the United States were identified after following some version of the window-pane algorithm , which discretizes a continuous weather time series into fixed-length windows before searching for summary variables associated with FHB risk. Functional data analysis , on the other hand , reconstructs the assumed continuous process ( represented by a series of recorded weather data) by using smoothing functions , and is an alternative way of working with time series data with respect to FHB risk. Our objective was to functionally model weather-based time series data linked to 865 observations of FHB ( covering 16 states and 31 years in total) , classified as epidemics ( FHB disease index â‰¥ 10 %) and non-epidemics ( FHB disease index < 10 %). Altogether 94 different time series variables were modeled by penalized cubic B-splines for the smoothing function , from 120 days pre-anthesis to 20 days post-anthesis. Functional mean curves , standard deviations , and first derivatives were plotted for FHB epidemics relative to non-epidemics. Function-on-scalar regressions assessed the temporal trends of the magnitude and significance of the mean difference between functionally-represented weather time series associated with FHB epidemics and non-epidemics. The mean functional weather-variable curve for epidemics started to deviate , in general , from that for non-epidemics as early as 40 days pre-anthesis for several weather variables. The greatest deviations were often near anthesis , the period of maximum susceptibility of wheat to FHB-causing fungi<pathogen> The most consistent separations between the mean functional curves were seen with the daily averages of moisture-related variables ( such as average relative humidity) , and with variables summarizing the daily variation in temperature ( as opposed to the daily mean). Functional data analysis was useful for extending our knowledge on relationships between weather variables and FHB epidemics.
