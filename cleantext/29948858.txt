  Adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV) is a ventilator algorithm able to correct breathing through anticyclic support of breathing in patients with central sleep apnea ( CSA). So far , very few data exist regarding the role of ASV on acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF). We performed a single-center prospective , randomized , case-control study in consecutive acute HFpEF ( left ventricle ejection fraction , LVEF â‰¥ 45 %) patients with sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB , apnea-hypopnea index , AHI > 15/h) and prevalence of CSA. We included ten consecutive patients randomized for ASV on top of standard therapy for acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( group 1) versus standard care alone ( group 2). ASV therapy significantly reduced AHI and CSA. An improvement in cardiac diastolic function was seen in group 1 compared to group 2 ( E/E ' 17.5 to 9.6 , p < 0.02 vs 18.5 to 14.5 , p = 0.4). Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) markedly decreased in cases , but not in controls ( 298 to 84 pg/ml , p < 0.02 vs 280 to 120 pg/ml , p = 0.06). Right ventricle ( RV) function significantly improved in group 1 , differently from group 2. An acute use of ASV seems effective in reducing BNP and improving diastolic and RV function in acute HFpEF patients with SDB and CSA , compared to standard treatment.
