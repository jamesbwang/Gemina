  Deterioration of gait in adolescent and adult patients with cerebral palsy can be associated with multiple factors. Multilevel surgery ( MLS) is one option in adults with cerebral palsy to improve gait function with encouraging short-term results. It is a question whether these improvements are maintained over time. In a retrospective consecutive cohort study , adults with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy ( BSCP) treated with MLS between 1995 and 2011 were scanned for potential inclusion. Patients needed to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: age at MLS > 17 , standardized three-dimensional gait analysis ( 3D-GA) including clinical examination at pre-operative ( E0) , a short-term follow-up ( E1) and at least seven years ( E2) after the index MLS. Twenty adults ( 10 women , 10 men) with a Gross Motor Function Classification Level ( GMFCS) I-III and a mean age at MLS of 24.8 years were included in this study. The average long-term follow-up was 10.9 years. The Gait Profile Score ( GPS) was used as primary outcome measure. The GPS improved significantly from 13.8 ° before surgery to 11.2 ° at short-term ( p = 0.007) and to 11.3 ° at long-term follow-up ( p = 0.002). Mean GPS showed a slight deterioration between E1 and E2 due to a minority of six patients ( 30 %) who showed a significant loss of correction. Surgical treatment in adults with BSCP was feasible and effective in the long-term. Significant improvement of gait and function was maintained in the majority of patients , while some patients were prone to develop crouch gait , hip flexion contractures , or pain.
