  Coupling reactions involving non-sulfonated C-O electrophiles provide a promising method for forming C-C bonds , but the incorporation of functionalized or secondary alkyl groups remains a challenge due to the requirement for well-defined alkylmetal species. In this study , we report a reductive nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of benzyl oxalates with alkyl bromides , using oxalate as a new leaving group. A broad range of highly functionalized alkyl units ( such as functional groups: alkyl chloride , alcohol , aldehyde , amine , amide , boronate ester , ether , ester , heterocycle , phosphonate , strained ring) were efficiently incorporated at the benzylic position. The utility of this synthetic method was further demonstrated by late-stage modification of complex bioactive compounds. Preliminary mechanistic experiments revealed that a radical process might be involved in the reaction.
