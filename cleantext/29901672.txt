  We report a simple , surfactant-assisted room temperature synthesis of metallic cadmium nanoparticle sheets and their subsequent hydrolysis to the formation of rice-shaped monoclinic cadmium hydroxide nanostructures. These new nanostructures have demonstrated 30-40 fold superior electrochemical charge storage capacity along with quantized double layer charging of metal nanoparticles as compared to the bulk cadmium.
