  To compare clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) switching from insulin glargine 100 units/mL ( Gla-100) or insulin detemir ( IDet) to insulin glargine 300 units/mL ( Gla-300) or insulin degludec ( IDeg). We conducted a retrospective , observational study of electronic medical records for Gla-300/ IDeg adult switchers ( March 1 , 2015 to January 31 , 2017) with active records for 12-month baseline ( glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) used a 6-month baseline period) and 6-month follow-up periods. Gla-300 and IDeg switchers were propensity score-matched using baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Outcomes were HbA1c change and goal attainment ( among patients with HbA1c captured at follow-up) , and hypoglycaemia with fixed follow-up ( intention-to-treat ( ITT); 6 months) and variable follow-up ( on-treatment ( OT); to discontinuation or 6 months). Each matched cohort comprised 1592 patients. The mean decrease in HbA1c and HbA1c goal ( < 7.0 % ( 53 mmol/mol) and < 8.0 % ( 64 mmol/mol)) attainment rates were similar for Gla-300 ( n = 742) and IDeg ( n = 727) switchers. Using fixed follow-up ( ITT method) , hypoglycaemia incidence decreased significantly from baseline with Gla-300 ( all hypoglycaemia: 15.6 % to 12.7 %; P = .006; hypoglycaemia associated with inpatient/emergency department ( ED) encounter: 5.3 % to 3.5 %; P = .007) , but not with IDeg. After adjusting for baseline hypoglycaemia , no significant differences in hypoglycaemia incidence and event rate were found at follow-up ( ITT) for Gla-300 vs IDeg. Using variable follow-up ( OT) , hypoglycaemia incidence was similar in both groups , but Gla-300 switchers had a lower inpatient/ED hypoglycaemia event rate at follow-up ( adjusted rate ratio 0.56; P = .016). In a real-world setting , switching from Gla-100 or IDet to Gla-300 or IDeg was associated with similar improvements in glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in adult patients with T2D.
