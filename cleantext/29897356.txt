  The aim of this study was to examine 10 different shades of pink ceramic to determine which one best matches the mean color of human gingiva. Bar-shaped zirconia samples were fabricated and veneered with 1 of 10 pink zirconia veneering ceramics. The color of the gingiva at the central maxillary incisors of 20 healthy volunteers was compared to the pink veneering ceramics using a spectrophotometer ( Spectroshade , MHT). The obtained color parameters L * , a * , and b * ( CIELAB) of the gingiva and the ceramics were used to calculate the color difference ( ΔE). Mean ΔE values were descriptively analyzed and compared to the threshold value for visibility of color differences of gingiva ( ΔE = 3.1). The lowest pink ceramic ΔE value obtained ( closest to the mean ΔE of all the volunteers ' gingiva) was 6.2. All the tested ceramics exhibited a color difference above the threshold value for visibility.
