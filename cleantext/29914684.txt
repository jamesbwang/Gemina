  The effect of two Marek 's disease ( MD) vaccines on the chicken embryo immune responses were evaluated. Transcription of interferon ( IFN-α , IFN-β , IFN-λ , and IFN-γ) and interferon-I receptors ( IFN-AR1 and IFN-AR2) , as well as transcription of toll like receptors ( TLR-3 , TLR-7 , and TLR-21) were evaluated in the bursa , thymus , spleen and lung of 1-day-old chickens that had been vaccinated with HVT , CVI988 , or sham inoculated at embryonic day 18 ( ED18). Each vaccine had a unique effect on the transcription of the evaluated genes and it differs among tissues. HVT increased IFN-γ and TLR-3 transcripts in the spleen and lung and IFN-β in the bursa. The immune responses elicited by CVI988 differed from that observed in the HVT inoculated group. CVI988 downregulated several of the studied genes and only upregulated IFN-β and TLR-21 in spleen. Differences in vaccine replication ( 53 % of spleens and lungs of HVT-vaccinated embryos but only 22 % of spleens of CVI988-vaccinated embryos had detectable viral gB transcripts) were detected. Previously , we have shown that intra-amniotic vaccination at ED18 with HVT but not with CVI988 rendered chickens more immunocompetent at hatch. The role of increased transcription of TLR-3 and IFN-γ in such positive effect warrant further investigations.
