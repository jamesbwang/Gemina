  Adolescent alcohol use is related to disinhibition traits and family environments. However , research is scarce on whether these factors predict alcohol use trajectories distally , from early adolescence into early adulthood. We examined whether sensation seeking and parenting environments in early adolescence predicted adolescents ' alcohol use trajectories proximally ( middle-adolescence) and distally ( early adulthood). Using four waves of data from 345 adolescents ( 51.3 % female; 80 % white) and their primary caregivers , we estimated adolescents ' alcohol use trajectories and examined variability in these by sensation seeking and parental control. The findings revealed distal , positive associations between sensation seeking and alcohol use; and negative , proximal associations between parental control and alcohol use. Also proximally , there was a significant interaction between sensation seeking and parental control. We discuss implications for theory and practice.
