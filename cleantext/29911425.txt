  Glycosylation is an effective approach to improve the druggability of natural products by increasing their water solubility. In this work , we report the glycosylation of oleanane-type triterpenoids by a recombinant microbial glycosyltransferase YjiC1. A preliminary screening test indicated YjiC1 exhibited robust capabilities for O-glycosylation of triterpenoids , based on LC/MS analysis. Among the products , two new compounds ( 2a and 3a) , together with a known one ( 1a) , were isolated and characterized. These products exhibited improved water solubility , and 3a showed moderate anti-HIV activities at 100 Î¼M. This reaction provides a facile and efficient approach to synthesize the glucosides of triterpenoids.
