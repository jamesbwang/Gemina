  The enediynes , microbial natural products with extraordinary cytotoxicities , have been translated into clinical drugs. Two self-resistance mechanisms are known in the enediyne producers-apoproteins for the nine-membered enediynes and self-sacrifice proteins for the ten-membered enediyne calicheamicin. Here we show that: ( 1) tnmS1 , tnmS2 , and tnmS3 encode tiancimycin ( TNM) resistance in its producer Streptomyces sp.. CB03234 , ( 2) tnmS1 , tnmS2 , and tnmS3 homologs are found in all anthraquinone-fused enediyne producers , ( 3) TnmS1 , TnmS2 , and TnmS3 share a similar Î² barrel-like structure , bind TNMs with nanomolar K
