  What is the effectiveness of interventions that aim to prevent a new episode of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>? Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised , controlled trials. People without neck<symptom> pain<symptom> at study entry. Any intervention aiming to prevent a future episode of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. New episode of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. Five trials including a total of 3852 individuals met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results from two randomised , controlled trials ( 500 participants) found moderate-quality evidence that exercise reduces the risk of a new episode of neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR 0.32 , 95 % CI 0.12 to 0.86). One of the meta-analysed trials included some co-interventions with the exercise. There was low-quality evidence from three randomised , controlled trials ( 3352 participants) that ergonomic programs do not reduce the risk of a new neck<symptom> pain<symptom> episode ( OR 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.74 to 1.35). This review found moderate-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of an exercise program for reducing the risk of a new episode of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. There is a need for high-quality randomised , controlled trials evaluating interventions to prevent new episodes of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. PROSPERO CRD42017055174.
