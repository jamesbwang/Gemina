  Photoelectrolysis of water using solar energy into storable and environment-friendly chemical fuel in the form of hydrogen provides a potential solution to address the environmental concerns and fulfill future energy requirements in a sustainable manner. Achieving efficient and spontaneous hydrogen evolution in water using solar light as the only energy input is a highly desirable but a difficult target. In this work , we report perovskite solar cell integrated CdS-based photoanode for unbiased photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. An integrated tandem device consisting of mesoporous CdS/TiO
