  Ecotoxicological studies mainly consist of single-species experiments evaluating the effects of a single stressor. However , under natural conditions aquatic communities are exposed to a mixture of stressors. The present study aimed to identify how the toxicity of zinc ( Zn) is affected by increased temperature and increased phosphorus ( P) supply and how these interactions vary among species , functional groups , and community structure and function. Aquatic microcosms were subjected to 3 Zn concentrations ( background , no Zn added , and 75 and 300 μg Zn/L) , 2 temperatures ( 16-19 and 21-24 °C) , and 2 different P additions ( low , 0.02 , and high , 0.4 mg P L
