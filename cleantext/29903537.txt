  Polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) is often the presenting manifestation of giant cell arteritis ( GCA). Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) scan often discloses the presence of large vessel vasculitis ( LVV) in PMR patients. We aimed to identify predictive factors of a positive PET/CT scan for LVV in patients classified as having isolated PMR according to well-established criteria. A set of consecutive patients with PMR from a single hospital were assessed. All of them underwent PET/CT scan between January 2010 and February 2018 based on clinical considerations. Patients with PMR associated to other diseases , including those with cranial features of GCA , were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized in classic PMR ( if fulfilled the 2012 EULAR/ACR classification criteria at disease diagnosis; n = 84) or atypical PMR ( who did not fulfill these criteria; n = 16). Only information on patients with classic PMR was assessed. The mean age of the 84 patients ( 51 women) with classic PMR was 71.4 Â± 9.2 years. A PET/CT scan was positive in 51 ( 60.7 %). Persistence of classic PMR symptoms was the most common reason to perform a PET/CT scan. Nevertheless , patients with positive PET/CT scan often had unusual symptoms. The best set of predictors of a positive PET/CT scan were bilateral diffuse lower limb<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR = 8.8 , 95 % CI: 1.7-46.3; p = 0.01) , pelvic girdle pain ( OR = 4.9 , 95 % CI: 1.50-16.53; p = 0.01) and inflammatory<symptom> low<symptom> back pain ( OR = 4.7 , 95 % CI: 1.03-21.5; p = 0.04). Inflammatory<symptom> low<symptom> back pain , pelvic girdle and diffuse lower limb<symptom> pain<symptom> are predictors of positive PET/CT scan for LVV in PMR.
