  This study examined the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Post-traumatic Syndrome<disease> Scale-Interview ( C-PSSI) for severe burn victims of the Formosa Fun Coast Explosion that occurred in Taiwan. A purposive sampling , cross-sectional , descriptive design study was selected. Participants were patients with severe burns from the Formosa Fun Coast Explosion , selected from teaching medical centers in Taiwan. They completed the C-PSSI and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9). Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties , including reliability , construct validity ( using confirmatory factor analysis) , convergent validity , and criterion-related validity of the questionnaire. Data on 63 participants were analyzed. The Cronbach 's α of the entire C-PSSI was .88 , ranging from .73 to .82 for the three subscales of this instrument. The item-total correlation coefficient was from .42 to .81. Examining the convergent validity revealed that two subscores of the C-PSSI were significantly correlated with PHQ-9 total scores ( ρ = .58 , .44 , P < .01). Criterion-related validity was confirmed because the PHQ-9 total scores were significantly correlated with the total C-PSSI scores ( ρ = .54 , P < .01). Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the construct validity , with a good model fit. Integrated moderate to good psychometric properties were demonstrated and a three-factor model of the C-PSSI was verified in patients with severe burn in Taiwan. The C-PSSI exhibited adequate psychometric properties for posttraumatic stress disorder evaluation in patients with severe burn in Taiwan. The Chinese version of this scale can be used to assess the psychological problems of victims of traumatic events.
