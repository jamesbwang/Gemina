  Mutations in the gene encoding Tau ( MAPT-microtubule-associated protein tau) cause a group of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. A recently identified Tau variant , p.A152T , has been reported as a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia-related disorders and Alzheimer disease. However , the mechanism for the pathologies still remain poorly understood. Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> expressing mutant 2N4R-Tau
