  Nursing home providers face challenges in urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> assessment and treatment , often prescribing unnecessary antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria , a practice that can result in adverse drug reactions , drug resistance , and an increase in antibiotic-associated diarrhea<disease> The purpose of this project was to replicate the Cooper Urinary<disease> Tract<disease> Infection Program in another facility and measure its effectiveness. Using a pre-post design , this project was implemented at a 120-bed , long-term care and rehabilitation facility located in the Midwest United States. This project used the multifaceted Cooper Urinary<disease> Tract<disease> Infection Program that includes the Cooper tool algorithm , didactic education for providers , and change champions. The results were significant improvements in nurse knowledge and reduced rates of urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> , inappropriate antibiotic treatments , and urinalyses. These results add to the evidence for implementing the Cooper Urinary<disease> Tract<disease> Infection Program in long-term care facilities for effective reduction of inappropriate antibiotic usage for
