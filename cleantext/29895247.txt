  Hippocampal mean diffusivity ( MD) measured by diffusion-tensor imaging is a promising diagnostic marker for Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI) and dementia. Its performance has yet to be evaluated in primary care patients , who vary systematically from patients visiting specialized care settings. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of hippocampus diffusivity for detecting MCI and dementia in a sample recruited from primary care , compared to a sample from specialized care. One sample was recruited from a primary care intervention trial ( DelpHi-MV) ( n = 70) , and the other sample was recruited from our memory clinic ( n = 70). The samples were matched pairwise for diagnosis , MMSE , age , gender , and education. They included dementia patients , MCI patients and healthy subjects. Mean MD was calculated for the left and right hippocampus , corrected for partial volume effects. Within each sample , left or right hippocampal MD served as predictor for diagnostic group in logistic regressions , which were additionally controlled for white matter lesions<symptom>. In the primary care sample , hippocampal MD detected dementia with high cross-validated accuracy ( left: AUC = .92; right: AUC = .85) , but did not classify MCI with an accuracy above chance ( left: AUC = .58; right: AUC = .44). In the memory clinic sample , hippocampal MD classified both dementia ( left: AUC = .91; right: AUC = .91) and MCI ( left: AUC = .86; right: AUC = .83) with high cross-validated accuracy. Hippocampal MD supported the identification of dementia but did not contribute to the detection of MCI in the primary care patient population.
