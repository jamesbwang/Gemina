  The role of lipid metabolism in epithelial stem cell ( SC) function and carcinogenesis is poorly understood. The transcription factor Runx1 is known to regulate proliferation in mouse epithelial hair follicle ( HF) SCs in vivo and in several mouse and human epithelial cancers. We found a novel subset of in vivo Runx1 HFSC target genes related to lipid metabolism and demonstrated changes in distinct classes of lipids driven by Runx1. Inhibition of lipid-enzymes Scd1 and Soat1 activity synergistically reduces proliferation of mouse skin epithelial cells and of human skin and oral squamous cell carcinoma cultured lines. Varying Runx1 levels induces changes in skin monounsaturated fatty acids ( e.g. , oleate , a product of Scd1) as shown by our lipidome analysis. Furthermore , varying Runx1 levels , the inhibition of Scd1 , or the addition of Scd1-product oleate , individually affects the plasma membrane organization ( or fluidity) in mouse keratinocytes. These factors also affect the strength of signal transduction through the membranes<symptom> for Wnt , a pathway that promotes epithelial ( cancer) cell proliferation and HFSC activation. Our working model is that HFSC factor Runx1 modulates the fatty acid production , which affects membrane organization , facilitating signal transduction for rapid proliferation of normal and cancer epithelial cells.
