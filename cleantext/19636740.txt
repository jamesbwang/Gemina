  Transgender youth experience elevated levels of victimization and may therefore report greater drug use than their cisgender peers , yet little is known about protective factors like school belonging that may mediate this relationship. Further , scant research has explored the experiences of youth at the intersection of transgender identity and youth of color status or low socioeconomic status , especially with respect to these multiple minority statuses & rsquo; associations with peer victimization , drug use , and school belonging. Using data from the California Healthy Kids Survey , the current study employs structural equation modeling to explore the relationships among school belonging , peer victimization , and drug use for transgender youth. Findings indicate that school belonging does mediate the pathway between peer victimization and drug use for transgender youth and that although youth of color experience greater victimization , they do not engage in greater drug use than their white transgender peers. Based on these results , those concerned with the healthy futures of transgender youth should advocate for more open and affirming school climates that engender a sense of belonging and treat transgender youth with dignity and fairness.
