  Poor<symptom> adherence is an important barrier to adequate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control among the diagnosed hypertensives. The study aimed at assessing the level of adherence to medication and to identify factors associated with it in people with hypertension in a rural population of Kerala. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2016 among 189 known hypertensives of a rural population in Kerala. Data was collected by interview method using a semistructured questionnaire. Medication adherence was assessed using 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Chi-square was used to test the significance of association , and logistic regression was done to identify independent predictors along with odds ratio ( OR). The mean age of study participants was 65.12 ± 11.71 years and the mean duration of disease was 8.69 ± 7.99 years. High adherence was seen in 46 % of the patients , while medium and low adherence was seen in 41.3 % and 12.7 % , respectively. Risk factors of poor adherence identified were poor knowledge of the complications ( OR- 2.120; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.110-4.048) , availing government pharmacy ( OR- 2.379; 95 % CI 1.131-5.004) , and being asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis ( OR- 2.120; 95 % CI 1.110-4.048). Adherence to medication among people with hypertension in the current study is poor. A comprehensive strategy to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications is the need of the hour.
