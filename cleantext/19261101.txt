  Peribiliary cysts<symptom> are usually benign , although severe complications and mortality may occur , and they may be confounded with other diseases. No classification delineating their different characteristics exists. We performed a systematic review of the frequency and clinical manifestations of peribiliary cysts<symptom>. Two reviewers identified studies after searching multiple databases on 2 August 2017. These cysts<symptom> were prevalent in cirrhosis ( 9 %). A total of 135 patients were reported in 72 papers with sufficient clinical data ( 10 countries , 65 % from Japan , median age 63 years ( range: 4-88) , and 80 % were males). Symptoms were present in 70 %. Misdiagnosis occurred in 40 % , and 33 % underwent therapeutic misadventures. Cysts<symptom> were solitary in 10 %. Obstructive features and cholangitis were observed in 36 % and 12.5 % , respectively. Cysts<symptom> progression was observed in 37.5 % over a median of 18 months. Mortality was 24 % , mostly due to cirrhosis. A classification framework is proposed , wherein type I includes hepatic , type II extrahepatic and type III mixed hepatic and extrahepatic cysts<symptom> , each having distinct features. Specifically , type II was more frequent in females , solitary , without cirrhosis , presenting with obstructive jaundice , more difficult to diagnose and required more surgical interventions ( all p < 0.05). Although rarely studied in the literature , peribiliary cysts<symptom> were frequent in studies designed to evaluate their prevalence , and were mostly asymptomatic. Inaccurate diagnosis , therapeutic misadventures , cysts<symptom> progression and cysts-related complications are frequent. In a novel classification framework based on location , extrahepatic peribiliary cysts<symptom> have distinct characteristics and require a special approach for diagnosis and management.
