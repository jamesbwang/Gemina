  Today , there is an almost endless variety of knee prosthesis models on the market from which the surgeon can choose. Although the designs appear closer and closer to one another , the industry makes a great effort to emphasise different features as beneficial and a stand-alone. It is increasingly difficult to keep an overview and to assess the clinical relevance of the diverse features. There is a clear lack of independent comparative studies and evidence is low. Nevertheless , different design philosophies require special surgical techniques , so that the surgeon must be familiar with the peculiarity of his/her prosthesis. Also , a differentiated indication for different designs appears to be an interesting concept. The aim of this essay is to give a brief overview of the major design concepts of current unconstrained knee prosthesis designs and their differences regarding biomechanics and kinematics.
