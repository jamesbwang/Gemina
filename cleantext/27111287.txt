  In this work , electrospun poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PVA) nanofiber membranes<symptom> were functionalized by incorporating poly ( methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) ( poly ( MVE/MA) , PMA) for the selective adsorption of proteins. The capture performance was regulated by an optimizing buffer pH , PMA content , and protein concentration. Lysozyme was used as the model protein and a high adsorption capacity of 476.53 Â± 19.48 was obtained at pH 6 , owing to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged nanofibers and positively charged proteins. The large specific surface area , highly open porous structure , and abundant available carboxyl groups contributed to such high adsorption performance. Moreover , the nanofiber membranes<symptom> exhibited good reusability and good selectivity for positively charged proteins. The obtained results can provide a promising method for the purification of proteins in small analytic devices.
