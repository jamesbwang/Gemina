  The experimental approach to deplete cellular glycosphingolipids ( GSLs) with the specific inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis has the potential to identify functions of endogenous GSLs. Most GSLs are derived from glucosylceramide ( GlcCer). D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol ( D-PDMP) inhibits GIcCer synthase and has been used extensively to study the biological functions of living cells. D-PDMP inhibits mTORC1 activity , which is independent of its inhibitory activity on GlcCer synthase. We also developed an analog of D-PDMP , D-threo-1-phenyl-2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol ( D-PBPP) lacking the effect on mTORC1. Here , we summarize the effects of D-PDMP and D-PBPP on the metabolism of GSLs and cell growth.
