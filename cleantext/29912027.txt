  Literature searches of databases , particularly CINAHL , using key phrases were undertaken. Some authors argue that there is a lack of evidence in forensic mental health ( FMH<pathogen>) nursing , with few randomized controlled trials and other methods providing definitive , generalizable evidence. However , literature searches revealed randomized controlled trials of relevance to FMH<pathogen> nursing , many qualitative studies by FMH<pathogen> nurses , and arguments for clinical experience and knowledge of service users , and the latter 's views , as sources of evidence. Research findings can be applied to practice , both directly and indirectly. Examples are given of ways that evidence can be used to inform FMH<pathogen> nursing interventions related to therapeutic ward environments , including communication , therapeutic relationships , preventing retraumatization , and enabling physical health. The complex nature of `` evidence '' is considered in relation to risk assessment and management. FMH<pathogen> nursing can be based on a wide range of sources of evidence. The types of evidence used in practice depend on individual service users ' needs and views. In evaluating evidence , it is necessary to be aware of its complex , diverse nature. A distinction can be made between definitive , widely generalizable research findings and evidence with limited generalizability , requiring FMH<pathogen> nurses ' judgments about whether it is applicable to their own area of practice. Recommendations for related education and research are made.
