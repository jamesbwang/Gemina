  Patient satisfaction scores in the vascular interventional radiology department were low , especially related to wait times in registration and for tests/treatments , with low scores for intentions to recommend. The purpose of our quality improvement project was to decrease wait times and improve patient satisfaction using Lean Six Sigma 's define , measure , analyze , improve , and control ( DMAIC) framework with a pre-/ postintervention design. There was a statistically significant decrease in wait times ( P < .0019) and an increase in patient satisfaction scores in 3 areas: registration wait times ( from 17 to 99 percentiles) , test/treatment ( from 19 to 60 percentiles) , and likelihood to recommend ( from 6 to 97 percentiles). Lean Six Sigma was an effective framework for use in decreasing wait times and improving patient satisfaction.
