  Targeted Regulation of Abortion<disease> Providers ( TRAP) laws impose extensive and sometimes costly requirements on abortion<disease> providers and facilities , potentially leading to barriers to care. Understanding the impact of these laws is important given their prevalence in the USA , but no review to date has summarised the available evidence. We conducted a systematic review of literature on TRAP laws and their impact on abortion<disease> trends and women 's health. We searched MEDLINE , PubMed and EconLit for original , quantitative studies where the exposure was at least one TRAP policy and the outcome was abortion<disease> and/or any women 's physical or mental health outcome. Six articles met our inclusion criteria. The most common outcome was population-level abortion<disease> trends; studies also assessed the effect of TRAP laws on gestational age at presentation and measures of self-perceived burden. While certain TRAP laws ( eg , admitting privilege requirements) appeared to have an effect on abortion<disease> outcomes , the impact of other laws- or combinations of laws- was unclear , due in part to heterogeneity between studies with respect to study design , geography , and exposure definition. TRAP laws may have an impact on the experience of obtaining an abortion<disease> in the USA. However , our review revealed a paucity of empirical research on their population and individual-level impact , as well as some disagreement about the effect of different TRAP laws on subsequent abortion<disease> outcomes. Future research should prioritise the specific TRAP laws that may have a uniquely strong effect on state-level abortion<disease> rates and other outcomes.
