  The crystal structure of the Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O2-sensitive C19G ( NiFe)- hydrogenase-1 variant shows that the mutation results in a novel FeS cluster , proximal to the Ni-Fe active site. While the proximal cluster of the native O2-tolerant enzyme can transfer two electrons to that site , EPR spectroscopy shows that the modified cluster can transfer only one electron , this shortfall coinciding with O2 sensitivity. Computational studies on electron transfer help to explain how the structural and redox properties of the novel FeS cluster modulate the observed phenotype.
