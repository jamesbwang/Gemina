  To examine the effects of poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1) inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol ( IQ) on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH) oxidase-derived oxidative stress in diabetic retina. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with IQ. The NADPH oxidase enzyme activity was determined by luminometer. Expression of gp Treatment of retinal MÃ¼ller cells with H PARP-1 inhibition by IQ protects diabetic retina from NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress. Thus , inhibition of PARP-1 could have potential therapeutic value in preventing the development of diabetic retinopathy.
