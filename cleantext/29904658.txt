  A laboratory setup is developed to examine the characteristics of convective drying of a moist potato sample. The thickness effect ( 5 , 10 and 15 mm) of product on heat and mass transfer during potato drying was presented. Potato samples were dried at temperature of 51 Â°C and air velocity of 1 m s
