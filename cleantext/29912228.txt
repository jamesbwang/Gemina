  The multidisciplinary standardized interventions to educate and support patients with congenital heart disease ( CHD) are described as `` Transition Clinic '' ( TC). TC represents a key element to deliver care for patients during the transition from childhood to adulthood. So far , there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the impact of TC models on the improvement of health perception in adolescent patients with CHD ( CHD-specific TC model). For this reason , the aim of this study is assess the impact of the TC model on CHD adolescent patients ' health perception outcomes. This study has a quasi-experimental design. Quality of life , satisfaction and health perception were assessed in T0 and after 1 year from enrollment ( T1). During the follow-up period , the patients enrolled ( aged 14 to 21 years) were involved in the CHD-specific TC model. The results are referred to the first 100 patients enrolled ( mean age 14.79 Â± 1.85 years; 60 % male) , as they have already completed the follow-up. The overall study is currently ongoing. According to Warnes ' classification , 29 % of patients had simple heart defects , 46 % showed moderate complexity , and 25 % showed severe complexity. The comparison between T0 and T1 showed statistically significant improvement in T1 regarding pain/discomfort , anxiety/depression and perception of health status ( EQ-5D) , general satisfaction and quality of life ( LAS QoL). The preliminary results showed in this study are encouraging , and confirm the need to create a multidisciplinary standardized intervention of education and support to deliver care for adolescent patients with CHD.
