  Recurrent acute pancreatitis<disease> ( RAP) is a clinically significant problem globally. The etiology remains unclear in approximately 10 % to 15 % of patients despite a thorough workup. Data on natural history and efficacy of treatments are limited. We aimed to establish criteria for diagnosis , evaluate the causative factors , and arrive at a consensus on the appropriate workup and management of patients with RAP. The organizing committee was formed , and a set of questions was developed based on the current evidence , controversies , and topics that needed further research. After a vetting process , these topics were assigned to a group of experts from around the world with special interest in RAP. Data were presented as part of a workshop on RAP organized as a part of the annual meeting of the America Pancreatic Association. Pretest and Posttest questions were administered , and the responses were tabulated by the current Grades of Recommendation Assessment , Development and Evaluation system. The consensus guidelines were established in the format of a diagnostic algorithm. Several deficiencies were identified with respect to data on etiology , treatment efficacies , and areas that need immediate research.
