  This study describes infection of intestinal smooth muscle in fringelip mullets Crenimugil crenilabis with Kudoa crenimugilis n. sp.. Of 30 individuals sampled from the Red Sea off Saudi Arabia , 6 ( 20 %) were infected. Ovoid plasmodia ( 279-412 × 157-295 µm) in the smooth muscle of the intestine were packed with only mature myxospores with 4 valves. Specifically , light and transmission electron microscopy revealed quadrate myxospores with 4 equal , rounded , spore valves uniting at thin delicate suture lines. The mature myxospores were 8 ( 7-9) µm long , 5.2 ( 5-6) µm thick and 7.8 ( 7-8) µm wide. The 4 polar capsules were equal-sized , elliptical to ovoid , and measured 5 ( 4-5) µm long and 2 ( 1.5-3) µm wide , possessing 2 filament coils. The sporoplasm was uninucleated and composed of a primary cell enveloping a secondary cell. The parasite had a significant histopathological impact since the developing plasmodia replaced normal muscle tissue and was associated with the myolysis of local muscle fibres and the inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. The partial sequences of the 18S and 28S rDNA showed that K. crenimugilis n. sp. has the highest level of nucleotide similarity with K. ciliatae ( 98.46 and 94.11 % , respectively) and K. cookii ( 97.51 and 92.11 % , respectively) , both of which have previously been reported from the intestines of their host fish. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that K. crenimugilis consistently clustered with these other 2 intestinal Kudoa species in a well-supported subclade , confirming the evaluative association between Kudoa species infecting the same organs.
