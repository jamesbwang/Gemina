  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients exhibit attenuated cardiovascular responses to exercise. The underlying mechanisms that are potentially contributing to these impairments are not fully understood. Therefore , we sought to test the hypothesis that PD patients exhibit blunted cardiovascular responses to isolated muscle metaboreflex activation following exercise. For this , mean blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were measured using finger photoplethysmography and modelflow method , in 11 PD patients ( 66 ± 2 yrs; ( Hohen and Yahr: 2 ± 1 a.u. and diagnose time: 7 ± 1 yrs) and nine age-matched controls ( 66 ± 3 yrs). Measurements were obtained at rest , during isometric handgrip exercise performed at 40 % maximal voluntary contraction and during post-exercise ischemia. Also , a cold pressor test was assessed to confirm that blunted cardiovascular responses were specific to exercise and not representative of generalized sympathetic responsiveness. Changes in mean blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were attenuated in PD patients during handgrip ( PD: ∆ 25 ± 2 mmHg vs. controls: ∆ 31 ± 3 mmHg; P < 0.05) , and these group differences remained during post-exercise ischemia ( ∆ 17 ± 1 mmHg vs. ∆ 26 ± 1 mmHg , respectively; P < 0.01). Additionally , changes in total peripheral resistance were attenuated during exercise and post-exercise ischemia , indicating blunted reflex vasoconstriction in PD patients. Responses to cold pressor test did not differ between groups , suggesting no group differences in generalized sympathetic responsiveness. Our results support the concept that attenuated cardiovascular responses to exercise observed in PD patients are , at least in part , explained by an altered skeletal muscle metaboreflex.
