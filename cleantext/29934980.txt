  Various scoring approaches for Multiple True-False ( MTF) items exist. This study aimed at comparing scoring results obtained with different scoring approaches and to assess the effect of item cues on each scoring approaches ' result. Different scoring approaches ( MTF , Count-2 , Count-3 , `` Vorkauf-Method , '' PS Average scoring results per item highly differed between the scoring approaches and ranged from 0.46 ( MR) to 0.92 ( Dichotomized MTF). Presence of cues leads to significantly higher scoring in case of all scoring approaches ( P < .001; +0.14 on average). However , effect of cues differed amongst scoring approaches and ranged from +0.04 ( Dichotomized MTF) to +0.20 ( MR). Scoring of MTF items is complex. The data presented in this manuscript may help educators make informed choices about scoring algorithms.
