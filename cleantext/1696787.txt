  We present a 42-year-old man with a BMI of 32 , who was referred because of proteinuria<symptom> and decreased renal function. We were impressed by his markedly muscular physique. A renal biopsy was performed , which showed focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ( FSGS). Is this patient merely an obese person with FSGS or is something else going on here? We performed extensive clinical and laboratory examinations , genetic testing , and anthropometric data monitoring over time. We transferred our methodology for routine FSGS mutation screening ( Sanger sequencing) to the Ion Torrent PGM platform with a new custom-targeted NGS gene panel ( Ion Ampliseq FSGS panel) and tested the performance of the system in two cohorts of patients with FSGS. We discuss FSGS in bodybuilders , including possible mechanisms , and review the literature.
