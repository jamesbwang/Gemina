  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication , along with repetitive and restrictive patterns of behaviors or interests. Normal brain development is crucial to behavior and cognition in adulthood. Abnormal brain development , such as synaptic and myelin dysfunction , is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. Microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins ( MAPs) are important in regulating the processes of brain development , including neuron production and synaptic formation , as well as myelination. Increasing evidence suggests that the level of MAPs are changed in autistic patients and mouse models of ASD. Here , we discuss the roles of MAPs.
