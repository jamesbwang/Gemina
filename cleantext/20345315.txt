  Aggregation during diapause is a common phenomenon in arthropods that nevertheless remains poorly understood. The most commonly claimed benefit is that survival is higher in aggregations but animal aggregations could also be driven by sexual selection. In this perspective , we investigated whether aggregations in insects could be part of their mating system. We studied the overwintering aggregations of the ladybird Hippodamia undecimnotata ( Schneider) , an aphidophagous species from Southern and Eastern<disease> Europe as well as Asia. We collected ladybirds at three aggregation sites in Southwest France , during two overwintering periods ( 2013-2014 and 2014-2015). We checked their reproductive status by counting the viable sperm cells in the sperm storage organs of both males and females , and by assessing the ovarian status of females. We also investigated if mating behaviour occurred in these aggregations. We found that males have a high quantity of viable sperm cells ( 70-95 %) in their reproductive organs throughout the overwintering periods. In contrast , although most females ( 85-95 %) had empty spermatheca at the onset of the aggregations in autumn , the majority ( 65-91 %) had numerous viable sperm in their spermatheca at the time of dispersal from the aggregation in early spring. Furthermore , frequent copulations were observed towards the end of the overwintering period , few weeks before dispersal. These results suggest that finding sexual mates may have been involved in overwintering aggregations in H. undecimnotata.
