  Derangement of cellular differentiation because of mutation or inappropriate expression of specific genes is a common feature in tumors. Here , we show that the expression of ZNF281 , a zinc finger factor involved in several cellular processes , decreases during terminal differentiation of murine cortical neurons and in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma ( NB) cells. The ectopic expression of ZNF281 inhibits the neuronal differentiation of murine cortical neurons and NB cells , whereas its silencing causes the opposite effect. Furthermore , TAp73 inhibits the expression of ZNF281 through miR34a. Conversely , MYCN promotes the expression of ZNF281 at least in part by inhibiting miR34a. These findings imply a functional network that includes p73 , MYCN , and ZNF281 in NB cells , where ZNF281 acts by negatively affecting neuronal differentiation. Array analysis of NB cells silenced for ZNF281 expression identified GDNF and NRP2 as two transcriptional targets inhibited by ZNF281. Binding of ZNF281 to the promoters of these genes suggests a direct mechanism of repression. Bioinformatic analysis of NB datasets indicates that ZNF281 expression is higher in aggressive , undifferentiated stage 4 than in localized stage 1 tumors supporting a central role of ZNF281 in affecting the differentiation of NB. Furthermore , patients with NB with high expression of ZNF281 have a poor clinical outcome compared with low-expressors. These observations suggest that ZNF281 is a controller of neuronal differentiation that should be evaluated as a prognostic marker in NB.
