  Although idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) patients experience a worse survival compared with chronic hypersensitivity<disease> pneumonitis<disease> ( CHP) , organic dust exposure is a known risk factor for both IPF and CHP. We divided patients diagnosed with IPF , based on their exposure to moulds/birds ( absent: group A; present: group B). We retrospectively compared pulmonary function and survival between groups A and B , and a separate CHP cohort ( group C). A total of 293 patients were included ( group A: n = 171 , group B: n = 73 , group C: n = 49). Demographics and baseline pulmonary function did not differ between groups A and B , but significant differences were seen between groups B and C. Median survival of group B was 84 months , which was longer than group A ( 43 months , P = 0.002) , but lower than group C ( 157 months , P = 0.04) , in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Antifibrotic treatment resulted in a better outcome in group A ( hazard ratio ( HR): 0.44) and group B ( HR: 0.12) without interaction between exposure and antifibrotic use ( P = 0.20). Forced vital capacity ( FVC) decline was not associated with mould/bird exposure in this cohort. Group B patients experienced a better outcome compared with ( non-exposed) IPF patients , although worse compared with CHP patients. Antifibrotic treatment in group B resulted in a similar beneficial effect compared with group A. Further research is needed to ascertain the diagnostic designation in this exposed usual interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( UIP) patient group without other CHP features.
