  The radiation of symbiotic copepods ( Crustacea<pathogen> Copepoda) living in association with stony corals ( Cnidaria: Scleractinia) is considered host-specific and linked to the phylogenetic diversification of their hosts. However , symbiotic copepods are poorly investigated , occurrence records are mostly anecdotal , and no explicit analysis exists regarding their relationship with the hosts. Here , we analysed the occurrence of symbiotic copepods on different co-occurring and phylogenetically closely related scleractinian corals. We used an innovative approach of DNA extraction from single microscopic specimens that preserves the shape of the organisms for integrative morphological studies. The rationale of the study involved: ( i) sampling of mushroom corals ( Fungiidae) belonging to 13 species and eight genera on different reefs along the Saudi coastline in the Red Sea , ( ii) extraction of all the associated copepods , ( iii) morphological screening and identification of copepod species , ( iv) use of DNA taxonomy on mitochondrial and nuclear markers to determine species boundaries for morphologically unknown copepod species , ( v) reconstruction of phylogenies to understand their evolutionary relationships , and ( vi) analysis of the ecological drivers of the occurrence , diversity and host specificity of the copepods. The seven species of coral-associated copepods , all new to science , did not show any statistically significant evidence of host-specificity or other pattern of ecological association. We thus suggest that , contrary to most assumptions and previous anecdotal evidence on this coral-copepod host-symbiont system , the association between copepods and their host corals is rather labile , not strict , and not phylogenetically constrained , changing our perception on evolutionary patterns and processes in symbiotic copepods.
