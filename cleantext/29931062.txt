  Ricin<disease> and abrin are toxic ribosome-inactivating proteins found in plants. Exposure to these toxins can be detected using the biomarkers ricinine and abrine , which are present in the same plant sources as the toxins. The concentration of the biomarkers in urine and blood will be dependent upon the purification of abrin or ricin<disease> , the route of exposure , and the length of time between exposure and sample collection. Here , we present the first diagnostic assay for the simultaneous quantification of both ricinine and abrine in blood matrices. Furthermore , this is the first-ever method for the detection of abrine in blood products. Samples were processed by isotope-dilution , solid-phase extraction , protein precipitation and quantification by HPLC-MS-MS. This analytical method detects abrine from 5.00 to 500 ng/mL and ricinine from 0.300 to 300 ng/mL with coefficients of determination of 0.996 ± 0.003 and 0.998 ± 0.002 ( n = 22) , respectively. Quality control material accuracy was determined to have < 10 % relative error , and precision was within 19 % relative standard deviation. The assay 's time-to-first result is three hours including sample preparation. Furthermore , the method was applied for the quantification of ricinine in the blood of a patient who had intentionally ingested castor beans to demonstrate the test was fit-for-purpose. This assay was designed to support the diagnosis of ricin<disease> and abrin exposures in public health investigations.
