  As local therapies improve , contralateral breast cancer ( CBC) risk for women with ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) may exceed the risk of a second ipsilateral breast cancer. We sought to determine whether estrogen-receptor ( ER) status influenced CBC risk. We identified women aged 40-79 with DCIS diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 using the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database. We used multivariable competing risk regression to examine predictors of time from index DCIS to CBC ( invasive or in situ). Multivariable competing risk regression found ER status to be a highly significant predictor of CBC. The 10-year cumulative incidence was estimated to be 5.3 % ( 95 % CI 4.8-5.8 %) among ER positive ( ER +) cases and 3.3 % ( 95 % CI 2.6-4.0 %) among ER negative ( ER-). This finding suggests that ER + DCIS may represent a field effect that confers increased propensity for developing cancer across breast tissue , regardless of laterality. In contrast , ER- DCIS may represent an isolated local event. Given that the majority of DCIS is ER + , and only a minority of DCIS patients receive hormonal therapy , consideration of ER status may influence treatment and surveillance approaches.
