  Dopamine ( DA) , a crucial neurotransmitter , not only functions in the central nervous system but also plays important roles in the modulation of inflammation<symptom>. Several studies suggest that DA might suppress the inflammatory response both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study , the potential effects of DA in a mouse model with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)/ d-galactosamine ( D-Gal)- induced acute liver injury were investigated. The results show that DA-treated LPS/D-Gal-exposed mice had reduced incidence of histologic lesions<symptom> , lower plasma aminotransferases and improved the survival rates compared to LPS/D-Gal-exposed mice. Treatment with DA also suppressed LPS/D-Gal-induced production of TNF-Î± , phosphorylation of c-jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK) , cleavage of caspase-3 , up-regulation of hepatic caspase-3 , caspase-8 , and caspase-9 activities and reduced the count of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes. These data indicate that DA attenuated LPS/D-Gal-induced fulminant liver injury in mice , which implies that DA might have value for the prevention of inflammatory liver disease.
