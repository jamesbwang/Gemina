  As a fine fuel , forest<disease> litter plays an important role in fire danger rating systems , so forest<disease> litter moisture data are necessary and meaningful for fire risk management and prevention. An optical remote sensing technique can provide continuous and regional data for litter moisture estimates , but such an approach is restricted in separating the background reflectance of the forest<disease> floor from pixel reflectance because the litter moisture information is included only in background reflectance while pixel reflectance in the forest<disease> area consists of both canopy reflectance and background reflectance. Therefore , we present a geometrical-optical model to estimate forest<disease> litter moisture by separating contributions of background reflectance from the remote sensing image and use a statistical model to estimate the forest<disease> litter moisture content based on the calculated background reflectance. The results show that the model had an R
