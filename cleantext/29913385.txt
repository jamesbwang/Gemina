  Biochar has been reported to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer ( DIET) in co-cultures between Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens , a model defined co-culture system. In this study , the biochar derived from the activated sludge with different pyrolysis temperature was added to the co-cultures , the ethanol metabolism rates ( Re) and succinate production rates ( Rs) of co-culture with biochar-800 were 1.05- and 1.42-fold higher than that without addition. The results suggested that the conductivity of the biochar did not correlate with the facilitating effect of the biochar on the co-culture metabolism. Furthermore , the surface functional group and surface charge of biochar may also influence the facilitating effect on the interspecies electron transfer between the two Geobacter cells. Based on these results , it supported that the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging process of the surface functional groups might play a major role in facilitating the direct electron transfer process by the biochar derived from activated sludge here. This study could shed light on the better understanding of the bacteria-biochar electron transfer system and the potential utilization of the biochar in the environmental wastewater treatments.
