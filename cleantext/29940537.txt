  Lymphangiogenesis is critical for metastasis of a variety of cancers , including breast cancer. CPT1A ( carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) has been reported to play a critical role in breast cancer progress. However , the molecular mechanism remains elusive. In order to investigate the role of CPT1A in HDLEC cells , short hairpin RNA approach was utilized to knock down the CPT1A gene expression. We employed transwell and lymphatic vessel formation assay to examine invasion and lymphangiogenesis of HDLEC ( Human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells). RT-qPCR and westernblot analyses were used to determine genes expression in HDLEC and breast cancer cells. Finally , we determined the relative rate of acetyl-CoA/CoA in shNC and shCPT1A HDLEC cells by LC-MS approach. Knockdown of CPT1A in breast cancer cells ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) abolished invasion and lymphangiogenesis of HDLEC cells. Mechanistically , CPT1A depletion suppressed the expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly , CPT1A knockdown in HDLEC cells exhibited attenuated expression of lymphangiogenic markers ( podoplanin , VEGFR-3 , VEGF-C , VEGF-D and PROX-1). Consistently , CPT1A- null HDLEC cells displayed compromised invasion and lymphangiogenesis compared with negative control. Further investigation revealed that CPT1A regulated VEGFR3 via acetyl-CoA mediated H3K9ac , which could be abrogated by supplement of acetate. In present study , we revealed the mechanism by which CPT1A regulates breast cancer-associated invasion and lymphangiogenesis. Our findings provide insights into CPT1A- promoted breast tumor metastasis and provide rationale for understanding breast cancer metastasis.
