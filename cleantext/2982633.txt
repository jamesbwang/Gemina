  The basal ganglia are an evolutionarily old group of structures , with gross organization conserved across species. Despite this conservation , there is evidence suggesting that anatomical organization of a key output nucleus of the basal ganglia , the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNpr) , diverges across species. Nevertheless , there are relatively few comparative studies examining the impact of manipulations of SNpr across species. Here , we evaluated the role of SNpr in a highly conserved behavior: prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response ( PPI). We performed parallel experiments in both rats and rhesus macaques using intracranial microinfusions of GABA
