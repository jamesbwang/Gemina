  Although telephone quitlines are effective for helping smokeless tobacco ( ST) users quit , ST users are underrepresented among quitline participants. After ClearWay Minnesota implemented multiple changes to its quitline service ( QUITPLAN Â® Services) , utilization increased dramatically , including by ST users. We examined data from Minnesota and Wisconsin to determine whether these changes were unique to Minnesota. Four years of quitline registration data were analyzed for both states. A significant increase in enrollees reporting any ST use was seen in Minnesota after changes were made to services; no change was seen in Wisconsin. A 2-week starter kit of nicotine replacement therapy and the ability to register for services online were popular among Minnesotans reporting ST use. This study suggests that quitline services can be designed to increase participation by ST users.
