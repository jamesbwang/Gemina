  The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 ( MCHR1) has become an important pharmacological target , since it may be involved in various diseases , such as diabetes , insulin resistance , and obesity. Hence , a suitable positron emission tomography radiotracer for the in vivo assessment of the MCHR1 pharmacology is imperative. The current paper contrasts the extensive in vitro , in vivo , and ex vivo assessments of the radiotracers ( Kinetic real-time cell-binding studies with ( ( Both radiotracers demonstrate appropriate imaging properties for the MCHR1. However , the pronounced metabolic stability as well as superior selectivity and affinity of (
