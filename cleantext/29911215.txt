  Although there have been extensive speculation regarding the applicability of doped silicon nanocrystals ( Si NCs) in optoelectronic technologies , a quantitative analysis on the photophysical workings of introduced free carriers remains elusive. Here , we present a comprehensive study on the photophysics of âˆ¼ 7.5 nm heavily phosphorous-doped Si NCs , using a combination of spectroscopic techniques. We correlate the carrier dynamics with the location of the free carriers- which we tune from NC core to surface depending on the state of oxidation. The strength of the Coulomb interactions between the photoexcited electron-hole pairs and the doping-induced free carriers depends on ( 1) the concentration of free carriers , ( 2) the location of these carriers , and ( 3) the diameter of the NCs. In contrast to prior studies , the photoexcited carrier dynamics in these n-type doped Si NCs are dominated by strong Coulomb interactions with doping-induced free electrons , characterized by a negative trion lifetime of around 9 ns. While radiative recombination in doped direct bandgap NCs can often still compete with trion recombination ( allowing emission to be present) , emission in our doped Si NCs is completely quenched due to the relatively slow radiative recombination in these indirect bandgap NCs. Furthermore , multi-exciton interaction times are slightly shortened compared to those of intrinsic Si NCs , which we attribute to an increased number of free electrons , enhancing the oscillator strength of Auger recombination. These results constitute a framework for the optimization of doped Si NC synthesis techniques and device engineering directions for future doped-Si NC-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.
