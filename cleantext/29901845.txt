  A novel kind of electron-deficient bis ( heterotetracenes) namely perylenotetrathiophenediimides ( PTTIs) involving double S-hetero ( 5) helicene diimides , is developed by a fourfold thienannulation route via ortho-functionalization of perylene diimides ( PDIs). PTTIs exhibit significantly red-shifted absorption capacity with lowest-energy transition maxima beyond 700 nm and narrowed HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Through delicately tuning the side-chain substitution , the distorted propeller-like framework could self-assemble into unprecedented 1D helical π-stacking structures with short π-π contacts and rich nonbonding interactions from alternating arrangements of P/M enantiomeric couples or tetrads.
