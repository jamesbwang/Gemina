  Recent studies on face processing and its hemispheric lateralization suggest that inconsistencies in earlier findings might be partially explained by sex differences , as findings from event-related potential studies indicated a more asymmetric functioning of the visual cortex during face encoding in men , whereas women seemed to display a more bilateral activation pattern. The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of sex differences in hemispheric specialization during face recognition. Fifty-four healthy participants ( 27 females and 27 males) engaged in a familiarity decision task in which famous and unfamiliar faces were presented in a lateralized tachistoscopic fashion with unilateral und bilateral presentation modes and measurement of event-related potentials and behavioral responses. Results showed a clear N170 component for males and females in all experimental conditions. No hemispheric differences of the N170 were observed in the bilateral condition and both groups showed larger right-hemispheric than left-hemispheric N170 amplitudes in the left visual field condition. In the right visual field condition , however , only female participants showed significantly larger left-hemispheric compared to right-hemispheric N170 amplitudes , whereas male participants did not show such a modulation. The effect corresponds to a greater responsivity of left-hemispheric processes underlying the N170 component in female participants. Further analyses revealed N170 differences in the left and right hemisphere for females only , when stimuli were presented unilaterally. In contrast , this modulation of N170 amplitudes was only observed in the left hemisphere in males. The results suggest a stronger hemispheric lateralization in men than in women during face processing.
