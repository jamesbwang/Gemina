  Neutrophil‑to‑lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) is commonly considered a useful prognostic index for many cardiovascular diseases; however , it has limited sensitivity and specificity. Factors associated with elevated NLR may aid in the prediction of prognosis with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) in combination with NLR. The present study sought to identify decisive factors associated with NLR in HF patients and investigate their association with elevated NLR. The gene expression profile for blood samples from 197 individuals with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , with corresponding hematological parameters and clinical data were obtained from the public database , GSE77343. Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were identified , and Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The protein‑protein interaction network was constructed with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes along with Cytoscape. Receiver operating characteristic curves for predictive power , sensitivity and specificity were constructed. The present study identified specific associated DEGs by using Pearson linear correlation and logistic regression analysis. A mean NLR of 3.96 was determined as the cutoff value in the analysis. In total , 31 genes were initially identified as DEGs associated with elevated NLR. They were mainly enriched in neutrophil activation and neutrophil mediated immunity , in fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis , and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Three focused DEGs , solute carrier family 22 member 4 ( SLC22A4) , interleukin‑1 receptor 2 ( IL1R2) and vanin 3 ( VNN3) , were finally revealed to be independently associated with elevated NLR in CHF patients. The present study demonstrated that the three genes SLC22A4 , IL1R2 and VNN3 may be independently associated with elevated NLR in CHF patients as potential decisive factors of NLR.
