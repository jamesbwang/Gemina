  Cystoid macular edema<symptom> ( CME) is a rare complication of the paclitaxel. However , the pathophysiology was unknown. A 60-year-old female presented with bilateral blurred vision due to cystoid macular edema<symptom> after taking 12-course paclitaxel for her breast cancer. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , fluorescein angiography ( FAG) , indocyanine green angiography ( ICGA) , electroretinogram ( ERG) and electrooculogram ( EOG) were performed. Paclitaxel-induced macular edema<symptom>. Paclitaxel was discontinued and supportive treatment with pentoxifylline was given. The OCT showed bilateral cystoid macular edema<symptom>. Impaired filling of choriocapillaries was noted on the ICGA; while EOG revealed decreased Arden ratio. The visual acuity , cystoid macular edema<symptom> and decreased Arden ratio improved slowly over six months. Paclitaxel rarely causes cystoid macular edema<symptom>. The damage of choriocapillaries and retinal pigment epithelium might be the underlying cause. Immediate discontinuation of the drug helps visual recovery.
