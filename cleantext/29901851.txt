  Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common and debilitating condition that lacks an effective therapy. In this study , the effects of α-cedrene are tested , a natural ligand of mouse olfactory receptor 23 ( MOR23) whose ectopic function regulating myogenesis on skeletal muscle growth was reported recently. α-Cedrene not only stimulated hypertrophy but also attenuated free fatty acid-induced atrophy of cultured skeletal myotubes , as evidenced by an increased myotube diameter , fusion index , and total cellular protein content. These hypertrophic and antiatrophic properties of α-cedrene in cultured myotubes were confirmed in corresponding mouse models. The skeletal muscle mass , total muscle protein content , average cross-sectional area of myofibers , and muscle strength were significantly greater in α-cedrene-treated mice compared with untreated animals during either a regular chow diet or high-fat diet. Receptor knockdown experiments using RNA interference in cultured skeletal myotubes revealed that the hypertrophic and antiatrophic properties of α-cedrene may be mediated by MOR23. Furthermore , α-cedrene induced the expression of MOR23 and enhanced its downstream cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP)- protein kinase A ( PKA)- cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein ( CREB) signaling in the skeletal muscle of mice fed chow or high-fat diet. α-Cedrene is a promising agent that may be applied to enhance the mass and strength of skeletal muscle.
