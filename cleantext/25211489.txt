  Prediction has been proposed to be a fundamental neurocognitive mechanism. However , its role in language comprehension is currently under debate. In this magnetoencephalography study we aimed to find evidence of word-form phonological pre-activation and to characterize the oscillatory mechanisms supporting this. Participants were presented firstly with a picture of an object , and then , after a delay ( fixed or variable) , they heard the corresponding word. Target words could contain a phoneme substitution , and participants ' task was to detect mispronunciations. Word-initial phonemes were either fricatives or plosives , generating two experimental conditions ( expect-fricative and expect-plosive). In the pre-word interval , significant differences ( Î± = 0.05) emerged between conditions both for fixed and variable delays. Source reconstruction of this effect showed a brain-wide network involving several frequency bands , including bilateral superior temporal areas commonly associated with phonological processing , in a theta range. These results show that phonological representations supported by the theta band may be active before word onset , even under temporal uncertainty. However , in the evoked response just prior to the word , differences between conditions were apparent under variable- but not fixed-delays. This suggests that additional top-down mechanisms sensitive to phonological form may be recruited when there is uncertainty in the signal.
