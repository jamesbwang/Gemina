  Inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1α ( IRE1α) is the most prominent and evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) membrane protein. This transduces the signal of misfolded protein accumulation in the ER , named as ER stress , to the nucleus as `` unfolded protein response ( UPR). '' The ER stress-mediated IRE1α signaling pathway arbitrates the yin and yang of cell life. IRE1α has been implicated in several physiological as well as pathological conditions , including immune disorders. Autoimmune diseases are caused by abnormal immune responses that develop due to genetic mutations and several environmental factors , including infections and chemicals. These factors dysregulate the cell immune reactions , such as cytokine secretion , antigen presentation , and autoantigen generation. However , the mechanisms involved , in which these factors induce the onset of autoimmune diseases , are remaining unknown. Considering that these environmental factors also induce the UPR , which is expected to have significant role in secretory cells and immune cells. The role of the major UPR molecule , IRE1α , in causing immune responses is well identified , but its role in inducing autoimmunity and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has not been clearly elucidated. Hence , a better understanding of the role of IRE1α and its regulatory mechanisms in causing autoimmune diseases could help to identify and develop the appropriate therapeutic strategies. In this review , we mainly center the discussion on the molecular mechanisms of IRE1α in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.
