  Soft tissue sarcomas<disease> ( STS) have minimal expression of PD-L1 , a biomarker for PD-1 therapy efficacy. Radiotherapy ( RT) has been shown to increase PD-L1 expression pre-clinically. We examined the expression of PD-L1 , pre- and post-RT , in 46 Stage II-III STS patients treated with pre-operative RT ( 50-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions) followed by resection. Five additional patients who did not receive RT were utilized as controls. PD-L1 expression on biopsy and resection samples was evaluated by immunochemistry using the anti PD-L1 monoclonal antibody ( E1L3 N clone; Cell Signaling). Greater than 1 % membranous staining was considered positive PD-L1 expression. Changes in PD-L1 expression were analyzed via the Fisher exact test. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to correlate PD-L1 expression to distant metastases ( DM) rate. The majority of STS were T2b ( 87.0 %) , high-grade ( 80.4 %) , undifferentiated pleomorphic histology ( 71.7 %) , and originated from the extremities ( 84.6 %). Zero patients demonstrated PD-L1 tumor expression pre-RT. Post-RT , 5 patients ( 10.9 %) demonstrated PD-L1 tumor expression ( p = 0.056). Tumor associated macrophages ( TAM) expression of PD-L1 increased after RT: 15.2 % to 45.7 % ( p = 0.003). Samples from controls demonstrated no baseline ( 0 %) or change in tumor PD-L1 expression. Freedom from DM was lower for patients with PD-L1 TAM expression post-RT ( 3 years: 49.7 % vs. 87.8 % , log-rank p = 0.006); TAM PD-L1 positivity remained an independent predictor for DM on multivariate analyses ( Hazard ratio- 0.16 , 95 % confidence interval: 0.034-0.721 , p = 0.042). PD-L1 expression on human STS tumor and TAM appears to elevate after pre-operative RT.. Expression of PD-L1 on TAM after RT was associated with a higher rate of DM.
