  Myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSC) play a pivotal role in tumor immune evasion and MDSC levels increased in patients with cancer. Studies confirmed the associations between MDSC and various cytokines in the peripheral blood. However , little is known about the association between parenchymal MDSC subsets and cytokines , or the mechanism drawing MDSC into tumor parenchyma. This study was to analyze the correlation between MDSC subsets and CCL2 level in lung cancer model. G-MDSC and M-MDSC from the blood and parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blot in the lung tumor model. CCL2 was detected by ELISA assay , real-time PCR , western blot and flow cytometry. Furthermore , the therapeutic effects of combination treatment combining CCL2 antagonist and anti-PD1 antibody were assessed. Results showed that MDSC subsets had a positive correlation with CCL2 , suggesting CCL2 may attract MDSC into the parenchyma. Gene and protein expression of CCL2 , as well as the CCL2 surface expression significantly increased in blood and tumor of tumor-bearing mice. Anti-CCL2 treatment decreased G-MDSC and M-MDSC in the periphery and tumor through inhibiting the protein expression of arginase 1 and iNOS. In addition , combination therapy enhanced CD4
