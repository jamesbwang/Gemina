  Transposition of teeth- mutual exchange of the teeth position in the dental arch , it 's a rare anomaly of the dentoalveolar apparatus. Most often in the transposition process the upper canines are involved in combination with the first premolars. Anomaly is mainly caused by an incorrect location of the teeth germs. Full correction is optimal in the treatment of transposition in terms of function and aesthetics , but in most cases , the movement of these teeth in their physiological position is impossible. Aim- to define and argue the tactics of the orthodontist in the treatment of patients with teeth transposition. The algorithm for curation of patients with teeth transposition consisted of several blocks: the establishment of etiologic factors , clinical and additional examination methods , planning and making treatment tactics , the stages of active treatment and management of the patient in the retention period. Among additional methods of examination were used: orthopantomography , 3D computer tomography , photometry , anthropometry. For a visual demonstration of orthodontic treatment , an curation algorithm of two patients with a teeth transposition was described. The choice of treatment options depended on the location and type of transposition ( full or partial) , the age of the patient , the condition of the periodontal tissue , the size of the teeth and their roots , the degree of tooth dislocation and root inclination , the type of occlusion , the bone thickness in the region of alveolar process , the level of cooperation between the patient and the doctor. Knowledge of the treatment tactics of patients with teeth transposition allows the orthodontist to normalize the individual teeth position , restore function and aesthetics in an optimal time. After our patient 's treatment , positive esthetic , morphological and functional results were achieved.
