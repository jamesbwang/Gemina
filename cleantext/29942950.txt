  It is highly desired to design and develop low-cost and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries ( ZABs). In this communication , we report that Fe-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on nickel foam ( Fe0.33-CoP/ NF) act as a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. We further demonstrate the use of Fe0.33-CoP/ NF as the cathode to construct rechargeable ZABs with superior performance to that of the CoP/NF counterpart. In concentrated alkaline electrolytes , such ZABs exhibit a higher power density of 63 mW cm-2 than that of CoP/NF ( 23 mW cm-2) with a long cycle life ( up to 200 h).
