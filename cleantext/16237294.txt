  Calciphylaxis is a poorly understood condition involving vascular calcification and thrombosis that leads to skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom>. Unfortunately , a noninvasive definitive test for calciphylaxis does not currently exist , and diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms and risk factors. Imaging can help guide diagnosis of this rare disorder. We present a pathology-proven case of calciphylaxis and the corresponding imaging findings seen on bone scintigraphy.
