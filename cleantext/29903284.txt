  To explore lycopene 's protective effect on H_2O_2 induced oxidative damage of L02 cells and its mechanism. L02 cells were cultured by H_2O_2 to build the model of cellular oxidative damage. Different dose of lycopene was used to pretreat the cells , and cell survival rate was detected to verify the appropriate concentration. Then cellular ROS level , activity of cellular SOD and GSH-Px , cellular MDA content , and activity of ALT , AST and LDH in the culture medium were detected to observe lycopene 's effect on cellular oxidant damage. Finally , to observe lycopene 's activating effect on nuclear-translocation of Nrf2 , L02 cells ' nuclear protein was extracted to detect Nrf2 protein content , and also , mRNA expression level of Nrf2 target genes HO-1 and NQO1 was assayed to verify this mechanism. Pretreatment of 10 Î¼mol/Llycopene raised cellular viability of L02 cells on H_2O_2 culturing condition , reduced cellular ROS , enhanced enzymatic activity of cellular SOD and GSH-Px , reduced cellular MDA content , and depressed the activity of ALT , AST and LDH in culture medium. Lycopene also increased nuclear Nrf2 protein content and enhanced the expression of its target genes HO-1 and NQO1. Lycopene could protect L02 cells from H_2O_2 induced oxidative damage , probably by promoting nuclear-translocation of Nrf2 and activating expression of its target antioxidant genes.
