  Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> may cause vaginal infections in women. The aim of this study was to compare the antifungal effect of Lawsonia inermis with that of clotrimazole on rats. A total of 35female Wistar rats were randomly assigned into 5groups. Four groups were infected vaginally with C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and one group was not ( negative control). The four infected groups received the following treatments: two groups received vaginal creams of 2 % or 4 % of L. inermis , one group received 1 % clotrimazole and one infected group did not receive any treatment ( positive control). The hydro-ethanolic henna extract was prepared from the powder of henna leaves using maceration method. Samples were taken for culture from the vaginae<pathogen> of all rats before the treatment , one and two weeks after treatment. An ANOVA test was used to analyze the data. Before the treatment , the mean colony forming units ( CFU) was 213.6 ± 10.08 and 334.42 ± 20.32 in the 2 % and 4 % henna groups , respectively , 312.7 ± 28.32 in the clotrimazole group , 233.85 ± 8.15 in the positive control group , and zero in the negative control group. The mean CFUs were zero for all groups except for the 2 % henna and positive control groups ( P < 0.001) one week after the treatment and zero in all groups except for the positive control group two weeks after the treatment ( P < 0.001). L. inermis ( henna) in form of vaginal cream could treat C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> infections in female rats; however , 4 % henna was more effective and had an effect similar to that of clotrimazole.
