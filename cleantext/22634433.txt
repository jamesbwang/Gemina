  Several auditory-based feedback devices have been developed to improve the quality of ventilation performance during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) , but their effectiveness has not been proven in actual CPR situations. In the present study , we investigated the effectiveness of visual flashlight guidance in maintaining high-quality ventilation performance. We conducted a simulation-based , randomized , parallel trial including 121 senior medical students. All participants were randomized to perform ventilation during 2 minutes of CPR with or without flashlight guidance. For each participant , we measured mean ventilation rate as a primary outcome and ventilation volume , inspiration velocity , and ventilation interval as secondary outcomes using a computerized device system. Mean ventilation rate did not significantly differ between flashlight guidance and control groups ( P = 0.159) , but participants in the flashlight guidance group exhibited significantly less variation in ventilation rate than participants in the control group ( P < 0.001). Ventilation interval was also more regular among participants in the flashlight guidance group. Our results demonstrate that flashlight guidance is effective in maintaining a constant ventilation rate and interval. If confirmed by further studies in clinical practice , flashlight guidance could be expected to improve the quality of ventilation performed during CPR.
