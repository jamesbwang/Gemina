  Lesion<symptom> expansion in the week after acute stroke involves both infarct growth ( IG) and anatomic distortion ( AD) because of edema<symptom> and hemorrhage<symptom>. Enabling separate quantification would allow clinical trials targeting these distinct pathological processes. We developed an objective and automated approach to quantify these processes at 24 hours and 1 week. Patients with acute ischemic stroke were scanned at presentation , 24 hours , and 1 week in a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) cohort study. IG and AD were calculated from follow-up lesion<symptom> masks after linear and nonlinear registration to a presenting MRI scan. Performance of IG and AD was compared with edema<symptom> quantified using cerebrospinal fluid displacement. The use of alternative reference images to define AD , including template MRI , mirrored MRI , and presenting computed tomographic scan , was explored. Thirty-seven patients with nonlacunar stroke were included. AD was responsible for 20 % and 36 % of lesion<symptom> expansion at 24 hours ( n = 30) and 1 week ( n = 28). Registration-defined IG and AD compared favorably with edema<symptom> quantified using cerebrospinal fluid displacement , particularly at smaller infarct volumes. Presenting computed tomographic imaging was the preferred alternative reference image to presenting MRI for measuring AD. The contributions of IG and AD to lesion<symptom> expansion can be measured separately over time through the use of image registration. This approach can be used to combine imaging outcome data from computed tomography and MRI.
