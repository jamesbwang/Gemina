  Both human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) and hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infections have been reportedly associated with a higher risk of diabetes mellitus ( DM) but results are conflicting. To determine whether there is an association between chronic HCV<pathogen> and the incidence of DM , and to study the role of factors such as cirrhosis , IFN-based HCV<pathogen> therapy , sustained virologic response ( SVR) and chronic HBV infection among patients living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) followed in a large French multicentre cohort in the combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART) era. All PLHIV followed up in the Dat ` AIDS cohort were eligible. Cox models for survival analysis were used to study the time to occurrence of DM. Among 28 699 PLHIV , 4004 patients had chronic HCV<pathogen> infection. The mean duration of HCV<pathogen> follow-up was 12.5 ± 8.1 years. The rate ratio of DM was 2.74 per 1000 person-years. By multivariate analysis , increasing age , body mass index > 25 , AIDS status , nadir CD4 cell count ≤ 200/mm Our study shows that in the HIV<pathogen> population , cirrhosis is associated with an increased occurrence of DM , but not chronic HCV<pathogen> infection or duration of HCV<pathogen> infection.
