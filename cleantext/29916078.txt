  Eukaryotic cells comprise various organelles surrounded by the membrane. Each organelle is characterized by unique proteins and lipids and has its own specific functions. Single membrane-bounded organelles , including the Golgi apparatus , endosomes , and vacuoles are connected by membrane trafficking. Identifying the organelle localization of a protein of interest is essential for determining the proteins physiological functions. Here , we describe methods for determining protein subcellular localization using the inhibitors brefeldin A and wortmannin in Arabidopsis thaliana.
