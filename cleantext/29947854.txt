  Breastfeeding is the physiological form of infant feeding and has many well-documented benefits. Low breastfeeding rates and short lactation periods have significant negative ecological , economic , and social impact. The promotion of breastfeeding supports the health of children and mothers and reduces costs to the health system. However , the promotion of breastfeeding is regularly undermined by inappropriate advertising of breast milk substitutes. To counteract this , the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted by the World Health Assembly ( WHA) in 1981. Although the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and its subsequent resolutions have been fully or partially incorporated into national law in 135 countries , the provisions of the Code are continually violated. These violations are almost always not punished at all or only insufficiently. For the promotion and protection of breastfeeding , it is essential that health workers are familiar with the Code and subsequent resolutions.This article presents and explains the history , content , and importance of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and gives an assessment of its implementation in practice.
