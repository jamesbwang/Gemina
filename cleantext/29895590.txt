  Renal denervation has no validated marker of procedural success. We hypothesized that successful renal denervation would reduce renal sympathetic nerve signaling demonstrated by attenuation of α-1-adrenoceptor-mediated autotransfusion during the Valsalva maneuver. In this substudy of the Wave IV Study: Phase II Randomized Sham Controlled Study of Renal Denervation for Subjects With Uncontrolled Hypertension , we enrolled 23 subjects with resistant hypertension. They were randomized either to bilateral renal denervation using therapeutic levels of ultrasound energy ( n = 12) or sham application of diagnostic ultrasound ( n = 11). Within-group changes in autonomic parameters , office and ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were compared between baseline and 6 months in a double-blind manner. There was significant office blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction in both treatment ( 16.1 ± 27.3 mm Hg , Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction per se is not necessarily a marker of successful renal nerve ablation. Reduction in splanchnic autotransfusion following renal denervation has not been previously demonstrated and denotes attenuation of ( renal) sympathetic efferent activity and could serve as a marker of procedural success.
