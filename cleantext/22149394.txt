  The polymer residues still present on a chemical vapour-deposited graphene surface after its wet transfer by the poly ( methyl methacrylate) method to the arbitrary substrates , tend to cause problems such as electrical degradation and unwanted intentional doping. In this study , by using an effective cleaning method for the graphene surface by air-assisted plasma , the graphene surface was cleaned significantly without damaging the graphene network , which resulted in the reduction ( approx. 71.11 %) of polymer residues on its surface. The analysis reveals that this approach reduced the D-band ( impurities , polymer residues) formation while maintaining the Ï€-bonding of the graphene , which affects conductivity. By characterizations of the optical microscope , Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy , we obtained a significantly cleaner graphene surface ( roughness of 4.1 nm) compared to pristine graphene ( roughness of 1.2 nm) on a SiO
