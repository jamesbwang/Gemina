  This study explores the metabolic profiles of concordant/discordant phenotypes of high insulin resistance ( IR) and obesity. Through untargeted metabolomics ( LC-ESI-QTOF-MS) , we analyzed the fasting serum of subjects with high IR and/or obesity ( n = 64). An partial least-squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction followed by univariate statistics and enrichment analysis allowed exploration of these metabolic profiles. A multivariate regression method ( LASSO) was used for variable selection and a predictive biomarker model to identify subjects with high IR regardless of obesity was built. Adrenic acid and a dyglyceride ( DG) were shared by high IR and obesity. Uric and margaric acids , 14 DGs , ketocholesterol , and hydroxycorticosterone were unique to high IR , while arachidonic , hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ( HETE) , palmitoleic , triHETE , and glycocholic acids , HETE lactone , leukotriene B4 , and two glutamyl-peptides to obesity. DGs and adrenic acid differed in concordant/discordant phenotypes , thereby revealing protective mechanisms against high IR also in obesity. A biomarker model formed by DGs , uric and adrenic acids presented a high predictive power to identify subjects with high IR ( AUC 80.1 % ( 68.9-91.4)). These findings could become relevant for diabetes risk detection and unveil new potential targets in therapeutic treatments of IR , diabetes , and obesity. An independent validated cohort is needed to confirm these results.
