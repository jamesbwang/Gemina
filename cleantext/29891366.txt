  Pedunsaponin A , a novel molluscicidal compound isolated from Pueraria peduncularis , exhibits strong toxicity against Pomacea canaliculata. To determine the mechanisms of Pedunsaponin A toxicity , its effects on the organs and hemocytes of P. canaliculata were examined in this study. The results showed that Pedunsaponin A had significant toxic effects on different organs of the snail , including the lungs , gills , mantle , siphon tube , ventricle , pericardial cavity , hepatopancreas , kidneys , and the major symptom of this toxicity was the loss of cilia in the lungs and gills. Additionally , in further studies on the effects of Pedunsaponin A treatment , we found that the hemocyte count was changed and hemocyte morphology was damaged , which was primarily reflected by cytoplasm leakage , nuclei deformation , and significant reductions in the number of ribosomes and granulocyte mitochondria. Based on these results and considering that blood vessels are distributed in the lungs and gills , we hypothesized that Pedunsaponin A would first destroy the cilia , which disrupt physiological activities such as respiration<symptom> , excretion and feeding , and then enter the hemolymph through blood vessels , disrupt the normal function of the hemocytes and destroy the snail immune system , eventually resulting in the death of the snail.
