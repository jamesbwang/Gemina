  Intracranial subependymomas account for 0.2-0.7 % of central nervous system tumours and are classified as World Health Organization ( WHO) grade 1 tumours. They are typically located within the ventricular system and are detected incidentally or with symptoms of hydrocephalus<symptom>. Due to paucity of studies exploring this tumour type , the objective was to determine the medium- to long-term outcome of intracranial subependymoma treated by surgical resection. Retrospective case note review of adults with intracranial WHO grade 1 subependymoma diagnosed between 1990 and 2015 at the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust was undertaken. Tumour location , extent of resection ( defined as gross total resection ( GTR) , sub-total resection ( STR) or biopsy) and the WHO performance status at presentation and through follow-up were recorded. Thirteen patients ( 7 males; 6 females) with a mean age of 47.6 years ( range 33-58 years) and a median follow-up of 46 months ( range 25-220 months) were studied. Eight patients had symptomatic tumours ( headache<symptom> , visual disturbance); five had incidental finding. Tumours were most commonly located in the fourth ventricle ( n = 8). The performance status scores at diagnosis were 0 ( n = 8) and 1 ( n = 5). The early post-operative performance status scores at 6 months were 0 ( n = 5) and 1 ( n = 8) and at last follow-up were 0 ( n = 11) and 1 ( n = 2). There was no evidence of tumour re-growth following GTR or STR. The commonest complication was hydrocephalus<symptom> ( n = 3). Subependymoma are indolent tumours. No patients exhibited a worsening of performance status at medium- to long-term follow-up and there were no tumour recurrence suggesting a shorter follow-up time may be sufficient. Surgical resection is indicated for symptomatic tumours or those without a clear imaging diagnosis. Incidental intraventricular subependymoma can be managed conservatively through MRI surveillance.
