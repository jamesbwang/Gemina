  Intracranial dermoid cysts<symptom> are uncommon lesions<symptom> with characteristic imaging appearances. Symptomatic clinical presentation usually occurs in one of two ways: mass effect or rupture. Radiologically , dermoid cysts<symptom> typically present as low density masses on computed tomography ( CT) scan and are generally hyperintense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) sequences with variable signal on T2-weighted sequences. We present the case of a 35-year-old female presented with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Radiological investigations showed a cystic posterior fossa tumor that was not only hyperdense on CT scans but also hypointense on MRI T1-weighted images. The patient underwent a total-gross resection of an extra-parenchymal posterior fossa tumor. Pathologic examination of the specimen concluded to dermoid cyst<symptom>. Dermoid cyst<symptom> of the posterior fossa is a benign lesion<symptom> surgically treatable. Only an appropriate radiological diagnosis of this lesion<symptom> would permit a well-targeted therapeutic approach.
