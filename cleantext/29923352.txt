  Gonadal cell lines provide valuable tools for studying gametogenesis , sex differentiation , and manipulating germ cells in reproductive biology. Female germline stem cells have been characterized and isolated from ovaries of mammalian species , including mice and human , but there has been very few studies on female germline stem cells in reptiles. Here , we described an ovarian stem cell-like line isolated and cultured from the Chinese soft-shell turtle ( Pelodiscus sinensis<pathogen>) , designated as PSO1. The cells showed high alkaline phosphatase activity with a normal diploid karyotype. As shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , the cells were positive for the expression of germ cell-specific genes , vasa and dazl , as well as a stem cell marker , nanog , but negative for the expression of the folliculogenesis-specific gene , figla. Likewise , through fluorescent immunostaining analyses , both the Dazl and Vasa proteins were detected abundantly in the cytoplasm of perinuclear region , whereas Nanog and PCNA were dominantly observed in the nuclei in PSO1 cells. Moreover , PSO1 cells transfected with pCS2: h2b-egfp could properly express the fusion protein in the nuclei. Taken together , the findings suggested that the germline stem cells exist in the ovary of juvenile Chinese soft-shell turtle and these cells can be isolated for a long-term in vitro culture under experimental conditions. This study has provided a valuable basis for further investigations on the molecular mechanisms whereby the germline stem cells develop and differentiate into gametes in turtles. Also , it has paved the way for studies on oogenesis in turtles , even in the other reptiles.
