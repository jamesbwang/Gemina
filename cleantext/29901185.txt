  The major hallmarks of tumor progression are angiogenesis , migration and metastasis. Among the components of Rhodiola rosea<pathogen> , salidroside ( p‑hydroxyphenethyl-β‑d-glucoside) is one of the most potent , and is present in all Rhodiola species. Recent data have revealed the anticancer effects of salidroside; however , the mechanism underlying its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis remains unknown. The present study aimed to analyze how salidroside affects major factors involved in breast cancer , and to elucidate its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and invasion. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) is a marker for tumor angiogenesis and migration , which interacts with matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs). Specifically , MMPs act as a downstream target for STAT3. Using western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis , the present study demonstrated that treatment of MDA‑MB 231 triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) cells with salidroside led to inhibition of invasion and migration markers , and of STAT3 signaling. Furthermore , in vitro angiogenesis analyses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells confirmed the anti-angiogenic activity of salidroside. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay also demonstrated that salidroside may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 , preventing STAT3 from binding to a novel binding site of the MMP2 gene promoter. In conclusion , the present results demonstrated that salidroside may downregulate the STAT3 signaling pathway , and inhibit cell viability , migration and invasion through MMPs in breast cancer cells.
