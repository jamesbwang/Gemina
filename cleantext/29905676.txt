  Classical antenna theory establishes that there are no coherent isotropic radiators. Thermal radiators can be isotropic , but they lack temporal coherence. Here , we demonstrate that quantum interference processes enable the design of isotropic and unpolarized single-photon sources that preserve temporal coherence properties. We illustrate how this effect can be realized with relatively simple multilevel emitters with degenerate ground states , and we discuss potential implementations based on atomic and solid-state single-photon sources.
