  In Arabidopsis thaliana , the bHLH transcription factor , GLABRA3 ( AtGL3) , is an important regulator of epidermal cell differentiation and positively controls anthocyanin accumulation. In contrast , we previously showed that Solanum lycopersicum GLABRA3 ( SlGL3) , the AtGL3 homolog , suppressed anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis. To clarify this functional discrepancy in anthocyanin accumulation , we analyzed the SlGL3 expression pattern in anthocyanin-induced tomato. The SlGL3 expression was significantly reduced in tomato seedlings rich in anthocyanin as a result of inorganic phosphate ( Pi) starvation. This was consistent with the previous result obtained in Arabidopsis , wherein the overexpression of SlGL3 was shown to inhibit anthocyanin accumulation. Our study suggests that the function of SlGL3 is different from that of AtGL3 , and it might inhibit anthocyanin accumulation in tomato.
