  Standard in vitro myotube culture conditions are nonphysiological and there is increasing evidence that this may distort adaptations to both catabolic and anabolic stimuli and hamper preclinical research into mechanisms and treatments for muscle atrophy in cancer and other chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. We tested a new model of myotube culture which mimics more accurately the basal conditions for muscle tissue in patients with chronic<disease> disease<disease> , such as cancer. Myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts , cultured under the modified conditions were thinner , more numerous , with more uniform morphology and an increased proportion of mature myotubes. Furthermore , modified conditions led to increased expression of mir-210-3p , genes related to slow-twitch , oxidative phenotype and resistance to commonly used experimental atrophy-inducing treatments. However , treatment with a combination of drugs used in anti-cancer treatment ( doxorubicin and dexamethasone) under the modified culture conditions did lead to myotube atrophy which was only partially prevented by co-administration of curcumin. The results underline the importance and potential advantages of using physiological conditions for in vivo experiments investigating mechanisms of muscle atrophy and especially for preclinical screening of therapies for cancer-related muscle wasting.
