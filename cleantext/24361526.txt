  Electronic cigarettes ( E-cigarettes) have become a debated issue for tobacco control over recent years. In this study we investigate how Chinese newspapers have covered E-cigarettes over the past ten years. The study analyses the salience , patterns and content of news articles pertaining to E-cigarettes in regional and national Chinese outlets. A total of 476 articles are examined via content analysis and supervised automatic text analysis. The manual content analysis generates a coding scheme , which is then validated and applied to machine learning. The whole research methodology demonstrates satisfying human-human and human-to-computer reliabilities. The study reveals that E-cigarettes have not received enough attention in terms of its salience in the media , though the amount of coverage has been growing. A large share of the articles is published around May of each year- which is when the No Tobacco Day of the WHO takes place. The results point to four major themes on E-cigarettes: nicotine/constituents/features , tobacco control/regulation , children 's use of E-cigarettes , and tobacco market/industry. Overall , E-cigarettes have not been a topic at the top of media agenda; however , we have identified a considerable growth of coverage about the potential concerns regarding young people 's adoption of E-cigarettes advocated by parents and educators.
