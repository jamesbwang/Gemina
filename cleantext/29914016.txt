  Health-care professionals , patients , and families seek as much information as possible about prognosis for patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD); however , we do not yet have a robust understanding of how demographic factors predict prognosis. We evaluated associations between age at presentation , age of onset , and symptom length with cognitive decline as measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes ( CDR-SOB) in a large dataset of AD patients. Age at presentation was associated with post-presentation decline in MMSE ( p < 0.001) , with younger patients showing faster decline. There was little evidence of an association with change in CDR-SOB. Symptom length , rather than age , was the strongest predictor of MMSE and CDR-SOB at presentation , with increasing symptom length associated with worse outcomes. The evidence that younger AD patients have a more aggressive disease course implies that early diagnosis is essential.
