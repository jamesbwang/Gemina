  The topic of network lifetime has been attracting much research attention because of its importance in prolonging the standing operation of battery-restricted wireless sensor networks , and the rechargeable wireless sensor network has emerged as a promising solution. In this paper , we propose a joint energy supply and routing path selection algorithm to extend the network lifetime based on an initiative power supply. We develop a two-stage energy replenishment strategy to supplement the energy consumption of nodes as much as possible. Furthermore , the influence of charging factors on the selection of next-hop nodes in data routing is considered. The simulation results show that our algorithm effectively prolong the network lifetime , and different demands of network delay and energy consumption can be obtained by dynamically adjusting parameters.
