  The aim of this study was to establish an effective and safe protocol for in vivo oral candidiasis treatment with atmospheric plasma jets. A novel amplitude-modulated cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet ( AM-CAPPJ) device , operating with Helium , was tested. In vitro assays with Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilms and Vero cells were performed in order to determine the effective parameters with low cytotoxicity. After the determination of such parameters , the protocol was evaluated in experimentally induced oral candidiasis in mice. AM-CAPPJ could significantly reduce the viability of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilms after 5 minutes of plasma exposure when compared to the non-exposed group ( p = 0.0033). After this period of exposure , high viability of Vero cells was maintained ( 86.33 ± 10.45 %). Also , no late effects on these cells were observed after 24 and 48 hours ( 83.24 ± 15.23 % and 88.96 ± 18.65 % , respectively). Histological analyses revealed significantly lower occurrence of inflammatory alterations in the AM-CAPPJ group when compared to non-treated and nystatin-treated groups ( p < 0.0001). Although no significant differences among the values of CFU/tongue were observed among the non-treated group and the groups treated with AM-CAPPJ or nystatin ( p = 0.3201) , histological analyses revealed marked reduction in candidal tissue invasion. In conclusion , these results point out to a clinical applicability of this protocol , due to the simultaneous anti-inflammatory and inhibitory effects of AM-CAPPJ with low cytotoxicity.
