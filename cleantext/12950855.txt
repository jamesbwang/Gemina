  Clonidine is a common adjunct to local anesthetics for pediatric neuraxial block; however , the pros and cons between clonidine and other adjuncts remain unclear. Thus , we performed this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and adverse effects between clonidine and other adjuncts added to local anesthetics. The systematic search , data extraction , critical appraisal , and pooled analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) statement. Randomized controlled studies were searched in Cochrane ( to present) , Medline ( 1946 to present) , Embase ( 1974 to present) , and Biosis ( 1995 to present). Relative risks ( RRs) , standard mean difference ( SMD) , and associated CIs were calculated using RevMan statistical software to assess continuous and dichotomous data. Heterogeneity in studies was measured by forest<disease> plots and A total of 15 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a longer duration of postoperative analgesia in the clonidine group than for other adjuncts ( SMD = 1.54 , Clonidine , compared with other adjuncts , added to local anesthetics for neuraxial block , provides a longer duration of postoperative analgesia with lower incidence of PONV. However , the duration of motor block may also be prolonged by clonidine.
