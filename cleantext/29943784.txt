  Gas sensors at low operating temperature with high sensitivity require group III nitrides owing to their high chemical and thermal stabilities. For the first time , Al0 .07 Ga0 .93 N nanowires ( NWs) have been utilized in CH4 sensing , and it has been demonstrated that they exhibit an improved response compared to GaN NWs at the low operating temperature of 50 Â°C. Al0 .07 Ga0 .93 N NWs have been synthesized via the ion beam mixing process using inert gas ion irradiation on the bilayer of Al/GaN NWs. The sensing mechanism is explained with the help of native defects present in the system. The number of shallow acceptors created by Ga vacancies ( VGa) is found to be higher in Al0 .07 Ga0 .93 N NWs than in as-grown GaN NWs. The role of the O antisite defect ( ON) for the formation of shallow VGa is inferred from photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis. These native defects strongly influence the gas sensing behaviour , which results in enhanced and low-temperature CH4 sensing.
