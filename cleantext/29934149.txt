  We developed an on-packaging colorimetric sensor label that can detect the aldehyde emission of apples based on Methyl Red. The sensor label was constructed using printable inks on paper medium and relied on the change in basicity caused by the nucleophilic addition reaction between aldehyde and hydroxide via the Cannizzaro reaction. The sensor can be used to detect aldehyde in solution and vapor. Sensitivity and stability toward changes in humidity were achieved by altering the concentration of OH
