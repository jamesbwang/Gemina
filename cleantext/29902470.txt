  To assess the effects of automated peripheral stimulation ( AMPS) in reducing gait variability of subjects with Parkinson disease ( PD) and freezing of gait ( FOG) treated with AMPS and to explore the effects of this treatment on gait during a single task ( walking) and a dual task ( walking while attending the word-color Stroop test). Interventional , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomized trial. Clinical rehabilitation. Thirty subjects were randomized into 2 groups: AMPS ( n = 15) and AMPS sham ( n = 15). Both groups received 2 treatment sessions a week for 4 consecutive weeks ( totaling 8 treatment sessions). AMPS was applied by using a medical device ( Gondola â„¢) and consisted in mechanical pressure stimulations delivered by metallic actuators on 4 areas of the feet. Treatment parameters and device configuration were modified for AMPS sham group. Gait analyses were measured at baseline and after the first , fourth , and eighth treatment sessions. Interactions among groups and sessions were found for both conditions while off anti-Parkinsonian medications. AMPS decreased gait variability in subjects with PD and FOG for both single and dual task conditions. AMPS is an effective add-on therapy for treating gait variability in patients with PD and FOG.
