  Cross-sectional data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 1999-2012 for those aged â‰¥ 20 years , fasting for at least 8 h , and classified as smokers and nonsmokers on the basis of observed serum cotinine levels were used to evaluate the impact of smoking on the adjusted and unadjusted concentrations of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol , total cholesterol ( TC) , and triglycerides ( TG). Adjustments were made for the effects of gender; race/ethnicity; survey year; dietary intake of alcohol; caffeine; cholesterol; saturated , unsaturated , and total fatty acids; fasting time; body mass index; and poverty income ratio. Adjusted levels of LDL and TC did not vary among smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers had lower adjusted levels of HDL than nonsmokers ( 48.8 vs. 51.4 mg/dL ,
