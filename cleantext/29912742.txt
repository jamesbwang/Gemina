  Mitral valve regurgitation may require complex repair techniques that are challenging in minimally invasive and may expose patients to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times. Here , we present a stepwise operative approach that may facilitate the repair of the mitral valve in a minimally invasive fashion and may be carried out even when multiple posterior segments are involved. This how-to-do article presents a method that was performed in 148 patients that were referred to our institution for severe organic mitral regurgitation between 2008 and 2016. At mean ± SD follow-up of 45.5 ± 27 months , freedom from recurrent of mitral regurgitation 2 + or greater and reoperation was 95.2 %.
