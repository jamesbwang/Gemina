  We investigate the molecular phylogeny of Boophis , a group of arboreal frogs from the Malagasy-Comoroan family Mantellidae. Based on newly acquired DNA sequences of five mitochondrial and five nuclear markers ( 7444 base pairs) , we infer a phylogeny of Boophis with complete species-level taxon sampling. We reconstruct the phylogeny using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood and estimate divergence dates for the major clades of the genus. The phylogenetic analyses together support the monophyly of the two subgenera ( Sahona and Boophis) , and provide strong support for most previously identified species groups , except that the B. ulftunni group is nested within the B. majori group. We also erect a new species group related to the B. mandraka group , the B. blommersae group , composed of small-sized , brown stream-breeding frogs previously included within the B. majori group. Finally , we use the resulting phylogeny to illustrate striking examples of repeated evolution of coloration and ventral transparency and address the biogeographic history and broad pattern of species diversification in the genus. Ancestral area reconstructions provide evidence that Boophis diversified within the Eastern<disease> highland forests of Madagascar , and we suggest that adaptation to these highland areas was important in their diversification.
