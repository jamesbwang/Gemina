  Threonine has been reported to be the second limiting amino acid in typical equine diets , but its actual requirement has not been determined in horses. To evaluate amino acid metabolism and requirements , the indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAAO) method has been successfully used in other species. The objective of this research was to estimate threonine requirements in mature horses fed timothy hay and concentrate in 4:1 ratio using the IAAO method. Six Thoroughbred mares ( 579.9 Â± 46.7 kg) received each of 6 levels of threonine intake , 41 , 51 , 61 , 70 , 80 and 89 mg/kg BW/day , in a randomly determined order. Each study period was 7-day long , and on day 6 , blood samples were collected before and 90 min after feeding to measure amino acid concentrations using HPLC. On day 7 , horses underwent IAAO procedures , which included a 2-hr primed , constant intravenous infusion of (
