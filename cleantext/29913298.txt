  Eruca sativa Mill. , ( Brassicaceae) is a popular remedy for the treatment of hypertension in Pakistan. However , direct effect of the extract and its fractions on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and vascular tone are unknown. This investigation was aimed to explore the pharmacological base for the traditional use of E. sativa in hypertension. In-vivo blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> study was carried out using normotensive and high salt-induced hypertensive rats under anaesthesia. The cardiovascular mechanisms were explored using rat aorta and atria in-vitro. Preliminary phytochemical analysis , spectrophotometric detection of total phenols , flavonoids and HPLC analysis of crude extract were performed using quercetin and erucin as marker compounds. Intravenous injection of crude extract induced a fall in mean arterial pressure ( MAP) in both normotensive ( max fall: 41.79 ± 1.55 % mmHg) and hypertensive ( max fall: 58.25 ± 0.91 % mmHg) rats. Atropine ( 1 mg/kg) pretreatment attenuated this effect significantly ( p < 0.001) , suggesting the involvement of muscarinic receptor in its antihypertensive effect. Fractions also induced atropine-sensitive antihypertensive effect. Similarly , oral administration of crude and aqueous extracts resulted a fall in MAP in the hypertensive rats. In isolated rat aortic rings from normotensive rats , crude extract and fractions induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation. This relaxation was partially inhibited with The results suggest that E. sativa is an antihypertensive remedy which is mainly due to its vasodilatory and partly cardiac effects.
