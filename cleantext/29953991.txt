  There are significant epidemiological and biological differences between breast cancer in blacks and whites which have wide-reaching implications for the institution of an effective cancer screening programme in Nigeria. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathologic features of breast cancer diagnosed in our facility and to discuss their implications for cancer screening. A retrospective review of the forms , slides , and results of breast cancer cases received in our facility over an 8-year period was carried out , as well as a systematic review of the characteristics of breast cancer in Nigeria , Africa , the US , and the UK. A total of 832 cancers were seen with a mean age of 49 years. Most cases ( 97 %) were invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified , high grade ( 41.9 %) , and unassociated with ductal carcinoma in situ ( 52.3 %). Triple-negative tumors were the commonest immunohistochemical type seen ( 42.1 %) , and these were less likely to have an intraductal component ( p = 0.0048). Luminal-type tumours were more likely to be low grade ( p = 0.0005). The majority of cases presented in advanced stages with no statistically significant difference among the different immunohistochemical subtypes ( p = 0.7949). The significant epidemiological and biological differences between breast cancer in Lagos and in western populations are important for the establishment of an effective breast cancer screening programme uniquely tailored for the Nigerian population.
