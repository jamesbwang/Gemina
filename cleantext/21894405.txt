  The aim of this study was to evaluate early clinical outcomes and echocardiographic measurements of the left ventricle in patients who underwent left ventricular aneurysm<disease> repair using two different techniques associated to myocardial revascularization. Eighty-nine patients ( 74 males , 15 females; mean age 58 ± 8.4 years; range: 41 to 80 years) underwent post-infarction left ventricular aneurysm<disease> repair and myocardial revascularization performed between 1996 and 2016. Ventricular reconstruction was performed using endoventricular circular patch plasty ( Dor procedure) ( n = 48; group A) or linear repair technique ( n = 41; group B). Multi-vessel disease in 55 ( 61.7 %) and isolated left anterior descending ( LAD) disease in 34 ( 38.2 %) patients were identified. Five ( 5.6 %) patients underwent aneurysmectomy alone , while the remaining 84 ( 94.3 %) patients had aneurysmectomy with bypass. The mean number of grafts per patient was 2.1 ± 1.2 with the Dor procedure and 2.9 ± 1.3 with the linear repair technique. In-hospital mortality occurred in 4.1 % and 7.3 % in group A and group B , respectively ( P > 0.05). The results of our study demonstrate that post-infarction left ventricular aneurysm<disease> repair can be performed with both techniques with acceptable surgical risk and with satisfactory hemodynamic improvement.
