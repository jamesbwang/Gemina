  CHD is becoming an increasing priority worldwide , as it is one of the main causes of death in low- and middle-income countries lately. This study aims to evaluate the association between beverage consumption patterns and the risk of CHD among Mexican adult population. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from 6640 adults participating in the Health Workers ' Cohort Study. Factor analysis was performed to identify beverage patterns using sex-specific Framingham prediction algorithms to estimate CHD risk. The prevalence of moderate to high CHD risk was 17 · 8 %. We identified four major beverage consumption patterns , which were categorised as alcohol , coffee/tea , soft drinks and low-fat milk. We observed a lower risk of CHD ( OR = 0 · 61; 95 % CI 0 · 46 , 0 · 80; and OR = 0 · 58; 95 % CI 0 · 43 , 0 · 79 , respectively) among participants in the upper quintile of alcohol or low-fat milk consumption compared with those in the bottom quintile. In contrast , a higher consumption of soft drinks was positively associated with CHD risk ( OR = 1 · 64; 95 % CI 1 · 21 , 2 · 20) when compared with other extreme quintiles. Finally , coffee/tea consumption was not significantly associated with CHD risk. Our findings suggest that a beverage pattern characterised by a higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages may be associated with an increased risk of CHD among the Mexican adult population , whereas patterns of moderate alcohol intake and low-fat milk may be associated with a reduced risk.
