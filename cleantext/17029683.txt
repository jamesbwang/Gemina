  Microcystin-leucine arginine ( MC-LR) , a cyclic heptapeptide produced by cyanobacteria , is a strong reproductive toxin. Studies performed in rat Sertoli cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells have demonstrated typical apoptosis after MC-LR exposure. However , little is known on how to protect against the reproductive toxicity induced by MC-LR. The present study aimed to explore the possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-apoptosis and protective effects of resveratrol ( RES) on the co-culture of Sertoli ⁻ germ cells and rat testes. The results demonstrated that MC-LR treatment inhibited the proliferation of Sertoli ⁻ germ cells and induced apoptosis. Furthermore , sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) and Bcl-2 were inhibited , while p53 and Ku70 acetylation , Bax expression , and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated by MC-LR. However , RES pretreatment ameliorated MC-LR-induced apoptosis and SIRT1 inhibition , and downregulated the MC-LR-induced increase in p53 and Ku70 acetylation , Bax expression , and caspase-3 activation. In addition , RES reversed the MC-LR-mediated reduction in Ku70 binding to Bax. The present study indicated that the administration of RES could ameliorate MC-LR-induced Sertoli ⁻ germ cell apoptosis and protect against reproductive toxicity in rats by stimulating the SIRT1/p53 pathway , suppressing p53 and Ku70 acetylation and enhancing the binding of Ku70 to Bax.
