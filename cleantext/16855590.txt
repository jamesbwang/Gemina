  The signal mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 ( S1P1) is essential but seemingly insufficient for thymic export of newly generated T cells. Here , we reported the identification of CCR2 as an additional regulator of this process. CCR2 showed a markedly increased expression in the most mature subset of single-positive ( SP) thymocytes. Its deficiency led to a reduction of recent thymic emigrants in the periphery and a simultaneous accumulation of mature SP cells in the thymus. The CCR2 signaling promoted thymic emigration primarily through modulating the chemotactic responses to S1P1 engagement. On the one hand , the chemokinesis induced by CCR2 activation endowed thymocytes with enhanced capacity to respond to S1P-induced migration. On the other hand , CCR2 signaling through Stat3 augmented forkhead box O1 activity , leading to increased expression of S1P1. Taken together , the present study highlights a unique and novel function of CCR2 signaling in the regulation of thymic egress.
