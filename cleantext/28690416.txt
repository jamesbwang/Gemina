  When considering an effective , i.e. homogenized description of waves in periodic media that transcends the usual quasi-static approximation , there are generally two schools of thought: ( i) the two-scale approach that is prevalent in mathematics and ( ii) the Willis ' homogenization framework that has been gaining popularity in engineering and physical sciences. Notwithstanding a mounting body of literature on the two competing paradigms , a clear understanding of their relationship is still lacking. In this study , we deploy an effective impedance of the scalar wave equation as a lens for comparison and establish a low-frequency , long-wavelength dispersive expansion of the Willis ' effective model , including terms up to the second order. Despite the intuitive expectation that such obtained effective impedance coincides with its two-scale counterpart , we find that the two descriptions
