  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate combined with emtricitabine is a highly effective oral pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP) agent<pathogen> for preventing the acquisition of HIV<pathogen>. This effectiveness has consequences for the design and analysis of trials assessing experimental PrEP regimens , which now generally include an active-control tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine group , rather than a placebo group , as a comparator. Herein , we describe major problems in the interpretation of the primary measure of effectiveness proposed for these trials , namely the ratio of HIV<pathogen> incidence in the experimental agent group to that in the active-control group. We argue that valid interpretation requires an assumption about one of two parameters: either the incidence among trial participants had they not received PrEP or the effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine within the trial. However , neither parameter is directly observed because of the absence of a no-treatment group , thus requiring the use of external evidence or subjective judgment. We propose an alternative measure of effectiveness based on the concept of averted infections , which incorporates one of these parameters. The measure is simple to interpret , has clinical and public health relevance , and is a natural preservation-of-effect criterion for assessing statistical non-inferiority. Its adoption could also allow the use of smaller sample sizes , currently a major barrier to the assessment of experimental PrEP regimens.
