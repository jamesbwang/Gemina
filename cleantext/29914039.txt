  Epidemiological evidence has associated Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) with vascular risk factors ( VRFs) , but whether treatment of VRFs reduces the incidence of dementia and AD is uncertain. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available data on the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia and AD incidence. Pertinent studies published until 1 January 2018 were identified from PubMed. Both randomized controlled trials ( RCT) and prospective studies that investigated the impact of treatment of VRFs on dementia or AD incidence were included. Eight RCTs and 52 prospective studies were identified. Antihypertensive treatment was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of dementia in RCTs ( n = 5; relative risk ( RR) , 0.84; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.69-1.02) and prospective studies ( n = 3; RR , 0.77; 95 % CI , 0.58-1.01) and with reduced AD risk in prospective studies ( n = 5; RR = 0.78; 95 % CI , 0.66-0.91). In prospective studies , treatment of hyperlipidemia with statins , but not nonstatin lipid-lowering agents , was associated with reduced risk of dementia ( n = 17; RR , 0.77; 95 % CI , 0.63-0.95) and AD ( n = 13; RR , 0.86; 95 % CI , 0.80-0.92). The single RCT on statins and dementia incidence showed no association. Data from one RCT and six prospective studies did not support a beneficial impact of antidiabetic drugs or insulin therapy on dementia risk. Current evidence indicates that antihypertensives and statins might reduce the incidence of dementia and AD. Further trials to determine the effect of VRF on AD are needed.
