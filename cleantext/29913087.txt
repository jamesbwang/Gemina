  Impulsivity and compulsivity are transdiagnostic features associated with clinically relevant aspects of psychiatric disorders , including addictions. However , little research has investigated how impulsivity and compulsivity relate to hypersexuality and problematic pornography use. Thus , the aims of the present study were to investigate ( a) self-reported impulsivity and compulsivity with respect to hypersexuality and problematic pornography use and ( b) the similarities and possible differences between hypersexuality and problematic pornography use in these domains. Utilizing structural equation modeling ( SEM) in a large community sample ( N = 13,778 participants; female = 4,151 , 30.1 %) , results indicated that impulsivity ( β = .28 , β = .26) and compulsivity ( β = .23 , β = .14) were weakly related to problematic pornography use among men and women , respectively. Impulsivity had a stronger relationship ( β = .41 , β = .42) with hypersexuality than did compulsivity ( β = .21 , β = .16) among men and women , respectively. Consequently , impulsivity and compulsivity may not contribute as substantially to problematic pornography use as some scholars have proposed. On the other hand , impulsivity might have a more prominent role in hypersexuality than in problematic pornography use. Future research should examine further social and situational factors associated with problematic pornography use.
