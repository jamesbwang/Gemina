  Left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) and proteinuria<symptom> are known as independent predictors of cardiovascular death in hypertension. However , LVH and its association with proteinuria<symptom> have not been investigated in adult hypertensive patients in Afghanistan. The objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of LVH and the correlation between LVH and proteinuria<symptom> among the Afghan adult hypertensive population visiting an outpatient clinic in Afghanistan. We retrospectively evaluated 789 hypertensive patients ( mean age is 56 years and 46 % were men) who visited the clinic between December 2014 and August 2016. Patient characteristics and laboratory and clinical findings were recorded. The rate of LVH among hypertensive patients was 54.4 %. Patients with proteinuria<symptom> had a significantly higher LVH percentage compared to those without proteinuria<symptom> ( 73.2 % versus 55.8 %;
