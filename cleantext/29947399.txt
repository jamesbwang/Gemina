  Compatible energy storage devices that are able to withstand various mechanical deformations , while delivering their intended functions , are required in wearable technologies. This imposes constraints on the structural designs , materials selection , and miniaturization of the cells. To date , extensive efforts have been dedicated towards developing electrochemical energy storage devices for wearables , with a focus on incorporation of shape-conformable materials into mechanically robust designs that can be worn on the human body. In this review , we highlight the quantified performances of reported wearable electrochemical energy storage devices , as well as their micro-sized counterparts under specific mechanical deformations , which can be used as the benchmark for future studies in this field. A general introduction to the wearable technology , the development of the selection and synthesis of active materials , cell design approaches and device fabrications are discussed. It is followed by challenges and outlook toward the practical use of electrochemical energy storage devices for wearable applications.
