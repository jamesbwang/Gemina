  PIK3CA mutations are common activating mutations associated with breast cancer ( occurring in 20-30 % of all cases) and are potent predictive markers for responses to PI3K inhibitors. Thus , it is important to develop sensitive methods to detect these mutations. We established a novel detection method using a quenching probe ( QP) system to identify PIK3CA mutations , using DNA from 309 breast cancer tissues. In a developmental cohort , we determined the optimal detection threshold of the QP system with human tumor DNA from 119 freshly frozen tumor samples. We found a 96 % concordance rate with the QP system between DNA from 26 matching fresh-frozen specimens and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE) specimens from the same patients , and known PIK3CA mutation status in the developmental cohort. In a validation cohort , we evaluated whether the threshold for judging mutations using the QP system with frozen specimen-derived DNA was applicable with FFPE-derived DNA. In the validation cohort , 30 DNA samples from 190 FFPE-derived DNA samples with known PIK3CA mutation status were analyzed by direct sequencing ( DS) and droplet digital PCR , in a blinded manner. The sensitivity and specificity of the droplet digital PCR results were 100 % and 100 % ( QP system) , and 60 % and 100 % ( DS) , respectively. We also analyzed the relationship between clinical outcomes and the PIK3CA mutational status of 309 breast cancer samples , including the developmental cohort and validation cohort samples. Multivariate analysis suggested that PIK3CA mutations , especially H1047R , were prognostic factors of relapse-free survival. Our novel detection system could be more useful than DS for detecting clinical PIK3CA mutations.
