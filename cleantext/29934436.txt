  Faecal immunochemical tests ( FITs) are replacing guaiac faecal occult blood tests ( gFOBTs) for colorectal cancer ( CRC) screening. Incidence of interval colorectal cancer ( iCRC) following a negative stool<symptom> test result is not yet known. We aimed to compare incidence of iCRC following a negative FIT or gFOBT. We searched Ovid Medline , Embase , Cochrane Library , Science Citation Index , PubMed and Google Scholar from inception to 12 December 2017 for citations related to CRC screening based on stool<symptom> tests. We included studies on FIT or gFOBT iCRC in average-risk screening populations. Main outcome was pooled incidence rate of iCRCs per 100000 person-years ( p-y). Pooled incidence rates were obtained by fitting random-effect Poisson regression models. We identified 7 426 records and included 29 studies. Meta-analyses comprised data of 6 987 825 subjects with a negative test result , in whom 11932 screen-detected CRCs and 5 548 gFOBT or FIT iCRCs were documented. Median faecal haemoglobin ( Hb) positivity cut-off used was 20 ( range 10-200) Âµg Hb/g faeces in the 17 studies that provided FIT results. Pooled incidence rates of iCRC following FIT and gFOBT were 20 ( 95 % CI 14 to 29; I A negative gFOBT result is associated with a higher iCRC incidence than a negative FIT. This supports the use of FIT over gFOBT as CRC screening tool.
