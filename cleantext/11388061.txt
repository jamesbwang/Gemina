  We have developed a single-breath-hold photoacoustic computed tomography ( SBH-PACT) system to reveal detailed angiographic structures in human breasts<disease>. SBH-PACT features a deep penetration depth ( 4 cm in vivo) with high spatial and temporal resolutions ( 255 Âµm in-plane resolution and a 10 Hz 2D frame rate). By scanning the entire breast within a single breath hold ( ~ 15 s) , a volumetric image can be acquired and subsequently reconstructed utilizing 3D back-projection with negligible breathing-induced motion artifacts. SBH-PACT clearly reveals tumors by observing higher blood vessel densities associated with tumors at high spatial resolution , showing early promise for high sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts<disease>. In addition to blood vessel imaging , the high imaging speed enables dynamic studies , such as photoacoustic elastography , which identifies tumors by showing less compliance. We imaged breast cancer patients with breast sizes ranging from B cup to DD cup , and skin pigmentations ranging from light to dark. SBH-PACT identified all the tumors without resorting to ionizing radiation or exogenous contrast , posing no health risks.
