  Viral<disease> infection<disease> triggers the innate antiviral immune response that rapidly produces type I interferons in most cell types to combat viruses invading. Upon viral<disease> infection<disease> , the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I/MDA5 recognize viral RNA , and then RIG-I/MDA5 is transported to mitochondria interacting with VISA through the CARD domain. From there , VISA recruits downstream antiviral signaling pathways molecules , such as TRAFs and TBK1. Eventually , IRF3 is phosphorylated and type I IFNs are induced to fight as the first line of defense against viruses. However , it remains unclear how VISA acts as a scaffold to assemble the signalosome in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. Here , we demonstrated Sec13 as a novel component that was involved in VISA-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. The co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Sec13 specifically interacts with VISA. Overexpression of Sec13 increases VISA 's aggregation and ubiquitination and significantly enhances the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 , facilitating the IFN-β production. Conversely , the knockdown of Sec13 attenuates Sendai virus-induced and VISA-mediated IRF3 activation and the production of IFNβ , thus weakens antiviral immune activity.
