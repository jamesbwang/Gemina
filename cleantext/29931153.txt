  Asparagine-linked glycans ( N-glycans) are attached onto nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) and subsequently processed by a set of processing enzymes in the ER and Golgi apparatus. Accumulating evidence has shown that not all N-glycans on glycoproteins are uniformly processed into mature forms ( hybrid- and complex-types in mammals) through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus , and a certain set of glycans remains unprocessed as an ` immature ' form ( high mannose-type in mammals). Much attention has been paid to environmental factors regulating N-glycoprotein maturation , such as the expression levels of glycosyltransferases/glycosidases. On the other hand , the influence of the 3D structure of the carrier glycoprotein on N-glycan maturation has been investigated mostly using individual model glycoproteins. To obtain more insights into N-glycoprotein maturation , we herein analyze glycoprotein structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank. We confirm that site-specific N-glycan processing is largely explained by the solvent accessibility of the glycosylated Asn residue and of the conjugated N-glycan. Potential bias of protein structural features towards immature or mature forms was explored within a range of concentric circles of fully folded glycoproteins. There does appear to be bias in amino acid composition and secondary structure. Most notably , Î³-branched amino acid residues ( Asn + Asp + Leu) occur more frequently on unstructured loop regions of immature glycoproteins. Structural features of the protein surface around the N-glycosylated site do seem to affect N-glycan processing and maturation.
