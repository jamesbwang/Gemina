  As sex estimation is an important step to delineate the biological profile , the development of tools employing anatomical structures which may maintain their integrity even after extreme events , such as the maxillary sinus , become useful for forensic identification. Thus , the aim in the present study was to develop and validate a formula for sex estimation through measurements in the maxillary sinuses in a Brazilian population , using cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) scans. Linear and volumetric measurements in the maxillary sinus were performed bilaterally in 94 CBCT scans from 45 males ( mean age 25.2 ± 0.79) and 49 females ( mean age 23.7 ± 0.50). The OnDemand 3D software was employed for linear measurements ( height , length and width of , and the largest distance between the right and left maxillary sinuses) , while the ITK-SNAP 3.0 segmentation software was used to acquire the volume. The data obtained was applied to a mathematical model for sex estimation. To validate the developed formula , another sample composed of 60 CBCT images of Brazilian individuals was tested. Overall , maxillary sinuses ' measurements were significantly higher in males , without statistically significant differences between the right and left sides within each group. The most dimorphic measurement was the height , with an accuracy of 77.7 % regarding sex estimation. The formula created lead to a sex estimation of 87.8 % for females and 80 % for males , with an overall accuracy of 84 %. When the formula validity was tested in another sample , it showed an accuracy of 82.4 %. The formula developed through measurements in the maxillary sinus using CBCT scans showed an accuracy of 84 % for sex estimation and can be applied as a complementary method for human identification in the Brazilian population.
