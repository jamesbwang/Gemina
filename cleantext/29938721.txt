  We report the water-in-ionic-liquid microemulsions ( ME) formed in a binary water/ionic liquid system , without organic solvents , using a surfactant ionic liquid ( SAIL) based on 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ( C4mIm +) as the cation and dioctyl sulfosuccinate ( AOT-) as the anion. Small-angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS) revealed that MEs were stably formed in the binary water/SAIL solutions in the low water content region ( water volume fraction , φw < 0.1) , and the ME size systematically increased with increasing φw. We further investigated the nanostructures of the high φw region using a combination of SAXS and rheological measurements and found that the MEs changed to a stacked lamellar structure comprising SAIL bilayers and water phases at φw > 0.12. At the largest water content , φw = 0.99 , vesicle structures were obtained.
