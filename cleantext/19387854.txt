  The urbanization of the Las Vegas Valley has transformed this part of the Mohave Desert into a green oasis by introducing many non-native plant species , some of which are allergenic. Typically , one monitoring station is established per city to obtain pollen counts for an entire metropolitan area. However , variations in pollen concentrations could occur among different microenvironments. The objective of this study is to measure and compare pollen concentrations in five locations in Las Vegas to determine if there are significant differences between microenvironments within the city. Air samples were collected from five sites across the Las Vegas Valley over a 1-year period. Prepared slides were analyzed with a light microscope for pollen grains and converted into airborne pollen concentrations. Mixed model methods were used to determine mean differences. Tree pollen was the greatest contributor to the annual average airborne pollen concentrations ( 130 grains/m
