  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) is often managed using minimal anticoagulation. This can make the circuitry susceptible to thrombosis. The ECMO cannula may be particularly vulnerable to thrombosis if flow is interrupted for an undetermined but prolonged period of time. Therefore , under conditions where cannula blood flow stasis may be prolonged and flashing , the cannulae is not an option ( e.g. , air in circuit) it is imperative to have an emergency plan available , which can be rapidly implemented that will provide a means of cannula patency preservation. The following outlines a system to preserve cannula patency in these instances.
