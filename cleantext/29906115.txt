  Serial femtosecond crystallography ( SFX) using the ultrashort X-ray pulses from a X-ray free-electron laser ( XFEL) provides a new way of collecting structural data at room temperature that allows for following the reaction in real time after initiation. XFEL experiments are conducted in a shot-by-shot mode as the sample is destroyed and replenished after each X-ray pulse , and therefore , monitoring and controlling the data quality by using in situ diagnostic tools is critical. To study metalloenzymes , we developed the use of simultaneous collection of X-ray diffraction of crystals along with X-ray emission spectroscopy ( XES) data that is used as a diagnostic tool for crystallography , by monitoring the chemical state of the metal catalytic center. We have optimized data analysis methods and sample delivery techniques for fast and active feedback to ensure the quality of each batch of samples and the turnover of the catalytic reaction caused by reaction triggering methods. Here , we describe this active in situ feedback system using Photosystem II as an example that catalyzes the oxidation of H
