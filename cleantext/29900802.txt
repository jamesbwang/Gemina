  The aim of this study was to examine major depressive disorder ( MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) diagnosed at age < 55 as predictors , and sex and race as potential moderators , of dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment. Veterans ( N = 4,800) aged ⩾ 56 years were grouped by psychiatric history , sex , and race. Hierarchical and stepwise regression were employed to determine significant predictors. MDD and PTSD were associated with almost double the risk for developing dementia or cognitive impairment at age ⩾ 56. Sex , as a moderator , had small effects whereas race increased the risk almost twofold for Black veterans , given the presence of MDD history. MDD and PTSD act as significant risk factors for dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment , and Black veterans , given a history of MDD , may be at an increased risk. An important endeavor for future research is to examine how this risk may vary across dementia subtypes and related conditions.
