  Bimodal nanostructured ( NS) metals , in which the nano-grains or ultrafine grains serve as matrix phase while the coarse grains serve as toughening phase , can synergize the overall strength and ductility to achieve excellent bullet-proof performance. Because of the extrusion process in the fabrication , the coarse-grained ( CG) inclusions<disease> are elongated in the extrusion direction and elliptical CG inclusions<disease> with different aspect ratios form. The shape , distribution , and volume fraction of these elliptical CG inclusions<disease> can all have significant influence on the overall ballistic performance. In this study , the strain gradient plasticity model together with the Johnson ‚Åª Cook failure criterion is employed to investigate the ballistic performance of the bimodal NS Cu with elliptical CG inclusions<disease>. Our results show that the ballistic performance can be improved by increasing the aspect ratio of the elliptical CG inclusions<disease>. Furthermore , the staggered distribution of the elliptical CG inclusions<disease> will decrease the overall ability of the material to resist failure , but it will improve its overall ability to resist deformation. The larger stagger degree of elliptical CG inclusions<disease> can weaken their shape effects on the limit displacement.
