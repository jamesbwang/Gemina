  This study examines the long-term OS of relapsed AML patients who were enrolled to 9 successive ECOG-ACRIN trials for newly diagnosed AML , during 1984-2008. The objectives were to examine whether there is a trend of improvement in the survival of relapsed AML patients in the more recent studies and to search for prognostic factors that are associated with long-term OS after relapse. A total of 3,012 patients were enrolled , 1,779 ( 59.1 %) achieved CR1 and of these , 58.9 % relapsed. The median follow-up was 9.7 years. The median OS from relapse was 0.5 years and the 5-year OS was 10 ( Â± 1) %. These results were similar even for the most recent studies. A multivariate model showed that age ( p < 0.001) , cytogenetics at diagnosis , duration of CR1 ( p < 0.001) and undergoing allogeneic transplantation were significantly associated with OS from relapse. Even among patients who relapsed with better prognostic factors; age < 40 and CR1 > 12 months , there was no significant OS difference between the studies ( p = 0.48). In conclusion , this large cohort appears to confirm that the survival of AML patients post-relapse continues to be dismal and has not improved during the past quarter of a century.
