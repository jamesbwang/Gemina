  We investigated the effect of heterologous expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase ( ZmPepcase) , aspartate aminotransferase ( GmAspAT) , and glutamine synthetase ( NtGS) on carbon ( C) and nitrogen ( N) metabolism in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana). These transgenes were expressed either separately or in different combinations. The highest gains in shoot dry weight were observed in transgenic lines co-expressing all three genes. Tracer experiments using NaH14CO3 suggested that the co-expression of ZmPepcase , GmAspAT , and NtGS resulted in a higher flux of assimilated CO2 towards sugars and amino acids. Upon feeding the leaf discs with glycine-1-14C , transgenic lines evolved significantly lower 14CO2 levels than the WT , suggesting a higher re-assimilation of CO2 evolved during photorespiration. Leaves of transgenic plants accumulated significantly lower ammonium without any significant difference in the levels of photorespiratory ammonium relative to the WT , suggesting higher re-assimilation of photorespired NH3. Transgenic lines also showed improved photosynthetic rates , higher shoot biomass accumulation , and improved seed yield in comparison to WT plants under both optimum and limiting N conditions. The present work demonstrates that the heterologous co-expression of ZmPepcase , GmAspAT , and NtGS reduced the photorespiratory loss of C and N with concomitant enhancements in shoot biomass and seed yield.
