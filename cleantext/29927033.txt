  A formaldehyde-assisted metal-ligand crosslinking strategy is used for the synthesis of metal-phenolic coordination spheres based on sol-gel chemistry. A range of mono-metal ( Co , Fe , Al , Ni , Cu , Zn , Ce) , bi-metal ( Fe-Co , Co-Zn) and multi-metal ( Fe-Co-Ni-Cu-Zn) species can be incorporated into the frameworks of the colloidal spheres. The formation of coordination spheres involves the pre-crosslinking of plant polyphenol ( such as tannic acid) by formaldehyde in alkaline ethanol/water solvents , followed by the aggregation assembly of polyphenol oligomers via metal-ligand crosslinking. The coordination spheres can be used as sensors for the analysis of nucleic acid variants with single-nucleotide discrimination , and a versatile precursor for electrode materials with high electrocatalytic performance.
