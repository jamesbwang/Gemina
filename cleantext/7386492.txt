  Chronically high blood glucose concentrations are a characteristic of diabetes mellitus. Maternal diabetes affects the metabolism of early embryos and can cause a delay in development. To mimic maternal diabetes , bovine in vitro fertilization and embryo culture were performed in fertilization medium and culture medium containing 0.5 , 2 , 3 , and 5 mM , glucose whereas under control conditions , the medium was glucose free ( 0 mM). Compared to control conditions ( 0 mM , 31 %) , blastocyst development was decreased to 23 % with 0.5 and 2 mM glucose. Presence of 3 or 5 mM glucose in the medium resulted in decreased blastocyst rates ( 20 % and 10 % respectively). The metabolomic profile of resulting day 8 blastocysts was analysed by UPLC-MS/MS , and compared to that of blastocysts cultured in control conditions. Elevated glucose concentrations stimulated an increase in glycolysis and activity of the hexosamine pathway , which is involved in protein glycosylation. However , components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle , such as citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate , were reduced in glucose stimulated blastocysts , suggesting that energy production from pyruvate was inefficient. On the other hand , activity of the polyol pathway , an alternative route to energy generation , was increased. In short , cattle embryos exposed to elevated glucose concentrations during early development showed changes in their metabolomic profile consistent with the expectations of exposure to diabetic conditions.
