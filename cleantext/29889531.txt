  Surfactant-free microemulsions ( SFMEs) are a unique kind of microemulsion , which form from immiscible fluids ( i.e. , oil and water phases) in the presence of amphi-solvents rather than traditional surfactants. In comparison with traditional surfactant-based microemulsions ( SBMEs) , SFMEs have received much less attention , and the current understanding of the unique system is very limited. Herein , we report a SFME consisting of the hydrophobic ionic liquid ( IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ( bmimPF
