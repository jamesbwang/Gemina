  A 68-year-old lawyer developed insidious disturbances in topographic orientation and apraxia. He underwent a geriatric evaluation , only documenting slight cognitive disturbances , and a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET) , showing mild right-lateralised frontoparietal hypometabolism. After 1 year , because of worsening in spatial orientation and the onset of dressing apraxia , he was referred to our memory clinic. The neuropsychological evaluation documented proeminent visuospatial , praxis deficits and dysgraphia. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis showed mild increase of total-τ , with normal Aβ1-42 , ruling out Alzheimer 's disease. Progression of the right parietal hypometabolism at FDG-PET and right superior longitudinal fasciculus damage at high-field MRI revealed a probable neurodegenerative aetiology. The neurological examination disclosed then Gerstmann 's and Balint 's syndromes<disease> , and extrapyramidal signs later appeared , suggesting the diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy associated with corticobasal syndrome<disease>.
