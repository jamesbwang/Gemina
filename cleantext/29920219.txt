  Matrix protease activity is fundamental to developmental tissue patterning and remains influential in adult homeostasis. In cartilage , the principal matrix proteoglycan is aggrecan , the protease-mediated catabolism of which defines arthritis<disease>; however , the pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive aberrant aggrecanolytic activity remain unclear. Human ciliopathies exhibit altered matrix , which has been proposed to be the result of dysregulated hedgehog signaling that is tuned within the primary cilium. Here , we report that disruption of intraflagellar transport protein 88 ( IFT88) , a core ciliary trafficking protein , increases chondrocyte aggrecanase activity in vitro. We find that the receptor for protease endocytosis in chondrocytes , LDL receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP-1) , is unevenly distributed over the cell membrane , often concentrated at the site of cilia assembly. Hypomorphic mutation of IFT88 disturbs this apparent hot spot for protease uptake , increases receptor shedding , and results in a reduced rate of protease clearance from the extracellular space. We propose that IFT88 and/or the cilium regulates the extracellular remodeling of matrix-independently of Hedgehog regulation-by enabling rapid LRP-1-mediated endocytosis of proteases , potentially by supporting the creation of a ciliary pocket. This result highlights new roles for the cilium 's machinery in matrix turnover and LRP-1 function , with potential relevance in a range of diseases.-Coveney , C.
