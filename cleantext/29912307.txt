  Both immediate or deferred switching from a PI/r to DTG may improve lipid profile. NEAT022 is a European , open label , randomized , trial. HIV-infected adults ≥ 50 years or with a Framingham score ≥ 10 % were eligible if HIV<pathogen> RNA < 50 copies/mL. Patients were randomized to switch the PI/r to DTG immediately ( DTG-I) or to deferred switch at week 48 ( DTG-D). Week 96 end-points were: proportion of patients with HIV<pathogen> RNA < 50 copies/ml , percentage change of lipid fractions and adverse events. 415 patients were randomized: 205 to DTG-I and 210 to continue PI/r plus a deferred switch ( DTG-D) at week 48. The primary objective of non-inferiority at week 48 was met. At week 96 , treatment success rate was 92.2 % in DTG-I arm and 87 % in DTG-D arm ( difference 5.2 % , 95 % CI -0.6 to 11). There were 5 virological failures in the DTG-I arm and 5 ( 1 while on PI/r and 4 after switching to DTG) in the DTG-D arm without selection of resistance mutations. There was no significant difference in terms of grade 3 or 4 AE 's or treatment modifying AE 's. Total cholesterol and other lipid fractions ( except HDL) significantly ( p < 0.001) improved both after immediate and deferred switching to DTG overall and regardless of baseline PI/r strata. Both immediate and deferred switching from a PI/r to a DTG regimen in virologically suppressed HIV<pathogen> patients ≥ 50 years old or with a Framingham score ≥ 10 % was highly efficacious , well tolerated and improved lipid profile.
