  To demonstrate the feasibility and long-term performances of a non-apical Micra<pathogen> pacemaker implantation. Fifty-two consecutive patients underwent Micra<pathogen> implantation , targeting a non-apical site of delivery when feasible. Each patient received a regular follow-up ( mean 13 ± 9 months). The first 17 patients were also enrolled in the Micra<pathogen> transcatheter pacing system trial ( Group 1); the remaining ones presented broader indications and included post-extraction subjects ( Group 2). In 19 of 52 patients ( Group 1: 6 % , Group 2: 51 %; P = 0.002) Micra was implanted because of high-risk characteristics that discouraged the implantation of a traditional pacemaker. In 31 of 52 patients ( 60 %) Micra was implanted in a non-apical location , with a lower rate of single delivery compared with apical sites ( 48 % vs. 81 % , P = 0.035) , but without any impact on electrical performance. Pacing threshold remained optimal in the majority of patients ( 94 %) , regardless of the site of implantation ( apical vs. non-apical location: 0.50 vs. 0.52 V/0 .24 ms; P = 0.856) and group membership , with only 6 % of the subjects showing elevated values ( mean 1.92 ± 0.92 V/0 .24 ms) at the last follow-up. No device-related adverse events were registered. Micra<pathogen> pacemaker implant is a safe and effective procedure even in a real life cohort of high-risk patients. A non-apical site of implantation is feasible in the majority of patients allowing stable electrical performance at long-term follow-up.
