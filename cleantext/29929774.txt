  Two-stage screening , involving a self-rating report , followed by a structured interview , has been proposed for identifying clinical high risk of psychosis ( CHR) for nearly two decades. This study used PRIME Screen-Revised ( PS-R) and Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes<disease> ( SIPS) to investigate the predictive validity of the two-stage screening. Of 566 participants who completed two-stage screening in this study , 192 were PS-R (-) and 374 were PS-R ( +). After being interviewed with SIPS , 112 were rated as CHR ( +) , 109 were diagnosed with psychosis , and the other 345 individuals were CHR (-). Those who were rated through SIPS as CHR ( +) and CHR (-) were followed up within 2 years to observe their clinical outcome. Ninety one ( 81.3 %) CHR ( +) and 171 ( 49.6 %) CHR (-) individuals completed the investigation at baseline and the two-year follow-up. The cumulative conversion rate to psychosis was 27.5 % in CHR ( +) group , but only 1.7 % in CHR (-) group , with a significant difference between the two groups ( log-rank test , χ2 = 30.07 , p < 0.001). In terms of two-stage screening , PS-R (-)/ CHR (-) , PS-R (-)/ CHR ( +) , and PS-R ( +)/ CHR (-) groups were viewed as expected negative ( EN) , and the PS-R ( +)/ CHR ( +) group as expected positive ( EP) , and the sensitivity and specificity was 64.3 % and 79.1 % , respectively. Furthermore , Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis showed that EP group were more likely to convert to psychosis than EN group ( log-rank test , χ2 = 16.702 , p < 0.001). Two-stage screening indeed saves much time and alleviates the workload , but may exclude some target individuals. Optimizing self-report scale , and forming a nurse-doctor-interviewer coalition are likely to improve the use of self-rating report and structured interview.
