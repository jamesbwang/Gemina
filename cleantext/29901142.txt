  Hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia is characterized by defective renal phosphate reabsorption and abnormal bone mineralization. Hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia consists of inherited and acquired forms , many of which have unknown aetiology. In the present study , next‑generation sequencing‑based resequencing was used on samples from Chinese subjects with hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia , aiming to detect the spectrum of pathogenic genes in these patients. A total of 86 hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia patients ( ranging from 3 to 70 years old) were recruited. Patients with tumour‑induced osteomalacia ( TIO) , renal tubular acidosis , renal osteodystrophy , and adefovir‑induced Fanconi syndrome<disease> were excluded. Targeted massively parallel resequencing of 196 candidate genes for hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia was performed in the 86 affected unrelated individuals ( cases) and in 100 unrelated healthy controls to identify new genes and mutations in known genes that cause hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia. The results identified seven phosphate‑regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome ( PHEX) mutations ( of which two were novel) and one novel dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1) mutation in eight patients. Following targeted exome sequencing data analysis , 14 candidate disease‑related gene loci were selected , two of which were of most concern regarding disease severity. Further validation of the present results is warranted , with additional sequencing projects and functional tests. To our knowledge , the present study is the largest cohort of cases with hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia to undergo targeted resequencing. The diagnosis and understanding of the molecular aetiologies of these disorders will be improved by this fast and efficient approach.
