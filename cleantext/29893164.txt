  Educational camps have hosted millions of children around the world. However , few studies have described their benefits on weight control and health promotion for overweight and obese children. To investigate the impact of a health educational program for children composed of 5 days of camp and a 12-week follow up on the physical activity level , sedentary behaviour , anthropometric data and food intake in overweight and obese children. 12 children attended the Health Educational Program for Children divided into two phases. Phase 1 consisted of pre-assessments and Phase 2 corresponded to 12 weeks of follow up. Physical activity level , sedentary behaviour and food intake were assessed throughout the questionnaire. After the follow up , 25 % of the children became active ( > 1500 and < 3000 Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks per week). In contrast , the number of sedentary children ( < 600 Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks per week) decreased by 15 % and insufficiently active ( 600-1500 Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks per week) increased by 15 %. The physical activity level of leisure time increased significantly throughout weekdays ( 26.0 %) and weekends ( 14.1 %) after the follow up compared to before the camp. Sedentary behaviour showed a significant reduction of 177.14 and 41.43 minutes on weekdays and weekends , respectively. Before the camp , the consumption of sugar and sweets was out of control ( 100 % inadequate) , and after the intervention , 58.4 % started to consume these foods in a balanced way. The Health Educational Program for Children ( 5-day camp and the 12 weeks of follow up) contributed to an increase in the physical activity level and a reduction in the sedentary behaviour and anthropometric measures in overweight and obese children.
