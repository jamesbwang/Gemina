  The signing of the National Cancer Act in 1971 was designed to take laboratory discoveries rapidly from the bench to the bedside. A `` war on cancer '' had been declared. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy was predicted to cure all cancers , based on the stunning success in treating childhood leukemia<disease>. Breast cancer treatments were primitive; radical mastectomy and radiation were standard of care for disease that had not spread. Ablative endocrine surgery ( oophorectomy , hypophysectomy , and adrenalectomy) was a palliative last option for metastatic breast cancer. However , only 30 % responded , surviving for only 1 or 2 years: every patient soon died. The discovery of the estrogen receptor ( ER) and translation to breast cancer treatment triggered a revolution in women 's health. Two important but interconnected events occurred in 1972 at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology ( WFEB) that would exploit the breast tumor ER as the first target to save lives and prevent breast cancer development. Two new groups of medicines-selective ER modulators ( SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors ( AIs)- would continue the momentum of research at the WFEB to improve women 's health. Here , we recount the important progress made in women 's health based on knowledge of the endocrinology of breast cancer. We propose future opportunities in SERM therapeutics to `` refresh '' the current standards of care for breast cancer treatment. The opportunity is based on emerging knowledge about acquired resistance to long-term adjuvant AI therapy used to treat breast cancer.
