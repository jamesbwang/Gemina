  Modest cold exposures are likely to activate autonomic thermogenic mechanisms due to activation of cutaneous thermal afferents , whereas central thermosensitive neurons set the background tone on which this afferent input is effective. In addition , more prolonged or severe cold exposures that overwhelm cold defense mechanisms would directly activate thermosensitive neurons within the central nervous system. Here , we examined the involvement of the canonical brown adipose tissue ( BAT) sympathoexcitatory efferent pathway in the response to direct local cooling of the preoptic area ( POA) in urethane-chloralose anesthetized rats. With skin temperature and core body temperature maintained between 36 °C and 39 °C , cooling POA temperature by approximately 1-4 °C evoked increases in BAT sympathetic nerve activity ( SNA) , BAT temperature , expired CO
