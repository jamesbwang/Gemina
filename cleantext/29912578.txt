  Adjuvant chemotherapy ( AC) in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) has become a standard of care in patients with stages IIA , IIB , and IIIA after complete tumor resection. Utilization and outcome of AC in routine practice is described in a few studies , with non-conclusive results. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent curative-intent surgery. Data of AC uptake in stages IB ( tumor of ≥ 4 cm in diameter) , II , and IIIA , and reasons of AC omission were evaluated according to medical records. Mortality risk among patients treated with surgery ( only) and different types of AC in routine practice was compared. AC was applied to 79 % of patients with stages IB ( tumor of ≥ 4 cm in diameter) , II , and IIIA , and was associated with an improved median of overall survival ( HR = 0.69; 95 % CI = 0.44-1.06). Significantly longer survival was achieved in the sub-group treated with platinum and oral vinorelbine ( HR = 0.575 , 95 % CI = 0.339-0.974) , and the longest survival was among patients treated with oral vinorelbine and cisplatin ( HR = 0.371 , 95 % CI = 0.168-0.820). AC utilization should be based on co-operation between surgeons , pneumo-oncologists , and patients. Rational use of AC offers better survival in routine practice.
