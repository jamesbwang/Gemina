  Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress ( OS) may increase the activity of arginine methylating enzymes that produce the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA). In addition , it is well documented that OS can significantly decrease the synthesis and/or activity of ADMA degrading enzymes , thus causing ADMA accumulation in biological fluids. Recent reports have focused on circulating methylated arginine concentrations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , a disease characterized by a significant increase in OS. This review discusses the results of these studies and the opportunities for further research in this area.
