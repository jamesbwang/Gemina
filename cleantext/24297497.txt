  The mutation of the Parkin gene is a cause of familial Parkinson 's disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that Parkin also functions as a tumor suppressor. Parkin is an ubiquitin E3 ligase , and plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes implicated in tumorigenesis , including cell cycle , cell proliferation , apoptosis , metastasis , mitophagy and metabolic reprogramming. Here we review the role and mechanism of Parkin in cancer.
