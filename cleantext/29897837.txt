  The superficial layers of the superior colliculus ( sSC) receive retinal input and project to thalamic regions- the dorsal lateral geniculate ( dLGN) and lateral posterior ( LP; or pulvinar) nuclei- that convey visual information to cortex. A critical step towards understanding the functional impact of sSC neurons on these parallel thalamo-cortical pathways is determining whether different classes of sSC neurons , which are known to respond to different features of visual stimuli , innervate overlapping or distinct thalamic targets. Here , we identified a transgenic mouse line that labels sSC neurons that project to dLGN but not LP. We utilized selective expression of fluorophores and channelrhodopsin in this and previously characterized mouse lines to demonstrate that distinct cell types give rise to sSC projections to dLGN and LP. We further show that the glutamatergic sSC cell type that projects to dLGN also provides input to the sSC cell type that projects to LP. These results clarify the cellular origin of parallel sSC-thalamo-cortical pathways and reveal an interaction between these pathways via local connections within the sSC.
