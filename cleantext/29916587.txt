  This paper aims to review the steps that the Italian Society Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene ( SIMLII) has undertaken over the past two decades in the context of a process of integration with quality systems , resulting in several initiatives including the production of different tools for the updating and professional qualification of the Occupational Health Physician ( OHP). The choice of focusing on a propositional-formative model such as the guidelines ( GL) and the choice of the topics to be dealt with , was based on the need to provide the OHP with appropriate tools in order to face the complexity , specificity and rapidity of knowledge evolution which characterize our discipline. After the release of the first set of instruments ( 25 GL) over the five-year period 2003-2008 , it became necessary to adhere to the guidelines of the GL National Program , distinguishing GL 's evidence based , from consensus/ orientation documents or technical assessments. In recent years , the introduction of the AGREE method has been of great interest and importance for assessing the quality of content and recommendations , also considering the recent legislation provisions on the criminal and civil liability of the Physician.
