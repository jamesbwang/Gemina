  Breast cancer survivors often report a decrease in physical activity levels and quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore whether a `` Kyusho Jitsu '' martial arts intervention is feasible and can improve general well-being and physical activity levels in breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors ( N = 51) were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention group participated in a 24-week Kyusho Jitsu intervention. Both groups were assessed at baseline , 3 , and 6 months. Analysis of original data showed several significant improvements in favor of the intervention group , but also some of the control group. Sensitivity analysis supports these findings. No adverse events were observed. To our knowledge this is the first study showing that a holistic Kyusho Jitsu martial arts intervention can be feasible and effective for breast cancer survivors.
