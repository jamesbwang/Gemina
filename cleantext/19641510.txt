  Cadmium ( Cd) is a toxic metal capable of damaging brain. Studies have demonstrated that Cd can induce apoptosis in neuronal cells. The CD95/APO -1 ( Fas)/ Fas Ligand ( FasL) signaling pathway is one of the primary apoptosis pathways , but the role and regulatory mechanism of this pathway in neuronal cells remain unclear. Here , we demonstrated the underlying mechanism of the Fas/FasL system involving the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in neuronal cells. Primary rat cerebral cortical neurons and PC12 cells were exposed to Cd , which significantly activated expression of Fas , FasL , Fas-associated death domain ( FADD) and cleaved caspase-8. However , expression of cleaved caspase-8 decreased at 20 ÂµM Cd in primary cerebral cortical neurons. Importantly , Cd-induced apoptotic morphological changes and increase in the apoptosis rate were partially blocked by Z-IETD-FMK , which is a specific inhibitor of caspase-8. Cd-mediated increase of apoptosis rate was inhibited by anti-FasL antibody. Furthermore , our data revealed that Z-IETD-FMK also blocked increase of truncated BH3 interacting domain death agonist ( tBID)/ BID , decrease of the B-cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2)/ Bcl-2 associate X protein ( Bax) ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) , release of cytochrome c , as well as cleavage of caspase-9/ 3 and poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) induced by Cd. Taken together , our results demonstrate that the Fas/FasL-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway plays an important role in Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis.
