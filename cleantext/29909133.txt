  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG) is the only vaccine available against tuberculosis<disease> and the tuberculin skin test ( TST) is the most widely used method to detect BCG take. However , subjects may remain TST-negative , even after several BCG administrations. To investigate some of the potential reasons underlying this inability of developing tuberculin sensitivity in response to BCG we compared the effect of different mycobacterial stimuli in the groups differently responding to tuberculin. TST was performed on 71 healthy adults aged 25-30 years , who had received BCG in their childhood , and considered TST-positive at ≥ 10 mm. Dendritic cells ( DCs) were incubated with PPD , live BCG or rBCGhIL-18 , producing human IL-18. The latter strain was used to investigate whether the production of IL-18 could overcome some of the immune read-out limitations in the TST-negative subjects. CD86 , CD80 , CD40 , and DC-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin ( DC-SIGN) expression was analysed by flow cytometry and IL-10 , IL-23 and IP-10 secretion in culture supernatants by ELISA. In DCs-T cell co-cultures with naive and memory CD4
