  Hydrothermal/solvothermal treatments have been widely used to prepare carbonized polymer dots ( CPDs) through the condensation and carbonization of small molecules and/or polymers. However , the basic scientific issues , such as the nucleation and growth process , morphology and size control , yield increase , and photoluminescence ( PL) mechanism have not been well investigated. In this work , enlightened by the principle of soap-free emulsion polymerization , CPDs with ultrahigh yields ( ca. 85 %) were obtained by hydrothermal addition polymerization and carbonization ( HAPC) of monomers. The unprecedented initiator-induced addition polymerization was exploited to synthesize CPDs for the first time. As expected in typical emulsion polymerization processes , the developed HAPC method can produce CPDs with designed sizes by systematically regulating the HAPC parameter , uncovering an unprecedented strategy for regulating the size of CPDs. In addition , the obtained CPDs were provided with high photoluminescence quantum yields ( PLQY) up to 45.58 % , while the relationship between the photoluminescence ( PL) mechanism and chemical structure was investigated. The viscosity parameter was first adopted to measure the polymer property of CPDs. Moreover , the ultrahigh yield and low-cost CPDs elicited the high-performance CPDs/PVA nanocomposite ( PVA = poly ( vinyl alcohol)) with fluorescence and room-temperature phosphorescence dual-mode emission , demonstrating potential for advanced anti-counterfeit applications.
