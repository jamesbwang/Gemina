  Conventional small-molecule antibiotics are facing a significant challenge of the rapidly developed drug resistance of pathogens. In contrast , antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) , an important component for innate host defenses , are now under intensive investigation as a promising antimicrobial agent for combating drug resistant pathogens. Most AMPs can effectively kill a broad spectrum of pathogens via physical disruption of microbial cellular membranes<symptom> , which is identified to be difficult to develop resistance. However , the clinical applications of AMPs are still greatly limited by several inherent impediments , such as high cost of production , potential hemolysis<symptom> or toxicity , and liability to proteinase degradation. Recently , cationic poly ( α-amino acid) s with structures mimicking the AMPs are found to have excellent antimicrobial activity. These polymers , termed `` antimicrobial poly ( α-amino acid) s ( APAAs) , '' have some advantages over AMPs , such as easy production and modification , prolonged antimicrobial activity , low cytotoxicity , and enhanced stability to protease degradation. Here , a brief introduction of mechanisms and affecting factors of microbial killing by AMPs is first presented , followed by a systematic illustration of recent advances in design and preparation of biomimetic APAAs and a perspective in this field.
