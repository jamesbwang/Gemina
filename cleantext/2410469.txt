  In Korea , lung cancer is a common cancer , and has the highest mortality rate in both males and females. Approximately 80 % of lung cancer is due to smoking , and the remaining cases are known to be due to genetic factors , history of respiratory<disease> disease<disease> , infection , diet , and occupational and environmental factors. Since the occupational and environmental hazards may differ from region to region , the lung cancer risk may differ too. To identify this , we selected seven metropolitan cities , and compared occupational and environmental hazards. Furthermore , we calculated smoking rate adjusted standardized rate ratio ( ratio of 10-year cumulative age-standardized incidence rate of lung cancer during the 2000 ‚Åª 2009 period at target region versus reference region) to compare the regional lung cancer risk. The result showed that the emissions and concentrations of air pollutant were higher in high-risk regions , and the risk of lung cancer was significantly elevated in such area. In this study , we simultaneously consider the cumulative incidence , age-standardization and smoking rate adjustment. Therefore , we can conclude that the validity of the finding of this study is higher than that of past studies. In conclusion , the occupational and environmental hazards have an effect on lung cancer.
