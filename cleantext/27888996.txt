  To evaluate the effectiveness of telephone health coaching delivered by a nurse to support self management in a primary care population with mild symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Multicentre randomised controlled trial. 71 general practices in four areas of England. 577 patients with Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale scores of 1 or 2 , recruited from primary care COPD registers with spirometry confirmed diagnosis. Patients were randomised to telephone health coaching ( n = 289) or usual care ( n = 288). Telephone health coaching intervention delivered by nurses , underpinned by Social Cognitive Theory. The coaching promoted accessing smoking cessation services , increasing physical activity , medication management , and action planning ( 4 sessions over 11 weeks; postal information at weeks 16 and 24). The nurses received two days of training. The usual care group received a leaflet about COPD. The primary outcome was health related quality of life at 12 months using the short version of the St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ-C). The intervention was delivered with good fidelity: 86 % of scheduled calls were delivered; 75 % of patients received all four calls. 92 % of patients were followed-up at six months and 89 % at 12 months. There was no difference in SGRQ-C total score at 12 months ( mean difference -1.3 , 95 % confidence interval -3.6 to 0.9 , P = 0.23). Compared with patients in the usual care group , at six months follow-up , the intervention group reported greater physical activity , more had received a care plan ( 44 % A new telephone health coaching intervention to promote behaviour change in primary care patients with mild symptoms of dyspnoea did lead to changes in self management activities , but did not improve health related quality of life.
