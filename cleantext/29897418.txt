  The rapid accumulation of both sequence and phenotype data generated by high-throughput methods has increased the need to store and analyze data on distributed storage and computing systems. Efficient data management across these heterogeneous systems requires a workflow management system to simplify the task of analysis through automation and make large-scale bioinformatics analyses accessible and reproducible. We developed SciApps , a web-based platform for reproducible bioinformatics workflows. The platform is designed to automate the execution of modular Agave apps and support execution of workflows on local clusters or in a cloud. Two workflows , one for association and one for annotation , are provided as exemplar scientific use cases. https://www.sciapps.org. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
