  Metabolic bone disease of prematurity is characterised by disordered bone mineralisation and is therefore an increased fracture risk. Preterm infants are especially at risk due to incomplete in utero bone accretion during the last trimester. Currently , diagnosing metabolic bone disease mainly relies on biochemistry and radiographs. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative ultrasound ( US) are used less frequently. However , biochemical measurements correlate poorly with bone mineralisation and although scoring systems exist for metabolic bone disease , radiographs are subjective and do not detect early features of osteopenia. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is the reference standard for determining bone density in older children and adults. However , challenges with this method include movement artefact , difficulty scanning small and sick infants and a lack of normative data for young children. Quantitative US has a relatively low cost , is radiation-free and portable , and may hence be suitable for assessing bone status in preterm infants. This review aims to provide an overview of the use of quantitative US in detecting metabolic bone disease in preterm infants.
