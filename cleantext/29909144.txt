  Mutations in the phosphodiesterase 8B gene ( PDE8B) were recently linked to autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration clinically presenting as slowly progressive parkinsonism. PDE8B degrades cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) , a second messenger involved in dopamine signaling. Dopamine deficiency is the pathognomonic feature of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Few studies have explored the role of PDE8B in PD. We aim to address the genetic contribution of PDE8B in early-onset and familial PD in a Taiwanese population. Among 642 participants , we sequenced the exon containing previously reported mutations and exon-intron boundaries of PDE8B in 196 PD pedigrees without known PD-causative gene mutations , 207 patients with early-onset PD ( age of onset < 50 years) , and 239 ethnicity-matched controls. We did not find any coding variants or previously reported mutations , suggesting that PDE8B mutations are not a common cause of familial or early-onset PD in this Taiwanese population.
