  Cardiovascular risk is increased in Rheumatoid Arthritis<disease> and it is associated with higher morbility and mortality. Few studies have evaluated the lipid profile in early arthritis<disease> ( EA). To study the lipid profile in patients with EA and its association with disease activity ( DA). We studied 31 patients with diagnosis of EA and a control group , with age , gender and cardiovascular risk factors matched , who were attended to Rheumatology Unit at CÃ³rdoba Hospital from January 2011 to May 2013. We evaluated demographic data , lipid profile and DA by DAS28. 31 patients were included with mean age of 42.3 years old , 87 % female , the cholesterol level was 191.9 mg/dl , HDL 54 , LDL 115.8 , Triglycerides 117,6; and 31 patients were included in the control group with average age of 42.7 years old , and cholesterol level of 198.7 mg/ dl , HDL 56.9 LDL 122.6 , Triglycerides 99.6 ( p NS). Regards disease activity , in the low DA group the Cholesterol level was 196.3 , LDL 115.8 , HDL 62 y triglycerides 95.17 , and in the Moderate and High DA the Cholesterol level was 190 mg/ dl , LDL 115 , HDL 52 y triglycerides 122,9 ( p NS) The lipid profile was normal and it was not associated with DA in EA patients.
