  Both-side synchronous involvement has been reported to account for 7-24 % of ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma ( OAML). We conducted a retrospective analysis to identify the clinical features and treatment outcomes of synchronous bilateral OAML ( SB-OAML) by treatment modality. We analyzed patients with a histologic diagnosis of SB-OAML , excluding metachronous bilateral involved OAML. We enrolled a total of 95 patients for this analysis , 36 males and 59 females; the median patient age was 42 years ( range 16-77 years). Eleven ( 11.6 %) patients had been treated with chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy ( eight R-CVP , two CVP , and one R-CHOP). The median number of treatments was 6 ( range 6-8); there were 9 complete responses ( CRs; 81.8 %) and 2 partial responses ( PRs; 18.2 %). Nearly all patients ( 88.4 %) received radiotherapy in both eyes , and the median radiation dose was 27 Gy ( range 20-40 Gy) to each eye; 68 CRs ( 80.9 %) and 14 PRs ( 16.7 %) were achieved. Ten-year progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) rates were 79.8 and 91.1 % , respectively. Radiotherapy continued to be an independent prognostic marker , with the hazard of progression ( P = 0.036). Eleven patients ( 13.1 %) had surgery for cataract treatment during follow-up , and patients who received low-dose radiation ( < 30.3 Gy) experienced fewer cataract operations. SB-OAML was predominantly observed in young females , and they had good response and prognosis regardless of treatment modalities. Low-dose radiotherapy to both eyes showed a tendency of longer PFS than did chemotherapy and could decrease cataract operations.
