  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-delta ( CaMKIIδ) activity is enhanced during hyperglycemia and has been shown to alter intracellular calcium handling in cardiomyocytes , ultimately leading to reduced cardiac performance. However , the effects of CaMKIIδ on cardiac contractility during type 2 diabetes are undefined. We examined the expression and activation of CaMKIIδ in right atrial appendages from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 7 patients per group) with preserved ejection fraction , and also in right ventricular tissue from Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats ( ZDF) ( n = 5-10 animals per group) during early diabetic cardiac dysfunction , using immunoblot. We also measured whole heart function of ZDF and control rats using echocardiography. Then we measured contraction and relaxation parameters of isolated trabeculae from ZDF to control rats in the presence and absence of CaMKII inhibitors. CaMKIIδ phosphorylation ( at Thr287) was increased in both the diabetic human and animal tissue , indicating increased CaMKIIδ activation in the type 2 diabetic heart. Basal cardiac contractility and relaxation were impaired in the cardiac muscles from the diabetic rats , and CaMKII inhibition with KN93 partially restored contractility and relaxation. Autocamtide-2-related-inhibitor peptide ( AIP) , another CaMKII inhibitor that acts via a different mechanism than KN93 , fully restored cardiac contractility and relaxation. Our results indicate that CaMKIIδ plays a key role in modulating performance of the diabetic heart , and moreover , suggest a potential therapeutic role for CaMKII inhibitors in improving myocardial function during type 2 diabetes.
