  The petrochemical industry is one of the most important industries in the world economy. In the largest oil-producing countries , more than half of GDP is generated by hydrocarbons production and refining. Reduction of oil prices and new environmental regulations are forcing petrochemical companies to improve their energy efficiency. Improvement of the energy efficiency of Crude oil distillation process at atmospheric vacuum distillation unit ( AVDU) with a capacity of 3.3 million ton per year is considered in this paper. The amount of fuel spent for reprocessing of one ton of crude oil has been defined and it is 3.79 kg of natural gas. This paper shows the ways to achieve the objectives of retrofit in the context of administrative and technical restrictions. The retrofit goal was achieved by the retrofit of the heat exchange network , which allowed reducing gas consumption by 0.98 t/h ( natural gas). The provided case studies show the pathway for efficient retrofit of crude oil distillation and most profitable ways for investment taking into account various administrative and technical constraints. The results of this work allow achieving reduction of energy consumption by 26 %.
