  In the southernmost part of coast of China , two height forms of Spartina alterniflora , tall and short , have invaded Leizhou Peninsula within the last decade. However , the effect of different height forms of Spartina alterniflora on plant-microbe interaction has not been clarified. Here , the community structures of rhizosphere bacteria and the abundance of N- and S-cycling functional genes associated with selected S. alterniflora were investigated in the field and a common garden. The community structure of tall-form S. alterniflora was distinct from short-form S. alterniflora at OTU level in the field , even after transplantation into a common garden. The abundance of bacterial amoA , nirS , and nosZ in tall S. alterniflora was significantly greater than those in short S. alterniflora in the field; however , this difference disappeared in a 1-year common garden experiment. These results suggested that compared with the tall-form S. alterniflora , the rhizosphere of short-form S. alterniflora harbored fewer nitrification-denitrification related microorganisms , which might benefit from conserving N in an N limited habitat. Together , our results suggested that tall- and short-form S. alterniflora can host their specific rhizosphere microbial communities and had different strategies of N usage via selecting the composition of rhizosphere bacterial assemblages , which in turn might determine the growth and invasiveness of S. alterniflora in its introduced range.
