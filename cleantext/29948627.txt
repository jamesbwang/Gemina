  Person-centered care has been gaining prominence in behavioral health care , and service planning has shifted towards `` person-centered care planning '' ( PCCP) , where individuals , in partnership with providers , identify life goals and interventions. A strong therapeutic alliance has been identified as key to a person-centered approach , but little is known about how the therapeutic relationship influences person-centered processes and outcomes. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design , this study investigated: ( 1) the association between the therapeutic alliance and PCCP , and ( 2) how the therapeutic relationship influences the process and outcomes of PCCP. Quantitative analyses found that a strong working alliance predicted greater personcenteredness. Qualitative analyses revealed two central themes: ( 1) the importance of connection , continuity , and calibration of the relationship to set the right conditions for PCCP , and ( 2) PCCP as a vehicle for engagement. Findings demonstrated that the therapeutic alliance is inextricably linked to the PCCP process , each influencing the other.
