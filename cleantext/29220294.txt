  A 61-year-old female patient with chronic hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection was diagnosed with liposarcoma in a community hospital. Fine needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Abdominal computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) showed that the mass adhered to and constricted the main trunk and branch of the superior mesenteric vein ( SMV) , especially the ileocolic vein , and collateral circulation was observed during the vascular reconstruction scan. The abdominal liposarcoma was resected. Because of the collateral circulation , devascularization of the SMV was attempted , and we resected the eroded SMV. The condition of the blood vessels was evaluated 20 d after surgery using CTA , which showed that the SMV had disappeared. Significant improvements in SMV collateral circulation and the inferior mesenteric vein were observed after vascular reconstruction. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course except for transient gastroplegia. Twenty months after surgery , the patient had a recurrence of liposarcoma. She underwent tumor resection to remove the distal small intestine and right hemicolon. We learned that ( 1) direct devascularization of the main SMV trunk without a vein graft is possible. The presence of collateral circulation can increase the success rate of patients undergoing radical surgery and prevent the occurrence of serious postoperative complications. In addition , ( 2) this case demonstrated the clinical value of 3D reconstruction.
