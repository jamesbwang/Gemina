  Stromal-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 , also known as CXCL12) and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 play important roles in brain repair after ischemic stroke , as SDF-1/ CXCR4/CXCR7 chemokine signaling is critical for recruiting stem cells to sites of ischemic injury. Upregulation of SDF-1/ CXCR4/CXCR7 chemokine signaling in the ischemic regions has been well-documented in the animal models of ischemic stroke , but not in human ischemic brain. Here , we found that protein expression of SDF-1 and CXCR7 , but not CXCR4 , were significantly increased in the cortical peri-infarct regions ( penumbra) after ischemic stroke in human , compared with adjacent normal tissues and control subjects. Double-label fluorescence immunohistochemistry shows that SDF-1 and CXCR4 proteins were expressed in neuronal cells and astrocytes in the normal brain tissue and peri-infarct regions. CXCR7 protein was also observed in neuronal cells and astrocytes in the normal cortical regions , but predominantly in astrocytes in the penumbra of ischemic brain. Our data suggest that ischemic stroke in human leads to an increase in the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR7 , but not CXCR4 , in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex. Our findings suggest that chemokine SFD-1 is expressed not only in animal models of stroke , but also in the human brain after an ischemic injury. In addition , unlike animals , CXCR7 may be the primary receptor of SDF-1 in human stroke brain.
