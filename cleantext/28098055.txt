  An inadequate clinical outcome after conservatively treated radial head fractures is not uncommon. We analyzed the subjective limitations , objective complaints , and surgical procedures for radial head fractures initially treated conservatively. Between 2007 and 2016 , 70 patients ( 42 men , 28 women) who suffered from fracture sequelae after conservatively treated radial head fractures were examined. Demographic ( age , 41.8 years , range , 16-75 years) and clinical data ( pain , range of motion , instability) were retrospectively evaluated. The average time to surgery after trauma was 50 months ( range , 5-360 months). In 38 cases , radial head fractures were initially treated with immobilization for 3.4 weeks ( range , 1-8 weeks). Physiotherapeutic treatment was performed in 39 cases. In only half of the cases was retrospective Mason classification possible: 20 type I , 8 type II , 5 type III , and 2 type IV. Of the 70 patients , 53 had posttraumatic elbow stiffness; 34 had isolated lateral and four patients isolated medial ligament instability. There were eight cases with a combination of lateral and medial ligament instability and 27 cases of elbow stiffness combined with instability. An average of 1.2 ( range , 1-4) surgical procedures per patient were performed. In all , 64 patients underwent elbow arthroscopy with arthrolysis and additional treatment depending on other injuries. The range of motion improved on average from preoperative flexion/extension of 131-15-0 째 to postoperative flexion/extension of 135-5-0 째 ( gain in flexion: 4.2 째 and extension: 10.6 째). Conservative treatment of radial head fractures does not always yield good results. Reasons for a poor outcome include chronic instability , cartilage damage , stiffness , or a combination thereof. Improved outcomes can be achieved via arthroscopic arthrolysis.
