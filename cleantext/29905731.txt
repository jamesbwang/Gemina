  Resonant cavity-enhanced Kerr frequency combs have been demonstrated using a range of cavity materials. Regardless of cavity type , one fundamental challenge is achieving low or flat dispersion while maintaining high-efficiency four-wave mixing ( FWM). Here we demonstrate a Raman-Kerr frequency comb using a Zr-doped silica hybrid toroidal microcavity. The Zr-doped layer both flattens the dispersion and increases the stimulated Raman scattering efficiency. This enhancement enables the generation of FWM around both the Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering emissions. As a result , the Raman-Kerr frequency comb spans more than 300 nm in the near-IR region with less than 5.2 mW of input power.
