  The diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS) is based on morphology and cytogenetics. However , limited information is currently available on the interobserver concordance of the assessment of dysplastic lineages ( < 10 % or ≥ 10 % in bone<disease> marrow ( BM)). The revised International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS-R) described a new threshold ( 2 %) for BM blasts. However , the interobserver concordance of the categories ( 0- ≤ 2 % and > 2- < 5 %) has limited data. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the assessment of dysplastic lineages and IPSS-R reproducibility. Our study was divided into two Steps. In each Step , the microscopic examinations were performed separately by two morphologists. Regarding the category of BM blasts ≤ 2 % and > 2- < 5 % , interobserver agreement was more than ` moderate ' in all pairs ( kappa test: 0.43-0.90). Regarding dysgranulopoiesis ( dysG) and dyserythropoiesis ( dysE) in BM , interobserver agreement was more than ` moderate ' in all pairs ( kappa test , dysG: 0.45-0.96 , dysE: 0.45-0.81). Regarding the category of dysmegakaryopoiesis ( dysMgk) in BM , interobserver agreement was more than moderate in 4 out of 5 pairs ( kappa test: 0.58-1.00) , and was fair for one pair ( kappa test: 0.37). We consider that high interobserver concordance may be possible for the BM blast cell count ( ≤ 2 % or > 2- < 5 %) and dysplasia ( < 10 % or ≥ 10 %) of each lineage.
