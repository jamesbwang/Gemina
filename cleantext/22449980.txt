  Activation of adiponectin receptors ( AdipoRs) by its natural ligand , adiponectin has been known to be involved in modulating critical metabolic processes such as glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation as demonstrated by a number of in vitro and in vivo studies over last two decades. These findings suggest that AdipoRs ' agonists could be developed into a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , especially for type II diabetes , a long-term metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar , insulin resistance , and relative lack of insulin. Because of limitations in production of biologically active adiponectin , adiponectin-mimetic AdipoRs ' agonists have been suggested as alternative ways to expand the opportunity to develop anti-diabetic agents. Based on crystal structure of AdipoR1 , we designed AdipoR1 's peptide agonists using protein-peptide docking simulation and screened their receptor binding abilities and biological functions via surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) and biological analysis. Three candidate peptides , BHD1028 , BHD43 , and BHD44 were selected and confirmed to activate AdipoR1-mediated signal pathways. In order to enhance the stability and solubility of peptide agonists , candidate peptides were PEGylated. PEGylated BHD1028 exhibited its biological activity at nano-molar concentration and could be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes. Also , SPR and virtual screening techniques utilized in this study may potentially be applied to other peptide-drug screening processes against membrane receptor proteins.
