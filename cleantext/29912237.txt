  The aim of this study was to report clinical outcomes in patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons ( PCB) for in-stent restenosis ( ISR) in both bare metal ( BMS) and drug-eluting stent ( DES). Between May 2009 and December 2015 , we treated 155 ISR in 140 patients. At recruitment , 35 % of patients had diabetes. Among the lesions<symptom> , 125 were first occurrence ( 55 within BMS and 70 within DES) and 30 recurrent; 24 ISR were multi-metal layered. Mean reference diameter was 2.79 ± 0.52 mm and mean lesion<symptom> length 13.2 ± 7.1 mm. PCB use included 32 Dior I , 97 InPact Falcon , 18 Panthera Lux , and 8 Restore DEB. At a median follow-up of 442 days , we observed 18 target lesion<symptom> revascularizations ( TLR) , one myocardial infarction , 3 cardiac deaths , and 5 non-cardiac deaths. TLR occurrence differed according to type of ISR ( 4 % within BMS , 14 % within DES , 28 % within recurrent ISR; p < 0.05). TLR was associated with PCB type ( 35 % Dior I , 9 % InPact Falcon , 0 % Panthera Lux and Restore DEB; p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed that first-generation PCB without a carrier ( hazard ratio ( HR) 2.50 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.96-6.50; p = 0.06) and recurrent ISR ( HR 7.76 , 95 % CI 1.56-38.66; p = 0.01) correlated with subsequent TLR. Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of PCB for ISR treatment both within BMS and DES. PCB type and recurrent ISR correlate with subsequent TLR.
