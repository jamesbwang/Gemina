  While technological applications demand the development of reliable computational techniques and accurate experiments for the characterization of diradicals , these species are still challenging systems for both theory and experiments. The singlet-triplet energy gap , the J-term of the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck spin Hamiltonian , is the most significant quantity; its measurement and computational evaluation may serve for understanding and controlling magnetism at the molecular scale. In this framework , we report a study of three diradicals containing one or two nitronyl-nitroxide species. Using Difference Dedicated Configuration Interaction ( DDCI) calculations , we investigate the multiconfigurational character of the O-N-C-N-O fragment of this unit. We find that a computational scheme that takes this nature into account is necessary to confidently obtain reliable values of the spin-spin coupling J. In addition , we show that the reduced DDCI2 scheme with a CAS ( 2,2) reference , which can reproduce experimental data in some cases , provides quite poor results in the present context.
