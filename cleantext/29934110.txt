  Life expectancy of patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer ( LS-SCLC) continues to rise; thus , characterization of long-term toxicities is essential. Although there are emerging data linking cardiac irradiation doses with survival for non-small cell lung cancer , there are currently minimal data on cardiac-specific mortality ( CSM) in LS-SCLC. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate CSM between left- and right-sided cases. The Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database was queried for stage I-III primary SCLC patients receiving radiotherapy; CSM was compared between left- and right-sided diseases. Accounting for mortality from other causes , Gray 's test compared cumulative incidences of CSM between both groups. Multiple multivariate models examined the independent effect of laterality on CSM , including the Fine and Gray competing risk model and the Cox proportional hazards model. Of 19,692 patients , 7991 ( 41 %) were left-sided and 11,701 ( 59 %) were right-sided. Left-sided patients experienced significantly higher CSM overall ( 3.3 % vs. 2.6 % , p = 0.004). Laterality was an independent predictor of CSM in the overall population in the Fine and Gray competing risk model ( p = 0.006) as well as the Cox proportional hazards model ( p = 0.007). The overall hazard ratio for CSM by disease laterality was 1.27 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.08-1.50). Laterality had no statistical association with non-cardiac mortality in the Fine and Gray competing risk model ( p = 0.130). Although causation between radiotherapy and CSM in LS-SCLC can not be stated based on these data , we encourage clinical attentiveness to cardiac-sparing radiotherapy for LS-SCLC , along with further investigation evaluating dosimetric correlates for cardiotoxicity.
