  The development of lipodystrophy is associated with the long-term use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART). We assessed agreement between patient-reported lipodystrophy and body composition measures using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) and developed objective measures to define lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy in black South Africans. One hundred and eighty-seven ART-na√Øve HIV-infected adults were enrolled in a 24-month longitudinal study. Self-reported information on regional fat loss and fat gain , anthropometry , and DXA measures were collected at baseline , three , six , 12 , 18 , and 24 months after starting ART. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to describe the performance of anthropometric variables using change in limb and trunk fat measured by DXA , as the reference standard. The proportion of men and women who developed lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy increased over the 24-month period , with lipoatrophy occurring more frequently in men ( 21 % versus 10 %). In women , lipoatrophy was best determined by thigh skinfold thickness ( 80.3 % correctly classified) and mid-arm circumference ( 77.6 % correctly classified). None of the anthropometric measures performed well for defining lipoatrophy in men. Anthropometric measures performed well for defining lipoatrophy in women , but not lipohypertrophy.
