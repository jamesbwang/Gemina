  A growing body of evidence suggests that cognition is embodied and grounded. Abstract concepts , though , remain a significant theoretical challenge. A number of researchers have proposed that language makes an important contribution to our capacity to acquire and employ concepts , particularly abstract ones. In this essay , I critically examine this suggestion and ultimately defend a version of it. I argue that a successful account of how language augments cognition should emphasize its symbolic properties and incorporate a view of embodiment that recognizes the flexible , multimodal and task-related nature of action , emotion and perception systems. On this view , language is an ontogenetically disruptive cognitive technology that expands our conceptual reach.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
