  The origin of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science , underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952 , Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state , giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature , and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently , the theory was extended to include noisy activator-inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly , this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters , in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator-inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice , we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator-inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria , producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms , if driven by stochasticity , can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis , arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.
