  Fluoridation of America 's drinking water was among the great public health achievements of the 20th century. Yet there is a paucity of studies from the past 3 decades investigating its dental health benefits in the U.S.. This cross-sectional study sought to evaluate associations between availability of community water fluoridation ( CWF) and dental<disease> caries<disease> experience in the U.S. child and adolescent population. County-level estimates of the percentage of population served by CWF ( % CWF) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Water Fluoridation Reporting System were merged with dental examination data from 10 y of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( 1999 to 2004 and 2011 to 2014). Dental<disease> caries<disease> experience in the primary dentition ( decayed and filled tooth surfaces ( dfs)) was calculated for 7,000 children aged 2 to 8 y and in the permanent dentition ( decayed , missing , and filled tooth surfaces ( DMFS)) for 12,604 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 y. Linear regression models estimated associations between % CWF and dental<disease> caries<disease> experience with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics: age , sex , race/ethnicity , rural-urban location , head-of-household education , and period since last dental visit. Sensitivity analysis excluded counties fluoridated after 1998. In unadjusted analysis , caries<disease> experience in the primary dentition was lower in counties with â‰¥ 75 % CWF ( mean dfs = 3.3; 95 % confidence limit ( CL) = 2.8 , 3.7) than in counties with < 75 % CWF ( mean dfs = 4.6; 95 % CL = 3.9 , 5.4) , a prevented fraction of 30 % ( 95 % CL = 11 , 48). The difference was also statistically significant , although less pronounced , in the permanent dentition: mean DMFS ( 95 % CL) was 2.2 ( 2.0 , 2.4) and 1.9 ( 1.8 , 2.1) , respectively , representing a prevented fraction of 12 % ( 95 % CL = 1 , 23). Statistically significant associations likewise were seen when % CWF was modeled as a continuum , and differences tended to increase in covariate-adjusted analysis and in sensitivity analysis. These findings confirm a substantial caries-preventive benefit of CWF for U.S. children and that the benefit is most pronounced in primary teeth.
