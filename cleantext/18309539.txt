  Esophageal lung is a rare communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation in which the main bronchus arising from the trachea is absent. The affected lung is usually hypoplastic and aerated via an anomalous airway originating from the esophagus. Other anomalies such as esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula<disease> or VACTERL ( vertebral defects , anal atresia , cardiac defects , tracheoesophageal fistula<disease> , renal anomalies , and limb abnormalities) association can co-exist. The initial radiographic findings may be normal , but subsequent imaging usually shows progressive and recurrent lung collapse , probably because of recurrent aspiration through the anomalous airway and poor compliance of the affected lung during breathing. In this report , we describe a neonate with esophageal lung and rare associated anomalies , including anorectal malformation , pulmonary artery sling , and inferior vena cava interruption with azygous continuation. To our knowledge , this is the first report of esophageal lung with such associations.
