  Computational methodologies have immense potential to delineate the dynamic conformations of glycoconjugates including gangliosides , thereby characterizing the conformational adaptability of their glycans upon interacting with various target proteins. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to effectively explore the vast conformational spaces of large , branched carbohydrate moieties. When experimentally validated using NMR , molecular simulations can provide dynamical views of molecular recognition events involving the ganglioside glycans.
