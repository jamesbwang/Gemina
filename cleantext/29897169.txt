  Since 1999 , the development of more than 100 `` Maisons des Adolescents '' ( MDAs) has enabled young persons to gain access to specific care in integrated youth-friendly facilities in France. To contribute to the development and standardization of international youth-friendly health care services , this review provides insight into the French MDA facilities. This socio-historical analysis includes a systematic review of articles referring to the MDAs ( selection through title and/or abstract) , ministry reports and newspaper articles , from 1999 to 2018. If the various medical programmes of MDAs depend on the priorities of local teams rather as well as on official regulations , all MDAs offer the following essential services: a `` Health and Prevention Space '' open daily; multidisciplinary consultations; a mobile team visiting youth hospitalized in medical units; a mobile team able to meet adolescents at their homes; an open centre for art workshops; refresher and remedial courses for school work; network meetings and parent support groups. The MDAs from the start addressed an age group ( young people aged 11-21 years) rather than an illness. They thus provide primary prevention for adolescents according to the World Health Organization definition of health as `` a state of complete physical , mental and social well-being. '' This medical and political movement was shaped by the epistemological background of its first leaders. Although more cohort studies to evaluate their early interventions would be useful , the success of the MDA network is already widely acknowledged by users , professionals and policy makers.
