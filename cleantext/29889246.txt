  It has been well-established that there is variation in the strength and direction of the relationship between circulating glucocorticoids ( GCs) and fitness. When studies demonstrate such variation or the direction of the GC-fitness relationship is unexpected , the results are often attributed to context-dependency. However , descriptors of context can be vague ( e.g. `` environmental context '') and few studies explicitly test how the optimal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis response to stressors varies across specific contexts. Although existing hypotheses create a strong foundation for understanding GC-fitness relationships , many do not provide explicit predictions of how , when , and why the relationships will change. Here , we discuss three broad factors which we expect to shape the relationships between HPA axis activity and fitness metrics: 1) whether the HPA axis-mediated response matches the challenge , 2) the intensity and frequency of challenges , and 3) life history. We also make predictions for how these factors might affect GC-fitness relationships and discuss ways to test these predictions. Observational studies , experimental manipulations of context , and large-scale cross-species comparisons will be critical to understanding the observed variation in GC-fitness relationships.
