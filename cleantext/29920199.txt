  A series of novel well-defined 8-hydroxyquinoline ( HQ)- containing thermoresponsive amphiphilic diblock copolymers ( poly ( styrene- co-5- ( 2-methacryloylethyloxy-methyl) -8-quinolinol)- b-poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) P ( St- co-MQ)- b-PNIPAm ( P1 ,2) , P ( NIPAm- co-MQ)- b-PSt ( P3 ,4)) and triblock copolymer poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide)- b-poly ( methyl-methacrylate- co-5- ( 2-methacryloylethyloxymethyl) -8-quinolinol)- b-polystyrene PNIPAm- b-P ( MMA- co-MQ)- b-PSt ( P5) were prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer ( RAFT) polymerization , and their self-assembly behaviors were studied. Block copolymer P1-P5-stabilized gold nanoparticles ( Au@P1-Au @P5) with a small size and a narrow distribution were obtained through the in situ reduction of gold precursors in an aqueous solution of polymer micelles with HQ as the coordination groups. The resulting Au @P nanohybrids possessed excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of nitrophenols using NaBH
