  Coagulase-negative staphylococci are frequently isolated from meat products and two species are used as starter cultures in dry fermented sausages. In these products , they face various environmental conditions such as variation of redox potential and oxygen levels that can lead to oxidative stress. Furthermore , when nitrate and nitrite are added as curing salts , staphylococci also experience nitrosative stress. A nos gene encoding a nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) is present in the genome of all staphylococci. NOS produces nitric oxide ( NO) and citrulline from arginine , but its activity is still poorly characterized , particularly in coagulase-negative staphylococci. NO is highly reactive with a broad spectrum of activity resulting from targeting metal centres ( heme and non-heme) and protein thiols. At low concentration , NO acts as a signalling molecule , while at higher concentration it generates stress. Thus , it was initially suggested that staphylococcal NOS counteract oxidative stress in relation to PerR and Fur regulators. In the physiology of staphylococci , it has recently been highlighted that NO controls the rate of aerobic respiration<symptom> and regulates the transition from aerobic to nitrate respiration<symptom> and also helps maintain the membrane potential in relation to the two-component systems SrrAB and AirRS. As NO interacts with heme centres , it binds the heme iron atom of myoglobin to form nitrosomyglobin , which is the typical red pigment of cured meat. However , the contribution of NOS to this reaction in meat products has yet to be evaluated.
