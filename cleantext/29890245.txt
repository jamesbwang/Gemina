  Calreticulin ( CRT) , a highly conserved ubiquitous eukaryotic protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa , containing three domains ( N , P , and C) is involved in promoting prolonged parasite-host relations. Brugia malayi Calreticulin ( BmCRT) is involved in the establishment of parasite infection by suppression of C1q-mediated host immune response. Calcium plays important role in this immunomodulatory mechanism of BmCRT. In the present study binding of calcium with BmCRT region involved in this interaction was investigated and correlated with the accompanying changes in fluorescence , circular dichroism ( CD) and UV absorption. The results obtained clearly indicated that BmCRT is a calcium binding protein and contains types two of Ca
