  To identify and assess patient motivation to initiate or maintain behavior changes. Attitudinal statements were developed from structured patient interviews and translated into 18 survey items. Items were analyzed with exploratory factor analysis ( EFA). An EFA with 340 type 2 diabetes patients identified three areas of patient attitudes toward changing health behaviors: ( 1) willingness to make changes ( 3 items; α = 0.69) , ( 2) perceived ability to make or maintain changes ( 3 items; α = 0.74) , and ( 3) and feeling changes are worthwhile ( 3 items; α = 0.61). Greater perceived ability and feelings of worthwhileness were associated with positive psychosocial and behavioral management indicators. All three areas were associated with confidence and attitudes toward making a specific behavioral change ( e.g. , improve diet). MATCH is an internally consistent and valid 9-item scale that provides a profile of factors influencing motivation that can be used in clinical and research settings.
