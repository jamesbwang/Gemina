  The epithelial sodium channel , ENaC , is responsible for Na reabsorption in several epithelia and is composed of homologous α , β , and γ subunits. Here , we will explore the differential regulation of ENaC subunits during biogenesis in the early secretory pathway. ENaC subunits are subject to numerous posttranslational modifications , including glycosylation , protease activation , disulfide bond formation , palmitoylation , and glycosylation , each of which modulate channel function. For example , glycan addition is regulated by sodium and affects protease activation at the cell surface , protein trafficking , sodium-dependent regulation , and sodium transport. Glycosylation of the α subunit also determines whether a chaperone , Lhs1/GRP170 , selects the protein for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Recognition by this chaperone is blocked by assembly of the ENaC transmembrane domains. In contrast , cytosolic lysines are acetylated in the early secretory pathway , which inhibits ubiquitination and endocytosis at the cell surface. As sodium reabsorption by ENaC in the distal nephron regulates salt and water homeostasis , ENaC function is critical for human health. Therefore , identifying and characterizing modifiers of ENaC in the early secretory pathway may provide both new therapeutic targets and further our basic understanding of membrane protein assembly and regulation.
