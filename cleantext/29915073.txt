  The phase diagram of water at extreme conditions plays a critical role in Earth and planetary science , yet remains poorly understood. Here we report a first-principles investigation of the liquid at high temperature , between 11 GPa and 20 GPa-a region where numerous controversial results have been reported over the past three decades. Our results are consistent with the recent estimates of the water melting line below 1,000 K and show that on the 1,000-K isotherm the liquid is rapidly dissociating and recombining through a bimolecular mechanism. We found that short-lived ionic species act as charge carriers , giving rise to an ionic conductivity that at 11 GPa and 20 GPa is six and seven orders of magnitude larger , respectively , than at ambient conditions. Conductivity calculations were performed entirely from first principles , with no a priori assumptions on the nature of charge carriers. Despite frequent dissociative events , we observed that hydrogen bonding persists at high pressure , up to at least 20 GPa. Our computed Raman spectra , which are in excellent agreement with experiment , show no distinctive signatures of the hydronium and hydroxide ions present in our simulations. Instead , we found that infrared spectra are sensitive probes of molecular dissociation , exhibiting a broad band below the OH stretching mode ascribable to vibrations of complex ions.
