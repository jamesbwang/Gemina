  To determine whether a second trabeculotomy ( LOT) can reduce the intraocular pressure ( IOP) in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG) that had undergone an unsuccessful LOT as the initial surgery. LOT ab externo was performed as a second surgery on 37 eyes of 34 POAG patients who had undergone an unsuccessful LOT as the initial surgery. The main outcome measure was the postoperative IOPs , and surgical failures were defined as eyes with a post-LOT IOP > 20 ▒ mm Hg. The eyes were divided into three groups; those that underwent LOT as both the initial and additional surgery ( L-L group) , those that underwent LOT as the initial surgery and combined LOT and cataract surgery ( cLOT-IOL) as the additional surgery ( L-cL group) , and those that underwent cLOT-IOL as the initial surgery and LOT as the additional surgery ( cL-L group). The IOP was reduced after the additional LOT at postoperative 24 months in the L-L group from 20.0 ± 3.0 ▒ mm Hg to 15.3 ± 2.6 ▒ mm Hg ( P < 0.001) , the L-cL group from 19.8 ± 1.6 ▒ mm Hg to 15.8 ± 3.2 ▒ mm Hg ( P = 0.029) , and the cL-L group from 20.1 ± 2.7 ▒ mm Hg to 15.5 ± 2.3 ▒ mm Hg ( P = 0.014). There were no differences in the preoperative and postoperative IOPs between the initial- and additionally-operated eyes. The success rates were improved by the additional surgery in the L-L group ( P < 0.001) and the L-cL group ( P = 0.029) , but the rate was worsened in the cL-L group ( P < 0.001). These results indicate that LOT is a reasonable choice as an additional glaucoma surgery after failure of an initial LOT.
