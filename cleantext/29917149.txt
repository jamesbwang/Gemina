  DNA polymerase β ( pol β) plays a central role in the DNA base excision repair pathway and also serves as an important model polymerase. Dynamic characterization of pol β from methyl-TROSY 13C-1H multiple quantum CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments of Ile and Met sidechains and previous backbone relaxation dispersion measurements , reveals transitions in μs-ms dynamics in response to highly variable substrates. Recognition of a 1-nt-gapped DNA substrate is accompanied by significant backbone and sidechain motion in the lyase domain and the DNA binding subdomain of the polymerase domain , that may help to facilitate binding of the apoenzyme to the segments of the DNA upstream and downstream from the gap. Backbone μs-ms motion largely disappears after formation of the pol β-DNA complex , giving rise to an increase in uncoupled μs-ms sidechain motion throughout the enzyme. Formation of an abortive ternary complex using a non-hydrolyzable dNTP results in sidechain motions that fit to a single exchange process localized to the catalytic subdomain , suggesting that this motion may play a role in catalysis.
