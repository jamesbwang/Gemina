  Solving the problem of large quantities of organic waste , which represents an enormous ecological and financial burden for all aspects of the process industry , is a necessity. Therefore , there is an emerged need to find specific solutions to utilize raw materials as efficiently as possible in the production process. The cocoa shell is a valuable by-product obtained from the chocolate industry. It is rich in protein , dietary fiber , and ash , as well as in some other valuable bioactive compounds , such as methylxanthines and phenolics. This paper gives an overview of published results related to the cocoa shell , mostly on important bioactive compounds and possible applications of the cocoa shell in different areas. The cocoa shell , due to its nutritional value and high-value bioactive compounds , could become a desirable raw material in a large spectrum of functional , pharmaceutical , or cosmetic products , as well as in the production of energy or biofuels in the near future.
