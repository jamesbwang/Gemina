  This paper proposes a discrete particle model based on the random-walk theory for simulating cement infiltration within open-cell structures to prevent osteoporotic proximal femur fractures. Model parameters consider the cement viscosity ( high and low) and the desired direction of injection ( vertical and diagonal). In vitro and in silico characterizations of augmented open-cell structures validated the computational model and quantified the improved mechanical properties ( Young 's modulus) of the augmented specimens. The cement injection pattern was successfully predicted in all the simulated cases. All the augmented specimens exhibited enhanced mechanical properties computationally and experimentally ( maximum improvements of 237.95 ± 12.91 % and 246.85 ± 35.57 % , respectively). The open-cell structures with high porosity fraction showed a considerable increase in mechanical properties. Cement augmentation in low porosity fraction specimens resulted in a lesser increase in mechanical properties. The results suggest that the proposed discrete particle model is adequate for use as a femoroplasty planning framework.
