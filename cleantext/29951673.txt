  Herein , we report the application of the mononuclear copper complex 1 , ( CuII ( L)) 2 + , in electrochemical water oxidation catalysis ( L = 1,3-bis ( ( ( 1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl) methyl) amino) propan-2-ol). The complex exhibits a N4 donor set consisting of two amine and two imidazole units and a dangling OH unit in close proximity to the copper ion. 1 exhibits a moderate apparent rate constant kcat of 0.12 s-1 in catalysis and operates at an overpotential of 0.83 V. Detailed investigations allowed us to derive a mechanism for water oxidation. The catalysis proceeds only under basic conditions , where ( CuII ( L) ( OH)) + , 1H-1 , is the main solution species , which indicates that a negatively charged ligand is necessary to drive the catalysis. Initial oxidation of 1H-1 is coupled to proton loss forming a copper ( iii) species and further oxidation initiates oxygen evolution. Initial oxidation of 1 under neutral , i.e. non-catalytic , conditions is pH independent , highlighting the importance of PCET steps during catalysis. We collected reasonable evidence that catalysis proceeds via a water nucleophilic attack mechanism. The electrolyte presumably acts as a proton acceptor in catalysis as the onset potential depends on the buffer employed.
