  Increasing evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) perform special biological functions by regulating gene expression through multiple pathways and molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to explore the expression characteristics of lncRNA uc .322 in pancreatic islet cells and its effects on the secretion function of islet cells. Bioinformatics analysis was used to detect the lncRNA uc .322 sequence , location , and structural features. Expression of lncRNA uc .322 in different tissues was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction , Western blot analysis , adenosine triphosphate determination , glucose-stimulated insulin secretion , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate the effects of lncRNA uc .322 on insulin secretion. The results showed that the full-length of lncRNA uc .322 is 224 bp and that it is highly conserved in various species. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that lncRNA uc .322 is located on chr7: 122893196-122893419 ( GRCH37/hg19) within the SRY-related HMG-box 6 gene exon region. Compared with other tissues , lncRNA uc .322 is highly expressed in pancreatic tissue. Upregulation of lncRNA uc .322 expression increases the insulin transcription factors pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 and Forkhead box O1 expression , promotes insulin secretion in the extracellular fluid of Min6 cells , and increases the adenosine triphosphate concentration. On the other hand , knockdown of lncRNA uc .322 has opposite effects on Min6 cells. Overall , this study showed that upregulation of lncRNA uc .322 in islet Î²-cells can increase the expression of insulin transcription factors and promote insulin secretion , and it may be a new therapeutic target for diabetes.
