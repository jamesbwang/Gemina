  Use of carrier solvents to assist dissolution of phase-selective organogelators ( PSOGs) before application in oil gelation is a common approach for solution-based gelators. Because of the competition in H-bonds by the polar carrier solvent , decreased gelling ability of PSOGs was often observed. That is , while data are available , the previously documented biphasic minimum gelling concentrations ( BMGCs) are much larger than the MGCs determined using heating-cooling cycle for the same PSOG against the same oil. In this study , we show that , by minimizing amount of polar carrier solvent used , the gelling ability of PSOGs actually can be enhanced very substantially , rather than being weakened. More specifically , we demonstrate that use of a minute amount of polar carrier solvents of different types ( e.g. , ethyl acetate , acetone , acetonitrile , and tetrahydrofuran) significantly enhances the gelling ability of seven structurally different organogelators in hydrophobic oil. In particular , with the use of 5 vol % essentially nontoxic ethyl acetate , application of this previously unexplored strategy onto four monopeptide-based PSOGs produces up to 11-fold improvement in biphasic gelling ability toward seven ( un) weathered crude oils of widely ranging viscosities. While collectively overcoming many problematic issues ( slow gelling action , low gelling ability , or a need to use hot or toxic solvent for dissolution of gelator) associated with PSOGs , this surprisingly simple yet powerful and reliable method produces unprecedented rapid supergelation of crude oil at room temperature , with BMGCs of as low as 0.38 w/v % ( e.g. , 3.8 g per liter of crude oil) and an averaged reduction in material cost of gelators by 85-97 %.
