  Despite limited information on neonatal safety , the transfer of frozen-thawed cleavage-stage embryos with blastomere loss is common in women undergoing in vitro fertilization. We aimed to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes and safety of frozen-thawed cleavage-stage embryos with blastomere loss. This prospective , multicenter , cohort study included all frozen-thawed cleavage-stage embryo transfer ( FET) cycles between 2002 and 2012. Pregnancy outcomes and subsequent neonatal outcomes were compared between FET cycles with intact embryos and those with blastomere loss. A total of 12,105 FET cycles were included in the analysis ( 2259 cycles in the blastomere loss group and 9846 cycles in the intact embryo group). The blastomere loss group showed significantly poorer outcomes with respect to implantation , pregnancy , and live birth rates than the intact embryo group. However , following embryo implantation , the two groups were similar with respect to live birth rates per clinical pregnancy. Among multiple pregnancies ( 4229 neonates) , neonates from the blastomere loss group were at an increased risk of being small for gestational age ( aOR = 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.00-2.25) compared to those from the intact group. A similar trend was observed among singletons ( aOR = 1.84 , 95 % CI 0.99-3.37). No associations were found between blastomere loss and the subsequent occurrence of congenital anomalies or neonatal mortality. However , neonates from the blastomere loss group were at an increased risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn ( aOR = 5.21 , 95 % CI 2.42-11.22). The transfer of embryos with blastomere loss is associated with reduced conception rates. Once the damaged embryos have implanted , pregnancies appear to have the same probability of progressing to live birth but with an increased risk of small for gestational age neonates and transient tachypnea of the newborn.
