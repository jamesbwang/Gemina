  Copy number variation ( CNV) of DNA plays an important role in the development of many diseases. However , due to the irregularity and sparsity of the CNVs , studying the association between CNVs and a disease outcome or a trait can be challenging. Up to now , not many methods have been proposed in the literature for this problem. Most of the current researchers reply on an ad hoc two-stage procedure by first identifying CNVs in each individual genome and then performing an association test using these identified CNVs. This potentially leads to information loss and as a result a lower power to identify disease associated CNVs. In this article , we describe a new method that combines the two steps into a single coherent model to identify the common CNV across patients that are associated with certain diseases. We use a double penalty model to capture CNVs ' association with both the intensities and the disease trait. We validate its performance in simulated datasets and a data example on platinum resistance and CNV in ovarian cancer genome.
