  Background Infantile hepatic haemangiomas ( IHHs) produce an excess of the thyroid hormone inactivating enzyme type-3 iodothyronine deiodinase ( D3) , leading to rapid degradation of thyroid hormones and consumptive hypothyroidism. The L-thyroxine replacement dose in patients with consumptive hypothyroidism is inappropriately higher than that in congenital hypothyroidism. Case presentation A 4-month-old boy presented with abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom>. Thyroid function tests ( TFTs) revealed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) level of 177 mU/L , normal free thyroxine ( fT4) of 1.23 ng/dL , low free tri-iodothyronine ( fT3) of 1.55 pg/mL and increased reverse T3 ( rT3) of 1240 ng/dL. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) revealed multiple IHHs. Based on his TFTs , ultrasonography and MRI evidence , he was diagnosed with consumptive hypothyroidism , and L-thyroxine replacement at 15 μg/kg/day was started. The L-thyroxine dose was increased gradually to 35 μ/kg/day until a stabilising euthyroid status was achieved. By the age of 8 months , the TSH concentration was decreased to normal levels; the L-thyroxine dose was gradually reduced and finally discontinued at the age of 12 months. Repeat abdominal ultrasound and MRI revealed a reduction in the number and size of the haemangiomas. The TFTs were at normal reference levels. The patient remains in active follow-up. Conclusions Neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism is usually negative in cases of IHH , as seen in our case. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose hypothyroidism in cases of IHH. The present case required very high doses of levothyroxine to achieve a euthyroid status. In cases of hypothyroidism in the first year of life with consumptive hypothyroidism caused by hepatic haemangioma , aggressive L-thyroxine replacement is required with no upper limit. The dose should be increased gradually until a stabilising euthyroid status is achieved.
