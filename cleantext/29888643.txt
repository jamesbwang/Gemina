  Mammalian tissues display circadian rhythms in transcription , translation , and histone modifications. Here we asked how an advance of the light-dark cycle alters daily rhythms in the liver epigenome at the H3K4me3 ( trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3) modification , which is found at active and poised gene promoters. H3K4me3 levels were first measured at 4 time points ( zeitgeber time ( ZT) 3 , 8 , 15 , and 20) during a normal 12L: 12D light-dark cycle. Peak levels were observed during the early dark phase at ZT15 and dropped to low levels around lights-on ( ZT0) between ZT20 and ZT3. A 6-h phase advance at ZT18 ( new lights-on after only 6 h of darkness) led to a transient extension of peak H3K4me3 levels. Although locomotor activity reentrained within a week after the phase advance , H3K4me3 rhythms failed to do so , with peak levels remaining in the light phase at the 1-week recovery time point. Eight weekly phase advances , with 1-week recovery times between each phase advance , further disrupted the H3K4me3 rhythms. Finally , we used the mPer2
