  Macroautophagy/autophagy is a proteolytic pathway that is involved in both bulk degradation of cytoplasmic proteins as well as in selective degradation of cytoplasmic organelles. Autophagic flux is often defined as a measure of autophagic degradation activity , and many techniques exist to assess autophagic flux. Although these techniques have generated invaluable information about the autophagic system , the quest continues for developing methods that not only enhance sensitivity and provide a means of quantification , but also accurately reflect the dynamic character of the pathway. Based on the theoretical framework of metabolic control analysis , where the autophagosome flux is the quantitative description of the rate a flow along a pathway , here we treat the autophagy system as a multi-step pathway. We describe a single-cell fluorescence live-cell imaging-based approach that allows the autophagosome flux to be accurately measured. This method characterizes autophagy in terms of its complete autophagosome and autolysosome pool size , the autophagosome flux , J , and the transition time , τ , for autophagosomes and autolysosomes at steady state. This approach provides a sensitive quantitative method to measure autophagosome flux , pool sizes and transition time in cells and tissues of clinical relevance.
