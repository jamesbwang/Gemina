  Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) represents approximately one third of presentations at diagnosis. Most patients are judged non-surgical due to disease extension , and chemo-radiotherapy still represents the standard therapeutic option , with unsatisfactory results in terms of overall survival ( OS) despite advances in staging and radiation therapy planning and delivery. Immunotherapy , and in particular immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis , gained wide popularity for NSCLC in light of the positive findings of several trials in metastatic disease. Stage III unresectable NSCLC is a remarkably interesting setting for the combined use of chemo-radiation and immunotherapy , also considering the multiple experimental evidences in favor of a synergistic effect between radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors , with the potential of enhancing immuno-modulating effects and overcoming resistance. We here summarized the biological rationale and the initial clinical experiences testing for this combination , and we briefly discussed ongoing trials and future options in this field.
