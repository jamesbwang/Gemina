  Determination of the true burden of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection among high-risk groups relies heavily on occurrence measures such as prevalence , which are vital for implementation of preventive action plans. Nevertheless , up-to-date data on the prevalence of HCV<pathogen> infection remain scarce in Iran. This study aimed to review the relevant literature systematically and determine the pooled prevalence of HCV<pathogen> infection among high-risk groups in Iran. Systematic review & meta-analysis. In 2016 , electronic scientific databases including PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science and local databases were searched using a detailed search strategy with language restricted to English and Farsi. The reference lists of the studies included in this review were also screened. Data were reviewed and extracted independently by two authors. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Sources of heterogeneity among the studies were determined using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. In total , 1817 records were identified in the initial search , and 46 records were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of HCV<pathogen> among high-risk groups was 32.3 %. The prevalence was 41.3 % in injection drug users ( IDUs) , 22.9 % in prisoners , 16.2 % in drug-dependent individuals and 24.6 % in drug-dependent prisoners. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that geographical location and year of publication were the probable sources of heterogeneity. This meta-analysis found a high prevalence of HCV<pathogen> among high-risk groups in Iran , particularly among IDUs. There is a need for prevention strategies to reduce the burden of HCV<pathogen> infection among high-risk groups , particularly IDUs.
