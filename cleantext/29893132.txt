  The novel and efficient approach toward the synthesis of endocyclic enol lactones was devised based on ring-closing metathesis of unsaturated carboxylic acids vinyl esters. Systematic studies revealed that vinyl esters are suitable substrates for RCM reaction. The developed methodology offers an easy route for synthetically challenging target molecules with different functional groups and substitution. We have also demonstrated that vinyl esters of cyclic carboxylic acids can be successfully applied for domino ring-opening ring-closing metathesis sequences.
