  Oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> may contribute to anabolic resistance in response to protein and exercise in older adults. We investigated whether consumption of montmorency cherry concentrate ( MCC) increased anabolic sensitivity to protein ingestion and resistance exercise in healthy older men. Sixteen healthy older men were randomized to receive MCC ( 60 mL · d Myofibrillar protein synthesis increased in response to exercise + protein compared to rest ( p < 0.05) in both groups , but there was no added effect of supplement ( MCC: 1.79 ± 0.75 EX vs 1.15 ± 0.40 rest; PLA: 2.22 ± 0.54 vs 1.21 ± 0.18; all % · d Short-term MCC ingestion does not affect the anabolic response to protein and exercise in healthy , relatively active , older men , despite MCC ingestion attenuating expression of proteins involved in the muscle inflammatory response to exercise , which may influence the chronic training response.
