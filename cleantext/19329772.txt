  Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS) is a prevalent condition in adults over the age of 55 years. The condition is associated with activity limitations that are related to increased pain when engaging in weight-bearing activities , such as walking and standing , and release of pain while sitting down or bending forward. The limitation on ambulation is also associated with impaired balance<symptom> although the types of balance<symptom> problems are sparsely described in this patient group. The purpose of this study was to assess dynamic balance<symptom> in persons with LSS by the Mini-BESTest and explore the associations with self-reported balance<symptom> and functional disability. Sixty two participants were included in this cross-sectional study. The main outcome measure was the Mini-BESTest , providing a total score and sub-scores for 4 balance<symptom> control systems ( Anticipatory Adjustment , Reactive Response , Sensory Orientation , Stability of Gait). The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire provided sub-scores for self-reported balance<symptom> problems and walking function ( FUNC). The participants showed large inter-individual variation in all measures of balance<symptom>. The Mini-BESTest score ranged from very good to poor and the mean value was 22.8 ( SD 3.5). Nineteen participants ( 31 %) reported having frequent balance<symptom> problems. Logistic regression analyses showed that both the total Mini-BESTest score ( OR ( 95 % CI) 1.6 ( 1.2 , 2.0) ( P = .001) and 3 of the 4 balance<symptom> control systems ( Anticipatory Adjustment , Sensory Orientation , Stability in Gait) were significantly associated with self-reported balance<symptom> problems ( .001 ≤ P ≤ .01). The strongest association was seen between Sensory Orientation and balance<symptom> problems , implying that it is 4.4 times more likely that persons would have no or occasional balance<symptom> problems with each unit of increase in Sensory Orientation. The total score for the Mini-BESTest was significantly associated with FUNC ( P = .042). The dynamic balance<symptom> of persons with LSS showed a large heterogeneity with a large fraction of the participants displaying no balance<symptom> impairments. The test results were associated with the participants ' self-reported balance<symptom> problems and walking function. The Mini-BESTest thus appears to provide additional information to self-reported disability , and by identifying different kind of balance<symptom> control impairments , the Mini-BESTest could be useful for physiotherapists working with person-centered rehabilitation in persons with LSS.
