  The formation of health-beneficial isothiocyanates ( ITCs) from glucosinolates depends on a wide variety of plant-intrinsic factors ( e.g. , concentration of glucosinolates , activity of myrosinase , and specifier proteins) and on a multitude of extrinsic postharvest factors such as the conditions used during industrial processing , domestic preparation , mastication , and digestion. All of these factors contribute to a large variability in the formation of ITCs ( and other breakdown products) , as well as their intake and absorption upon consumption of Brassica vegetables. This uncertainty in ITC intake and absorption is a barrier for the determination of an optimal Brassica vegetable consumption pattern. In this review , the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect the formation , intake , and absorption of ITCs are described according to the most recent findings. The focus of this review includes the hydrolysis reaction mechanisms , the elucidation of the primary factors that play a role in the hydrolysis reaction , the influence of processing and cooking conditions , the effect of chewing , and the roles of the gastric and upper intestinal phases , including the effect of the meal composition ( e.g. , the effect of other meal compounds present during digestion) on the potential formation of ITCs.
