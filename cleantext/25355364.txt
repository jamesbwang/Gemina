  Chancelloriids are an extinct group of spiny Cambrian animals of uncertain phylogenetic position. Despite their sponge-like body plan , their spines are unlike modern sponge spicules , but share several features with the sclerites of certain Cambrian bilaterians , notably halkieriids. However , a proposed homology of these ` coelosclerites ' implies complex transitions in body plan evolution. A new species of chancelloriid ,
