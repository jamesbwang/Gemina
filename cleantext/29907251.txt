  There have been considerable advances in our understanding of the systematics and ecology of Opisthorchis viverrini; however , this new knowledge has not only clarified but also complicated the situation. We now know that what was once considered to be a single species is , in fact , a species complex , with the individual species being confined to specific wetland areas. There is also a strong genetic association between the members of the O. viverrini species complex and their Bithynia snail intermediate hosts. Although this does not negate data collected before the recognition of this situation , it does lead to the caveat that regional and temporal variations in data collected may be related to the species examined. The advances in ecology have generally been spatially limited and have led , in part , to contradictory results that may well be related to nonrecognition of the species studied. It may also be related to natural temporal and spatial variation related , for example , to habitat characteristics. To understand the variation present , it will be necessary to conduct long-term ( several years at least) sampling projects after defining the genetic characteristics of O. viverrini sensu lato and its Bithynia snail intermediate hosts.
