  Frequent use of antibiotics is thought to create selection pressure by clearing susceptible bacteria and allowing resistant bacteria to spread in a community. A cluster-randomized trial comparing two different frequencies of mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma<disease> provided a convenient experiment for determining the causal relationship between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance. 24 communities were randomized to either annual or biannual mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma<disease> Randomization was stratified on health catchment area and trachoma<disease> prevalence. Swabs were processed for the genetic macrolide resistance determinants ermB and mefA/E in a masked fashion from a random sample of 120 pre-school children before treatment and another 120 children after two years of mass antibiotics. Macrolide resistance determinants were similar in the 12 annually and 12 biannually treated communities before treatment , with a median prevalence among pre-school children of 20 % ( interquartile range ( IQR) 10 % to 40 %) in each group. By 24 months , macrolide resistance determinants were found more commonly in the biannually treated communities ( median 60 % , IQR 50 to 80 %) than the annually treated communities ( median 40 % , IQR 20 to 40 %); P < 0.001. Adjusting for baseline , the 24-month prevalence of macrolide resistance determinants in the biannual group was 29.4 % higher than that of the annual group; 95 % CI 10.5 to 56.7 %. This randomized trial used direct genetic methods to confirm the causal relationship of community antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance. Communities randomized to less frequent use of antibiotics had a significantly lower prevalence of genetic antibiotic resistance determinants. NCT00792922.
