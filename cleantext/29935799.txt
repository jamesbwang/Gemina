  Air pollution exposure represents a major health threat to the developing foetus. DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants , but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention. We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide ( NO Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina 's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a specific expression pattern in placenta ( active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study ( EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and differentially methylated regions ( DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and long-term time-windows. The candidate genes approach identified nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO The methylation of ADORA2B , a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia , was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition , air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia , hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These findings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported effects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.
