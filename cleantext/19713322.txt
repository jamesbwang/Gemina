  Pseudohypoxic brain swelling ( or the more recent term , postoperative intracranial hypotension-associated venous congestion<symptom>) is a rare and potentially deadly complication that can occur after routine spine or brain surgery. The mechanism of this injury has been described as a rapid cerebral spinal fluid drainage leading to venous cerebral congestion<symptom>. The clinical and radiographic findings mimic those found in a patient who has suffered an anoxic brain injury. We present the third reported case of postoperative intracranial hypotension-associated venous congestion<symptom> following spinal surgery.
