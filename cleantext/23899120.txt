  Sepsis<disease> is a systemic inflammatory response to suspected or confirmed infection. Clinical evaluations are essential for its early detection and treatment. Blood cultures may take as long as 2 days to yield a result and are not always reliable. However , recent studies have suggested that neutrophil CD64 expression may be a sensitive and specific alternative for the diagnosis of systemic<disease> infection<disease>. The objective of the study was to analyze the difference in CD64 values between subjects with systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> ( SIRS) , suspected or confirmed sepsis<disease> , who meet diagnostic criteria for SIRS upon arriving at an emergency department. This was a prospective observational cohort study , an accuracy study of CD64 prospectively evaluated. The sample consisted of 109 patients aged 18 years with criteria for SIRS on arrival to emergency department. CD64 expression was measured within 6 h of hospital admission and once again after 48 h. ROC curve analysis suggested that a cutoff of 1.45 for CD64 expression could diagnose sepsis<disease> with a sensitivity of 0.85 , a specificity of 0.75 , an accuracy of 82.08 % , a positive predictive value of 0.96 , a negative predictive value of 0.38 and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.33. The area under the curve was 0.83. CD64 seems to be a useful , sensitive , and specific biomarker in discriminating between SIRS and
