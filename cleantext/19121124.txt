  Cognitive functioning and academic performance of pupils depend on regular breaks from classroom work. However , it is unclear which settings during such breaks provide the best environment to restore cognitive performance and promote wellbeing of adolescent pupils. Therefore , we investigated the effects of staying in different urban green spaces during breaks. Sixty-four pupils ( 16 ‚Åª 18 years old) participated in a cross-over experiment. They were placed into one of three settings ( small park , larger park , forest<disease>) for one hour during a lunch break. Wellbeing was assessed four times ( Nitsch scale) , and a cognitive test ( d2-R Test of Attention) was applied in the classrooms before and after the break. Wellbeing was almost always highest after the stay in the green spaces. However , a sustained effect was only found for the forest<disease>. Concentration performance values of the d2-R test were significantly higher after the pupils & rsquo; stay in green spaces for all sites. The highest increase of performance was found for the larger park type. In conclusion , this pilot study showed that study breaks in green spaces improved wellbeing and cognitive performance of adolescents. It also found that larger green spaces , either parks or forests , have stronger positive impacts on wellbeing and cognitive performance than small parks.
