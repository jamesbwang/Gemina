  We aimed to evaluate the effects of intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC) in patients at low mobility with leg<symptom> edema<symptom>. A pilot , two-arm , randomized controlled clinical trial was performed. Fifty patients ( age , 58.4 Â± 9 years; male , 14) , randomly allocated to a group ( IPC) undergoing 1 month ( n = 29) of an in-home cycle of IPC and to a control ( C) group ( n = 21) , were studied. Leg<symptom> edema<symptom> was evaluated by measuring subcutaneous thickness ( high-resolution ultrasound) and circumferences ( metric tape) , both assessed at different levels of the lower limbs , and volume ( water plethysmography). Ankle range of motion ( ROM , goniometer) , quality of life ( QoL) by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey , and a pool of plasma inflammatory markers were also evaluated. Edema<symptom> significantly decreased in the IPC group ( for all outcome measures , P < .0001) , whereas it significantly increased in the C group ( P < .0001). Ankle ROM was significantly enhanced in the IPC group ( dorsiflexion , P < .0001; plantar flexion , P = .002) and remained stable in the C group. QoL showed an improvement in the IPC group , particularly significant for the general health subscale ( P = .004) , whereas no changes were highlighted in the C group. The two groups exhibited different trends and variations for some plasma inflammatory markers , mainly for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. In a sample of patients at reduced mobility with leg<symptom> edema<symptom> , IPC treatment was effective in reducing the edema<symptom> , improving the ankle ROM , and determining a positive impact on QoL together with a slight modulation of some plasma inflammatory markers.
