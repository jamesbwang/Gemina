  Behavioral inflexibility is often assessed using reversal learning tasks , which require a relatively low degree of response variability. No studies have assessed sensitivity to reinforcement contingencies that specifically select highly variable response patterns in mice , let alone in models of neurodevelopmental disorders involving limited response variation. Operant variability and incremental repeated acquisition ( IRA) were used to assess unique aspects of behavioral variability of two mouse strains: BALB/c , a model of some deficits in ASD , and C57Bl/6. On the operant variability task , BALB/c mice responded more repetitively during adolescence than C57Bl/6 mice when reinforcement did not require variability but responded more variably when reinforcement required variability. During IRA testing in adulthood , both strains acquired an unchanging , performance sequence equally well. Strain differences emerged , however , after novel learning sequences began alternating with the performance sequence: BALB/c mice substantially outperformed C57Bl/6 mice. Using litter-mate controls , it was found that adolescent experience with variability did not affect either learning or performance on the IRA task in adulthood. These findings constrain the use of BALB/c mice as a model of ASD , but once again reveal this strain is highly sensitive to reinforcement contingencies and they are fast and robust learners.
