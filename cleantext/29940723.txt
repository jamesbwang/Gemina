  To investigate the potential risk of approach-related complications at different access angles in minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion. Eighty-six axial magnetic resonance images were obtained to analyze the risk of approach-related complications. The access corridor were simulated at different access angles and the potential risk of neurovascular structure injury was evaluated when the access corridor touching or overlapping the corresponding structures at each angle. Furthermore , the safe corridor length was measured when the corridor width was 18 and 22 mm. When access angle was 0 째 , the potential risk of ipsilateral nerve roots injury was 54.7 % at L4-L5. When access angle was 45 째 , the potential risk of abdominal aorta , contralateral nerve roots or central canal injury at L4-L5 was 79.1 % , 74.4 % , and 30.2 % , respectively. The length of the 18mm-wide access corridor was largest at 0 째 and it could reach 44.5 mm at L3-L4 and 46.4 mm at L4-L5. While the length of the 22 mm-wide access corridor was 42.3 mm at L3-L4 and 44.1 mm at L4-L5 at 0 째. Changes in the access angle would not only affect the ipsilateral neurovascular structures , but also might adversely influence the contralateral neural elements. It should be also noted to surgeons that alteration of the access angle changed the corridor length.
