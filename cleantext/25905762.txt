  Liver fibrosis<pathogen> is an important pathological precondition for hepatocellular carcinoma. The degree of hepatic fibrosis<pathogen> is positively correlated with liver cancer. Liver fibrosis<pathogen> is a series of pathological and physiological process related to liver cell necrosis<pathogen> and degeneration after chronic liver injury , which finally leads to extracellular matrix and collagen deposition. The early detection and precise staging of fibrosis<pathogen> and cirrhosis are very important for early diagnosis and timely initiation of appropriate therapeutic regimens. The risk of severe liver fibrosis<pathogen> finally progressing to liver carcinoma is > 50 %. It is known that biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis.<pathogen> However , this method has some limitations , such as the potential for pain , sampling variability , and low patient acceptance. Furthermore , the necessity of obtaining a tissue diagnosis of liver fibrosis<pathogen> still remains controversial. An increasing number of reliable non-invasive approaches are now available that are widely applied in clinical practice , mostly in cases of viral hepatitis<pathogen> , resulting in a significantly decreased need for liver biopsy. In fact , the non-invasive detection and evaluation of liver cirrhosis now has good accuracy due to current serum markers , ultrasound imaging , and magnetic resonance imaging quantification techniques. A prominent advantage of the non-invasive detection and assessment of liver fibrosis<pathogen> is that liver fibrosis<pathogen> can be monitored repeatedly and easily in the same patient. Serum biomarkers have the advantages of high applicability ( > 95 %) and good reproducibility. However , their results can be influenced by different patient conditions because none of these markers are liver-specific. The most promising techniques appear to be transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography because they provide reliable results for the detection of fibrosis<pathogen> in the advanced stages , and future developments promise to increase the reliability and accuracy of the staging of hepatic fibrosis.<pathogen> This article aims to describe the recent progress in the development of non-invasive assessment methods for the staging of liver fibrosis<pathogen> , with a special emphasize on computer-aided quantitative and deep learning methods.
