  Stem cells transplantation has emerged as a promising alternative therapeutic due to its potency at injury site. The need to monitor and non-invasively track the infused stem cells is a significant challenge in the development of regenerative medicine. Thus , in vivo tracking to monitor infused stem cells is especially vital. In this manuscript , we have described an effective in vitro labelling method of MSCs , a serial in vivo tracking of implanted stem cells at traumatic brain injury ( TBI) site through 7 T magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Proper homing of infused MSCs was carried out at different time points using histological analysis and Prussian blue staining. Longitudinal in vivo tracking of infused MSCs were performed up to 21 days in different groups through MRI using relaxometry technique. Results demonstrated that MSCs incubated with iron oxide-poly-L-lysine complex ( IO-PLL) at a ratio of 50:1.5 Î¼g/ml and a time period of 6 h was optimised to increase labelling efficiency. T2 *- weighted images and relaxation study demonstrated a significant signal loss and effective decrease in transverse relaxation time on day-3 at injury site after systemic transplantation , revealed maximum number of stem cells homing to the lesion<symptom> area. MRI results further correlate with histological and Prussian blue staining in different time periods. Decrease in negative signal and increase in relaxation times were observed after day-14 , may indicate damage tissue replacement with healthy tissue. MSCs tracking with synthesized negative contrast agent represent a great advantage during both in vitro and in vivo analysis. The proposed absolute bias correction based relaxometry analysis could be extrapolated for stem cell tracking and therapies in various neurodegenerative diseases.
