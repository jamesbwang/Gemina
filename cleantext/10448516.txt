  Patient acceptability is an important consideration in the design of medicines for children. The aim of this study was to investigate acceptability of multiparticulates in healthy children and adults. A randomised , single-blind acceptability testing was performed involving 71 children ( 4-12 years) and 61 adults ( 18-37 years). Each participant received three 500 mg samples of microcrystalline cellulose pellets administered on a medicine spoon with water at 5-10 minutes intervals. Acceptability was measured based on voluntary intake of the samples , facial expressions , ratings on hedonic scales and reported willingness to take multiparticulates everyday as a medicine. Multiparticulates were voluntarily swallowed by 92 % of children and 100 % of adults. However , palatability issues were identified , with emphasis on textural aspects. Grittiness perception received negative ratings on hedonic scales by 60 % of children and 51 % of adults. Researcher observations revealed that 72 % of children and 42 % of adults displayed negative facial expressions towards the samples. Children reported their willingness to take multiparticulates as a medicine in 30 % of the cases , compared to 74 % in adults. This study demonstrates that multiparticulates may be a suitable formulation platform for children and adults , although palatability concerns have been highlighted. Additional work is required to define acceptability criteria and to standardise methodologies.
