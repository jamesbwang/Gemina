  Circadian rhythms play a fundamental role at all levels of biological organization. Understanding the mechanisms and implications of circadian oscillations continues to be the focus of intense research. However , there has been no comprehensive and integrated way for accessing and mining all circadian omic datasets. The latest release of CircadiOmics ( http://circadiomics.ics.uci.edu) fills this gap for providing the most comprehensive web server for studying circadian data. The newly updated version contains high-throughput 227 omic datasets corresponding to over 74 million measurements sampled over 24 h cycles. Users can visualize and compare oscillatory trajectories across species , tissues and conditions. Periodicity statistics ( e.g. period , amplitude , phase , P-value , q-value etc.) obtained from BIO_CYCLE and other methods are provided for all samples in the repository and can easily be downloaded in the form of publication-ready figures and tables. New features and substantial improvements in performance and data volume make CircadiOmics a powerful web portal for integrated analysis of circadian omic data.
