  Voluntary recall of trauma is a key element in exposure-based psychotherapies and can trigger spontaneous dissociative responses such as flashbacks , depersonalisation , and derealisation. In order to examine the associations between cardiovascular and psychological responses to voluntary recollection of trauma , individuals with PTSD recalled a traumatic memory. Heart rate and heart rate variability were recorded continuously and the episodes when different forms of dissociation were experienced during the recall were identified. A significant increase in parasympathetic activity was found during trauma recall , with greater parasympathetic dominance being indicative of greater state depersonalisation/derealisation. Whereas overall decreases in heart rate during trauma recall were associated with increased fear and perceived threat , flashbacks were accompanied by short-term increases in heart rate. These findings demonstrate different types of cardiovascular responses associated with different psychological experiences during trauma recall. Future research directions were discussed.
