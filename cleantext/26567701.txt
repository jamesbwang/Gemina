  Bile acid homeostasis is essential and imbalance may lead to liver damage and liver failure. The bile acid induced intestinal factor fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) has been identified as a key protein for mediating negative feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis. The aim of the study was to define FGF19 and bile acid concentrations in portal and systemic blood in the fasted and postprandial state. We also addressed the question if physiological portal levels of FGF19 can be extrapolated from the concentration in systemic blood. Portal and systemic blood was collected from 75 fasted patients undergoing liver surgery and from three organ donors before and after enteral nutrition. Serum concentration of FGF19 was determined with ELISA and bile acid concentration with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentration of bile acids was twice as high in portal compared to systemic blood in the fasted group and 3-5 times higher in the postprandial group. FGF19 increased after enteral nutrition but did not differ between portal and systemic blood , in either group. In addition , a strong , positive correlation between bile acids and FGF19 was found. Our results confirm that bile acids drive the postprandial increase of circulating FGF19 but a hepatic clearance of FGF19 is unlikely. We conclude that systemic concentrations of FGF19 reflect portal concentrations of FGF19.
