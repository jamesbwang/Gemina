  Diabetic nephropathy ( DN) is a serious complication of diabetes and can cause an increased mortality risk. It was previously reported that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However , the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood. In the present study , the effects of spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk) and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase ( JNK) on the NLRP3 inflammasome were examined in vivo and in vitro. Sprague‑Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin ( 65 mg/kg) to induce diabetes. HK2 cells and rat glomerular mesangial cells ( RGMCs) were examined to detect the expression of JNK and NLRP3 inflammasome‑associated proteins following treatment with a Syk inhibitor or Syk‑small interfering ( si) RNA in a high glucose condition. In the present study , it was revealed that the protein and mRNA expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome‑associated molecules and the downstream mature interleukin ( IL) 1β were upregulated in vivo and in vitro. The Syk inhibitor and Syk‑siRNA suppressed high glucose‑induced JNK activation , and subsequently downregulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and mature IL‑1β in HK2 cells and RGMCs. Furthermore , high glucose‑induced apoptosis of HK2 cells was reduced by the Syk inhibitor BAY61‑3606. Therefore , the present results determined that high glucose‑induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is mediated by Syk/JNK activation , which subsequently increased the protein expression level of IL‑1β and mature IL‑1β. The present study identified that the Syk/JNK/NLRP3 signaling pathway may serve a vital role in the pathogenesis of DN.
