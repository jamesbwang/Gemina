  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Intravesical Botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection on the symptoms and urodynamic parameters in pediatric patients with idiopathic overactive bladder ( iOAB) refractory to medical treatment. The study was designed as an open-label uncontrolled therapeutic clinical trial. The eligible patients who underwent Intravesical botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection were evaluated before treatment. The evaluation included a 7-day paper bladder diary to assess OAB symptoms ( frequency , urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI) and nocturnal enuresis ( NE)) , filling the Arabic International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form ( ICIQ-UI short form) , and conducting urodynamic study. The Urodynamic parameters obtained were the maximum filling detrusor pressure , cystometric bladder capacity , and compliance. After 12 weeks of the intravesical injection , the patients were revaluated and the results were compared using paired samples t-test. The study enrolled 75 patients. And of those , statistical analysis was done on 46 patients who did follow the study protocols. The mean age was 8.9 years and male to female ratio was 1:4. There was a statistically significant improvement in overactive bladder symptoms and urodynamic parameters in the patient injected with botulinum<pathogen> toxin with minimal side effects. The evidence in this study would support the safety and efficacy of Intravesical botulinum<pathogen> toxin injection in children with refractory idiopathic OAB with significant improvement of symptoms , quality of life , as well as urodynamic parameters. Open-label uncontrolled therapeutic clinical trial. III.
