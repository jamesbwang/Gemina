  DNA is a highly programmable material that can be configured into unique high-order structures , such as DNA branched junctions containing multiple helical arms converging at a center. Herein we show that DNA programmability can deliver in situ growth of a 3-way junction-based DNA structure ( denoted Y-shaped DNA) with the use of three hairpin-shaped DNA molecules as precursors , a specific microRNA target as a recyclable trigger , and a DNA polymerase as a driver. We demonstrate that the Y-shaped configuration comes with the benefit of restricted freedom of movement in confined cellular environment , which makes the approach ideally suited for in situ imaging of small RNA targets , such as microRNAs. Comparative analysis illustrates that the proposed imaging technique is superior to both the classic fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) method and an analogous amplified imaging method via programmed growth of a double-stranded DNA ( rather than Y-shaped DNA) product.
