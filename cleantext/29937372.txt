  Mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes , comprising complexes I , III , and IV , are the minimal functional units of the electron transport chain. Assembling the individual complexes into supercomplexes may stabilize them , provide greater spatiotemporal control of respiration<symptom> , or , controversially , confer kinetic advantages through the sequestration of local quinone and cytochrome c pools ( substrate channeling). Here , we have incorporated an alternative quinol oxidase ( AOX) into mammalian heart mitochondrial membranes<symptom> to introduce a competing pathway for quinol oxidation and test for channeling. AOX substantially increases the rate of NADH oxidation by O
