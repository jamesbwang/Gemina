  Some female moths attract male moths by emitting series of pulses of pheromone filaments propagating downwind. The turbulent nature of the wind creates a complex flow environment , and causes the filaments to propagate in the form of patches with varying concentration distributions. Inspired by moth navigation capabilities , we propose a navigation strategy that enables a flier to locate an upwind pulsating odor source in a windy environment using a single threshold-based detection sensor. This optomotor anemotaxis strategy is constructed based on the physical properties of the turbulent flow carrying discrete puffs of odor and does not involve learning , memory , complex decision making or statistical methods. We suggest that in turbulent plumes from a pulsating point source , an instantaneously measurable quantity referred as a `` puff crossing time '' , improves the success rate as compared to the navigation strategies based on temporally regular zigzags due to intermittent contact , or an `` internal counter '' , that do not use this information. Using computer simulations of fliers navigating in turbulent plumes of the pulsating point source for varying flow parameters such as turbulent intensities , plume meandering and wind gusts , we obtained statistics of navigation paths towards the pheromone sources. We quantified the probability of a successful navigation as well as the flight parameters such as the time spent searching and the total flight time , with respect to different turbulent intensities , meandering or gusts. The concepts learned using this model may help to design odor-based navigation of miniature airborne autonomous vehicles.
