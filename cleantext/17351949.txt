  Telangiectatic osteosarcoma ( TOS) , a rare variant of osteosarcoma , may be easily misdiagnosed as aneurysmal bone cyst<symptom> ( ABC). The aims of this study were to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic factors of TOS by reviewing our experience with TOS and to develop a diagnostic model that may distinguish TOS from ABC. We identified 51 cases of TOS treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from March 2001 to January 2016 and reviewed their records , imaging information and pathological studies. A diagnostic model was developed to differentiate TOS and ABC by Bayes discriminant analysis and was evaluated. The log-rank test was used to analyze the prognostic factors of TOS and to compare the outcome differences between TOS and other high-grade osteosarcoma subtypes. The multi-disciplinary diagnostic method employed that combined clinical , imaging , and pathological studies enhanced the diagnostic accuracy. Age 18 years or younger and pathologic fracture were more common among the TOS patients than among the ABC patients The multi-disciplinary diagnostic method and diagnostic model based on predictive factors ,
