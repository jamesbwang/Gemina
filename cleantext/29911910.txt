  To identify differences in skeletal , dental , and soft-tissue morphology between postorthodontic patients with attractive and unattractive frontal posed smiles. The attractiveness of close-up photographs of frontal posed smiles in 100 adult female patients after conventional orthodontic treatment was evaluated by 20 dental students ( 10 men , 10 women) using a visual analogue scale. Posttreatment cephalograms of the 20 patients with the most attractive smiles ( attractive group; mean age 23.75 ± 3.35 years) and the 20 patients with least attractive smiles ( unattractive group; mean age 23.11 ± 4.45 years) were selected , and 41 measurements were made and compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test ( P < .05). When compared with the attractive group , the unattractive group exhibited greater values for sella-nasion plane to mandibular plane , palatal plane to mandibular plane , anterior facial height , lower facial height , and lower facial height/anterior facial height as skeletal measurements; for occlusal plane to sella-nasion plane , palatal plane to occlusal plane , and maxillary central incisor to palatal plane as dental measurements; and for lower face , upper lip length , and upper lip superior to palatal plane as soft-tissue measurements. Cephalometric analysis revealed that postorthodontic Japanese female patients with unattractive frontal posed smiles are characterized by a hyperdivergent skeletal pattern with extruded maxillary incisors and a steep occlusal plane , accompanied by a longer upper lip than patients achieving attractive posed frontal smiles.
