  The acquisition of research skills by midwifery students is increasingly important especially for midwifery programmes in universities. Recently , universities in Chile have included the development of research skills in the majority of professional curricula for basic and post-basic degree programmes. The lack of research training is a limitation recognised and shared with other Latin American countries which prevents scientific and technological development. To describe the process of implementation of a programme of research projects by midwifery students in a school in Chile and the results obtained , and the perceptions of students and teachers. 31 work groups were formed ( 92 students) , who developed and implemented research projects in gynecology , public health and neonatology. Research was conducted at six public hospitals serving high risk populations , a private clinic , and nine family health centres. The average scores earned for the projects was a 5.7 ( scale of 1-7). The students and teachers positively rated the experience of undertaking research. The development of research projects allows students to acquire competencies and confidence in their research skills. It is an experience that can be replicated in other countries supported by the commitment of the midwifery and university faculty and the training and motivation of a group of midwifery educators.
