  Limited data exist with regard to treatment outcomes in Asian Americans with chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC). We evaluated sofosbuvir ( SOF)- based regimens in a national cohort of Asian Americans. Eligible Asian Americans patients with CHC who had posttreatment follow-up of 24 weeks for SOF- based therapies from December 2013 to June 2017 were enrolled from 11 sites across the United States. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response ( SVR) rates at posttreatment weeks 12 and 24. Secondary endpoints were to evaluate safety by tolerability and adverse events ( AEs). Among 231 patients screened , 186 were enrolled. At baseline , 31 % ( 57/186) patients were cirrhotic , 34 % ( 63/186) were treatment experienced. Most of the subjects ( 42 % , 79/186) received ledispavir/SOF therapy. The overall SVR12 was 95 % , ranging from 86 % in genotype ( GT) 1b on SOF + ribavirin to 100 % in GT 1b patients on ledipasvir/SOF at subgroup analyses. SVR12 was significantly lower in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients ( 88 % ( 50/57) vs. 98 % ( 126/129) , P < 0.01). Stratified by GT , SVR12 were: 96 % ( 43/45) in GT 1a; 93 % ( 67/72) in GT 1b; 100 % ( 23/23) in GT 2; 90 % ( 19/21) in GT 3; 100 % ( 1/1) in GT 4; 83 % ( 5/6) in GT 5; and 100 % ( 16/16) in GT 6. Cirrhotic patients with treatment failure were primarily GT 1 , ( GT 1a , n = 2; GT 1b , n = 4) with 1 GT 5 ( n = 1). Patients tolerated the treatment without serious AEs. Late relapse occurred in 1 patient after achieving SVR12. In Asian Americans with CHC , SOF-based regimens were well tolerated without serious AEs and could achieve high SVR12 regardless of hepatitis<disease> C<disease> viral<disease> infection<disease> GT.
