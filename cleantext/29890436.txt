  The in vitro effects of individual brominated flame retardants ( BFRs) , selected metals , and their binary mixtures on ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase ( EROD) activity were evaluated using a plate-reader method. The BFRs , 2,2 ' ,4,4 '- tetrabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-47) , decabromodiphenyl oxide ( BDE-209) , hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD) , and tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA) , were tested at doses ranging from 0.1 ng/L to 100 Âµg/L. Selected metals ( Cu
