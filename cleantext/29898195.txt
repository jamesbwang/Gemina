  The field of food addiction has attracted growing research attention. The modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 ( mYFAS 2.0) is a screening tool based on DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders. However , there is no validated instrument to assess food addiction. The mYFAS 2.0 has been transculturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. The data for this study was obtained through an anonymous web-based research platform: participants provided sociodemographic data and answered Brazilian versions of the the mYFAS 2.0 and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale ( BIS-11). Analysis included an assessment of the Brazilian mYFAS 2.0 's internal consistency reliability , factor structure , and convergent validity in relation to BIS-11 scores. Overall , 7,639 participants were included ( 71.3 % females; age: 27.2 Â± 7.9 years). The Brazilian mYFAS 2.0 had adequate internal consistency reliability ( Cronbach 's alpha = 0.89). A single factor solution yielded the best goodness-of-fit parameters for both the continuous and categorical version of the mYFAS 2.0 in confirmatory factor analysis. In addition , mYFAS 2.0 correlated with BIS-11 total scores ( Spearman 's rho = 0.26 , p < 0.001) and subscores. The Brazilian mYFAS 2.0 demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in our sample; however , future studies should further evaluate its discriminant validity.
