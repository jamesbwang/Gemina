  Restraint manipulation is necessary for observing the effect of acupuncture or moxibustion stimulation on various variables in the experimental study. Thus , the present study was designed to examine the impact of restraint manipulation on rats ' learning-memory ability , visional acuity , and body mass , so as to have a reasonable assessment on the influence of restraint stress. Normal Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a restraint group ( After 30 days ' restraint , no significant differences were found between the two groups in the training times for acquiring a correct rate of 80 % in the learning-memory tests , and visional acuity and body mass ( P 0.05). Thirty days ' restraint has no obvious impact on the increase of body<symptom> weight , learning-memory and visional acuity in normal rats , suggesting an applicable of restraint device in acupuncture study.
