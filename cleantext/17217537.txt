  Primitive neuroectodermal tumor is a high-grade malignant tumor originating from the neural crest and neuroectoderm , which can be subdivided into central and peripheral categories. Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor is thought to be identical to Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> , and falls under a broader category of Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> family of tumors. Very rarely , it may present without osseous involvement , known as extraosseous Ewing 's sarcoma<disease>. Here we present a case of a 38-year-old woman , who presented with several-month history of a slow-growing chest wall mass , initially thought to be a breast mass. The mass was diagnosed as extraosseous Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> upon tissue biopsy. The patient was started on a dose-intensified neoadjuvant therapy , based on protocol from pediatric population given rarity of this tumor in the adult population. While the patient was initially planned for surgical resection , the tumor showed excellent response to chemotherapy on follow-up imaging , and radiation therapy was elected in lieu of resection.
