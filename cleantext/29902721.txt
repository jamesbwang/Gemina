  A new series of 6-amino-pyrido ( 2,3-d) pyrimidine-2,4-dione derivatives 3a-3s were prepared via a facile and efficient reaction from α-azidochalcones and 6-amiouracils. The reactions were performed under mild conditions to produce the corresponding compounds in good to excellent yields. Obtained derivatives 3a-3s were evaluated for α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and all of them exhibited excellent in vitro yeast α-glucosidase inhibition with IC
