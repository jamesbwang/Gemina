  This study investigates the effect of passenger and phone conversations on sleep-restricted driving. Six volunteers ( 50 % male , mean age 24.8 Â± 4.3 years) had their sleep restricted to 4 h in bed followed by a 20-min simulated drive on three separate occasions. Each drive included either a passenger conversation , a mobile phone conversation or a quiet passenger. The effect size of a phone conversation on lane deviation was large while passenger conversation was small. The main effect of conversation on lane deviation was non-significant ( F ( 2,10) = 2.57 , p = 0.126). Combining sleep-restricted driving with conversations warrants further investigation.
