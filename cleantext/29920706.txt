  Evidence from groups who have studied fistula<disease> aetiology and extrapolation from interventional studies supports a multifactorial hypothesis of Crohn 's perianal fistula<disease> , with several pathophysiological elements that may contribute to fistula<disease> formation , persistence and resistance to treatment. An evidence synthesis of current understanding of pathophysiological factors underlying Crohn 's perianal fistula<disease> is presented , exploring the fundamental reasons why some treatments succeed and others fail , as a means of focussing clinical knowledge on improving treatment of Crohn 's perianal fistula<disease>. Evidence to support this review was gathered via the Pubmed database. Studies discussing pathophysiological factors underpinning perianal fistula<disease> , particularly in Crohn 's disease , were reviewed and cross-referenced for additional reports. Pathophysiological factors that impact on success or failure of interventions for Crohn 's perianal fistulae<disease> include the high-pressure zone , obliterating the dead space , disconnecting the track from the anus , removing epithelialisation , eradicating sepsis<disease> and by-products of bacterial colonisation , correcting abnormalities in wound<disease> repair and removing the pro-inflammatory environment which allows fistula<disease> persistence. Most current interventions for Crohn 's perianal fistulae<disease> tend to focus on a single , or at best two , aspects of the pathophysiology of Crohn 's anal fistulae<disease>; as a result , failure to heal fully is common. For an intervention or combination of interventions to succeed , multiple factors must be addressed. We hypothesise that correct , timely and complete attention to all of these factors in a multimodal approach represents a new direction that may enable the creation of an effective treatment algorithm for Crohn 's anal
