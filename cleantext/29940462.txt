  We reported herein the design , synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 5-hydroxypyrido ( 2,3-b) pyrazin-6 ( 5H)- one derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ( RT) ribonuclease H ( RNase H) inhibitors using a privileged structure-guided scaffold refining strategy. In view of the similarities between the pharmacophore model of RNase H and integrase ( IN) inhibitors as well as their catalytic sites , we also performed IN inhibition assays. Notably , the majority of these derivatives inhibited RNase H and IN at micromolar concentrations. Among them , compound 7a exhibited similar inhibitory activity against RNase H and IN ( IC
