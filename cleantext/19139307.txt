  The `` Iowa kindred , '' a large Iowan family with autosomal-dominant Parkinson 's disease , has been followed clinically since the 1920s at the Mayo Clinic. In 2003 , the genetic cause was determined to be a 1.7 Mb triplication of the alpha-synuclein genomic locus. Affected individuals present with an early-onset , severe parkinsonism-dementia syndrome<disease>. Here , we present a descendant of the Iowa kindred with novel , disease-associated non-motor findings of reduced heart rate variability , complete anosmia , and a rare skin condition called colloid milium. At autopsy , key neuropathological findings were compatible with diffuse Lewy body disease. Using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH) array analysis to fine-map the genomic breakpoints , we observed two independent recombination events of the
