  Dementia is a progressive and life-limiting condition that can be described in three stages: early , middle , and late. This article reviews current literature on late-stage dementia. Survival times may vary across dementia subtypes. Yet , the overall trajectory is characterized by progressive decline until death. Ideally , as people with dementia approach the end of life , care should focus on comfort , dignity , and quality of life. However , barriers prevent optimal end-of-life care in the final stages of dementia. Improved and earlier advanced care planning for persons with dementia and their caregivers can help delineate goals of care and prepare for the inevitable complications of end-stage dementia. This allows for timely access to palliative and hospice care , which ultimately improves dementia end-of-life care.
