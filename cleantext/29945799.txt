  To compare cataract surgery with implantation of a Schlemm canal microstent with cataract surgery alone for the reduction of intraocular pressure ( IOP) and medication use after 24 months. Prospective , multicenter , single-masked , randomized controlled trial. Subjects with concomitant primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG) , visually significant cataract , and washed-out modified diurnal IOP ( MDIOP) between 22 and 34 mmHg. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single Hydrus Microstent ( Ivantis , Inc , Irvine , CA) in the Schlemm canal or no stent after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Comprehensive eye examinations were conducted 1 day , 1 week , and 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months postoperatively. Medication washout and MDIOP measurement were repeated at 12 and 24 months. The primary and secondary effectiveness end points were the proportion of subjects demonstrating a 20 % or greater reduction in unmedicated MDIOP and change in mean MDIOP from baseline at 24 months , respectively. Hypotensive medication use was tracked throughout the course of follow-up. Safety measures included the frequency of surgical complications and adverse events. A total of 369 eyes were randomized after phacoemulsification to Hydrus Microstent ( HMS) and 187 to no microstent ( NMS). At 24 months , unmedicated MDIOP was reduced by ≥ 20 % in 77.3 % of HMS group eyes and in 57.8 % of NMS group eyes ( difference = 19.5 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 11.2 % -27.8 % , P < 0.001). The mean reduction in 24-month unmedicated MDIOP was -7.6 ± 4.1 mmHg ( mean ± standard deviation) in the HMS group and -5.3 ± 3.9 mmHg in the NMS group ( difference = -2.3 mmHg; 95 % CI , -3.0 to -1.6; P < 0.001). The mean number of medications was reduced from 1.7 ± 0.9 at baseline to 0.3 ± 0.8 at 24 months in the HMS group and from 1.7 ± 0.9 to 0.7 ± 0.9 in the NMS group ( difference = -0.4 medications; P < 0.001). There were no serious ocular adverse events related to the microstent , and no significant differences in safety parameters between the 2 groups. This 24-month multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrated superior reduction in MDIOP and medication use among subjects with mild-to-moderate POAG who received a Schlemm canal microstent combined with phacoemulsification compared with phacoemulsification alone.
