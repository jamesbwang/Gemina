  Coiled coils are important nanomechanical building blocks in biological and biomimetic materials. A mechanistic molecular understanding of their structural response to mechanical load is essential for elucidating their role in tissues and for utilizing and tuning these building blocks in materials applications. Using a combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS) and steered molecular dynamics ( SMD) simulations , we have investigated the mechanics of synthetic heterodimeric coiled coils of different length ( 3-4 heptads) when loaded in shear geometry. Upon shearing , we observe an initial rise in the force , which is followed by a constant force plateau and ultimately strand separation. The force required for strand separation depends on the coiled coil length and the applied loading rate , suggesting that coiled coil shearing occurs out of equilibrium. This out-of-equilibrium behaviour is determined by a complex structural response which involves helix uncoiling , uncoiling-assisted sliding of the helices relative to each other in the direction of the applied force as well as uncoiling-assisted dissociation perpendicular to the force axis. These processes follow a hierarchy of timescales with helix uncoiling being faster than sliding and sliding being faster than dissociation. In SMFS experiments , strand separation is dominated by uncoiling-assisted dissociation and occurs at forces between 25-45 pN for the shortest 3-heptad coiled coil and between 35-50 pN for the longest 4-heptad coiled coil. These values are highly similar to the forces required for shearing apart short double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides , reinforcing the potential role of coiled coils as nanomechanical building blocks in applications where protein-based structures are desired.
