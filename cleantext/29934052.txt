  Mangiferin , a natural glucosyl xanthone , was confirmed to be an effective uric acid ( UA)- lowering agent with dual action of inhibiting production and promoting excretion of UA. In this study , we aimed to evaluate the effect of mangiferin on alleviating hypertension induced by hyperuricemia. Mangiferin ( 30 , 60 , 120 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic rats induced by gavage with potassium oxonate ( 750 mg/kg). Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , serum levels of UA , nitric oxide ( NO) , C-reactionprotein ( CRP) and ONOO
