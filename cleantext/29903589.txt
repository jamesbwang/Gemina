  Infectious keratitis<disease> are a frequent cause of ocular morbidity. Today , new treatments are necessary to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistant germs. Corneal collagen cross-linking has been suggested to treat corneal infectious ( PACK-CXL). Its action would be both antimicrobial and protective for the cornea , increasing its biochemical resistence to proteolytic enzymes. In vivo , PACK-CXL might demonstrate good efficacy against bacterial keratitis<disease> , contrary to herpetic keratitis<disease> for which it is contraindicated. For fungal or amoebic keratitis<disease> , results are uncertain regarding its safety and efficacy. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the use of corneal collagen cross-linking to treat infectious
