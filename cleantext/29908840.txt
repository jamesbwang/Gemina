  Although an increasing number of studies have been published on the effects of emergent pollutants such as carbon nanoparticles , there is still scarce information on the impact of these contaminants on marine organisms when acting in combination with classical pollutants such as meta ( loid) s. The present study evaluated the impacts of Arsenic and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes ( MWCNTs) in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum , assessing the effects induced when both contaminants were acting individually ( As , NP) and as a mixture ( As + NP). Metabolic capacity ( electron transport system activity) , oxidative stress ( antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes activity and cellular damage) and neurotoxicity ( Acetylcholinesterase activity) biomarkers were evaluated in clams after a 28 days exposure period. The results obtained showed that the accumulation of As was not affected by the presence of the NPs. Our results demonstrated that higher injuries were noticed in clams exposed to NPs , with higher metabolic depression<symptom> and oxidative stress , regardless of the presence of As. Furthermore , higher neurotoxicity was observed in clams exposed to the combination of both contaminants in comparison to the effects of As and NPs individually.
