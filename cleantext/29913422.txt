  Semen cryopreservation is an important tool for artificial breeding , species conservation and human reproductive medicine. However , sublethal freezing damage remains an important limitation of the cryopreservation process , inevitably leading to reduced fertility in vivo. This review explores several facets of sublethal freezing damage , touching on cryocapacitation , the generation of reactive oxygen species and alterations to sperm proteins , lipids and sugars. The effects of sublethal freezing damage on sperm performance in vivo are also discussed , examining fertile lifespan and interaction with female reproductive tract immune cells , mucus and oviductal cells. Finally , the cryoprotective potential of whole seminal plasma and individual proteins are explored.
