  Retrospective review. To assess correction of pelvic obliquity in children with cerebral palsy ( CP) scoliosis postoperatively and 5 years after posterior spinal fusion with pelvic fixation using unit rods , sacral-alar-iliac ( SAI) screws , or iliac screws. There are multiple options for pelvic fixation in children with scoliosis secondary to CP. The long-term differences in outcomes between these fixation methods are still unclear. A multicenter review identified records of 70 children with CP who underwent posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis using unit rods ( n = 9) , SAI screws ( n = 19) , or iliac screws ( n = 42). Patients younger than 18 years with 5-year follow-up were included. Pelvic obliquity and major coronal curve measurements were compared using preoperative , ( first erect) postoperative , and 5-year follow-up radiographs. Implant-related complications were noted. Alpha = 0.05. For all groups , there was a significant difference between preoperative and postoperative pelvic obliquity that was maintained at 5 years. At 5-year follow-up , pelvic obliquity was significantly higher in the IS group ( 12 °) compared with the unit rod group ( 4 ° , p = 0.001) and SAI screw group ( 6 °) ( p = 0.006). Implant-related complications were as follows: unit rod group , 1 patient ( reoperation); SAI screw group , none; iliac screw group , 6 patients , including 3 cases of loss of connection between the rod and the iliac screw , 2 prominent screws , and 1 loose screw. Correction of pelvic obliquity for children with CP-related scoliosis was achieved postoperatively using unit rods , SAI screws , and iliac screws. Implant-related complications and reoperations were most common in the iliac screw group. At 5-year follow-up , the iliac screw group had loss of major curve correction and less correction of pelvic obliquity than the unit rod and SAI screw groups. 3.
