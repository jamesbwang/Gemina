  Freshwater harmful algal blooms ( HABs) , driven by nutrient inputs from anthropogenic sources , pose unique risks to human and ecological health worldwide. A major nutrient contributor is agricultural land use , specifically tile drainage discharge. Small lakes and ponds are at elevated risk for HAB appearance , as they are uniquely sensitive to nutrient input. HABs introduce exposure risk to microcystin ( MC) , hepatotoxic and potentially carcinogenic cyanotoxins. To investigate the impact of anthropogenic land use on small lakes and ponds , 24 sites in central Ohio were sampled over a 3-month period in late summer of 2015. MC concentration , microbial community structure , and water chemistry were analyzed. Land use intensity , including tile drainage systems , was the driver of clustering in principle component analysis , ultimately contributing to nutrient deposition , a driver of HABs. Relative abundance of HAB-forming genera was correlated with elevated concentrations of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphate. One location ( FC) showed MC concentrations exceeding 875 Î¼g/L and large community shifts in ciliates ( Oligohymenophorea) associated with hypoxic conditions. The prokaryotic community at FC was dominated by Planktothrix sp.. These results demonstrate the impact of HABs in small lakes and ponds , and that prevailing issues extend beyond cyanotoxins , such as cascading impacts on other trophic levels.
