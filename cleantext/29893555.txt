  Materials that possess coupled magnetic and electric properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in next-generation magnetoelectric devices such as digital information storage. To date , the magnetoelectric materials that have been studied in-depth have been limited mainly to inorganic oxides such as perovskite oxides. Molecular materials are a promising alternative because their magnetic and electric elements can be combined together at the molecular level via relatively simple molecular designs. Here , we report the coupling of magnetic and electric properties through a magnetodielectric ( MD) effect in a single-crystal sample , which is constructed from dysprosium ( III) single-molecule magnets ( SMMs). The MD effect originates from intrinsic spin-lattice coupling of the dysprosium ( III) ion within the sample. This is the first observation of the MD effect in a SMM-based material , which could pave the way toward the synthesis of advanced materials that combine distinct magnetic and electric properties using molecular chemistry for use in molecular devices with nanoscale size.
