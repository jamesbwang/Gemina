  Graphene and its derivatives are widely used for a variety of industrial , biomedical , and environmental applications. However , the potential harm caused by exposure of the eyes to graphene-based nanomaterials is scarce. Given the potential for these materials to be used in multiple applications , there is a pressing need to evaluate their ocular toxicity , and understand the relationships between their physico-chemical properties and the resulting toxicity. In this study , the toxicity of PEGylated graphene oxide ( PEG-GO) with differing oxidation levels and/or surface charges ( positive , negative and neutral charge) was evaluated using two in-vitro models of the eye: primary human corneal epithelial cells and human retinal capillary endothelial cells. The results showed that oxidation level , but not surface charge , had a pivotal effect on the toxicity of graphene-based nanomaterials. Typically , PEG-GO sample with a higher oxidation level caused more serious cytotoxicity than those with a lower oxidation level. Furthermore , by analysis of global gene expression profiles , we found that the foremost cellular response to PEG-GO sample with a high oxidation level was the oxidative stress response. Next , via exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity , we showed that PEG-GO sample with a high degree of oxidation induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS) via NDUFB9-mediated biological pathway. This work has significant implications for design of safe graphene-based nanomaterials for biomedical applications.
