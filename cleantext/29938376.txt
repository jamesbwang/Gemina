  Lagochilascariosis is an emerging parasitic<disease> disease<disease> limited to the American continent , caused by nematodes of the genus Lagochilascaris. Its life cycle is heteroxenous , involving natural definitive hosts ( wild carnivores) , accidental hosts ( domestic carnivores and humans) , and intermediate hosts ( rodents). Here we report , for the first time , the occurrence of Lagochilascaris major in female of a Pampas fox ( Lycalopex gymnocercus) which was found in the Mar Chiquita basin , Buenos Aires province , Argentina. At necropsy<disease> , multiple Lagochilascaris larvae and several adults ( 1 female and 5 male) were observed inserted in the mucosa of the trachea and a male was also collected in the stomach. The diagnosis was made by observing the different stages with optical microscopy , by scanning electron microscopy of adult males and coproparasitological analysis. Although cases of lagochilascariosis have been reported in wildlife in different countries of the American continent , in Argentina , cases are really rare and were only found in domestic cats.

In Argentina , sporadic cases of Lagochilascariosis were reported in domestic cats but this work represents the first record in a wild carnivore ( L. gymnocercus) naturally infected with L. major.
