  The primary aim of the investigation was to study the seasonal changes in body composition in elite European soccer players and identify key playing positional differences. Twenty-two players ( age = 24 ± 3.7 years , body height = 180.45 ± 5.12 cm , body mass = 76.66 ± 5.34 kg) were tested. Players ' mass ( kg) , lean body mass ( LBM) , fat free mass ( FFM) , fat mass ( FM) , muscle girths ( MG) and sum of 8 skinfolds ( mm) were measured across 5 time points ( T0 = Start of pre-season training; T1 = End of pre-season training; T2 = Mid-season; T3 = End of mid-season break; T4 = End of season). Players were divided into their tactical positional roles for analysis. The specific positions they were divided into included defenders ( n = 8) , midfielders ( n = 8) and forwards ( n = 6). Assessment of training and matchplay exposure were also recorded. Sites-4 , Sites-7 , Sites-8 and Fat Mass decreased dramatically from T0 to T1 and T2 in all playing positions ( p < 0.01) , while no remarkable differences were found between T2 , T3 and T4. Except for defenders , calf girth and lean mass were higher in T2 , T3 and T4 compared to T0 and T1 ( p < 0.01). Midfielders were found to be leaner than forwards and defenders in all data collection time point sessions. Defenders showed higher values in calf girth and lean body mass than midfielders and forwards. It can be concluded from this investigation that there are large variances n positional body composition profiles amongst professional European soccer players. Furthermore , significant changes are prevalent and occur across the season from LBM , FFM , MG and skinfold assessment amongst European elite level soccer players.
