  G-protein coupled receptor 40 ( GPR40) is also known as free fatty acid receptor 1. It is a typical 7 transmembrane receptor and currently the natural receptor of the saturated or unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. It could trigger the intracellular signalling pathway when combined with the free long-chain fatty acids , thereby controlling cells physiological function. In this review , we summarised the relationships and the potential mechanisms between the promising target GPR40 , and pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer 's disease and type 2 diabetic dementia. It may provide a theoretical reference for the development of clinical drug targeting GPR40.
