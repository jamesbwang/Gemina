  Recently , 2D-MXene materials have attracted much attention. However , their low adsorption capacities for metal ions have limited their application in nuclear wastewater disposal. Here , we describe the unprecedentedly high adsorption by Ti3C2Tx for the removal of radionuclides by a simple and efficient surface modification strategy. We have produced an Alk-Ti3C2Tx material possessing desirable properties such as wide layer spacing and abundant active adsorption sites , with excellent ability to remove barium ions from aqueous solution. Maximum Ba2 + adsorption by Alk-Ti3C2Tx is 46.46 mg g-1 , almost three times higher than that of unmodified Ti3C2Tx and much higher than that reported in previous studies. The remarkable selectivity for the removal of Ba2 + from simulated mixed nuclear wastewater is highly desirable for application in environmental wastewater treatment.
