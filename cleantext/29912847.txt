  Owing to great improvements in cognitive neuroscience , the study of brain functions during different types of cognitive tasks has attracted much attention. Recording event-related potentials ( ERPs) is an appropriate tool for such a purpose , as it is noninvasive and affordable. Attention is among the most studied cognitive processes. In this study , a visual version of the conjunctive continuous performance task-visual was used to examine the differences of cognitive processes in target and nontarget stimuli. Twenty healthy individuals ( average age: 23 years) participated in the study. Electroencephalogram signals were recorded from all participants during conjunctive continuous performance task-visual. After preprocessing , the ERPs were calculated by averaging the epochs that were time-locked to the stimulus onset. Then , the ERPs of the two groups of target and nontarget stimuli , from the aspects of differences in the P300 and N200 morphological features , were analyzed in three midline channels: Pz , Fz , and Cz. According to the results , the P300 amplitudes were significantly larger in the target than those in the nontarget stimuli. The P300 latencies were also larger in the target than in the nontarget stimuli , but the difference was only significant in the Pz channel ERPs. For the N200 component , the negativity of amplitudes was significantly more enhanced in the target than in the nontarget stimuli. However , for the N200 latencies , no significant difference was found based on the data obtained from the groups. Furthermore , the findings suggest that the distribution of the P300 component is more centroparietal for the target stimuli , and more centrofrontal for the nontarget ones. In addition , the distribution of the N200 component is more frontoparietal for both the target and nontarget stimuli.
