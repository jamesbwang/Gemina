  Background: Controversial results have been reported concerning the influence of calcium intake on prostate cancer risk. The aim of this study was to determine any association between total calcium ( in the diet and in supplements) intake and prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: The present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out following a PRISMA guidelines. Two reviewers independently using MeSH keywords searched international databases including PubMed , Science Direct , Cochrane , EMBASE , Web of Science , CINAHL , EBSCO and search engines such as Google Scholar. The searches were performed without any time limit until May 2016. The results were pooled using a random effects model and homogeneity was confirmed using the Q test and I2 index. Subgroup analyses was performed according to continents and study designs. The data were analyzed using STATA software version 3.2 , with p < 0.05 considered significant. Result: Overall , 12 studies with a total sample size of 905,046 were entered into the final meta-analysis. The main age range of the participants was 50 to 70 years. The relative risks ( RR) for total calcium with total prostate cancer , localized prostate cancer , and advance prostate cancer were estimated to be 1.15 ( 95 % CI: 1.04-3.46) , 1.05 ( 95 % CI: 0.96-1.14) , and 1.15 ( 95 % CI: 0.89-1.50) , respectively. Only the relationship between total calcium and total prostate cancer was significant ( P < 0.05). Conclusions: High calcium intake can be considered as a risk factor for total prostate cancer. Therefore , calcium intake might be a target for prevention.
