  Diacylglycerol acyltranferase-2 ( DGAT2) is a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerol. When lipid droplet formation is stimulated by incubating cells with fatty acids , DGAT2 becomes concentrated around the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets. Using confocal microscopy and directed mutagenesis , we have identified a 17-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of DGAT2 that is necessary and sufficient for targeting DGAT2 to lipid droplets. When this region was deleted , DGAT2 remained in the ER and did not target to lipid droplets. Fusing this sequence to mCherry directed the fluorescent reporter to lipid droplets. Similarly , when the corresponding region of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 ( MGAT2) was replaced with this sequence , MGAT2 was also targeted to lipid droplets. Lastly , we demonstrated that DGAT2 in ER membranes<symptom> is continuous with lipid droplets. We propose a new model whereby DGAT2 remains in the ER during lipid droplet formation via it 's transmembrane domains and interacts with nascent lipid droplets via its C-terminal lipid droplet interacting domain as they expand.
