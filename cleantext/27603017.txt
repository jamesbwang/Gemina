  We exposed a headform instrumented with 10 pressure sensors mounted flush with the surface to a shock<symptom> wave with three nominal intensities: 70 , 140 and 210 kPa. The headform was mounted on a Hybrid III neck , in a rigid configuration to eliminate motion and associated pressure variations. We evaluated the effect of the test location by placing the headform inside , at the end and outside of the shock<symptom> tube. The shock<symptom> wave intensity gradually decreases the further it travels in the shock<symptom> tube and the end effect degrades shock<symptom> wave characteristics , which makes comparison of the results obtained at three locations a difficult task. To resolve these issues , we developed a simple strategy of data reduction: the respective pressure parameters recorded by headform sensors were divided by their equivalents associated with the incident shock<symptom> wave. As a result , we obtained a comprehensive set of non-dimensional parameters. These non-dimensional parameters ( or amplification factors) allow for direct comparison of pressure waveform characteristic parameters generated by a range of incident shock<symptom> waves differing in intensity and for the headform located in different locations. Using this approach , we found a correlation function which allows prediction of the peak pressure on the headform that depends only on the peak pressure of the incident shock<symptom> wave ( for specific sensor location on the headform) , and itis independent on the headform location. We also found a similar relationship for the rise time. However , for the duration and impulse , comparable correlation functions do not exist. These findings using a headform with simplified geometry are baseline values and address a need for the development of standardized parameters for the evaluation of personal protective equipment ( PPE) under shock<symptom> wave loading.
