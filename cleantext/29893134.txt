  Cerebral ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions characterized by cerebral infarction , death of the brain tissue , and loss of brain function. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is the tissue damage caused when blood supply begins to the tissue after a period of ischemia or poor oxygen supply. In this study , we preliminarily investigated the biochemical changes in the brain hippocampal area , CA1 , resulting from ischemia reperfusion and neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) inhibitor treatment in rats using Raman spectroscopy. A drastic spectral change was observed in the ischemia-reperfusion brain tissue; a strong dependency between the intensity of certain Raman bands was observed at the amide positions of 1276 and 1658 cm
