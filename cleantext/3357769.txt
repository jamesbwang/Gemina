  Massive expansion of a DNA hexanucleotide sequence repeat ( C2G4) within the human C9orf72 gene has been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In sodium or potassium salt solutions , single-stranded d ( C2G4) n DNAs fold to form G-quadruplexes. We have found that in magnesium or lithium salt solutions , especially under slightly acidic conditions , d ( C2G4) n oligonucleotides fold to form a distinctive higher order structure whose most striking feature is an `` inverted '' circular dichroism spectrum , which is distinguishable from the spectrum of the left handed DNA double-helix , Z-DNA. On the basis of CD spectroscopy , gel mobility as well as chemical protection analysis , we propose that this structure , which we call `` iCD-DNA '' , may be a left-handed Hoogsteen base-paired duplex , an unorthodox G-quadruplex/i-motif composite , or a non-canonical , `` braided '' DNA triplex<pathogen>. Given that iCD-DNA forms under slightly acidic solution conditions , we do not know at this point in time whether or not it forms within living cells.
