  There has been an increased use of commercial kits for biomarker measurement , commensurate with the increased demand for biomarkers in drug development. However , in most cases these kits do not meet the quality attributes for use in regulated environment. The process for adaptation of these kits can be frustrating , time consuming and resource intensive. In addition , a lack of harmonized guidance for the validation of biomarker poses a significant challenge in the adaptation of kits in a regulated environment. The purpose of this perspective is to propose a tiered approach to commercial drug development kits with clearly defined quality attributes and to demonstrate how these kits can be adapted to perform analytical validation in a regulated environment.
