  Body mass index ( BMI) and percentage of body fat ( PBF) are used to measure obesity; however , their performance in identifying cardiometabolic risk in Southeast Asians is unclear. Generally , Asian women have higher PBF and lower BMI than do men and other ethnic populations. This study was conducted to address whether a discord exists between these measures in predicting obesity-related cardiometabolic risk in a Thai population and to test whether associations between the measures and risk factors for cardiovascular disease have a sex-specific inclination. A total of 234 ( 76 men and 158 women) outpatients were recruited. BMI obesity cutoff points were ≥ 25.0 and ≥ 27.0 kg/m Twenty-five percent of participants classified as normal-BMI had excessive fat , whereas 9 % classified as normal-PBF had excessive BMI. Good relationships were found between BMI and PBF using sex stratification ( Considerable sex-specific variations were observed between BMI and PBF in their associations with and predictability of numerous cardiometabolic biomarkers. No single measure provides a comprehensive risk predication as shown herein with the Thai population , and therefore both should be applied in screening activities.
