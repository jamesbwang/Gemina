  The effect of time-of-flight ( TOF) and point spread function ( PSF) modeling in image reconstruction has not been well studied for cardiac PET. This study assesses their separate and combined influence on Thirty-six obese patients underwent rest-stress TOF improved polar map visual uniformity and increased septal wall perfusion by up to 10 %. This increase was greater for larger patients , more evident for patients grouped by cross-sectional area than by BMI , and more prominent for females. PSF modeling increased perfusion by about 1.5 % in all cardiac segments. TOF modeling generally decreased SRS and SSS with significant decreases between 2.4 and 3.0 ( P < .05) , which could affect risk stratification; SDS remained about the same. With PSF modeling , SRS , SSS , and SDS were largely unchanged. TOF and PSF modeling affect regional and global perfusion , SRS , and SSS. Clinicians should consider these effects and gender-dependent differences when interpreting
