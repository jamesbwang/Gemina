  Natural Language Processing ( NLP) holds potential for patient care and clinical research , but a gap exists between promise and reality. While some studies have demonstrated portability of NLP systems across multiple sites , challenges remain. Strategies to mitigate these challenges can strive for complex NLP problems using advanced methods ( hard-to-reach fruit) , or focus on simple NLP problems using practical methods ( low-hanging fruit). This paper investigates a practical strategy for NLP portability using extraction of left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) as a use case. We used a tool developed at the Department of Veterans Affair ( VA) to extract the LVEF values from free-text echocardiograms in the MIMIC-III database. The approach showed an accuracy of 98.4 % , sensitivity of 99.4 % , a positive predictive value of 98.7 % , and F-score of 99.0 %. This experience , in which a simple NLP solution proved highly portable with excellent performance , illustrates the point that simple NLP applications may be easier to disseminate and adapt , and in the short term may prove more useful , than complex applications.
