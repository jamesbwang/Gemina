  Anisotropic nanoparticles , such as nanorods and nanoprisms , enable packing of complex nanoparticle structures with different symmetry and assembly orientation , which result in unique functions. Despite previous extensive efforts , formation of large areas of oriented or aligned nanoparticle structures still remains a great challenge. Here , we report fabrication of large-area arrays of vertically aligned gold nanorods ( GNR) through a controlled evaporation deposition process. We began with a homogeneous suspension of GNR and surfactants prepared in water. During drop casting on silicon substrates , evaporation of water progressively enriched the concentrations of the GNR suspension , which induces the balance<symptom> between electrostatic interactions and entropically driven depletion attraction in the evaporating solution to produce large-area arrays of self-assembled GNR on the substrates. Electron microscopy characterizations revealed the formation of layers of vertically aligned GNR arrays that consisted of hexagonally close-packed GNR in each layer. Benefiting from the close-packed GNR arrays and their smooth topography , the GNR arrays exhibited a surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) signal for molecular detection at a concentration as low as 10
