  To report refractive outcomes from an National Health Service ( NHS) cataract surgery service and assess if results meet suggested benchmark standard. Details of all patients undergoing cataract surgery in the Southern General and New Victoria hospitals in Glasgow , UK , between November 2006 and December 2016 were prospectively entered into an electronic database. Patients were reviewed 4 weeks postoperatively in the eye clinic and underwent refraction at their local optometrist prior to this appointment. Surgically uncomplicated cases with in the bag ' non-toric intraocular lens implantation were included. Patients with previous laser refractive procedures or failing to achieve 6/12 acuity or better postoperatively were excluded. Proximity to targeted postoperative refraction was documented. Over this 10-year period , 11 083 eyes underwent cataract surgery. Of these , 8943 eyes of 6936 patients ( 80.69 %) met the inclusion criteria and had both target and postoperative outcome refraction recorded. The mean difference between the targeted and outcome refraction was -0.07 D ( SD 0.67). The mean absolute error was 0.50 D. Postoperative refraction was within 1 D of target refraction for 7938 eyes ( 88.76 %) and within 0.50 D for 5577 eyes ( 62.36 %). Refractive outcomes following routine cataract surgery reported here are well within the targets recommended by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and European guidelines , but suggest that higher cataract refractive outcome benchmark standards may not yet be a realistic expectation for all NHS units with current biometry practice.
