  Discovering highly efficient , environmentally friendly , and low-cost exfoliating media that can both disperse and protect black phosphorus ( BP) remains a challenge. Herein , we demonstrate such a new molecule , N , N '- dimethylpropyleneurea ( DMPU) , for effective exfoliation and dispersion of two-dimensional BP nanosheets. A very high exfoliation efficiency of up to 16 % was achieved in DMPU , significantly surpassing other good solvents. Exfoliated flakes are free from structural disorder or oxidation. Nanosheets retain high stability in DMPU even after addition of 25 vol % of common solvents. The solvation shell appears to protect the nanosheets from reacting with water and air , more remarkably than the best solvent N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone reported so far. Molecular dynamics simulations of the exfoliation process show that DMPU is among the effective solvents , although energetically it does not appear as favorable as some other amides. We also demonstrate that our exfoliated BP nanosheets exhibit excellent antimicrobial activities against both Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , outperforming other common two-dimensional materials of graphene and MoS2 , suggesting promise in biomedical applications.
