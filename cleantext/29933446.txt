  The military population is frequently overlooked in civilian primary care due to an assumption that they are treated at the Veterans Health Administration ( VA). However , less than 50 % of eligible veterans receive VA treatment. Primary care providers ( PCPs) may need support in addressing veterans ' needs. This regional pilot study explored the current state of practice among primary care providers as it pertains to assessing patients ' veteran status and their knowledge of and comfort with treating common conditions in this population. An electronic survey was administered to PCPs ( N = 102) in Western New<pathogen> York. Survey questions asked about assessing military status , understanding of military-related health problems , and thoughts on the priority of addressing these issues in practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive summary statistics. The majority ( 56 %; n = 54) of respondents indicated they never or rarely ask their patients about military service , and only 19 % ( n = 18) said they often or always ask. Seventy-one percent ( n = 68) of providers agreed or strongly agreed it was important to know if their patient was a veteran. Participants indicated limited knowledge about military stressors , resources available for military populations , and common medical conditions impacting veterans. Our pilot results demonstrate that in a regional sample of primary care providers , providers rarely ask patients about their military history; however , they feel it is important information for patient care. While further study is needed , it may be necessary to provide education , specifically pertaining to military culture and health-related sequelae , to address barriers that may be limiting PCPs ' provision of care for this population.
