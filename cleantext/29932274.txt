  The phytohormone auxin is essential for root development in plants. OsMADS25 is a homologue of the AGL17-clade MADS-box genes in rice. Despite recent progress , the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of root development by OsMADS25 are not well known. It is unclear whether OsMADS25 regulates root development via auxin signalling. In this study , we examined the role of OsMADS25 in root development and characterized the signalling pathway through which OsMADS25 regulates root system development in rice. OsMADS25 overexpression significantly increased , but RNAi gene silencing repressed primary root ( PR) length and lateral root ( LR) density. Moreover , OsMADS25 promoted LR development in response to NO
