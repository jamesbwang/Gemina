  In biomedical sciences , the function of a protein of interest is investigated by altering its net activity and assessing the consequences for the cell or organism. To change the activity of a protein , a wide variety of chemical and genetic tools have been developed. The drawback of most of these tools is that they do not allow for reversible , spatial and temporal control. Here , we describe selected developments in photopharmacology that aim at establishing such control over protein activity through bioactive molecules with photo-controlled potency. We also discuss why such control is desired and what challenges still need to be overcome for photopharmacology to reach its maturity as a chemical biology research tool.
