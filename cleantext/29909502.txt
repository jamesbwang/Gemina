  An iron scarcity often occurs in chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL) , a biomarker of acute kidney injury , is associated with iron metabolism. The present study determined the association between serum NGAL and iron status in chronic kidney disease with anemia<symptom> A total of 154 adult CKD patients were divided into anemia<symptom> and without anemia<symptom> groups. The anemia<symptom> groups were further subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of iron deficiency , defined as a transferrin saturation ( TSAT) < 20 %. The NGAL was measured for all the 154 patients , and the possible relationships with iron status were analyzed. 27.7 % patients with TSAT < 20 % presented lower hemoglobin , serum iron , serum ferritin , and higher NGAL values than those without iron deficiency. NGAL was inversely correlated with hemoglobin , hematocrit , MCV , MCH , serum iron , and TSAT. NGAL adequately diagnosed the status of iron deficiency among CKD patients by ROC analysis. The optimal NGAL cutoff value able to identify iron deficiency was found to be > 244.8 ng/mL , with 73.01 % sensitivity and 68.29 % specificity. CKD patients with anemia<symptom> presented altered NGAL values as this protein is involved in the maintenance of iron balance<symptom>. Thus , NGAL might be proposed as a new tool for assessing the iron deficiency and in the management of iron therapy for CKD patients.
