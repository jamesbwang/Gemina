  Hyperuricemia and gout represent important issues in the obese patients. Considering the epidemic trend of overweight and obesity in developed countries , the impact of these conditions is likely to increase. At present , bariatric surgery represents the most effective treatment for the management of severe obesity for reducing weight and the impact of associated comorbidities , but its effects on hyperuricemia and gout have not been fully elucidated. In this narrative review , we discuss the current knowledge about hyperuricemia and gout in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We also suggest a useful approach to prevent gouty attacks in the perioperative period. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> seems to reduce hyperuricemia in the long-term follow-up , but there is evidence also of a high frequency of acute attacks early after surgery in patients with a diagnosis of gout. Bariatric surgery has a high impact on hyperuricemia and gout. A perioperative approach is suggested , based on appropriate hydration , early physical resumption , urate lowering drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) , or colchicine and corticosteroids if NSAIDs are ineffective or not tolerated.
