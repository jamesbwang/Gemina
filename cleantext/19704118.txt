  Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) contains heterogeneous subtypes with various molecular dysregulation at the gene , protein and microRNA levels. Compared with the GCB subtype , the non-germinal center B-like ( non-GCB)/ activated B cell-like ( ABC) subtype<pathogen> exhibits frequent progression despite standard immunochemotherapy. We aimed to investigate the effects of miR-197 on the progression and chemosensitivity of DLBCL with respect to the GCB and non-GCB/ABC subtypes. To screen distinctively expressed microRNAs , microRNA expression patterns were analyzed in 10 DLBCL cases by microarray chip assays. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) , associations between miR-197 expression levels and clinicopathologic variables were investigated in 51 DLBCL tissue samples. The effects of miR-197 on doxorubicin chemosensitivity were investigated using the OCI-Ly1 and SUDHL9 cell lines. MicroRNA expression profiling by hierarchical clustering revealed that miR-197 was one of the distinctively expressed microRNAs in DLBCL. Quantitative analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that miR-197 levels were not correlated with clinicopathologic variables , including the international prognostic index , but low miR-197 levels were significantly associated with lymphoma progression defined by refractoriness , relapse or death in the rituximab plus cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( R-CHOP)- treated subgroup ( n = 43; p = 0.004). Among the three molecular groups , i.e. , the GCB , non-GCB/miR -197 These results suggest the role of miR-197 as a biomarker with potential therapeutic implications.
