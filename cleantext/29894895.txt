  Glyphosate , as a broad-spectrum herbicide , is frequently detected in water , and phosphorus widely enters the water due to the extensive use of phosphorus-containing substances in agriculture , industries and daily life. Thus , aquatic ecosystems are exposed to both glyphosate and phosphorus , which may affect aquatic organisms. In the present research , we studied the physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> of the floating aquatic plant species H. dubia to different concentrations of glyphosate ( 0 , 1 , 5 , 15 mg/L) with different levels of phosphate ( 0 , 50 , 100 mg/L) after 14 days ( d) of treatment. We explored glyphosate toxicity in H. dubia and investigated whether phosphate addition mitigates glyphosate toxicity in this species , which will provide a theoretical basis for the ecotoxicological study of aquatic plants. The results show that glyphosate significantly reduced the chlorophyll content , leaf number and root length of H. dubia , while it significantly increased the malondialdehyde ( MDA) , hydrogen peroxide ( H
