  Self-injurious behaviours ( SIB) continue to afflict a significant segment of the clinical and general population , sometimes with fatal consequences. The development of SIB seems to share developmental pathways and mechanisms similar to attachment insecurity. To date , no reviews have explored their relationship. A search of publication databases PubMed and PsychInfo from 1969 through April 2018 was conducted. 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Of the 17 articles identified , 13 reported a positive relationship and 1 reported a negative relationship between attachment insecurity and SIB. Both attachment anxiety<symptom> and avoidance seem to play a role in the risk for SIB , possibly through different mechanisms and likely with different impacts on the choice for either self-harm or suicide attempts.
