  This study reports the fabrication of porogen-induced , surface-modified , 3-dimensionally microporous regenerated bacterial cellulose ( rBC)/ gelatin ( 3DMP rBC/G) scaffolds for skin regeneration applications. Round shaped gelatin microspheres ( GMS) , fabricated using a water-in-oil emulsion ( WOE) method , were utilized as the porogen. The dissolution of GMS from the solution casted BC scaffolds led to surface-modified microporous rBC. The scaffolds were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM) and elemental analysis. FE-SEM analysis confirmed the regular microporosity of the 3DMP rBC/G scaffolds , while elemental analysis confirmed the successful surface modification of cellulose with gelatin. In vitro tests showed good adhesion and proliferation of human keratinocytes ( HaCaT) on the 3DMP rBC/G scaffolds during 7 days of incubation. Confocal microscopy showed penetration of HaCaT cells into the scaffolds , up to 300 Î¼m in depth. In vivo wound<disease> healing and skin regeneration experiments , in experimental mice , showed complete skin regeneration within 2 weeks. The wound<disease> closure efficacy of the 3DMP rBC/G scaffolds was much higher ( 93 %) than that of the control ( 47 %) and pure BC-treated ( 63 %) wounds<disease> These results indicated that our 3DMP rBC/G scaffolds represent future candidate materials for skin regeneration applications.
