  Gastric varices ( GVs) are a major cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis. The current treatments of choice are balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration ( BRTO) and the placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS). We aimed to compare the efficacy and outcomes of these two methods for the management of GV bleeding. This retrospective study included consecutive patients who received BRTO ( n = 157) or TIPS ( n = 19) to control GV bleeding from January 2005 to December 2014 at a single tertiary hospital in Korea. The overall survival ( OS) , immediate bleeding control rate , rebleeding rate and complication rate were compared between patients in the BRTO and TIPS groups. Patients in the BRTO group showed higher immediate bleeding control rates ( p = 0.059 , odds ratio ( OR) = 4.72) and lower cumulative rebleeding rates ( log-rank p = 0.060) than those in the TIPS group , although the difference failed to reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences in the rates of complications , including pleural effusion<symptom> , aggravation of esophageal varices , portal hypertensive gastropathy , and portosystemic encephalopathy , although the rate of the progression of ascites was significantly higher in the BRTO group ( p = 0.02 , OR = 7.93). After adjusting for several confounding factors using a multivariate Cox analysis , the BRTO group had a significantly longer OS ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) = 0.44 , p = 0.01) and a longer rebleeding-free survival ( aHR = 0.34 , p = 0.001) than the TIPS group. BRTO provides better bleeding control , rebleeding-free survival , and OS than TIPS for patients with GV bleeding.
