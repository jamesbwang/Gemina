  All males and females attending the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre ( MSHC) from August 2017 were asked whether they had had sex with a transgender or gender diverse ( TGD) person using computer-assisted self-interviewing ( CASI). We aimed to verify the self-reported responses via chart review. The secondary aim of this study was to identify whether having sex with a TGD person was associated with STI risk. This was a retrospective chart analysis of patients visiting MSHC between August and December 2017. Chart review was performed to verify the self-reported responses. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the association between having sex with a TGD person and patients ' characteristics and STI risk. Of the 10100 male and female consultations , the proportion who reported having sex with a TGD person was 111 ( 1.0 %) and was higher among males ( 1.3 %) than females ( 0.6 %) ( p = 0.001). After chart review , we could verify 66.9 % of the responses , more for males ( 75.2 %) than females ( 45.2 %) ( p < 0.001). Of the 6822 males , men aged ≥ 35 years ( adjusted OR = 2.2; 95 % CI 1.1 to 4.1) were more likely to have sex with a TGD person compared with men aged ≤ 24 years , after adjusting for confounding factors. Sex with a TGD person was not associated with sexual orientation in males. Of the 3278 females , gay and bisexual females had 13.7-fold ( 95 % CI 5.1 to 37.0) higher odds of having sex with a TGD person than heterosexual females. There was no association between chlamydia<pathogen> positivity and sex with a TGD person in both males and females. When a question on TGD partners is asked as part of routine sexual history using CASI , the majority of responses could be verified. TGD partners were most commonly reported among males. These findings underscore the value of asking patients about sex with TGD partners.
