  In this paper , a novel embeded elliptic cylindrical posts ( ECPs) with large surface area and wide effective width , which could support more stationary phase and decrease the pressure drop , is applied on the micro-fabricated gas chromatographic ( μGC) column. Compared with μGC column with cylindrical posts ( CPs) , the surface area and effective width of μGC column with ECPs are increased by 29 % and 30 %. Separation experiments are performed under the same head pressure at column inlet: in experiments of separating mixture 1 , the column efficiency of the μGC column with ECPs for C9 has a 76 % improvement , and the separation resolution between C8 and C9 also has a 34 % improvement; in experiments of separating mixture 2 , seven kinds of analytes can be identified by the μGC column with ECPs less than ten minutes , while , only six kinds can be identified by the μGC column with CPs in almost the same time. In detail , the column efficiency of the μGC column with ECPs for toluene has a 129 % improvement , and the separation resolution between benzene and toluene also has a 56.4 % improvement. Hence , the μGC column with the inner structures of ECPs is a valid means to improve column efficiency and resolution in a lower pressure drop.
