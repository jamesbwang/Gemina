  The fatty acid composition of the diet has been linked to the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Compared with monounsaturated fatty acids , saturated fatty acids decrease fat oxidation and diet-induced thermogenesis. A potential limitation of previous studies was the short duration ( ≦ 5h) of calorimetry used. The present study compared the effects of a meal rich in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on 24-h of fat oxidation. Ten males participated in two sessions of indirect calorimetry in a whole-room metabolic chamber. At each session , subjects consumed three meals rich in palm oil ( 44.3 % as saturated , 42.3 % as monounsaturated and 13.4 % as polyunsaturated fatty acid) or rapeseed oil ( 11.7 % as saturated , 59.3 % as monounsaturated and 29.0 % as polyunsaturated fatty acid). Fat oxidation over 24-h was significantly higher in the meal rich in rapeseed oil ( 779 ± 202 kcal/day) than that rich in palm oil ( 703 ± 158 kcal/day , P < 0.05) , although energy expenditure was similar between both meal conditions. Meal rich in unsaturated fatty acids increased the oxidation of exogenous and/or endogenous fat. The results of a long calorimetry period indicate that rapeseed oil offered an advantage toward increased 24-h fat oxidation in healthy young males.
