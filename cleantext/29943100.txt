  To compare sub-tenon steroid plus anti-VEGF injection with anti-VEGF injection solely in the treatment of resistant diabetic macular edema<symptom> ( DME). Patients who exhibited insufficient anatomic ( over 350 μm central macular thickness ( CMT)) and less than 3 lines of visual gain at least six anti-VEGF injections , were randomly divided into two groups. In group I , the anti-VEGF injection was performed 10 days after the sub-tenon steroid injection ( Triamcinolone acetonide ( Sinakort-A The baseline BCVA in group I and group II was 0.51 ± 0.667 logMAR and 0.47 ± 0.60 logMAR , respectively ( p = 0.52). In group I and II , at the end of 6-month follow-up , BCVA improved to 0.38 ± 0.60 logMAR ( p < 0.001) and 0.43 ± 0.60 logMAR ( p = 0.20) , respectively. The baseline CMT in group I and group II was 494 ± 118.32 and 438.20 ± 90.99 μm , respectively ( p = 0.029). In group I and II , at the end of 6 months , CMT decreased to 302.57 ± 69.89 μm ( p < 0.001) and 439.20 ± 107.6 μm ( p = 0.96) , respectively. Adding steroid to routine anti-VEGF treatment is an effective way of treatment method for resistant DME.
