  Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes , interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application , normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest<disease> ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs , trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in
