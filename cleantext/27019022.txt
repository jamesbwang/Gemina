  Motor actions can be facilitated or hindered by psychophysiological states of readiness , to guide rapid adaptive action. Cardiovascular arousal is communicated by cardiac signals conveying the timing and strength of individual heartbeats. Here , we tested how these interoceptive signals facilitate control of motor impulsivity. Participants performed a stop signal task , in which stop cues were delivered at different time points within the cardiac cycle: at systole when the heart contracts ( T-wave peak , approximately 300 ms following the R-wave) , or at diastole between heartbeats ( R-wave peak). Response inhibition was better at systole , indexed by a shorter stop signal reaction time ( SSRT) , and longer stop signal delay ( SSD). Furthermore , parasympathetic control of cardiovascular tone , and subjective sensitivity to interoceptive states , predicted response inhibition efficiency , although these cardiovascular and interoceptive correlations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. This suggests that response inhibition capacity is influenced by interoceptive physiological cues , such that people are more likely to express impulsive actions during putative states of lower cardiovascular arousal , when frequency and strength of cardiac afferent signalling is reduced.
