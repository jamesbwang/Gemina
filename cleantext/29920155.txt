  The purpose of this study was to classify runners in sex-specific groups as either competitive or recreational based on center of mass ( CoM) accelerations. Forty-one runners participated in the study ( 25 male and 16 female) , and were labeled as competitive or recreational based on age , sex , and race performance. Three-dimensional acceleration data were collected during a 5-minute treadmill run , and 24 features were extracted. Support vector machine classification models were used to examine the utility of the features in discriminating between competitive and recreational runners within each sex-specific subgroup. Competitive and recreational runners could be classified with 82.63 % and 80.4 % in the male and female models , respectively. Dominant features in both models were related to regularity and variability , with competitive runners exhibiting more consistent running gait patterns , but the specific features were slightly different in each sex-specific model. Therefore , it is important to separate runners into sex-specific competitive and recreational subgroups for future running biomechanical studies. In conclusion , we have demonstrated the ability to analyze running biomechanics in competitive and recreational runners using only CoM acceleration patterns. A runner , clinician , or coach may use this information to monitor how running patterns change as a result of training.
