  Increasing usage of next-generation sequencing techniques pushed during the last decade cardiogenetic diagnostics leading to the identification of a huge number of genetic variants in about 170 genes associated with cardiomyopathies , channelopathies , or syndromes<disease> with cardiac involvement. Because of the biochemical and cellular complexity , it is challenging to understand the clinical meaning or even the relevant pathomechanisms of the majority of genetic sequence variants. However , detailed knowledge about the associated molecular pathomechanism is essential for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies in future and genetic counseling. Mutations in DES , encoding the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein desmin , have been identified in different kinds of cardiac and skeletal myopathies. Here , we review the functions of desmin in health and disease with a focus on cardiomyopathies. In addition , we will summarize the genetic and clinical literature about DES mutations and will explain relevant cell and animal models. Moreover , we discuss upcoming perspectives and consequences of novel experimental approaches like genome editing technology , which might open a novel research field contributing to the development of efficient and mutation-specific treatment options.
