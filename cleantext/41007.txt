  During heating , there are a lot of physical and chemical changes in milk components , which are mainly reflected in the changes of proteins. Calcium ions in milk react with proteins to precipitate or form gels , and the thermal stability of milk is affected by the type and content of calcium. In this study , different calcium-fortified milk systems were treated by rapid conventional heating ( RCV) and microwave heating ( MV) to evaluate the effects of forms and concentration of calcium in liquid milk on microwave absorption properties and thermal stability of milk. It was found that the concentration of calcium ions on microwave energy absorption is not a significant influence , while the forms affected the systems dramatically. The thermal stability of milk during MV is remarkably affected by the forms of calcium ions. When adding ionized calcium , the calcium-fortified milk systems had poor thermal stability and severe agglomeration of protein , while the addition of milk calcium had little effect and was almost free from protein coagulation. It could be speculated that the metal ions in the microwave field could create a strong vibration that could trigger protein agglomeration through the combination of the surrounding casein phosphorylates.
