  Laryngeal cancer ( LC) remains a challenging disease to treat. The majority of LCs diagnosed worldwide are squamous cell carcinomas ( SCC) , and current treatment guidelines are designed to address conventional laryngeal SCC. However , several histologically rare tumor types can originate in the larynx. There is a lack of guidelines regarding the best therapeutic approaches to these tumors and their treatment is often modeled after their recommended management at non-laryngeal sites. Understanding the role for systemic therapy in these rare tumors is important , especially for patients with advanced disease or those who are not surgical candidates. We provide in this manuscript a detailed and comprehensive overview of systemic therapy considerations for the following histologic tumor types of the larynx: verrucous carcinoma ( VC) , HPV-related SCC , basaloid SCC ( BSCC) , lymphoepithelial carcinoma ( LEC) , adenosquamous carcinoma ( ASC) , typical and atypical carcinoid , small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma ( SCNC) , large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma ( LCNC) , NUT midline carcinomas ( NUTMC) , melanoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma , rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS) , malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( MFH) , lymphoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma ( MEC) , acinic cell carcinoma , and spindle cell carcinoma ( SpCC).
