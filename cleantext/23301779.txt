  ( Purpose) This study describes and compares the conditioning services of the roller hockey teams of the two most important leagues in Spain: the OK Liga and the First Division. ( Subjects and Methods) A survey was administered to the people responsible for physical preparation. The response rate was 93 %. ( Results) 75 % of the OK Liga teams have hired someone full time exclusively for training , with a university degree. The percentage was significantly lower in the First Division , at a 43.7 %. A low percentage of the physical trainers continued with their academic training , and the consultation of scientific journals. The main deficiencies are associated with the strength training equipment and facilities. In the First Division teams , significant deficiencies were found in most of the variables associated with the training environment. These results show significant deficiencies in the conditioning services offered by the teams to their players , especially in non-professional and lower performance level teams. ( Conclusion) Spanish physical trainers should take advantage of advances in scientific knowledge in the area of conditioning by studying Masters and consulting scientific journals. The clubs directors and/or coaches should be aware of the importance of conditioning to improve the training environment. Both aspects would offer a better training and rehabilitation procedure in the club.
