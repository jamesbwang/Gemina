  With suppressed photon scattering and diminished autofluorescence , in vivo fluorescence imaging in the 1,500- to 1,700-nm range of the near-IR ( NIR) spectrum ( NIR-IIb window) can afford high clarity and deep tissue penetration. However , there has been a lack of NIR-IIb fluorescent probes with sufficient brightness and aqueous stability. Here , we present a bright fluorescent probe emitting at ∼ 1,600 nm based on core/shell lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide ( CdS) quantum dots ( CSQDs) synthesized in organic phase. The CdS shell plays a critical role of protecting the lead sulfide ( PbS) core from oxidation and retaining its bright fluorescence through the process of amphiphilic polymer coating and transferring to water needed for imparting aqueous stability and compatibility. The resulting CSQDs with a branched PEG outer layer exhibited a long blood circulation half-life of 7 hours and enabled through-skin , real-time imaging of blood flows in mouse vasculatures at an unprecedented 60 frames per second ( fps) speed by detecting ∼ 1,600-nm fluorescence under 808-nm excitation. It also allowed through-skin in vivo confocal 3D imaging of tumor vasculatures in mice with an imaging depth of ∼ 1.2 mm. The PEG-CSQDs accumulated in tumor effectively through the enhanced permeation and retention effect , affording a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio up to ∼ 32 owing to the bright ∼ 1,600-nm emission and nearly zero autofluorescence background resulting from a large ∼ 800-nm Stoke 's shift. The aqueous-compatible CSQDs are excreted through the biliary pathway without causing obvious toxicity effects , suggesting a useful class of ∼ 1,600-nm emitting probes for biomedical research.
