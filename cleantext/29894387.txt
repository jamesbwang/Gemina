  The impact of short-term analytical antiretroviral therapy ( ART) interruptions on the levels of cellular HIV<pathogen> and of residual activation after subsequent ART-mediated plasma HIV<pathogen> viral load re-suppression remains under active investigation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) from 23 ART-suppressed , chronically HIV-1-infected subjects were evaluated at the initiation of an analytical treatment interruption ( ATI) , during ATI , and following plasma re-suppression of HIV<pathogen> with ART. T cell activation was measured by flow cytometry. Total cellular HIV<pathogen> DNA , and episomal 2-long terminal repeat ( 2-LTR) circles were measured by droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR). Cellular HIV<pathogen> multiply spliced RNA ( tat/rev) , unspliced ( gag) , and poly ( A) tailed transcripts ( poly ( A)) were measured by reverse transcriptase-ddPCR. Analyses were performed using R version 2.5.1 , or JMP Pro 11. ATI ( median ATI duration = 4 weeks) resulted in a rise of plasma HIV<pathogen> RNA ( median = 72900 copies/ml) , decrease in CD4 T cells/mm ( median = 511.5 cells/mm; P = 0.0001) , increase in T cell activation , and increase in cellular HIV<pathogen> DNA and RNA. Mean fluorescence intensity of CD38 on CD4HLA-DR T cells at baseline was positively associated with total HIV<pathogen> DNA levels during ATI ( pol: P = 0.03 , Rho = 0.44). Upon ART resumption , plasma HIV<pathogen> re-suppression occurred after a median of 13 weeks and resulted in restoration of pre-ATI CD4 T cells/mm , T cell activation , and levels of cellular HIV<pathogen> DNA and RNA. Monitored viremia and immune activation during an ATI in ART-suppressed chronic HIV-infected subjects does not change the amount of persistent cellular HIV<pathogen> RNA or total HIV<pathogen> DNA after ART-mediated re-suppression.
