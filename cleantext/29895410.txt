  A pseudo simulated moving bed ( SMB) with solvent gradient was used to trap and separate paclitaxel from yew extracum. This SMB process consisted of three steps: feeding , purification and recovery. In comparison with methanol/water as an eluent , acetonitrile/water could give a better separation but had a poor dissolubility of the yew extracum , and therefore methanol/water was used in the feeding followed by acetonitrile/water in the purification. In the first two steps , water was deliberately added into zone III to modulate the eluotropic strength of the liquid entering zone III , so as to make paclitaxel separation from impurities be more efficient. Once most of impurities discarded , the columns were in turn eluted to recover the trapped paclitaxel of 98 % yield with a purity of 78 % from the yew extracum containing 1.5 % paclitaxel. Afterward , an additional operation of crystallization improved the purity further to 97.8 % with the yield of 95 %.
