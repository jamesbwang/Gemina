  Reported complication rates for minimally invasive lateral transpsoas interbody fusion ( MIS-LIF) vary widely. The risk of lumbar plexus injury is particularly concerning at the L4-5 disc space. We report our experience with MIS-LIF at L4-5 , and discuss the risk profile of transpsoas approaches at this level. To evaluate safety of MIS-LIF at the L4/5 level. This was a retrospective , IRB-approved cohort study performed at a single institution from 2011 to 2016. Patients who underwent MIS-LIF at L4-5 were included. Patients with multilevel fusions were excluded. We analyzed postoperative sensory and motor deficits , the date of resolution , health-related quality-of-life scores , and rate of fusion. Over a 5-yr period , 303 patients underwent MIS-LIF at our institution. Sixty-one patients had surgery only at the L4-5 level ( 20.1 %). Twelve of these patients ( 19.6 %) had postoperative neurological deficits including 2 motor deficits ( 2/61 = 3.2 %) and 11/61 ( 18 %) sensory deficits. At 12-mo follow-up , 3 of the deficits persisted for a long-term complication rate of 3/61 ( 4.9 %) , motor complication 2/61 ( 3.2 %). Hospital stay and follow-up averaged 2.1 d and 15 mo.. Average Oswestry Disability Index improved from 51.1 to 31.1 ( P < .00001). Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) improved from 7.4 to 3.9 ( P < .016). There were no reoperations secondary to hardware failure or pseudoarthrosis. Fusion rate was 89 % at 12 mo.. MIS-LIF is a safe and effective approach for interbody fusion at L4-5 with low rate of lumbar plexus injury. Most immediate postoperative deficits will resolve over time.
