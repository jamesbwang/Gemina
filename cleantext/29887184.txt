  To evaluate treatment outcomes with percutaneous cryoablation ( PCA) based on renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) histology. Patients treated with PCA for a solitary , sporadic stage T1a RCC from 2003 to 2016 were identified from a single institution 's renal ablation registry. Patients with multiple tumors , history of RCC , or genetic syndromes<disease> associated with RCC ( n = 60); no specific RCC subtype determined from core biopsy ( n = 66); RCC subtype other than clear-cell or papillary ( n = 7); or less than 3 mo of follow-up imaging ( n = 5) were excluded. In total , 173 patients met study inclusion criteria. Oncologic outcomes , clinical outcomes , and complications were evaluated based on tumor subtype. Of the 173 patients who underwent PCA for a stage T1a RCC , 130 ( 75 %) had clear-cell RCC ( ccRCC) and 43 ( 25 %) had papillary RCC ( pRCC). Median tumor size was 2.9 cm ( range , 1.3-4.0 cm). Technically successful cryoablation was achieved in all 173 patients. Local tumor recurrence developed in 6 patients with ccRCC ( 4.6 %) , new renal tumors developed in 1 patient ( 0.8 %) , and metastatic RCC developed in 1 patient ( 0.8 %) who also had local tumor recurrence. No patients with pRCC showed local tumor recurrence , new renal tumors , or metastatic disease. The 5-year disease-free survival rate in patients with ccRCC was 88 % , compared with 100 % in patients with pRCC ( P = .48). Nine patients ( 5.2 %) , all with ccRCC , experienced major complications ( P = .11). Percutaneous ablation is a viable treatment option for patients with clinical stage T1a pRCC and ccRCC. Percutaneous ablation may be a very favorable treatment strategy particularly for pRCC.
