  Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring involves the use of various modalities , including somatosensory evoked potentials ( SEP) , to assess the integrity of the at-risk nervous system during surgeries. Reliable baseline tracings are important because they are data against which future tracings are compared to detect potential injury. In some cases , adequate baselines may be difficult to achieve. Therefore , we analyzed several patient-specific factors to determine which variables are associated with inadequate intraoperative SEP baseline signals. This is a single-center , retrospective chart review of 631 consecutive patients who underwent spine or cranial surgeries between 2010 and 2011. Variables analyzed included age , glucose levels , diabetes mellitus type 2 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , height , weight , sex , smoking , preexisting neurologic conditions , surgical history , lower extremity edema<symptom> , and neurologic examination findings. Association between these patient factors and baseline lower extremity SEP signals were analyzed. Height , weight , neurologic deficits , lower extremity edema<symptom> , and history of neurologic disease are each associated with inadequate baseline lower extremity SEPs after controlling for confounding variables. Baseline signals were able to be acquired in 94.1 % of patients. Adequate baselines are paramount for successful intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring. However , certain patient-specific factors are associated with inadequate baseline SEP signals. Physical examination findings and a detailed chart review can be done to identify these factors and guide expectations during monitoring. Further research related to patient-specific factors amenable to modification can further improve our capacity to protect the nervous system during surgery.
