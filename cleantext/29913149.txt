  Nitric oxide ( NO) is an important gas signal that regulates many biological processes , and due to the high nitrogen recycling activity in the rhizosphere , NO is an important signaling molecule in this region. Thus , an understanding of the effect of NO on the rhizomicrobiome , especially on plant beneficial rhizobacteria , is important for the use of these bacteria in agriculture. In this study , the effect of exogenous NO on the beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens SQR9 was investigated. The results showed that low concentrations of NO increased the ability of the strain SQR9 to form biofilms , while high concentrations of NO inhibited the growth of this bacterium<pathogen>. The SQR9 gene yflM encodes nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) , which is used to synthesize NO , while the gene ykvO encodes a sepiapterin reductase that is used to synthesize tetrahydrobiopterin , the coenzyme of NOS. Isothermal titration calorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses demonstrated an interaction between YkvO and NADPH. SQR9 has two hmp genes , although only one was observed to be responsible for NO detoxification through oxidization. This study revealed the effect of NO on plant beneficial rhizobacterium and assessed the ability of this strain to adapt to exogenous NO , which will help to improve the application of this strain in agricultural production.
