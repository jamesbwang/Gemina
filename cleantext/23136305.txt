  The number of undergraduate public health education programs is increasing , but few publications provide examples of introductory public health courses that provide foundational knowledge and meet 2016 Council on Education in Public Health ( CEPH) accreditation standards. This article presents the development and testing of a three-course , introductory series in public health at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa ( UHM). Development was informed by best pedagogical practices in education , web review of existing programs , literature review , key informant interviews , and accreditation standards. Student mastery of required concepts , domains , and competencies is assessed through testing and class assignments. Data from course evaluations , students ' exit questionnaires at graduation , and faculty feedback were used to continuously evolve and adapt the curriculum. The three-course series-including Introduction to Public Health , Public Health Issues in Hawai'i , and Introduction to Global Health-was designed to provide incoming undergraduate public health students with a foundation in local , national , and global public health concepts and domains , while improving their skills in public health communication and information literacy. Data from class assignments , examinations , and later coursework suggest students are mastering the course materials and gaining required competencies. Data from course evaluation and exit questionnaires suggest that the students appreciate the series ' approach and the challenge to apply course concepts locally and globally in subsequent courses. This foundational public health series provides a model for an introductory course series that can be implemented with existing resources by most programs , meets the new CEPH requirements , is well-received by students , and prepares students well for upper-division public health courses.
