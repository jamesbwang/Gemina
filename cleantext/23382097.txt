  BACKGROUND The present study was performed to explore the presence of informative protein biomarkers of human serum proteome in idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum samples were profiled using iTRAQ coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( 2D-LC-MS/MS) technique , and ELISA was used to validate candidate biomarkers. RESULTS A total of 394 proteins were identified and 97 proteins were associated with IPF. Four biomarker candidates generated from iTRAQ experiments- CRP , fibrinogen-Î± chain , haptoglobin , and kininogen-1- were successfully verified using ELISA. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that levels of CRP and fibrinogen-a are higher and levels of haptoglobin and kininogen-1 are lower in patients with IPF compared to levels in healthy controls. We found they are useful candidate biomarkers for IPF.
