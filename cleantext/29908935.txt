  Brain activity at rest is characterized by widely distributed and spatially specific patterns of synchronized low-frequency blood-oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) fluctuations , which correspond to physiologically relevant brain networks. This network behaviour is known to persist also during task execution , yet the details underlying task-associated modulations of within- and between-network connectivity are largely unknown. In this study we exploited a multi-parametric and multi-scale approach to investigate how low-frequency fluctuations adapt to a sustained n-back working memory task. We found that the transition from the resting state to the task state involves a behaviourally relevant and scale-invariant modulation of synchronization patterns within both task-positive and default mode networks. Specifically , decreases of connectivity within networks are accompanied by increases of connectivity between networks. In spite of large and widespread changes of connectivity strength , the overall topology of brain networks is remarkably preserved. We show that these findings are strongly influenced by connectivity at rest , suggesting that the absolute change of connectivity ( i.e. , disregarding the baseline) may not be the most suitable metric to study dynamic modulations of functional connectivity. Our results indicate that a task can evoke scale-invariant , distributed changes of BOLD fluctuations , further confirming that low frequency BOLD oscillations show a specialized response and are tightly bound to task-evoked activation.
