  To determine whether hypotensive drugs may play a pivotal role in inducing orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( OH)- related syncope. Prospective , observational , multicenter study. Acute care wards , syncope units , and centers for the diagnosis of dementia. Individuals aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of dementia and 1 or more episodes of transient<symptom> loss<symptom> of consciousness<symptom> of a suspected syncopal nature or unexplained falls during the previous 3 months MEASUREMENTS: Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was measured in the supine position and in the orthostatic position after 1 and 3 minutes. OH was defined as a decrease in systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of 20 mmHg or more and in diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of 10 mmHg or more within 3 minutes of standing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate associations between hypotensive drugs and their combinations with OH-related syncope. The mean age of the study population ( n = 522; women , n = 324) was 83.5 ± 6.1 , and the most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension ( 74.5 %); 324 ( 67.8 %) participants had had a syncopal fall and 168 ( 32.2 %) a nonsyncopal fall. The mean number of hypotensive drugs administered ( 2.9 ± 3.1) did not differ between the two groups. Syncopal falls was OH-related in 170 participants ( 48.0 %). OH-related syncopal falls were more frequent in participants receiving nitrates ( 15.3 % vs 9.8 % , p = .06) , alpha-blockers ( 16.5 % vs 9.8 % , p = .04) , or combinations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACE-Is) and diuretics ( 20.6 % vs 13.0 % , p = .04) , alpha-blockers and diuretics ( 8.2 % vs 3.3 % , p = 0.036) , and ACE-Is and nitrates ( 8.2 % vs 3.3 % , p = .10). Multivariate analysis confirmed a greater risk of OH-related syncopal fall for nitrates ( relative risk ( RR) = 1.77) , combinations of ACE-Is and diuretics ( RR = 1.66) , and combinations of ACE-Is and nitrates ( RR = 2.32). In older adults with dementia , OH-related syncopal falls are significantly related to treatment with nitrates , combinations of ACE-Is and diuretics , and combinations of ACE-Is and nitrates.
