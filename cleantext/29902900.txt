  The comparison on evaluating blood stasis syndrome<disease> in sleep deprived rats was carried out by using R , G , B image analysis of Tongue and palm as well as auricle , palm surface laser Doppler flow perfusion. The experiment was performed by means of a small platform on the water environment for sleep deprivation. The rats were weekly weighed at fixed time , and their macroscopic signs were observed; and their tongue and palm images of the control and model group were respectively collected by the SLR camera at the 2nd , 4th and 6th week. Then the color saturation analysis was performed by means of proofreading with the standard colorimetric card. At the same time , the laser dopper flowmetry was used to analyze the perfusion of auricle and foot flow in rats. It turned out that there was no significant difference in the R , G , B value of the tongue and palm in rats between normal group and model group at the first stage ( at the 2nd week) , so were the perfusion of auricle and foot flow in rats. But at the second stage ( at the 4th week) , the R value of tongue in model group rats was obviously lower than that in normal group (
