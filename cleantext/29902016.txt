  Understanding solute uptake into soft microstructured materials , such as bilayers and worm-like and spherical micelles , is of interest in the pharmaceutical , agricultural , and personal care industries. To obtain molecular-level insight on the effects of solutes loading into a lamellar phase , we utilize the Shinoda-Devane-Klein ( SDK) coarse-grained force field in conjunction with configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the osmotic Gibbs ensemble. The lamellar phase is comprised of a bilayer formed by triethylene glycol mono- n-decyl ether ( C10E3) surfactants surrounded by water with a 50:50 surfactant/water weight ratio. We study both the unary adsorption isotherm and the effects on bilayer structure and stability caused by n-nonane , 1-hexanol , and ethyl butyrate at several different reduced reservoir pressures. The nonpolar n-nonane molecules load near the center of the bilayer. In contrast , the polar 1-hexanol and ethyl butyrate molecules both load with their polar bead close to the surfactant head groups. Near the center of the bilayer , none of the solute molecules exhibits a significant orientational preference. Solute molecules adsorbed near the polar groups of the surfactant chains show a preference for orientations perpendicular to the interface , and this alignment with the long axis of the surfactant molecules is most pronounced for 1-hexanol. Loading of n-nonane leads to an increase of the bilayer thickness , but does not affect the surface area per surfactant. Loading of polar additives leads to both lateral and transverse swelling. The reduced Henry 's law constants of adsorption ( expressed as a molar ratio of additive to surfactant per reduced pressure) are 0.23 , 1.4 , and 14 for n-nonane , 1-hexanol , and ethyl butyrate , respectively , and it appears that the SDK force field significantly overestimates the ethyl butyrate-surfactant interactions.
