  Newcastle<pathogen> disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( NDV) is a major cause of infectious mortality and morbidity in poultry worldwide. It is an enveloped virus with two outer-membrane proteins-haemagglutinin-neuraminidase ( HN) and fusion protein ( F)- that induce neutralizing antibodies. All NDV strains belong to one serotype. Yet , NDV vaccines , derived from genotype II , do not fully prevent infection or shedding of viruses from other genotypes. The aim of this study was to test if an updated vaccine is required. For this purpose , NDVs isolated from infected , albeit heavily vaccinated , flocks were genetically and immunologically characterized. Amino acid differences in F and HN protein sequences were identified between the vaccine strain and each of the isolates , some specifically at the neutralization sites. Whereas all tested isolates showed similar haemagglutination-inhibition ( HI) titres , 100-100,000 times higher antibody-to-virus ratios were needed to neutralize viral propagation in embryos by the field isolates versus the vaccine strain. As a result , a model and an equation were developed to explain the phenomenon of escape in one-serotype viruses and to calculate the HI values needed for protection , depending on variation rate at key positions. In conclusion , to confer full protection against NDVs that differ from the vaccine strain at the neutralizing epitopes , very high levels of antibodies should be raised and maintained to compensate for the reduction in the number of effective epitopes; alternatively , an adjusted attenuated vaccine should be developed-a task made possible in the current era of reverse vaccinology.
