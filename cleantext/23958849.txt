  At present , solvothermal fabrication method has widely been applied in the synthesis of spinel ferrite nanoparticles ( SFNs) , which is mainly because of its great advantages such as precise control over size , shape distribution , and high crystallinity that do not require postannealing treatment. Among various SFNs , Fe
