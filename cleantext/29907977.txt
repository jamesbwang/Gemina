  Melatonin is an endogenous pleiotropic molecule which orchestrates regulatory functions and protective capacity against age-related ailments. The increase in circulating levels of melatonin through dietary supplements intensifies its health benefits. Investigations in animal models have shown that melatonin protects against Alzheimer 's disease ( AD)- like pathology , although clinical studies have not been conclusive. We hypothesized that melatonin induces changes in the brain that prevent or attenuate AD by increasing resilience. Therefore , we treated healthy nontransgenic ( NoTg) and AD transgenic ( 3xTg-AD) 6-month-old mice with a daily dose of 10 mg/kg of melatonin until 12 months of age. As expected , melatonin reversed cognitive impairment and dementia-associated behaviors of anxiety<symptom> and apathy and reduced amyloid and tau burden in 3xTg-AD mice. Remarkably , melatonin induced cognitive enhancement and higher wellness level-related behavior in NoTg mice. At the mechanism level , NF-ÎºB and proinflammatory cytokine expressions were decreased in both NoTg and 3xTg-AD mice. The SIRT1 pathway of longevity and neuroprotection was also activated in both mouse strains after melatonin dosing. Furthermore , we explored new mechanisms and pathways not previously associated with melatonin treatment such as the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system and the recently proposed neuroprotective Gas6/TAM pathway. The upregulation of proteasome activity and the modulation of Gas6 and its receptors by melatonin were similarly displayed by both NoTg and 3xTg-AD mice. Therefore , these results confirm the potential of melatonin treatment against AD pathology , by way of opening new pathways in its mechanisms of action , and demonstrating that melatonin induces cognitive enhancement and brain resilience against neurodegenerative processes.
