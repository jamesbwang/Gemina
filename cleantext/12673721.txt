  Melanoma is one of the most aggressive malignant skin tumors and its incidence has been increasing worldwide in recent decades. Among the four subtypes , acral lentiginous melanoma ( ALM) shows the highest incidence in Asian countries , whereas ALM comprises only 1 % of all melanomas in white populations. Early clinical diagnosis of ALM is essential , but early ALM lesions<symptom> are often difficult to diagnose because the pigmentation of the lesions<symptom> sometimes follows the skin marking of the palms and soles , resulting in an asymmetrical appearance and an irregular border in both ALM and benign melanocytic nevus. To overcome this difficulty , dermoscopy was introduced , and determination of the patterns by this method is essential for accurate clinical diagnosis of ALM. Although recent clinical trials have demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors showed significantly improved overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma , ALM may be less susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors because of the poor immune response to the tumor. Therefore , strategies for enhancing the immune response to the tumor cells may be required when we apply immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced ALM. In this context , imiquimod , dacarbazine , or interferon are possible therapies that may enhance the effectiveness of the immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to being known to have poor immunogenicity , ALM is also known to have infrequent BRAF mutation. Therefore , the majority of ALM patients may not benefit from therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. However , some ALMs have mutations such as KIT and NRAS mutations , and therefore , targeted therapies may improve the survival of ALM patients in the future.
