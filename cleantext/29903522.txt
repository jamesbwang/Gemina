  A multidisciplinary approach and Doppler ultrasound ( DU) assessment for the creation and maintenance of arteriovenous fistulas<disease> ( AVF) for haemodialysis can improve prevalence and patency. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of a new multidisciplinary vascular access ( VA) clinic with routine DU. We analysed the VA clinic results from 2014 and 2015 , before and after the implementation of a multidisciplinary team protocol ( vascular surgeon/nephrologist) with routine DU in preoperative mapping and prevalent AVF. We analysed 345 and 364 patients from 2014 and 2015 respectively. The number of surgical interventions was similar in both periods ( p = .289) , with a trend towards an increase in preventive surgical repair of AVF in 2015 ( 17 vs. 29 , p = .098). 155 vs. 169 new AVF were performed in 2014 and 2015 , with a significantly lower primary failure rate in 2015 ( 26.4 vs. 15.3 % , p = .015) , and a non-significant increase in radiocephalic AVF , 25.8 vs. 33.2 % ( n = 40 vs. 56) , p = .159. The concordance between the indication at the clinic and the surgery performed also increased ( 81.3 vs. 93.5 % , p = .001). Throughout 2015 fewer complementary imaging test were requested from the clinic ( 78 vs. 35 , p < .001) , with a corresponding reduction in costs ( $ 87,716 vs. $ 59,445). Multidisciplinary approach with routine DU can improve VA results , with a decrease in primary failure rate , higher likelihood of radiocephalic AVF , better management of dis-functioning AVF and lower radiological test costs.
