  Adiposity has been associated with the risk of coronary artery disease ( CAD) in observational studies , but their association may differ according to specific characteristics of studies. In Mendelian randomization ( MR) analyses , genetic variants are used as instrumental variables ( IVs) of exposures to examine causal effects to overcome confounding factors and reverse causation. We performed MR analyses for adiposity ( n = 322,154) on risk of CAD ( 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls) based on the currently largest genome-wide association studies. The estimated associations between adiposity traits and CAD were calculated by an inverse-variance weighted method with and without excluding the IVs , which are associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD. Genetic variants are identified to be associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD by a cross-phenotype meta-analysis method. Our results furnished strong evidence for a causal role of adiposity in risk of CAD , with the odds ratios ( ORs) for CAD being 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.36-1.72) for body mass index ( BMI) , 1.48 ( 1.20-1.96) for waist-hip ratio ( WHR) , and 1.34 ( 1.07-1.59) for WHR adjusted for BMI ( WHRadjBMI) , respectively. After excluding mediators-associated IVs from the MR analyses , the corresponding ORs were 1.46 ( 1.28-1.67) for BMI , 1.39 ( 1.01-1.93) for WHR , and 1.38 ( 1.04-1.84) for WHRadjBMI , respectively. Furthermore , our results suggested that central adiposity and general adiposity might pose a similar risk for CAD. In summary , our data supported that genetically driven adiposity traits imposed the risk of CAD independent of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , dyslipidaemia , glycaemic traits , and type 2 diabetes.
