  This study investigated the proposed association between restless legs syndrome<disease> ( RLS) and the prevalence of hypertension. A meta-analysis was conducted based on searches of the PUBMED , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , and Korean electronic databases. Cohort and cross-sectional studies reporting the incidence of hypertension in individuals with RLS were included. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain an odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) for the prevalence of hypertension in individuals with RLS. The main outcome measure of the study was prevalence of hypertension in patients with RLS compared with a control group. One cohort study and eight cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis. Individuals with RLS had an increased prevalence of hypertension ( all studies: OR = 1.13 , 95 % CI = 1.04-1.23; cross-sectional studies: OR = 1.12 , 95 % CI = 1.01-1.24). However , in subgroup analyses controlling for cardiovascular risk factors , such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia , the differences in the prevalence of hypertension between RLS and control patients were no longer significant. Patients with RLS may have a higher prevalence of hypertension , according to a pooled analysis , but the results remain to be confirmed in well-designed prospective studies.
