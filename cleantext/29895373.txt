  Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a revolution in the last decade opening up promising strides for the cancer treatment. The major challenge in these therapeutic approaches resides in the failure of clinical trials owing to the immunological cancer microenvironment. Therefore , the success of next generation nanomedicine depends on tunable physicochemical nanomaterial design and corresponding clinical trials by integrating targeted delivery with mitigated toxicity. The present study deals with the fabrication of nanofibrous scaffold impregnated with molybdenum nanoparticles for targeted skin cancer therapeutics. Molybdenum oxide , a transitional metal oxide is gaining rapid importance due to its vital role in cellular and molecular metabolism. Polycaprolactone nanofibers were chosen as a matrix to localize the nanoparticles topically facilitating selective apoptosis of the tumor cells over the normal cells with mitigated side effects. The scaffold was designed to tailor the physicochemical , mechanical and biological suitability for skin cancer ( melanoma and non melanoma). The designed scaffold was found to reduce more than 50 % cell viability of the cancer cells selectively through apoptosis as confirmed using AO/PI staining and the probable mechanism could be attributed to the induction of mitochondria dependent apoptosis as observed by JC1 dye staining. In-vivo trials in zebra fish were found to reduce cancer progression by more than 30 % in 14 days. The fabricated molybdenum trioxide nano constructs not only serve as tunable targeted systems but also open venues capable of ferrying chemotherapeutic drugs sparing normal cells alleviating the trauma due to side effects.
