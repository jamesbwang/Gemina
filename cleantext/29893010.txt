  To study the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in a very large unselected population. To determine the prevalence of abnormal thyroid function and evaluate potential modulatory factors. The Estudio de Atención Primaria de Navarra , The APNA Study , is a cross-sectional study conducted in northern Spain. It involved 303 883 people , of 20 years of age and older , who live in the Navarra region. Participants are covered by the public healthcare system and medical records are digitalized. The information was gathered from e-registered data regarding serum thyrotropin ( TSH) , thyroid hormones , thyroid antibody concentration and clinical context. Measurements were logged ( demographic information and potential thyroid function modulatory factors). Serum TSH ( mU/L) normal range was established at 0.7-4.28. At the time of the study , 87 % of the Navarra population had a TSH level within the normal range. Mean serum TSH in euthyroid individuals was higher in women ( 2.15) than in men ( 1.96) ( P < .001) and higher in the obese with body mass index ( BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m Nearly 15 % of the general population suffers from biochemical thyroid dysfunction. The serum TSH level appears to be influenced by sex , BMI , age , ethnic origin and socio-economic status.
