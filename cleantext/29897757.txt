  A quantitative characterization of the molecular mechanisms that regulate ion solvation is key to the microscopic understanding of fundamental processes taking place in aqueous environments with major implications for different fields , from atmospheric chemistry to materials research and biochemistry. This study presents a systematic analysis of isomeric equilibria for small M
