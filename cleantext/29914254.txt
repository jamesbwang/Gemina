  Background/aim: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and association of mesenteric panniculitis ( MP) with other diseases and the clinicoradiological features of MP , and to examine computed tomography findings to estimate the presence of malignancy in patients with MP. Materials and methods: Between September 2012 and August 2016 , we used a keyword search to identify patients diagnosed with MP. Associated diseases and malignancies of patients were recorded. Cut-off values and diagnostic efficiencies of total MP scores and short and long diameters of the greatest lymph nodes were determined. Results: Out of 22,033 patients , 309 were determined to have MP ( prevalence 1.40 %); 57.9 % of these patients had a malignancy and 42.1 % did not have a malignancy. The mean total MP scores and diameters of the greatest lymph nodes were significantly higher in the patients with a malignancy ( P < 0.001). AUCs were 0.728 , 0.879 , and 0.767 for the short diameter , long diameter , and total score , respectively. The diagnostic efficiencies of the long diameter of the greatest lymph nodes were significantly higher than the total MP scores and the short diameter of the greatest nodes. Conclusion: MP is thought to be associated with abdominal and other system malignancies so MP may be a paraneoplastic syndrome<disease> in some patients.
