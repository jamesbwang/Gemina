  Soft touch possesses strong prosocial effects that facilitate social bonding and group cohesion in animals. Touch activates opioids ( OP) and oxytocin ( OXT) , two neuromodulators involved in affiliative behaviors and social bonding. We examined whether touch serves as an unconditioned reward in affective conditioning of human faces , a basic process in social bonding , and whether this process is mediated by variation in mu-OP ( OPRM1) and OXT ( rs53576) receptor genes. Participants viewed affectively-neutral human faces , half of which were paired with a brief soft brushing on the forearm as an unconditioned stimulus ( US). Paired and unpaired faces were rated for positive affective and sensory features of touch. Variation in OPRM1 but not rs53576 significantly modulated strength and development of conditioning , indicating that touch-induced mu-OP but not OXT activity provides rewarding properties of a US in conditioning. Implications for touch-induced mu-OP activity in normal and disordered conditioned social bonding are discussed.
