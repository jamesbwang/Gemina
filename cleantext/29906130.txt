  We consider charge pumping in a system of parafermions , implemented at fractional quantum Hall edges. Our pumping protocol leads to a noisy behavior of the pumped current. As the adiabatic limit is approached , not only does the noisy behavior persist but the counting statistics of the pumped current becomes robust and universal. In particular , the resulting Fano factor is given in terms of the system 's topological degeneracy and the pumped quasiparticle charge. Our results are also applicable to the more conventional Majorana fermions.
