  Polysubstance use ( PSU) is common among patients with cannabis use ( CU) and is related to more severe CU problems. However , it is unclear how PSU predicts CU treatment outcomes beyond CU patterns. We examined the frequency , amount , and class of additionally used substances as predictors for primary and secondary outcomes. We conducted crude and adjusted regression analyses for PSU variables as predictors of remission , abstinence ,- reduction , and secondary outcomes in 166 help-seeking- patients from a randomized clinical trial of CANDIS , a- cognitive behavioral treatment program. Patients with recent illegal PSU experienced more difficulties in reducing their CU ( B = -1.22 , p < 0.001). In contrast , remission rates were slightly higher in patients with a wide variety of- last-year-PSU ( RD = 0.04 , p < 0.001). Amphetamine use- predicted poorer outcomes regarding CU-related problems ( B = -4.22 , p = 0.019) , and the use of opiates , inhalants , and dissociative substances predicted poorer physical health outcomes ( B = -0.62 , p = 0.009; B = -0.96 , p = 0.039; B = -1.18 , p = 0.007). CU treatment is also effective for patients with moderate PSU. However , treatment effects may be enhanced by addressing specific PSU characteristics as part of a modularized program.
