  Auditory sensation is often thought of as a bottom-up process , yet the brain exerts top-down control to affect how and what we hear. We report the discovery that the magnitude of top-down influence varies across individuals as a result of differences in linguistic background and executive function. Participants were 32 normal-hearing individuals ( 23 female) varying in language background ( 11 English monolinguals , 10 Korean-English late bilinguals , and 11 Korean-English early bilinguals) , as well as cognitive abilities ( working memory , cognitive control). To assess efferent control over inner ear function , participants were presented with speech-sounds ( e.g. ,/ ba/ ,/ pa/) in one ear while spontaneous otoacoustic emissions ( SOAEs) were measured in the contralateral ear. SOAEs are associated with the amplification of sound<symptom> in the cochlea , and can be used as an index of top-down efferent activity. Individuals with bilingual experience and those with better cognitive control experienced larger reductions in the amplitude of SOAEs in response to speech stimuli , likely as a result of greater efferent suppression of amplification in the cochlea. This suppression may aid in the critical task of speech perception by minimizing the disruptive effects of noise. In contrast , individuals with better working memory exert less control over the cochlea , possibly due to a greater capacity to process complex stimuli at later stages. These findings demonstrate that even peripheral mechanics of auditory perception are shaped by top-down cognitive and linguistic influences.
