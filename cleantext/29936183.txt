  Raman microscopy is an imaging technique that has been applied to assess molecular compositions of living cells to characterize cell types and states. However , owing to the diverse molecular species in cells and challenges of assigning peaks to specific molecules , it has not been clear how to interpret cellular Raman spectra. Here , we provide firm evidence that cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomic profiles of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> can be computationally connected and thus interpreted. We find that the dimensions of high-dimensional Raman spectra and transcriptomes measured by RNA sequencing can be reduced and connected linearly through a shared low-dimensional subspace. Accordingly , we were able to predict global gene expression profiles by applying the calculated transformation matrix to Raman spectra , and vice versa. Highly expressed non-coding RNAs contributed to the Raman-transcriptome linear correspondence more significantly than mRNAs in S. pombe. This demonstration of correspondence between cellular Raman spectra and transcriptomes is a promising step toward establishing spectroscopic live-cell omics studies.
