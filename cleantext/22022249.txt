  This article examines how digital epidemiology and eHealth coalesce into a powerful health surveillance system that fundamentally changes present notions of body and health. In the age of Big Data and Quantified Self , the conceptual and practical distinctions between individual and population body , personal and public health , surveillance and health care are diminishing. Expanding on Armstrong 's concept of `` surveillance medicine '' to `` quantified self medicine '' and drawing on my own research on the symbolic power of statistical constructs in medical encounters , this article explores the impact of digital health surveillance on people 's perceptions , actions and subjectivities. It discusses the epistemic confusions<symptom> and paradoxes produced by a health care system that increasingly treats patients as risk profiles and prompts them to do the same , namely to perceive and manage themselves as a bundle of health and security risks. Since these risks are necessarily constructed in reference to epidemiological data that postulate a statistical gaze , they also construct or make-up disembodied `` individuals on alert ''.
