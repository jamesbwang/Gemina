  In recent years , focal therapy has emerged as a treatment option for a selected group of men with localized prostate cancer. Cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU) are the most investigated types of focal treatment with other options currently under evaluation. The objective of the study was to give a comprehensive overview of six available focal treatment options for prostate cancer with their rationale , delivery mechanism , and outcomes. The SIU ICUD chapter on available Energies to Treat Prostate Cancer was used as a guide to describe the different technologies. For outcomes , a literature search was conducted using PubMed key words including focal therapy , HIFU , cryotherapy , irreversible electroporation , vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy , laser interstitial therapy , radiofrequency ablation , microwave therapy , and their synonyms in MeSH terms. Focal therapy appears to have encouraging outcomes on quality of life and urinary and erectile function. For oncological outcomes , it is challenging to fully interpret the outcomes due to heterogeneity in patient selection and short-term follow-up.
