  Hematoma volume is an important determinant of clinical outcome in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). We performed a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) of hematoma volume with the aim of identifying novel biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of primary brain injury in ICH. We conducted a 2-stage ( discovery and replication) case-only genome-wide association study in patients with ICH of European ancestry. We utilized the admission head computed tomography to calculate hematoma volume via semiautomated computer-assisted technique. After quality control and imputation , 7 million genetic variants were available for association testing with ICH volume , which was performed separately in lobar and nonlobar ICH cases using linear regression. Signals with The discovery phase included 394 ICH cases ( 228 lobar and 166 nonlobar) and identified 2 susceptibility loci: a genomic region on 22q13 encompassing We identified
