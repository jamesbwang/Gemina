  It is now well-established that the surface chemistry and `` stealth '' surface functionalities such as poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) chains of nanocarriers play an important role to decrease unspecific protein adsorption of opsonizing proteins , to increase the enrichment of specific stealth proteins , and to prolong the circulation times of the nanocarriers. At the same time , PEG chains are used to provide colloidal stability for the nanoparticles. However , it is not clear how the chain length and density influence the unspecific and specific protein adsorption keeping at the same time the stability of the nanoparticles in a biological environment. Therefore , this study aims at characterizing the protein adsorption patterns depending on PEG chain length and density to define limits for the amount of PEG needed for a stealth effect by selective protein adsorption as well as colloidal stability during cell experiments. PEG chains are introduced using the PEGylated Lutensol AT surfactants , which allow easy modification of the nanoparticle surface. These findings indicate that a specific enrichment of stealth proteins already occurs at low PEG concentrations; for the decrease of unspecific protein adsorption and finally the colloidal stability a full surface coverage is advised.
