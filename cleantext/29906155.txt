  We observe cavity mediated spin-dependent interactions in an off-resonantly driven multilevel atomic Bose-Einstein condensate that is strongly coupled to an optical cavity. Applying a driving field with adjustable polarization , we identify the roles of the scalar and the vectorial components of the atomic polarizability tensor for single and multicomponent condensates. Beyond a critical strength of the vectorial coupling , we infer the formation of a spin texture in a condensate of two internal states from the analysis of the cavity output field. Our work provides perspectives for global dynamical gauge fields and self-consistently spin-orbit coupled gases.
