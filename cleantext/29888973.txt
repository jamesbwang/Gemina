  Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM) are environmental organisms that are rapidly emerging as pathogens in the transplant population. The prevalence of infection in transplant recipients remains unknown. While guidelines exist for treatment of NTM , neither the American Thoracic Society , the Infectious Diseases Society of America , nor the British Thoracic Society guidelines dictate the approach needed for transplant recipients. Here , we summarize risk factors , important diagnostic and treatment facts , and preventive measures to be taken to help improve outcomes of those infected with NTM infections.
