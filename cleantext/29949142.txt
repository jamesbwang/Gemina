  Never in Mitosis ( NIMA) Related Kinase 2 ( Nek2) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase encoded by the NEK2 gene and is an essential enzyme in cell cycle progression. In this study , we investigated NEK2 expression profile , its independent prognostic value in terms of recurrence-free survival ( RFS)/ overall survival ( OS) , and the potential mechanisms of its dysregulation in melanoma. A retrospective study was conducted using data from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA)- skin cutaneous melanoma ( SKCM). NEK2 was significantly upregulated in melanoma tissues. NEK2 upregulation independently predicted poor OS ( HR: 1.500 , 95 % CI: 1.092-2.059 , p = 0.012) and RFS ( HR: 2.213 , 95 % CI: 1.298-3.772 , p = 0.004). NEK2 DNA amplification was common in melanoma ( 192/366 , 52.5 %) , which was associated with significantly elevated NEK2 expression. NEK2 expression was weakly and negatively correlated with its DNA methylation ( Pearson 's r = -0.29). Loss of p53 was associated with increased NEK2 expression. Based on findings above , we infer that NEK2 expression independently predicts poor survival of melanoma. Its dysregulation might be related to DNA amplification/methylation and TP53 mutation.
