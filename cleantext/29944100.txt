  New materials with good purification of water quality ( heavy metal ions removal and inhibition of bacteria) have increasingly attracted more research attentions. Considering the advantages of zinc oxide ( ZnO) and tea polyphenol functionalized and reduced graphene oxide ( TPG) , the TPG-ZnO composites were prepared under moderate hydrothermal method and characterized by various methods. Lead ions ( Pb2 +) and Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen>) were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity and antimicrobial activity of the TPG-ZnO , respectively. The influencing factors for heavy metal ions removal ( pH , contact time) , adsorption kinetics , and isotherms were discussed in this article. Furthermore , their antibacterial properties against S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> were investigated by counting of colony-forming units ( CFU) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM). Results showed that the novel TPG-ZnO composites presented higher adsorption efficiency for Pb2 + ( 98.92 %) compared with pure ZnO and enhanced antibacterial activity effects ( 99.99 %) towards S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> , compared with pure ZnO and TPG ( P < 0.05). The TPG-ZnO composites are therefore promising water purification materials for application in high-efficient removal of heavy metal ions and inhibition of bacterial growth.
