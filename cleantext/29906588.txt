  To evaluate the performance of a new mathematical model gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase to cholinesterase and platelet ratio ( GCPR) versus gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase to platelet ratio ( GPR) in predicting significant fibrosis<disease> and cirrhosis of chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB). A complete cohort of 2343 patients was divided into early and late cohort depending on the time of liver biopsy. With reference to the Scheuer standard , liver pathological stage ≥ S2 and ≥ S4 were defined as significant fibrosis<disease> and cirrhosis , respectively. ROC curve was used to evaluate the performance of investigated models. In early cohort ， the areas under ROC curves ( AUROCs) of GCPR in predicting significant fibrosis<disease> of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients ( 0.782 and 0.775) were both significantly greater than those of GPR ( 0.748 and 0.747) ( Z ＝ 8.198 and Z ＝ 6.023 , both P < 0.0001); the AUROCs of GCPR in predicting cirrhosis of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients ( 0.842 and 0.861) were both significantly greater than those of GPR ( 0.802 and 0.823) ( Z ＝ 6.686 and Z ＝ 6.116 , both P < 0.0001). In early , late and complete cohort , using a single cutoff of GPCR > 0.080 , the specificities of GCPR in predicting significant fibrosis<disease> of HBeAg-positive patients were 83.3 % , 88.2 % and 85.0 % , and of HBeAg-negative patients were 87.6 % , 87.4 % and 87.6 % , respectively; and the sensitivities of GCPR in predicting cirrhosis of HBeAg-positive patients were 81.9 % , 88.7 % and 84.2 % , and of HBeAg-negative patients were 83.1 % ,82.1 % and 82.7 % , respectively. GCPR has higher performance than GPR in predicting significant fibrosis<disease> and cirrhosis of CHB.
