  Despite well established empiric dose adjustments for drug and disease-state interactions , the impact of body mass index ( BM) on warfarin remains unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate warfarin requirements in hospitalized patients , stratified by BMI. This retrospective review included two cohorts of patients: cohort A ( patients admitted with a therapeutic international normalized ratio ( INR)) and cohort B ( newly initiated on warfarin during hospitalization). Exclusion criteria included: age under 18 years , pregnancy , INR ( goal 2.5-3.5) , and warfarin thromboprophylaxis post orthopedic surgery. The primary outcome was mean total weekly dose ( TWD) of warfarin based on weight classification: underweight ( BMI < 18 kg/m A total of 585 patients were included in cohort A ( 26 underweight , 200 normal/overweight , 200 obese , 159 morbidly obese). There was a statistically significant difference in TWD as determined by one-way analysis of variance ( p < 0.05). A Tukey post hoc test revealed a statistically significantly higher TWD in morbidly obese ( 41.5 mg) compared with underweight ( 25.6 mg , p < 0.05) , normal/overweight ( 28.8 mg , p < 0.05) and obese patients ( 32.4 mg , p < 0.05). In cohort B , 379 patients were evaluated ( 9 underweight , 166 normal/overweight , 152 obese , 52 morbidly obese). Overall , 191 patients had a therapeutic INR on discharge ( 88.9 % underweight , 52.4 % normal/overweight , 44.1 % obese , 55.8 % morbidly obese , p = 0.035). Of those , there was a statistically significant difference in TWD ( p = 0.021) with a higher TWD in the morbidly obese ( 41 mg) compared with underweight patients ( 24.4 mg , p = 0.017). Based on the results of this study , morbidly obese patients may require higher TWD to obtain and maintain a therapeutic INR.
