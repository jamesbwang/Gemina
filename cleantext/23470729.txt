  Understanding brain functions at the circuit level requires time-resolved simultaneous measurement of a large number of densely distributed neurons , which remains a great challenge for current neural technologies. In particular , penetrating neural electrodes allow for recording from individual neurons at high temporal resolution , but often have larger dimensions than the biological matrix , which induces significant damage to brain tissues and therefore precludes the high implant density that is necessary for mapping large neuronal populations with full coverage. Here , it is demonstrated that nanofabricated ultraflexible electrode arrays with cross-sectional areas as small as sub-10 Âµm
