  Cell targeting protein toxins have gained increasing interest for cancer therapy aimed at increasing the therapeutic window and reducing systemic toxicity. Because recombinant expression of immunotoxins consisting of a receptor-binding and a cell-killing moiety is hampered by their high toxicity in a eukaryotic production host , most applications rely on recombinant production of fusion proteins consisting of an antibody fragment and a protein toxin in bacterial hosts such as Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>). These fusions often lack beneficial properties of whole antibodies like extended serum half-life or efficient endocytic uptake via receptor clustering. Here , we describe the production of full-length antibody immunotoxins using self-splicing split inteins. To this end , the short ( 11 amino acids) N-terminal intein part of the artificially designed split intein M86 , a derivative of the Ssp DnaB intein , was recombinantly fused to the heavy chain of trastuzumab , a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) receptor targeting antibody and to a nanobody-Fc fusion targeting the HER1 receptor , respectively. Both antibodies were produced in Expi293F cells. The longer C-terminal counterpart of the intein was genetically fused to the protein toxins gelonin or Pseudomonas<pathogen> Exotoxin A , respectively , and expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> via fusion to maltose binding protein. Using optimized in vitro splicing conditions , we were able to generate a set of specific and potent immunotoxins with IC
