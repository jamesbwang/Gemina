  Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC) with oxaliplatin ( OX) is the standard of care for selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin. Because 5-FU is mandatory to improve efficacy of OX when used by systemic route , several teams now empirically combine intravenous ( IV) 5-FU with HIPEC OX , but this practice has yet to be supported by preclinical data. Using a murine model , we studied the impact of IV 5-FU on peritoneal absorption of HIPEC OX. Under general anesthesia , 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to 4 different doses of IV 5-FU ( 0 , 100 , 400 and 800 mg/m Peritoneal absorption of OX was significantly higher ( 17.0 , 20.1 , 34.9 and 38.1 nmol/g , p < 0.0001) with increasing doses of 5-FU ( 0 , 100 , 400 and 800 mg/m IV 5-FU enhances peritoneal absorption of HIPEC OX. The most efficient dose of IV 5-FU to be used in combination with HIPEC OX seems to be 400 mg/m
