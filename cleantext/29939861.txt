  There is scarce information on cancer incidence in Mozambique. We aimed to describe cancer incidence data from the Cancer Registry of the Maputo Central Hospital ( MCH) in 2015-2016 , for Maputo City dwellers , and to compare the incidence rates with those observed in 1956-1961. Cancers with incidence data in 2015-2016 were identified by the Cancer Registry of the MCH. Crude and age-standardized incident rates ( ASIR , per 100000)- direct method , world standard population- were computed for Maputo City , under the assumption that most cancer cases among this population were identified at the MCH. A total of 1707 incident cases in Maputo City dwellers were registered ( 76.6 % confirmed histologically). Prostate cancer , Kaposi<disease> sarcoma<disease> , and liver cancer were the most frequent in men ( ASIR: 24.5 , 19.8 , and 13.3 , respectively). Cervical and breast cancers , and Kaposi<disease> sarcoma<disease> were the most common among women ( ASIR: 32.4 , 11.8 , and 9.5 , respectively). Compared with the data from 1956 to 1961 , the most pronounced declines in ASIR were for bladder and liver cancers , in both sexes , and increases were greater for prostate cancer among men ( 172.2 %) and breast cancer ( 237.1 %) among women. Our study highlights the high frequency of infection-related cancers in Maputo , but also of those related to the ongoing demographic and socioeconomic transition.
