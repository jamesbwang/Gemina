  Risk assessment in cardiac surgery traditionally consists of medical and physiological parameters. However , non-physiological factors have also been found to be predictive of poor outcomes following cardiac surgery. Therefore , the isolated focus on physiological parameters is questionable. This paper describes the emotional , behavioural , social and functional factors that have been established to play a role in outcomes following cardiac surgery. This forms a basis for future research , testing the value of these factors above and beyond the physiological parameters. By including such non-physiological factors , the accuracy of the existing risk scoring systems could potentially be improved.
