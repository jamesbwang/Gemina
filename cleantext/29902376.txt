  To optimize the lipophilicity and improve in vivo pharmacokinetics of near-infrared probes targeted Aβ plaques , we designed , synthesized , and evaluated a series of polyethylene glycol modified probes with hydroxyl and methoxyl terminals. The relationships between chemical structure and optical , biological properties were systemically elucidated. The results indicated that a desired Aβ probe should keep a balance<symptom> among molecular rigidity , size , and lipophilicity. Probe 12d displayed improved properties including intense and selective response to Aβ
