  This study investigated associations between the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 ( GH/IGF -1) axis , adiponectin , resistin and metabolic profile in 47 GH-deficient children before and during 12 months of GH treatment. 23 short age-matched children without growth hormone deficiency ( GHD) or any genetic or chronic disorders were recruited as controls at baseline. Metabolic evaluation included measurements of adiponectin , resistin , IGF-1 , total cholesterol ( total-C) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , triglycerides ( TG) , glucose , insulin , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) , thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH) and free thyroxine ( free T4) concentrations. The GH-deficient children had significantly higher adiponectin ( p < 0.05) and total cholesterol ( p < 0.05) levels , and a significantly lower level of resistin ( p < 0.05) than the controls. Resistin at 6 months of GH treatment significantly correlated with changes in height SDS in that period ( r = 0.35) and with the level of fasting insulin ( r = 0.50) , the HOMA-IR ( r = 0.56) and the QUICKI ( r = -0.53) at 12 months of therapy. Adiponectin level at 12 months of GH treatment was significantly associated with changes in HDL-C within the first 6 ( r = 0.73) and within 12 ( r = 0.56) months of therapy , while resistin significantly correlated with an increment in IGF-1 within 12 months of treatment ( r = 0.49) and with total-C at 12 months ( r = 0.56). Untreated GH-deficient children had higher adiponectin and lower resistin levels than healthy short children without GHD. Adiponectin and resistin levels did not change significantly during the first 12 months of GH therapy. Good responders to GH treatment had a tendency for higher resistin level during GH therapy , which positively correlates with the insulin resistance parameters.
