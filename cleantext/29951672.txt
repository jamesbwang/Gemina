  The complexation of three surface active ionic liquids ( SAILs): 1-methyl-3-dodecylimidazolium chloride , ( C12mim) ( Cl) , and its amide , 3- ( 2- ( dodecylamino) -2-oxoethyl) -1-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium chloride , ( C12Amim) ( Cl) , and ester , 3-methyl-1-dodecyloxycarbonylmethylimidazolium chloride , ( C12Emim) ( Cl) , functionalized counterparts with sodium carboxymethylcellulose ( NaCMC) , has been investigated. The behaviour of colloidal systems comprising SAILs and NaCMC at the air-solution interface has been investigated using tensiometry. The formed colloids in the bulk have been characterized for their mobility , surface charge , shape , size and morphology along with their relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and other thermodynamic parameters of interest in different concentration regimes of the SAILs. For this , various techniques such as conductivity , turbidity , dynamic light scattering , Î¶-potential , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and fluorescence measurements have been employed. H-bonding prone SAILs , i.e. ( C12Amim) ( Cl) and ( C12Emim) ( Cl) , are found to interact with NaCMC in a contrasting manner as compared to their non-functionalized counterpart. The formed complexes of SAILs and NaCMC have been explored for the one pot preparation of magnetic nano-composites by doping colloids of SAILs and NaCMC with zinc ferrite ( ZnFe3O4) nano-particles. The prepared magnetic nano-composites are characterised using X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and vibrating sample magnetometry ( VSM). It is expected that the present work would offer a new colloidal route for the preparation of SAILs and biopolymer assisted nano-composites along with providing physical insights into the complexation phenomenon.
