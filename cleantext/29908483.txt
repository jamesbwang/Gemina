  Depressive tendency and nicotine dependency are factors related to the failure of smoking cessation. Women generally have a higher depressive tendency and difficulty in smoking cessation than men. However , the impact of sex differences on the relationship between nicotine dependency and depressive tendency remains unclear. We evaluated 727 patients ( 496 men and 231 women) who visited our outpatient clinic for smoking cessation therapy and compared various parameters measured between sexes during consultation. Age , duration of smoking , and daily cigarette consumption were significantly higher in men during the first visit. Women had significantly higher self-rating depression<symptom> scale ( SDS) scores and took significantly more antidepressant drugs than men. The SDS score significantly correlated with the Fagerstr√∂m test for the nicotine dependence score and with daily cigarette consumption in women , but not in men. Thus , the present study demonstrates the differential relationship of depressive tendency with tobacco use or nicotine dependency in men and women , which might reflect sex differences in response to psychological stress.
