  The perovskite layer is a crucial component influencing high-performance perovskite solar cells ( PSCs). In the one-step solution method , anti-solvents are important for obtaining smooth and uniform perovskite active layers. This work explored the effect of various anti-solvents on the preparation of triple cation perovskite active layers. In general , anti-solvents with low dielectric constants , low polarity , and low boiling point are suitable for the preparation of perovskite films. Microstructural and elemental analyses of the perovskite films were systematically conducted by scanning electron microscopy , X-ray diffraction , and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photoelectric properties , carrier transfer , and recombination process in the PSCs were investigated using photocurrent-voltage characteristic curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Optimum performance was obtained when the anti-solvent was diethyl ether ( DEE) and the ratio of the optimum amount of DEE to the volume of the precursor was 1: 10. Meanwhile , we found that the partial replacement of formamidinium/methylammonium by cesium could increase the stability of the PSCs and enhance the power conversion efficiency from 15.49 % to over 17.38 %.
