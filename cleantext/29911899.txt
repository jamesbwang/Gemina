  Two new sesquiterpenes ( 1-2) , along with one known sesquiterpene ( 3) , were isolated from cultures of the higher fungus Pholiota nameko. The structures of new compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods. The known compound was identified by comparing its spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature. All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against five human cancer cell lines.
