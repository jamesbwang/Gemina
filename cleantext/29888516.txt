  The Wzx flippase is a critical component of the O-antigen biosynthesis pathway , being responsible for the translocation of oligosaccharide O units across the inner membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Recent studies have shown that Wzx has a strong preference for its cognate O unit , but the types of O-unit structural variance that a given Wzx can accommodate are poorly understood. In this study , we identified two Yersinia<pathogen> pseudotuberculosis<pathogen> Wzx that can distinguish between different terminal dideoxyhexose sugars on a common O-unit main-chain , despite both being able to translocate several other structurally-divergent O units. We also identified other Y.<pathogen> pseudotuberculosis<pathogen> Wzx that can translocate a structurally divergent foreign O unit with high efficiency , and thus exhibit an apparently relaxed substrate preference. It now appears that Wzx substrate preference is more complex than previously suggested , and that not all O-unit residues are equally important determinants of translocation efficiency. We propose a new `` Structure-Specific Triggering '' model in which Wzx translocation proceeds at a low level for a wide variety of substrates , with high-frequency translocation only being triggered by Wzx interacting with one or more preferred O-unit structural elements found on its cognate O unit ( s).
