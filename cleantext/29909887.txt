  HPV-driven oropharyngeal<disease> cancer ( OPC) patients have a better prognosis than their HPV-negative counterparts but several studies have suggested that among HPV-positive patients those with a smoking history had worse oncological outcomes. The aim of our study is to characterize the interplay between tobacco consumption , patient and disease characteristics , and disease control. All patients diagnosed with HPV-driven OPC and treated with curative intent between 2007 and 2009 and 2011-2016 at Gustave Roussy cancer center were included ( n = 282). Demographic , clinical , morphological and tobacco consumption were correlated with oncologic outcomes. 157 ( 56 %) patients had a positive smoking history , including 23.8 % who were smoking at the time of diagnosis and 37.6 % who had a tobacco consumption exceeding 20 pack-years. In multivariate analysis , the strongest prognostic factor for survival was smoking status at cancer diagnosis , with a hazard ratio ( HR) for non-smokers compared to smokers of 0.25 ( ( 0.12 , 0.50) , p = 0.0001). Smoking history , either more than 20 pack-years or smoking at diagnosis , was associated with local relapse and distant relapse. There was no difference in terms of comorbidity ( p = 0.32) and radiotherapy duration ( p = 0.93) according to tobacco consumption. Smoking is frequent among patients with HPV-driven OPC and increases the risk of death and oncologic failure.
