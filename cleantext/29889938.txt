  Type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide , disproportionately affecting First Nations ( FN) people. Identifying early-life determinants of type 2 diabetes is important to address the intergenerational burden of illness. To investigate the association of in utero exposure to gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes , stratified by FN status , with the development of type 2 diabetes in offspring. This cohort study was derived from the linkage of a pediatric diabetes clinical database and a population-based research data repository in Manitoba , Canada. Mother-infant dyads with a hospital birth or midwifery report in the data repository between April 1 , 1984 , and April 1 , 2008 , were identified. The dates of analysis were August through December 2017. Children identified with type 1 diabetes , monogenic diabetes , or secondary diabetes were excluded. Primary exposures included maternal gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes and FN status. The primary outcome was incident type 2 diabetes in offspring by age 30 years. In this cohort study of 467850 offspring ( mean follow-up , 17.7 years; 51.2 % male) , FN status and diabetes exposure were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in offspring after adjustment for sex , maternal age , socioeconomic status , birth size , and gestational age. Type 2 diabetes exposure conferred a greater risk to offspring compared with gestational diabetes exposure ( 3.19 vs 0.80 cases per 1000 person-years , P < .001). Compared with no diabetes exposure , any diabetes exposure accelerated the time to the development of type 2 diabetes in offspring by a factor of 0.74 ( 95 % CI , 0.62-0.90) for gestational diabetes and a factor of 0.50 ( 95 % CI , 0.45-0.57) for type 2 diabetes. First Nations offspring had a higher risk compared with non-FN offspring ( 0.96 vs 0.14 cases per 1000 person-years , P < .001). First Nations offspring had accelerated type 2 diabetes onset by a factor of 0.52 ( 95 % CI , 0.49-0.55) compared with non-FN offspring. Neither interaction between FN and type 2 diabetes ( 0.92; 95 % CI , 0.80-1.05) nor interaction between FN and gestational diabetes ( 0.97; 95 % CI , 0.77-1.20) was significant ( P = .21 and P = .75 , respectively). Important differences exist in offspring risk based on type of diabetes exposure in utero. These findings have implications for future research and clinical practice guidelines , including early pregnancy screening and follow-up of the offspring.
