  In 1992 , Kobe University proposed treatment criteria for hyperbilirubinemic newborns using total serum bilirubin and serum unbound bilirubin reference values. In the last decade , chronic bilirubin encephalopathy has found to develop in preterm infants in Japan because it can now be clinically diagnosed based on an abnormal signal of the globus pallidus in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and abnormal findings of the auditory brainstem response with or without apparent hearing loss , along with physical findings of kinetic disorders with athetosis. Therefore , we revised the Kobe University treatment criteria for preterm hyperbilirubinemic infants in 2017. The three revised points are as follows: 1) The newborns were classified under gestational age at birth or corrected gestational age , not birth weight. 2) Three treatment options were created: standard phototherapy , intensive phototherapy , and albumin therapy and/or exchange blood transfusion. 3) The initiation of standard phototherapy , intensive phototherapy , and albumin therapy and/or exchange blood transfusion is judged based on the total serum bilirubin and serum unbound bilirubin reference values of gestational weeks at birth within 7 days of age , and based on the values of corrected gestational age after 7 days of age. Studies are needed to establish whether chronic bilirubin encephalopathy can be prevented by using the revised Kobe University treatment criteria in 2017 in preterm infants in Japan.
