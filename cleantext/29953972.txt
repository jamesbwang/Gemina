  Somatotropinomas are rare in childhood and frequently associated with genetic mutations. AIP mutations are found in 20-25 % cases and cause aggressive somatotropinomas , often resistant to somatostatin analogues. To assess responses to multimodal therapy including pegvisomant in 2 children with sporadic somatotropinomas due to AIP mutations. We report 2 children , a boy aged 13 and a girl aged 10 , with rapid growth , visual impairment , and growth hormone hypersecretion. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a pituitary macroadenoma with parasellar extension in both. Despite multiple surgical attempts to debulk tumour mass , residual tumour persisted. Genetic analysis showed two different AIP mutations ( patient 1: c. 562delC ( p.Arg188Glyfs * 8); patient 2: c. 140 _ 163del24 ( p.Gly47 _ Arg54del8)). They were initially treated with a long-acting somatostatin analogue ( octreotide LAR 30 mg/month) and cabergoline as a dopamine agonist , with the later addition of pegvisomant titrated up to 20 mg/day and with radiotherapy for long-term control. Somatostatin analogue was ceased due to patient intolerance and lack of control. Patient 1 had normalization of insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) after 5 months of combined therapy with pegvisomant and cabergoline. For patient 2 , normalization of IGF-1 was achieved after 2 months of cabergoline and pegvisomant. AIP-associated tumours can be resistant to management with somatostatin analogues. Pegvisomant can safely be used , to normalize IGF-1 levels and help control disease.
