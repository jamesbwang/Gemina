  The aim of this study was to understand factors associated with increased mortality in a cohort of primary HIV<pathogen> infection ( PHI) in New South Wales ( NSW) over three decades. Six hundred and two patients with PHI were enrolled from 1984 to 2009. Probabilistic data linkage was performed to NSW Registry of births deaths and marriages and Australian Bureau of Statistics mortality database. Mortality was measured by crude death rate. Pre highly active antiretroviral therapy ( pre-HAART) era was defined as before January 1 , 1997. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify factors associated with death. One hundred and thirty-eight deaths occurred during 6,223 person years ( PY) follow-up. Overall crude death rate was 2.2 per 100 PY ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.9-2.6) , 3.6 ( 95 % CI , 3.1-4.3) in pre-HAART era and 0.20 ( 95 % CI , 0.08-0.47) in post-HAART era. AIDS was the most frequent cause of death ( 52 % , 72/138) , all occurring in the pre-HAART era. Of non-AIDS deaths , the leading known cause was non-AIDS cancer 8 % ( 11/138) followed by suicide 4 % ( 6/138). On multivariate analysis , estimated date of infection in pre-HAART era and time to commencement of ART greater than 1 year post diagnosis were more likely to be associated with death ( p < .05). Mortality in PHI has decreased significantly in the post-HAART era. Non-AIDS deaths due to malignancy and suicide are emerging as leading causes in this population in the post-HAART era. Time to starting ART greater than 1 year was associated with increased mortality.
