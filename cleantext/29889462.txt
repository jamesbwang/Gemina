  The study aims to retrospectively compare the efficacy of lacosamide ( LCS) and levetiracetam ( LEV) in add-on treatment in patients with partial-onset epilepsy. Patients who have been followed-up for at least one year due to diagnosis of partial epilepsy between September 2014 and December 2017 and who had no seizure<symptom> control , despite using at least two antiepileptic monotherapies , and therefore undergone LEV or LCS add-on treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Of the patients , total number of seizures<symptom> and seizure<symptom> control rates 6 months before and 3 and 6 months after the add-on treatment were compared. There was no statistically significant difference between the 30 patients in the LEV group ( 12 females , 18 males , mean age 29.7 ± 6.6) and 28 patients in the LCS group ( 12 females , 16 males , mean age 28.2 ± 6.4) in terms of age , gender and the duration of illness. When the LEV and LCS groups were evaluated separately , the mean number of seizures<symptom> within 3 and 6 months after the add- on treatment were significantly lower than the mean number of seizures<symptom> in the last 6 months before the add-on treatment ( p < 0.005 and p < 0.005 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups when compared with each other in terms of the rate of decrease in number of seizures<symptom> and seizure<symptom> control before and after the add-on treatment ( p = 0.445 and p = 0.238 , respectively). LCS appears to be as effective as the currently well-established LEV in the treatment of partial onset seizures<symptom>. No comparative study was found in the literature similar to this subject matter. There is a need for prospective studies for the comparison of the efficacies of these two drugs.
