  Despite the importance of strain compatibility , most of the enological strain selection studies are carried out separately on yeasts and lactic acid bacteria ( LAB). In this study , the enological traits and interactions between native yeasts and LAB were studied. The H An alternative scheme is proposed for the joint selection of yeast and lactic acid bacteria strains , which allows us to foresee the interactions that may occur between them during winemaking. The kinetic parameters , turbidimetrically measured and analyzed by multivariate methods , simplify the detection of outstanding selectable microorganisms. This methodology can be implemented at any cellar or even any fermentative industry that aims to select compatible yeast and lactic acid bacteria.
