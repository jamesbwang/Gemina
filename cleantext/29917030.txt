  We describe here a binding-facilitated reaction strategy , enabling quantitative conjugation of DNA to native proteins with a desirable 1: 1 stoichiometry. The technique takes advantage of the iterative affinity interaction and covalent binding processes to achieve complete conjugation. The complete conjugation obviates the need for separation of the protein-DNA conjugates as required by other DNA-protein conjugation methods.
