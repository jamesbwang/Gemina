  In analogy with developments in soft robotics it is anticipated that soft robotic functions at surfaces of objects may have a large impact on human life with respect to comfort , health , medical care and energy. In this review , we demonstrate the possibilities and versatilities of liquid crystal networks and elastomers being explored for soft robotics , with an emphasis on motile surface properties , such as topographical dynamics. Typically the surfaces reversibly transfer from a flat state to a pre-designed corrugated state under various stimuli. But also reversible conversion between different corrugated states is feasible. Generally , the driving triggers are heat , light , electricity or contact with pH changing media. Also , the macroscopic effects of those dynamic topographies , such as altering the friction , wettability and/or performing work are illustrated. The review concludes with the existing challenges as well as outlook opportunities.
