  Paraoxonase1 ( PON1) is an antioxidant which confers antioxidant properties to high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) and prevents low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) oxidation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activities of PON1 and oxidative/antioxidative stress markers in acute cerebral infarction. In this study , 161 patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction and 161 gender- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Based on the clinicoradiological profiles , the patients were further classified into two groups: lacunar infarction group and large-artery atherosclerosis group. We measured the individual lipid status parameters , oxidative and antioxidative stress status parameters , and PON1 activity. Serum total cholesterol ( TC) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) , and oxidative stress parameters in patients with acute cerebral infarction were significantly higher than those in the normal controls ( p < 0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) level , PON1 activity , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity , and antioxidative stress parameters in patients were lower than in the normal controls ( p < 0.05). Superoxide anion ( O2-) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , and PON1 levels in the lacunar infarction group were lower than in the large-artery atherosclerosis group ( p < 0.05). Oxidative stress markers and PON1 activity are sensitive indicators of acute cerebral infarction. Our findings suggest a severely impaired antioxidative protection mechanism in these patients. Our study provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute cerebral infarction , which may also provide new therapeutic targets for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.
