  Pyrethroid insecticides modify the gating of voltage-gated sodium channels , thus disrupting the function of the nervous system. In Drosophila melanogaster , para encodes a functional sodium channel. Drosophila Sodium Channel 1 ( DSC1) , although considered as a putative sodium channel gene for decades due to its high sequence similarity with sodium channels , encodes a voltage-gated cation channel with high permeability to Ca
