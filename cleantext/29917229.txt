  Although the theory of how gene flow and genetic drift interact with local adaptation is well understood , few empirical studies have examined this process. Hämälä et al. ( 2018) present evidence that adaptive divergence between populations of Arabidopsis lyrata can persist in the face of relatively high levels of gene flow and drift. Maintaining divergence despite gene flow and drift has important implications for understanding adaptive responses of populations in response to human-driven environmental change.
