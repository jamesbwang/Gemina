  In this study , a new self-healing shape memory polymer ( SMP) coating was prepared to protect the aluminum alloy 2024-T3 from corrosion by the incorporation of dual-function microspheres containing polycaprolactone and the corrosion inhibitor 8-hydroxyquinoline ( 8HQ). The self-healing properties of the coatings were investigated via scanning electron microscopy , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , and scanning electrochemical microscopy following the application of different healing conditions. The results demonstrated that the coating possessed a triple-action self-healing ability enabled by the cooperation of the 8HQ inhibitor , the SMP coating matrix , and the melted microspheres. The coating released 8HQ in a pH-dependent fashion and immediately suppressed corrosion within the coating scratch. After heat treatment , the scratched coating exhibited excellent recovery of its anticorrosion performance , which was attributed to the simultaneous initiation of scratch closure by the shape memory effect of the coating matrix , sealing of the scratch by the melted microspheres , and the synergistic effect of corrosion inhibition by 8HQ.
