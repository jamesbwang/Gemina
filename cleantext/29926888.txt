  A base-induced dearomative ( 2,3) sigmatropic rearrangement of amino acid ester-derived ammonium salts followed by 1,4-elimination produced α- ( ortho-vinylphenyl) amino acid esters. The reaction of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid-derived ammonium salt , ( 1S ,2 S ,1 ` R) -3 b , proceeded with a perfect N-to-C chirality transfer to afford α- ( ortho-vinylphenyl) azetidine-2-carboxylic acid ester , ( R) -5 ( 99 % ee). On the other hand , the reaction of glycine-derived ammonium salt ( R) -6 a , which involves an efficient chirality transfer from a chiral benzylic carbon to an α-carbon of an ester carbonyl giving the optically active α- ( ortho-vinylphenyl) glycine ester , ( R) -8 a ( 85 % ee) , was demonstrated. Although this dearomative ( 2,3) rearrangement followed by 1,4-elimination has limitations with regard to the structures of the substrates , our method provides unique access to substituted α-arylamino acid derivatives.
