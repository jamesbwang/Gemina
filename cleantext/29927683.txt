  The aim of the current study was to explore how the location updating effect is affected when people are tested using recall rather than recognition , which is what has been done in prior work. Differences in the memory processes involved with these two tasks lead to predictions for two different patterns of data. In Experiment 1 , memory was tested by having participants recall the single object they were carrying or had just put down , whereas in Experiment 2 , people sometimes needed to recall both objects. It was found that , unlike recognition test performance , a similar location updating effect was found for both Associated ( what was currently being carried) and Dissociated ( what was recently set down) objects. Moreover , when both objects were correctly recalled , there was a bias to remember them in the order that they were encountered. Finally , if only one object was correctly recalled , it was the Associated object that was currently being carried. Overall , these results are consistent with the Event Horizon Model of event cognition.
