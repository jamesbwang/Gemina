  Schistosomiasis is a tropical disease caused by a flatworm trematode parasite that infects over 240 million people worldwide. Treatment and control of the disease rely on just one drug , praziquantel. The possibility of drug resistance coupled with praziquantel 's variable efficacy encourages the identification of new drugs and drug targets. Disruption of neuromuscular homeostasis in parasitic worms is a validated strategy for drug development. However , in schistosomes , much remains to be understood about the organization of the nervous system , its component neurotransmitters and potential for drug discovery. Using synapsin as a neuronal marker , we map the central and peripheral nervous systems in the
