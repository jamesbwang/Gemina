  The timing of brief stationary sounds<symptom> has been shown to alter the perceived speed of visual apparent motion ( AM) , presumably by altering the perceived timing of the individual frames of the AM stimuli and/or the duration of the inter-stimulus intervals ( ISIs) between those frames. To investigate the neural correlates of this `` temporal ventriloquism '' illusion , we recorded spiking and local field potential ( LFP) activity from area MT ( the middle temporal area) in awake , fixating macaques. We found that the spiking activity of most MT neurons ( but not the LFP) was tuned for the ISI/speed ( these parameters co-varied) of our AM stimuli but that auditory timing had no effect on that tuning. We next asked whether the predicted changes in perceived timing were reflected in the timing of neuronal responses to the individual frames of the AM stimuli. Although spiking dynamics were significantly , if weakly , affected by auditory timing in a minority of neurons , the timing of spike responses did not systematically mirror the predicted perception of stimuli. Conversely , the duration of LFP responses in beta and gamma frequency bands was qualitatively consistent with human perceptual reports. We discovered , however , that LFP responses to auditory stimuli presented alone were robust and that responses to audiovisual stimuli were predicted by the linear sum of responses to auditory and visual stimuli presented individually. In conclusion , we find evidence of auditory input into area MT but not of the non-linear audiovisual interactions we had hypothesized to underlie the illusion.
