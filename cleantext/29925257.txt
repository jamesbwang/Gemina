  The formation of ordered nanostructures by molecular self-assembly of proteins and peptides represents one of the principal directions in nanotechnology. Indeed , polyamides provide superior features as materials with diverse physical properties. A reductionist approach allowed the identification of extremely short peptide sequences , as short as dipeptides , which could form well-ordered amyloid-like β-sheet-rich assemblies comparable to supramolecular structures made of much larger proteins. Some of the peptide assemblies show remarkable mechanical , optical , and electrical characteristics. Another direction of reductionism utilized a natural noncoded amino acid , α-aminoisobutryic acid , to form short superhelical assemblies. The use of this exceptional helix inducer motif allowed the fabrication of single heptad repeats used in various biointerfaces , including their use as surfactants and DNA-binding agents. Two additional directions of the reductionist approach include the use of peptide nucleic acids ( PNAs) and coassembly techniques. The diversified accomplishments of the reductionist approach , as well as the exciting future advances it bears , are discussed.
