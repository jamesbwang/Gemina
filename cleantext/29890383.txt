  This study addresses the issue of the adaptive output tracking control for a category of uncertain nonstrict-feedback delayed incommensurate fractional-order systems in the presence of nonaffine structures , unmeasured pseudo-states , unknown control directions , unknown actuator nonlinearities and output constraints. Firstly , the mean value theorem and the Gaussian error function are introduced to eliminate the difficulties that arise from the nonaffine structures and the unknown actuator nonlinearities , respectively. Secondly , the immeasurable tracking error variables are suitably estimated by constructing a fractional-order linear observer. Thirdly , the neural network , the Razumikhin Lemma , the variable separation approach , and the smooth Nussbaum-type function are used to deal with the uncertain nonlinear dynamics , the unknown time-varying delays , the nonstrict feedback and the unknown control directions , respectively. Fourthly , asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to overcome the violation of the output constraints and to tune online the parameters of the adaptive neural controller. Through rigorous analysis , it is proved that the boundedness of all variables in the closed-loop system and the semi global asymptotic tracking are ensured without transgression of the constraints. The principal contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: ( 1) based on Caputo 's definitions and new lemmas , methods concerning the controllability , observability and stability analysis of integer-order systems are extended to fractional-order ones , ( 2) the output tracking objective for a relatively large class of uncertain systems is achieved with a simple controller and less tuning parameters. Finally , computer-simulation studies from the robotic field are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
