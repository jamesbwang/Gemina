  Varied evidence shows that mindfulness-oriented meditation improves individuals ' mental health , positively influencing practitioners ' personality profiles as well. A limited number of studies are beginning to show that this type of meditation may also be a helpful therapeutic option for persons with multiple sclerosis ( MS). We evaluated the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-oriented meditation training on the personality profiles , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms , and mindfulness skills of a group of patients with MS. A control group of patients with MS not enrolled in any training was also tested. After mindfulness-oriented meditation training , participants in this group ( n = 15) showed an increase in character traits reflecting the maturity of the self at the intrapersonal ( self-directedness) and interpersonal ( cooperativeness) levels. Moreover , increased mindfulness and conscientiousness and decreased trait anxiety<symptom> were observed in participants after the training. These data support the utility for patients with MS of therapeutic interventions based on mindfulness meditation that may lead to enhanced character and self-maturity.
