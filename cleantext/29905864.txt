  Central conducting lymphatic anomaly ( CCLA) is one of the complex lymphatic anomalies characterized by dilated lymphatic channels , lymphatic channel dysmotility , and distal obstruction affecting lymphatic drainage. We performed whole exome sequencing ( WES) of DNA from a four-generation pedigree and examined the consequences of the variant by transfection of mammalian cells and morpholino and rescue studies in zebrafish. WES revealed a heterozygous mutation in EPHB4 ( RefSeq NM_004444.4; c. 2334 + 1G > C) and RNA-Seq demonstrated that the EPHB4 mutation destroys the normal donor site , which leads to the use of a cryptic splice donor that results in retention of the intervening 12-bp intron sequence. Transient co-expression of the wild type and mutant EPHB4 proteins showed reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine , consistent with a loss-of-function effect. Zebrafish ephb4a morpholino resulted in vessel misbranching and deformities in the lymphatic vessel development , indicative of possible differentiation defects in lymphatic vessels , mimicking the lymphatic presentations of the patients. Immunoblot analysis using zebrafish lysates demonstrated over-activation of mTORC1 as a consequence of reduced EPHB4 signaling. Strikingly , drugs that inhibit mTOR signaling or RAS-MAPK signaling effectively rescued the misbranching phenotype in a comparable manner. Moreover , knockin of EPHB4 mutation in HEK293T cells also induced mTORC1 activity. Our data demonstrate the pathogenicity of the identified EPHB4 mutation as a novel cause of CCLA and suggesting that ERK inhibitors may have therapeutic benefits in such patients with complex lymphatic anomalies.
