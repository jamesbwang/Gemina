  Interventional endoscopy and interventional radiology have led to the development of minimally invasive techniques for management of kidney and ureteral diseases in the dog and cat including idiopathic renal hematuria<symptom> , ureteral obstruction , and ectopic ureters. Sclerotherapy is a renal-sparing chemical cauterization technique used in cases of idiopathic renal hematuria<symptom>. Diagnosis of ureteral obstruction is challenging in some cases based on ultrasound alone and antegrade pyelography should be considered. Treatment options for obstructions include nephrostomy tubes , ureteral stents , and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices. Treatment with cystoscopic-guided laser ablation provides similar outcomes to surgery in dogs with intramural ectopic ureters.
