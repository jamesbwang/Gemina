  The motion of social insects is often used as a paradigmatic example of complex adaptive dynamics arising from decentralized individual behaviour. In this paper , we revisit the topic of the ruling laws behind the burst of activity in ants. The analysis , done over previously reported data , reconsiders the causation arrows , proposed at individual level , not finding any link between the duration of the ants ' activity and their moving speed. Secondly , synthetic trajectories created from steps of different ants demonstrate that a Markov process can explain the previously reported speed shape profile. Finally , we show that as more ants enter the nest , the faster they move , which implies a collective property. Overall , these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the reported behavioural laws , and suggest us a formal way to further study the collective properties in these scenarios.
