  To determine , within a weight-loss clinical trial for obesity , the impact of intervention arm , weight change , and weight-loss maintenance on telomere length ( TL). Adults ( N = 194) with a BMI between 30 and 45 were randomized to a 5.5-month weight-loss program with ( n = 100) or without ( n = 94) mindfulness training and identical diet-exercise guidelines. We assessed TL at baseline and 3 , 6 , and 12 months post-baseline in immune cell populations ( primarily in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) , but also in granulocytes and T and B lymphocytes). We defined weight-loss maintenance as having lost at least 5 % or 10 % of body<symptom> weight ( tested in separate models) from pre- to post-intervention , and having maintained this loss at 12 months. We predicted that greater weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and weight-loss maintenance would be associated with TL lengthening. Neither weight-loss intervention significantly predicted TL change , nor did amount of weight change , at any timepoint. Across all participants , weight-loss maintenance of at least 10 % was associated with longer PBMC TL ( b = 239.08 , 95 % CI ( 0.92 , 477.25) , p = .049) , CD8 + TL ( b = 417.26 , 95 % CI ( 58.95 , 775.57) , p = .023) , and longer granulocyte TL ( b = 191.56 , 95 % CI ( -4.23 , 387.35) , p = .055) at 12 months after accounting for baseline TL. Weight-loss maintenance of 5 % or greater was associated with longer PBMC TL ( b = 163.32 , 95 % CI 4.00 , 320.62) , p = .045) at 12 months after accounting for baseline TL. These tests should be interpreted in light of corrections for multiple tests. Among individuals with obesity , losing and maintaining a weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of 10 % or greater may lead to TL lengthening , which may portend improved immune and metabolic function. TL lengthening in this study is of unknown duration beyond 12 months , and requires further study.
