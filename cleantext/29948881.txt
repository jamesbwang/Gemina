  Infection age is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics. In order to realistically analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases , in this paper , a generalized disease transmission model of SIS type with age-dependent infection and birth and death on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection , the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property , that is , for the basic reproduction number less than one , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable , while for the basic reproduction number is above one , a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally , some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results. The disease dynamics rely not only on the network structure , but also on an age-dependent factor ( for some key functions concerned in the model).
