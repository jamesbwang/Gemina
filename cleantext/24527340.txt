  Cutaneous ulcers<disease> are treated with dressing materials and/or ointments to keep the wound<disease> in an appropriately moist environment. However , chronic cutaneous ulcers<disease> commonly have bacterial colonization that can cause local infection in such an environment. Therefore , the dressing materials and/or ointments should have antibacterial potency to treat chronic ulcers<disease>. Acute cutaneous<disease> wounds<disease> , by contrast , heal rapidly without local infection. The aim of treating acute cutaneous<disease> wounds<disease> is therefore not only wound closure but also preventing scar contracture after wound<disease> healing. However , no dressing materials or ointments available at present are simultaneously effective for preventing infection in chronic ulcers<disease> and reducing wound<disease> contracture in acute ulcers<disease>. Silk-elastin is a recombinant protein polymer with repeating units of silk-like and elastin-like blocks. Silk-elastin solution can self-assemble from a liquid to a hydrogel. We preliminarily reported that silk-elastin hydrogels have the potential to accelerate wound<disease> healing in decubitus ulcers<disease> of diabetic mice , which are animal models of severe , intractable cutaneous ulcers<disease>. In the present study , we examined the effects of silk-elastin hydrogels in chronic and acute ulcer<disease> models in comparison with conventional products ( carboxymethyl cellulose gel). Silk-elastin hydrogels resulted in significantly higher epithelialization rates than conventional hydrogels in both the chronic and acute ulcer<disease> models and significantly larger areas of granulation tissue in acute ulcer<disease> models. These results show that silk-elastin hydrogel is a promising material for promoting the healing of cutaneous<disease> wounds<disease> , including decubitus ulcers<disease> , chronic ulcers<disease> , and acute
