  Aluminum ( Al) causes neurodegeneration and its toxic effects on cholinergic system in the brain is well documented. However , it is unknown whether and how Al changes oscillation patterns , driven by the cholinergic system , in the hippocampus. We studied acute effects of Al on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs)- mediated modulation of persistent gamma oscillations in the hippocampus. The field potential recording was done in CA3 area of acute hippocampal slices. Carbachol-induced gamma oscillation peak power increased ( 1.32 ± 0.09 mV2/Hz , P < 0.01) in control conditions ( without Al) by application of 10µM nicotine as compared to baseline value normalized to 1. This nicotine-induced facilitation of gamma oscillation peak power was found to depend on non-α7 nAChRs. In slices with Al pre-incubation for three to four hours , gamma oscillation peak power was reduced ( 5.4 ± 1.8 mV2/Hz , P < 0.05) and facilitatory effect of nicotine on gamma oscillation peak power was blocked as compared to the control ( 18.06 ± 2.1 mV2/Hz) or one hour Al pre-incubated slices ( 11.3 ± 2.5 mV2/Hz). Intriguingly wash-out , after three to four hours of Al incubation , failed to restore baseline oscillation power and its facilitation by nicotine as no difference was observed in gamma oscillation peak power between Al wash-out slices ( 3.4 ± 1.1 mV2/Hz) and slices without wash-out ( 3.6 ± 0.9 mV2/Hz). This study shows that at cellular level , exposure of hippocampal tissue to Al compromised nAChR-mediated facilitation of cholinergic hippocampal gamma oscillations. Longer in vitro Al exposure caused permanent changes in hippocampal oscillogenic circuitry and changed its sensitivity to nAChR-modulation. This study will help to understand the possible mechanism of cognitive decline induced by Al..
