  The sex of an individual affects glucose homeostasis and the pathophysiology , incidence , and prevalence of diabetes as well as the response to therapy. This review focuses on clinical and experimental sex differences in islet cell biology and dysfunction during development and in adulthood in human and animal models. We discuss sex differences in β-cell and α-cell function , heterogeneity , and dysfunction. We cover sex differences in communication between gonads and islets and islet-cell immune interactions. Finally , we discuss sex differences in β-cell programming by nutrition and other environmental factors during pregnancy. Important sex differences exist in islet cell function and susceptibility to failure. These differences represent sex-related biological factors that can be harnessed for gender-based prevention of and therapy for diabetes.
