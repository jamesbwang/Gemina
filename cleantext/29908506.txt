  Sustainable flood management is a basic societal need. In this article , life cycle assessment is used to compare two ways to maintain the state of a coastal urban area in a changing climate with increasing flood risk. On one side , the construction of a dike , a hard and proactive scenario , is modelled using a bottom up approach. On the other , the systematic repair of houses flooded by sea surges , a post-disaster measure , is assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation allowing for aleatory uncertainties in predicting future sea level rise and occurrences of extreme events. Two metrics are identified , normalized mean impacts and probability of dike being most efficient. The methodology is applied to three case studies in Denmark representing three contrasting areas , Copenhagen , Frederiksværk , and Esbjerg. For all case studies the distribution of the calculated impact of repairing houses is highly right skewed , which in some cases has implications for the comparative LCA. The results show that , in Copenhagen , the scenario of the dike is overwhelmingly favorable for the environment , with a 43 times higher impact for repairing houses and only 0 % probability of the repairs being favorable. For Frederiksværk and Esbjerg the corresponding numbers are 5 and 0.9 times and 85 % and 32 % , respectively. Hence constructing a dike at this point in time is highly recommended in Copenhagen , preferable in Frederiksværk , and probably not recommendable in Esbjerg.
