  Osmolytes ' mechanism of protecting proteins against denaturation is a longstanding puzzle , further complicated by complex diversities inherent in protein sequences. An emergent approach in understanding the osmolytes ' mechanism of action toward biopolymer has been to investigate osmolytes ' interplay with hydrophobic interaction , the major driving force of protein folding. However , the crucial question is whether all of these protein-stabilizing osmolytes display a single unified mechanism toward hydrophobic interactions. By simulating the hydrophobic collapse of a macromolecule in aqueous solutions of two such osmoprotectants , glycine and trimethyl N-oxide ( TMAO) , both of which are known to stabilize protein 's folded conformation , we here demonstrate that these two osmolytes can impart mutually contrasting effects toward hydrophobic interaction. Although TMAO preserves its protectant nature across diverse range of polymer-osmolyte interactions , glycine is found to display an interesting crossover from being a protectant at weaker polymer-osmolyte interactions to being a denaturant of hydrophobicity at stronger polymer-osmolyte interactions. A preferential-interaction analysis reveals that a subtle balance<symptom> of conformation-dependent exclusion/binding of osmolyte molecules from/to the macromolecule holds the key to overall heterogenous behavior. Specifically , TMAOs ' consistent stabilization of collapsed configuration of macromolecule is found to be a result of TMAOs ' preferential binding to polymers via hydrophobic methyl groups. However , polar glycine 's crossover from being a protectant to denaturant across polymer-osmolyte interaction is rooted in its switch from preferential exclusion to preferential binding to the polymer with increasing interaction. Overall , by highlighting the complex interplay of osmolytes with hydrophobic interaction , this work puts forward the necessity of quantitative categorization of osmolytes ' action in protein.
