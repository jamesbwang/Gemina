  The FoxP2 transcription factor and its target genes have been implicated in developmental brain diseases with a prominent language component , such as developmental verbal dyspraxia and specific language impairment. How FoxP2 affects neural circuitry development remains poorly understood. The sushi domain protein SRPX2 is a target of FoxP2 , and mutations in SRPX2 are associated with language defects in humans. We have previously shown that SRPX2 is a synaptogenic protein that increases excitatory synapse density. Here we provide the first characterization of mice lacking the SRPX2 gene , and show that these mice exhibit defects in both neural circuitry and communication and social behaviors. Specifically , we show that mice lacking SRPX2 show a specific reduction in excitatory VGlut2 synapses in the cerebral cortex , while VGlut1 and inhibitory synapses were largely unaffected. SRPX2 KO mice also exhibit an abnormal ultrasonic vocalization ontogenetic profile in neonatal pups , and reduced preference for social novelty. These data demonstrate a functional role for SRPX2 during brain development , and further implicate FoxP2 and its targets in regulating the development of vocalization and social circuits.
