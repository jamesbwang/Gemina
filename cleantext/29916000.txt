  Phemister procedure is an effective treatment for early stage osteonecrosis of femoral head ( ONFH). Since the long-term results of the Phemister procedure are less reported in the literature , the purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of this bone grafting technique in patients with earlier stages of ONFH. From 1994 to 2010 , 29 hips with pre-collapsed or early collapsed ( < 2 mm) ONFH treated by Phemister procedure were evaluated. Among them , nine hips were Association Research Circulation Osseous ( ARCO) stage IIA , 13 stage IIB , 4 stage IIC , and 3 stage IIIA. The mean age was 38.9 years. The mean follow-up was 14 years ( 1-21 years). Survivorship was analyzed with conversion to total hip arthroplasty ( THA) as the endpoint. At the final follow-up , 10 hips underwent THA at a mean of ten years ( 1-18 years). The overall clinical success rate for hip preserving was 65.5 % , and radiological success rate was 31 %. The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 50.3 to 76.1. The survival of hips was significantly inferior in female patients ( P < 0.01) , ARCO stage III disease ( P = 0.03) , lateral type lesion<symptom> ( P < 0.01) , and necrotic index â‰¥ 0.67 ( P < 0.01). The Cox proportional hazards model showed that gender , ARCO stage , and necrotic index were independent risk factors for conversion to THA. The study showed acceptable results without complication in patients receiving Phemister procedure for early stage ONFH at a mean follow-up of 14 years. As a head-preserving procedure , Phemister technique is worthwhile for young patients to postpone the need for THA.
