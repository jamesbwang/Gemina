  Simulation models can predict the outcome of different strategies for the control and eradication of paratuberculosis ( PTB) in dairy herds. Two main transmission modes have previously been used to simulate the spread of PTB: direct ( contact between animals) and indirect ( through the environment). In addition , previous models were calibrated to either low or high within-herd prevalence levels , which we refer to as normal and low hygiene levels , respectively. We simulated both direct and indirect transmission with the same model in both normal and low hygiene level scenarios. The effectiveness of a test-and-cull strategy was dependent on the calibration level of the simulation model , and eradication occurred less frequently with the more biologically plausible indirect transmission mode. The results were compared to within-herd prevalence records from 314 dairy herds. The prevalence in 50 % of the herds varied less than 0.9 % per year on average , and less than 4 % in 90 % of the herds. We therefore conclude that the normal-hygiene scenario best describes most dairy herds in Denmark. Finally , we simulated different levels of farmer compliance with a test-and-cull strategy and found that a 60 % compliance level was not sufficient to reach eradication within 10 years.
