  T cells play a crucial role in orchestrating body immune responses. T cell hyperfunction , however , leads to inflammation<symptom> and induction of autoimmune diseases. Understanding of T cell regulation mechanisms and successful modulation of T cell responses is beneficial in treatment of disease associated to T cell hyperresponsiveness. Our previous study indicated that monoclonal antibody ( mAb) P-3E10 , a mAb to Na , K ATPase β3 subunit , inhibited anti-CD3-induced PBMC proliferation. In the current study , we further investigated the mechanism of mAb P-3E10 in the induction of T cell hypofunction. We demonstrated that mAb P-3E10 decreased T cell proliferation and Th1 , Th2 and Th17 cytokine production. Monocytes were the cells playing a key role in mediation of mAb P-3E10 induced T cell hypofunction. The inhibition of T cell activation by mAb P-3E10 required cell contact between monocytes and T cells. The mAb P-3E10 induced the down-expression level of MHC class II and CD86 and increased IL-6 , IL-10 and TNF-α production of monocytes. We concluded that ligation of the Na , K ATPase β3 subunit on monocytes by mAb P-3E10 arbitrated T cell hypofunction. This mAb might be a promising novel immunotherapeutic antibody for the treatment of hyperresponsive T cell associated diseases.
