  Microfluidics has proven to be a key tool in quantitative biological research. The C. elegans<pathogen> research community in particular has developed a variety of microfluidic platforms to investigate sensory systems , development , aging , and physiology of the nematode. Critical for the growth of this field , however , has been the implementation of concurrent advanced microscopy , hardware , and software technologies that enable the discovery of novel biology. In this review , we highlight recent innovations in microfluidic platforms used for assaying C. elegans<pathogen> and discuss the novel technological approaches and analytic strategies required for these systems. We conclude that platforms that provide analytical frameworks for assaying specific biological mechanisms and those that take full advantage of integrated technologies to extract high-value quantitative information from worm assays are most likely to move the field forward.
