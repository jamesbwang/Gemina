  The encapsulation of a hemicyanine dye , LDS 730 , into the 1D nanochannels of MgAPO-5 aluminophosphate by `` one-pot '' synthesis , based on `` in situ '' occlusion via a crystallization inclusion method , has led to a hybrid material with emission in the NIR region. The tight fitting between the molecular size of the guest dye and the pore dimensions of the host has enabled a rigid conformation of the LDS 730 dye within the nanochannels. Consequently , fluorescence in the NIR range of the spectra is enhanced with respect to the dye in solution. The synthesis of the hybrid material was optimized through a systematic variation of the gel composition via MW in order to obtain a pure phase.
