  Photodynamic therapy ( PDT) is a noninvasive therapeutic technique. Upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs) hold promise for photodynamic therapy ( PDT). UCNPs with antistokes emission can improve the tissue penetration depth of PDT. However , the low upconversion efficiency poses a strong limit on further development of PDT.
