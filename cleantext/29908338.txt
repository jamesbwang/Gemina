  To compare the surgical and oncologic outcomes between radical abdominal trachelectomy and radical hysterectomy ( RH) for stage IA2-IB1 cervical cancer. Ⅱ-2:: Retrospective cohort study. Shandong Cancer Hospital. 329 patients with IA2-IB1 cervical cancer. All patients underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy ( ART) or RH. All patients were divided into ART ( n = 143) and RH ( n = 186) group according to surgical approach. Additionally , oncologic and fertility outcomes were compared for different tumor pathologies and sizes in ART patients. ART group had similar case characteristics as RH group , except that ART group had a longer surgical time. During a similar follow-up period , there were 4 ( 2.9 %) recurrences and 3 ( 2.2 %) patients who died for recurrence in ART group , compared to 8 ( 4.6 %) recurrences and 4 ( 2.3 %) patients who died for recurrence in RH group ( P = 0.444 , P = 0.999 respectively). In ART group , squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) patients had a 5-year overall-survival and pregnancy rate similar to those of non-SCC patients ( 98.1 % vs. 96.8 % , P = 0.999 , 33.3 % vs. 26.7 % , P = 0.873) , and patients with tumors ≤ 2 cm and 2-4 cm experienced similar 5-year overall-survival rate ( 97.0 % vs. 98.6 % , P = 0.999) , except patients in former group had a higher pregnancy rate ( 45.2 % vs. 17.2 % , P = 0.020). ART seems to have similar surgical and oncologic outcomes to RH , except ART has a longer surgical time. Both non-SCC patients and stage IA2-IB1 patients with 2-4 cm tumors can undergo ART safely. Patients with tumors ≤ 2 cm have a higher pregnancy rate than patients with tumors 2-4 cm.
