  To observe the effect of electroacupuncture ( EA) intervention on learning-memory ability and the expression of senile plaques ( SP) , amyloid precursor protein ( APP) , Î²-secretase 1 ( BACE 1) and insulin degrading enzyme ( IDE) in the hippocampus in APP/presenilin 1 ( PS 1) double transgenic Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) mice , so as to reveal its mechanisms underlying improvement of AD. A total of 18 male APP/PS 1 double transgenic AD mice were randomly divided into model , EA-2-week and EA-3-week groups ( Following modeling , the escape latency and path length of hidden platform tests were significantly increased ( EA stimulation of GV 20 and BL 23 can improve the learning-memory ability in APP/PS 1 double transgenic AD mice , which may be related to its effects in down-regulating the expression of SP , APP and BACE 1 proteins and up-regulating the expression of IDE protein in the hippocampus.
