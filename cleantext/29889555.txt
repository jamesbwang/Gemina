  The H19-IGF2 imprinted gene region could be implicated in the risk of developing impaired renal function ( IRF). Our aim was to determine the association of several common H19-IGF2 variants and IRF in a cohort of elderly healthy individuals. The study involved 675 individuals > 65 years of age , 184 with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) , and 105 with IRF ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 60). They were genotyped for two common H19 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) ( rs2839698 and rs10732516) , one H19-IGF2 intergenic indel ( rs201858505) , and one indel in the 3 ` UTR of the IGF2. For the H19 SNPs , we also determined the allele present in the methylated chromosome through genotyping the DNA digested with a methylation-sensitive endonuclease. None of the four H19-IGF2 variants was associated with IRF in our cohort. We found a significantly higher frequency of the 3 ` UTR IGF2 deletion ( D) in the eGFR < 60 group ( p = 0.01; odds ratio = 1.16 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.10-2.51). This association was independent of age and T2DM , two strong predictors of IRF. In conclusion , a common indel variant in the 3 ` UTR of the IGF2 gene was associated with the risk of IRF. This association could be explained by the role of IGF2 in podocyte survival , through regulation of IGF2 expression by differential binding of miRNAs to the indel sequences. Functional studies should be necessary to clarify this issue.
