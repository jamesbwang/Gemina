  The aim of this paper is to present our experience with femoral press-fit fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. The patient population was randomly placed in two groups: group A ( 58 patients) , who underwent femoral screw fixation; group B ( 62 patients) , who underwent femoral press-fit fixation. At last follow-up 9.2 % of patients were lost; 28 % of patients in group A and 64 % of patients in group B had excellent International Knee Documentation Committee score ( grade A); 66 % of patients in group A and 32 % of patients in group B had good International Knee Documentation Committee scores ( grade B). The difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05). Femoral press-fit fixation of bone- patellar tendon- bone autograft provides stable fixation at low cost , it ensures unlimited bone-to-bone healing and high primary stability , avoiding the disadvantages of hardware and the need for removal in case of revision.
