  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief review of the literature on the recent developments in neuromuscular blockade and reversal agents. Novel drug development resulted in pharmacological advancements in neuromuscular management and led to a new series of compounds , chlorofumarates , such as gantacurium , CW002 , and CW011. These drugs have a fast onset and rapid to intermediate duration of action and can be rapidly reversed by l-cysteine adduction without side effects that are commonly observed with anticholinesterase reversal drugs. Another new advancement is the development of a new class of reversal drugs , the calabadions. These drugs are able to reverse both steroidal and non-steroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs rapidly. Recent advancements in neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal drugs have shown promise in improving safety of management of neuromuscular blockade. Preclinical and clinical studies are discussed. However , to date these new drugs are not yet available for clinical use.
