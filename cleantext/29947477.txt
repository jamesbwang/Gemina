  SCY-078 is an orally bioavailable triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor in clinical development as an intravenous and oral treatment of fungal infections caused by Candida and Aspergillus species. This was a sequential , single-center , open-label phase 1 study to assess the drug-drug interaction potential between SCY-078 and tacrolimus during concomitant administration in healthy subjects. In cohort 1 , period 1 , subjects received a single oral dose of tacrolimus 2 mg in the fasted state. In period 2 after a â‰¥ 15 day washout , subjects received a single loading dose of SCY-078 1250 mg on day 1 followed by maintenance doses of SCY-780 750 mg on days 2 through 8. On day 3 of period 2 , subjects also received a single dose of tacrolimus 2 mg concurrent with SCY-078. In cohort 2 , subjects received a loading dose of SCY-078 1250 mg on day 1 followed by maintenance doses of SCY-780 750 mg on days 2 and 3. Pharmacokinetic ( PK) parameters were compared to assess both the impact of steady-state SCY-078 on tacrolimus and the impact of tacrolimus on the PK of steady-state SCY-078. The concurrent coadministration of tacrolimus and SCY-078 had no effect on the maximum blood levels of tacrolimus , as evidenced by no change in maximum concentration of drug in blood plasma and a 1.4-fold increase in total area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve. The concurrent coadministration of tacrolimus and SCY-078 resulted in a weaker interaction than typically observed with the azole class of antifungals. The current data indicate that an initial dose adjustment for tacrolimus may not be warranted when combined with SCY-078 , as the modest increase in exposure is less than the therapeutic window , although tacrolimus monitoring , as with addition of any new medication , is recommended. These results support the coadministration of SCY-078 and tacrolimus.
