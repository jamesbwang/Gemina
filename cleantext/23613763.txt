  Negative and uncertain medical findings are frequent in radiology reports , but discriminating them from positive findings remains challenging for information extraction. Here , we propose a new algorithm , NegBio , to detect negative and uncertain findings in radiology reports. Unlike previous rule-based methods , NegBio utilizes patterns on universal dependencies to identify the scope of triggers that are indicative of negation or uncertainty. We evaluated NegBio on four datasets , including two public benchmarking corpora of radiology reports , a new radiology corpus that we annotated for this work , and a public corpus of general clinical texts. Evaluation on these datasets demonstrates that NegBio is highly accurate for detecting negative and uncertain findings and compares favorably to a widely-used state-of-the-art system NegEx ( an average of 9.5 % improvement in precision and 5.1 % in F1-score). https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/NegBio.
