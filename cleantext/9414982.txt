  Arthrogryposis-Renal dysfunction-Cholestasis syndrome<disease> ( ARC , MIM # 208085) is a rare multisystem disease due to mutations in the VPS33B and VIPAR genes , both involved in maintaining apical-basolateral cell polarity. The correlation between mutations and phenotype in the ARC Syndrome<disease> is not well described. We report on a 6 year old patient who presented with severe renal Fanconi as first manifestation of ARC related to a combined de novo mutation in the VPS33B gene. A 6 year old girl presented during the first year of life with severe renal Fanconi as the first manifestation of ARC-Syndrome. This case presents all defining features of ARC syndrome<disease> ( including liver , skin and articular manifestations) with predominantly renal impairment at presentation. This novel mutation may be associated with a pronounced renal phenotype in ARC. Furthermore , we report on the successful use of LDL-Apheresis and biliodigestive derivation for treatment of cholestatic pruritus with encouraging results. ARC is a heterogeneous disorder with early mortality. This case report contributes to a better understanding of this rare disorder , describes a novel mutation in the VPS33B gene and presents an innovative rescue treatment approach.
