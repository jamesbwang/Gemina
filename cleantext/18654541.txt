  In this work , we have prepared a series of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) composites containing various graphene flakes loadings ( 0.02-2 wt %) , and their broadband optical properties are being investigated. We demonstrate the tunability and evolution of transmittance and reflection spectra of the composites in a wide spectral range ( 0.4-200 μm) as a function of graphene content. Using these data we derive the broadband wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient ( α) values. Our results show that α is roughly constant in the visible and IR ranges , and , surprisingly , is approximately one order of magnitude lower in the terahertz regime , suggesting different terahertz radiation scattering mechanism in our composite. Our material could be useful for applications in optical communication , sensing or ultrafast photonics.
