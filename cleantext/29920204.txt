  Mercury-contaminated sediment and water contain various Hg species , with a small fraction available for microbial conversion to the bioaccumulative neurotoxin monomethylmercury ( MeHg). Quantification of this available Hg pool is needed to prioritize sites for risk management. This study compared the efficacy of diffusive gradient in thin-film ( DGT) passive samplers to a thiol-based selective extraction method with glutathione ( GSH) and conventional filtration ( < 0.2 Î¼m) as indicators of Hg bioavailability. Anaerobic sediment slurry microcosms were amended with isotopically labeled inorganic Hg `` endmembers '' ( dissolved Hg
