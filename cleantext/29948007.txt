  Tomato pollen grains have the capacity for ethylene production , possessing specific components of the ethylene-biosynthesis and- signaling pathways , being affected/responsive to high-temperature conditions. Exposure of plants to heat stress ( HS) conditions reduces crop yield and quality , mainly due to sensitivity of pollen grains. Recently , it was demonstrated that ethylene , a gaseous plant hormone , plays a significant role in tomato pollen heat-tolerance. It is not clear , however , whether , or to what extent , pollen grains are dependent on the capacity of the surrounding anther tissues for ethylene synthesis and signaling , or can synthesize this hormone and possess an active signaling pathway. The aim of this work was ( 1) to investigate if isolated , maturing and mature , tomato pollen grains have the capacity for ethylene production , ( 2) to find out whether pollen grains possess an active ethylene-biosynthesis and- signaling pathway and characterize the respective tomato pollen components at the transcript level , ( 3) to look into the effect of short-term HS conditions. Results from accumulation studies showed that pollen , anthers , and flowers produced ethylene and HS affected differentially ethylene production by ( rehydrated) mature pollen , compared to anthers and flowers , causing elevated ethylene levels. Furthermore , several ethylene synthesis genes were expressed , with SlACS3 and SlACS11 standing out as highly HS-induced genes of the pollen ethylene biosynthesis pathway. Specific components of the ethylene-signaling pathway as well as several ethylene-responsive factors were expressed in pollen , with SlETR3 ( ethylene receptor; named also NR , for never ripe) and SlCTR2 ( constitutive triple response2) being HS responsive. This work shows that tomato pollen grains have the capacity for ethylene production , possessing active ethylene-biosynthesis and- signaling pathways , highlighting specific pollen components that serve as a valuable resource for future research on the role of ethylene in pollen thermotolerance.
