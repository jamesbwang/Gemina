  The role of rs4919510 polymorphism in microRNA-608 ( miR-608) and cancer susceptibility and prognosis remain controversial and debatable. We conducted a meta-analysis of twenty-four eligible publications on the association of rs4919510 polymorphism with cancer risk and/or prognosis. Odds ratios , hazard ratios , and 95 % confidence interval were used to investigate the association between this polymorphism and susceptibility , overall survival , and recurrence-free survival of cancer. Overall , eighteen case-control studies and nine cohort studies evaluated the susceptibility and prognostic value of rs4919510 polymorphism in cancer , respectively. Pooled analysis showed that rs4919510 polymorphism was not associated with cancer risk in all five genetic models. When stratifying by different cancer sites , rs4919510 polymorphism was detected to have a significant association with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in homozygous model (
