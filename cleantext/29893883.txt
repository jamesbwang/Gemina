  Dyspnea<symptom> is among symptoms that decrease quality of life for terminal cancer patients. There are few reports of the positive effects of oxycodone for the treatment of dyspnea<symptom> , and no studies have focused on opioid-na誰ve patients. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of continuous intravenous oxycodone infusion for opioid-na誰ve cancer patients with dyspnea<symptom>. Eligible patients were opioid-na誰ve cancer inpatients who received continuous oxycodone infusion as a treatment for dyspnea<symptom> under the care of the palliative care team at Komaki City Hospital between November 2013 and December 2016. We retrospectively investigated the improvement of dyspnea<symptom> following continuous oxycodone infusion from the medical records. This study included 19 patients , and the response rate to oxycodone infusion for dyspnea<symptom> was 68.4 %. Most participants were terminal cancer patients with performance status 3 or 4. Median survival of participants following continuous oxycodone infusion was 6 ( range 1-377) days. No serious adverse events such as respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> or somnolence were noted. Continuous oxycodone infusion could be a reasonable treatment option in the management of dyspnea<symptom> in opioid-na誰ve cancer patients.
