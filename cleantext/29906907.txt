  The continuous time random walk ( CTRW) is often applied to the study of particle motion in disordered media. Yet most such applications do not allow for particle-particle ( walker-walker) interaction. In this paper , we consider a CTRW with particle-particle interaction; however , for simplicity , we restrain the interaction to be local. The generalized Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is modified by introducing a perturbation function that fluctuates around 1 , which models the effect of interaction. Subsequently , a time-fractional nonlinear advection-diffusion equation is derived from this walking system. Under the initial condition of condensed particles at the origin and the free-boundary condition , we numerically solve this equation with both attractive and repulsive particle-particle interactions. Moreover , a Monte Carlo simulation is devised to verify the results of the above numerical work. The equation and the simulation unanimously predict that this walking system converges to the conventional one in the long-time limit. However , for systems where the free-boundary condition and long-time limit are not simultaneously satisfied , this convergence does not hold.
