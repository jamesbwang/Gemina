  Using culture-based methods , bacterial translocation from the gut to draining mesenteric lymph nodes ( LNs) is seen in 5 % of normal controls and up to 33 % of patients with IBD. Many bacteria ca n't be cultured so these methods are unable to capture the full spectrum of bacteria present. To detect viable bacteria in LNs of patients with IBD and non-IBD controls using bacterial RNA as a surrogate for viability and to compare them with the same patient 's gut microbiome. Bacterial RNA was extracted from LNs and mucosa of 20 patients who had undergone intestinal resection ( 10 IBD , 10 non-IBD). A previous study had detected bacterial DNA in these patients ' LNs. Bacterial RNA was detected in LNs of five patients with IBD and three controls ( volvulus , diverticulitis and bowel obstruction). LNs had higher alpha ( within sample) diversity compared to mucosal samples ( Shannon diversity index 2.41 vs 1.81 , one-way ANOVA p = 0.035). Beta diversity ( inter-sample variation: LN vs intestine) was similar within individuals , and did not differ between groups. Common gene polymorphisms linked with IBD ( NOD2 , ATG16L1 , IRGM and IL23R) were not associated with bacterial translocation. Metabolically-active bacteria mirroring the individual 's gut microbiome , were found commonly in LNs of patients with IBD undergoing resection. An increase in LN alpha diversity is likely due to the larger drainage area. The presence of viable bacteria in non-IBD controls is also not unexpected given the underlying pathology in these patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
