  The 2009 influenza<disease> pandemic was caused by A/H1N1pdm09 virus , which was subsequently included in the seasonal vaccine as the A/H1N1 strain up to 2016/17. This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the antibody response to H1N1pdm09 over time. Healthcare workers ( HCWs) were immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 ( N = 250) , and subsequently vaccinated with seasonal vaccines containing H1N1pdm09 for 4 seasons ( repeated group) , < 4 seasons ( occasional group) , or received no further vaccinations ( single group). Blood samples were collected at 21-days , 3- , 6- and 12-months after each vaccination or annually ( pre-season) from 2010 in the single group. The H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition ( HI) assay. Pandemic vaccination robustly induced HI antibodies that persisted above the 50 % protective threshold ( HI titers ≥ 40) over 12-months post-vaccination. Previous seasonal vaccination and the duration of adverse events after pandemic vaccination influenced the decision to vaccinate in subsequent seasons. During 2010/11- 2013/14 , antibodies were boosted after each seasonal vaccination , although no significant difference was observed between the repeated and occasional groups. In the single group without seasonal vaccination , 32 % of HCWs seroconverted ( ≥ 4 fold-increase HI titers) during the four subsequent years , most of whom had HI titers < 40 prior to seroconversion. When excluding these seroconverted HCWs , HI titers gradually declined from 12- to 60-months post-pandemic vaccination. Pandemic vaccination elicited durable antibodies , supporting the incorporation of adjuvant. Our findings support the current recommendation of annual influenza<disease> vaccination in HCWs.
