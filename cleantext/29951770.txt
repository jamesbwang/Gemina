  Biomarker-based strategies to assess human exposure to mycotoxins have gained increased acceptance in recent years. In this study , an improved method based on UPLC-MS/MS following 96-well μElution solid-phase extraction was developed and validated for the sensitive and high-throughput determination of zearalenone ( ZEN) and its five metabolites α-zearalenol ( α-ZEL) , β-zearalenol ( β-ZEL) , α-zearalanol ( α-ZAL) , β-zearalanol ( β-ZAL) , and zearalanone ( ZAN) in human urine samples , using
