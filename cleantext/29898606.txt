  Background Computed tomography colonography ( CTC) is an accepted complement or alternative to optical colonoscopy ( OC) but its implementation is incompletely analyzed , and technical performance varies between centers. Purpose To evaluate implementation , indications , and technical performance of CTC in Sweden and to evaluate compliance to international guidelines. Material and Methods A structured , self-assessed questionnaire regarding implementation and technical performance of CTC was sent to all eligible radiology departments in Sweden. Eighty-six out of 89 departments replied. Comparisons were made with similar national surveys from 2004 and 2009. Results The number of centers performing CTC gradually increased from 23 in 2004 to 77 in 2016. In parallel , centers performing barium enema ( BE) examinations have decreased from 89 in 2004 to 13 in 2016. Main reasons stated for still performing BE were lack of resources regarding CTC/OC. Main reasons for not performing CTC were lack of suitable software , lack of machine/reading time , and lack of experience. The majority of centers follow international CTC guidelines. An important exception is fecal tagging , which was implemented in only 63 % of the centers. Incomplete OC remains a major indication for CTC , while preoperative CTC in colorectal cancer and follow-up after diverticulitis have emerged as new indications. Conclusion CTC today is well implemented in routine healthcare but still lacking in capacity. Indications have expanded over time , and most departments perform `` state of the art '' CTC , although fecal tagging is incompletely implemented.
