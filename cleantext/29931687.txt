  The focus on investigations of probiotics has been on their health beneficial roles thus far , with some of the findings finally reaching food and pharmaceutical industries to commercialize their products. In biocontrol research some microbes mainly isolated from plants have shown antagonism towards both enteric and plant pathogens and out of them , some represent probiotic species. Fresh fruits and vegetables are upheld as health promoting dietary components , and if probiotics could be used to control pathogens on them , they could turn out to be even more healthy. The fresh produce industry still depends on agrochemicals and the upward trend in the demand for highly priced organically grown produce indicates consumer concern of agrochemical usage. If the potential of probiotic organisms to serve as biocontrol agents on fresh produce is exploited , all fresh produce can be made as safe as organically grown produce , and elevate them to be much more wholesome. This review appraises feasibility for such a move by evaluating how research has progressed in both disciplines ( probiotic and biocontrol) and suggests sharing results from research via information technology , efficient collaboration , and use of novel molecular biological tools to set a firm foundation to achieve the objective of probiotic-antagonists.
