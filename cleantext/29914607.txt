  Despite overwhelming evidence for the association between tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) and tobacco use , it remains neglected in the context of policy , planning and practice. There is limited evidence about the extent of integration of TB and tobacco control programmes in South-East Asia Region ( SEAR) countries. To assess the level of TB-tobacco integration in 11 SEAR countries. Cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire addressed to TB and tobacco focal points at the World Health Organization Country Offices. Apart from India , no country in the SEAR has a formal coordination mechanism for national TB and tobacco control programmes or a system of referral for tobacco users among TB patients for treatment of tobacco dependence. There is no joint planning , joint training or joint supervision and monitoring in any country. There is poor integration between TB and tobacco control programmes in most SEAR countries. This assessment fed into the development of a regional framework for TB-tobacco integration , which outlines three strategies: 1) integrated patient-centred care and prevention; 2) joint TB tobacco actions covering policy development , planning , training and monitoring; and 3) research and innovation. Every country in the region should adopt the TB-tobacco integration framework to improve programme performance.
