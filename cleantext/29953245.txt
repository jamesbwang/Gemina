  Scoring functions are important component of protein-protein docking methods. They need to be evaluated on high-quality benchmarks to reveal their strengths and weaknesses<symptom>. Evaluation results obtained on such benchmarks can provide valuable guidance for developing more advanced scoring functions. Methodology & results: In our comparative assessment of scoring functions for protein-protein interactions benchmark , the performance of a scoring function was characterized by ` docking power ' and ` scoring power '. A high-quality dataset of 273 protein-protein complexes was compiled and employed in both tests. Four scoring functions , including FASTCONTACT , ZRANK , dDFIRE and ATTRACT were tested as demonstration. ZRANK and ATTRACT exhibited encouraging performance in the docking power test. However , all four scoring functions failed badly in the scoring power test. Our comparative assessment of scoring functions for protein-protein interaction benchmark is created especially for assessing the scoring functions applicable to protein-protein interactions. It is different from other benchmarks for assessing protein-protein docking methods. Our benchmark is available to the public at www.pdbbind-cn.org/download/CASF-PPI/.
