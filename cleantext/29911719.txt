  We present a model to investigate the formation of two-length scale surface patterns in biological and synthetic anisotropic soft matter materials through the high order interaction of anisotropic interfacial tension and capillarity at their free surfaces. The unique pattern-formation mechanism emerging from the presented model is based on the interaction between lower and higher order anchoring modes. Analytical and numerical solutions are used to shed light on why and how simple anisotropic anchoring generates two-lengthscale wrinkles whose amplitudes are given in terms of anchoring coefficients. The novel finding is that the surface energy landscape with its maxima and minima can be imprinted onto the surface geometric landscape. Symmetry relations and scaling laws are used to provide the explicit relations between the anchoring constants and surface profile of the two length scale wrinkles. These new findings establish a new paradigm for characterizing surface wrinkling in biological liquid crystals , and inspire the design of novel functional surface structures.
