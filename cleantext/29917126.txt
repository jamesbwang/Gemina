  THS , the residual tobacco smoke remaining in the environment after tobacco has been smoked , represents an underestimated public health hazard. Evidence supports its widespread presence in indoor environments. Vulnerable populations are believed to include infants and children living in a smoking household exposed to THS and/or SHS and exposure has been identified as a risk factor for lung cancer later in life. These and future studies will provide novel and important evidence of how early-life exposure to THS affects cancer development and other diseases , which should be useful for framing and enforcing new policies against passive smoking in the the world.
