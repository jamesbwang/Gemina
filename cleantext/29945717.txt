  To demonstrate the risk of cataract associated with radiation exposure from neuro-interventional procedures. This was a nationwide population-based , matched-cohort study. The exposed group ( group E) comprised patients diagnosed with an aneurysm<disease> , cerebrovascular system anomaly , or subarachnoid haemorrhage who underwent a neuro-interventional procedure , such as brain digital subtraction angiography or endovascular embolisation. The comparison group ( group C) included subjects who were never exposed to radiation from neuro-interventional procedures and were propensity score-matched by the date of enrolment , age , sex , and associated comorbidities. Multiple Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio ( HR) of cataract risk due to radiation exposure while adjusting for potential confounding factors. There were 838 patients and 3,352 matched subjects in groups E and C , respectively. The incidence of cataracts was significantly greater among subjects in group E ( adjusted HR ( aHR) = 1.88; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.08-3.26) , especially those aged > 40 years ( aHR = 2.14; 95 % CI = 1.16-3.94). The number of computed tomography examinations was positively correlated , but not statistically significant , with an increased risk of cataract occurrence. Neuro-interventional procedures might be significantly associated with an increased risk of cataract occurrence.
