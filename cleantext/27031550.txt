  Decellularization of tissues is a recently developed technique mostly used to provide a 3-dimensional matrix structure of the original organ , including decellularized lung tissues for lung transplantation. Based on the results of the present study , we propose new utilization of decellularized tissues as inducers of stem cell differentiation. Decellularized lung matrix ( L-Mat) samples were prepared from mouse lungs by SDS treatment , then the effects of L-Mat on differentiation of ES cells into lung cells were investigated. ES cell derived-embryoid bodies ( EBs) were transplanted into L-Mat samples and cultured for 2 weeks. At the end of the culture , expressions of lung cell-related markers , such as TTF-1 and SP-C ( alveolar type II cells) , AQP5 ( alveolar type I cells) , and CC10 ( club cells) , were detected in EB outgrowths in L-Mat , while those were not found in EB outgrowths attached to the dish. Our results demonstrated that L-Mat has an ability to induce differentiation of ES cells into lung-like cells.
