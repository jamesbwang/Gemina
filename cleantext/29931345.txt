  Since spiders are sensitive to pesticides , the use of lower-volume pesticide sprays that specifically target the plucking surface may help to preserve their assemblages. In this study , we investigated the effect of four pyrethroid pesticides on spider populations in tea ( Camellia sinensis<pathogen>) fields when applied using a lower-volume sprayer. Abundance and composition at family level of spiders were assessed before and after treatments. We found that fewer spiders were eliminated when we used a lower-volume sprayer ( 40 liters/10 ares) rather than a conventional sprayer ( 200 liters/10 ares) due to the lower-volume treatment only covering the plucking surface ( top layer) of the tea plants. These findings indicate that the tea leaf layer plays a good role in sheltering spiders during pesticide application and that the lower-volume treatment that specifically targets the plucking surface can enhance this protection. Therefore , to successfully maintain predatory spiders that prey on tea pests , tea farmers should reduce the volume of pesticides they use and try to restrict the spray to the plucking surface of the plants.
