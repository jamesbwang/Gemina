  Monocytes differentiate into macrophages , which deactivate invading pathogens. Macrophages can be resistant to cell death mechanisms in some situations , and the mechanisms involved are not clear. Here , using mouse immune cells , we investigated whether the differentiation of macrophages affects their susceptibility to cell death by the ripoptosome/necrosome pathways. We show that treatment of macrophages with a mimetic of second mitochondrial activator of caspases ( SMAC) resulted in ripoptosome-driven cell death that specifically depended on tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα) expression and the receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 ( RipK1)- RipK3-caspase-8 interaction in activated and cycling macrophages. Differentiation of macrophages increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but reduced RipK1-dependent cell death and the RipK3-caspase-8 interaction.
