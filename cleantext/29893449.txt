  Resting cyst<symptom> formation is a remarkable survival strategy used by ciliates in response to the adverse environmental conditions. However , the mechanisms underlying encystment are poorly understood. Here , the genetic basis of encystment in Colpoda aspera was examined through RNA sequencing to identify transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression between vegetative and encystment stages. After de novo assembly , 49,543 transcripts were identified. Gene annotation and pathway mapping analysis revealed marked changes in biosynthesis , energy metabolism , and autophagy pathways during cyst<symptom> formation. In addition , some differentially regulated genes were predicted to function in the interconnected cAMP , AMPK , mTOR , and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways , potentially forming a regulatory network for encystment. The present study conducted a large-scale assessment of Colpoda aspera genomic resources and provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cyst<symptom> formation.
