  An increasing number of studies have shown the ability of organisms to escape from toxic effects due to contamination , by moving spatially towards less contaminated habitats. However , this issue has been investigated in monospecific scenarios , without considering possible interactions between species during the contamination avoidance process. It is widely known that the spatial distribution of one species can be affected by another one , in different ways. Therefore , the main question addressed in the present study was as follows: Might interspecific interaction between the freshwater fish Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> ( zebrafish) and Poecilia reticulata ( guppy) change their behavior patterns in terms of avoidance in the presence of a copper gradient? Zebrafish and guppies exposed to a copper gradient were tested for avoidance responses in a free-choice , non-forced , static , multi-compartmented exposure system , using two distinct approaches: ( 1) monospecific tests , in which only one species was exposed to the copper gradient , at two different population densities; and ( 2) multispecific tests , in which both species were tested simultaneously. In the control ( with no copper) monospecific tests , both species were randomly distributed; however , in the control multispecific test , P. reticulata tended to aggregate. In the monospecific tests with a copper gradient , both species avoided copper in a similar way , with AC
