  To explore service user experiences of a 9-month cognitive behavioural therapy for command hallucinations in the context of a randomised controlled trial including their views on acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. The study took place across three sites: Birmingham , Manchester and London. Interviews were carried out at the sites where therapy took place which included service bases and participants ' homes. Of 197 patients who consented to the trial , 98 received the Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Command Hallucinations ( CTCH) intervention; 25 ( 15 males) of whom were randomly selected and consented to the qualitative study. The mean age of the sample was 42 years , and 68 % were white British. Two superordinate themes were identified: participants ' views about the aspects of CTCH they found most helpful; and participants ' concerns with therapy. Helpful aspects of the therapy included gaining control over the voices , challenging the power and omniscience of the voices , following a structured approach , normalisation and mainstreaming of the experience of voices , and having peer support alongside the therapy. Concerns with the therapy included anxiety<symptom> about completing CTCH tasks , fear of talking back to voices , the need for follow-up and ongoing support and concerns with adaptability of the therapy. Interpretation: CTCH was generally well received and the narratives validated the overall approach. Participants did not find it an easy therapy to undertake as they were challenging a persecutor they believed had great power to harm; many were concerned , anxious and occasionally disappointed that the voices did not disappear altogether. The trusting relationship with the therapist was crucial. The need for continued support was expressed. ISRCTN62304114 , Pre-results.
