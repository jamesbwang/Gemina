  Borneol as a penetration enhancer is widely used in guiding other components through the biological barrier into the targeting organs or tissues. This study aimed at studying effect and mechanism of synthetic borneol ( S-BO) on improving lymphatic-targeting ability of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin liposomes ( SN-38-Lips) via increasing lymph node uptake. At first , SN-38-Lips prepared had appropriate particle distribution , drug loading property and compatible stability with S-BO. Both in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo fluorescence imaging showed that 2 and 5 mg/mL S-BO , especially 2 mg/mL S-BO , enhanced cytoplasmic fluorescence signal of SN-38-Lips in the macrophages based on phagocytosis effect. And high-intensity zone appeared in the paracortex and medulla of popliteal lymph node. SN-38-Lips were subcutaneously ( s.c.) injected into the right footpad of KM rats in the dose of 4 mg/kg following s.c. injection of 1 , 2 and 5 mg/mL BO suspension. The lymphatic pharmacokinetics were investigated to explore the promotion law of S-BO , and combined with tissue irritation to optimize S-BO concentrations. The results indicated that 2 mg/mL S-BO could reduce injection-site retention , and prolong residence time and increase uptake of lymph nodes , which would not cause inflammatory reaction of injection site. In conclusion , the present study may provide a basic study for improving lymphatic-targeting ability of SN-38-Lips by the S-BO regulation , and to be the helpful guidance for further study in lymphatic targeting of delivery system.
