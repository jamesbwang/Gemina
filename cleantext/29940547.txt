  Accidental or intentional subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of metallic mercury is an uncommon form of intoxication. We present the case of a 22 year-old man , who had psychotic disorders and autoaggressive behavior , with a preceding history of self-injection of mercury into the soft tissues of the neck , thorax and abdomen. Clinical examination , radiographs , and computed tomography showed the affected area. Mercury was measured in blood and urine. The mercury was surgically resected from the affected areas. Early detection and removal of mercury from the body by physical removal or chelation is required to prevent short- and long-term toxicity.
