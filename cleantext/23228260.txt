  This study examined the effects and mechanisms of strontium ranelate ( SrRn)- a drug used to treat osteoporosis-on the proliferation and differentiation/mineralization of cloned dental pulp-like cells ( mouse dental papillae cells; MDPs). It also determined whether topical application of SrRn to exposed dental pulp tissue promotes the formation of mineralized tissue in vivo. The MDPs were cultured with or without SrRn , and cell proliferation , odonto-/ osteoblastic gene expression , mineralized nodule<disease> formation , and Akt phosphorylation were evaluated. The formation of mineralized tissue in SrRn-treated pulp tissue in rat upper first molars was evaluated histologically. The SrRn up-regulated cell proliferation and expression of Alp ( alkaline phosphatase) , Bsp ( bone sialoprotein) , Dmp ( dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein) -1 , Dspp ( dentin sialophosphoprotein) , and Oc ( osteocalcin) in a dose-dependent manner. Mineralized nodule<disease> formation was also enhanced by SrRn. NPS-2143 , a calcium-sensing receptor ( CaSR) antagonist , and siRNA against the CaSR gene blocked SrRn-induced proliferation , odonto-/ osteoblastic gene expression , and mineralized nodule<disease> formation. SrRn induced Akt phosphorylation , and this was blocked by NPS-2143. Topical application of SrRn to exposed rat molar pulps induced the formation of osteodentin-like mineralized tissue. Our study revealed for the first time that SrRn promotes proliferation and odonto-/ osteogenic differentiation/mineralization of MDPs via PI3K/Akt signaling activated by CaSR in vitro; mineralized tissue forms from the dental pulp in vivo.
