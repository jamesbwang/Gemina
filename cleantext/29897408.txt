  Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain `` activity ''. However , the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular , whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics , integration between regions , or both , is unknown. Here , using magnetoencephalography , we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further , in resting-state data , we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled , or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here , we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that , in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability , the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations , and suggest that time-frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.
