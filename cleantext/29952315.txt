  To noninvasively quantify variation in intra-fraction motion of esophageal tumors over the course of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT) using 2D cine-magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) series. Patients treated with nCRT for esophageal cancer underwent six MRI scans. Scans were acquired prior to the start of nCRT , followed by weekly MRI scans during nCRT. Cine-MRI series were acquired in the coronal and sagittal plane ( â‰ˆ 1.6 Hz). To be able to quantify intra-fraction motion over a longer time period , a second cine-MRI series was performed after 10 min. Tumor motion was assessed in cranio-caudal ( CC) , anterior-posterior ( AP) and left-right ( LR) direction. Motion patterns were analyzed for the presence of deep inhales and tumor drift. A total of 232 cine-MRI series of 20 patients were analyzed. The largest tumor motion was found in CC direction , with a mean peak-to-peak motion of 12.7 mm ( standard deviation ( SD) 5.6) , followed by a mean peak-to peak motion in AP direction of 3.8 mm ( SD 2.0) and in LR direction of 2.7 mm ( SD 1.3). The CC intra-fraction tumor motion can differ extensively between and within patients. Deep inhales were present in six of 232 scans ( 3 %). After exclusion of these scans , mean CC peak-to-peak motion was12 .3 mm ( SD 5.2). Correction for tumor drift showed a further reduction to 11.0 mm ( SD 4.6). Despite correction for tumor drift , a large variation in tumor motion occurred within patients during treatment. Mean tumor drift during the 10 min interval between the two series was 1.5 mm ( SD 1.8) , with a maximum of 11.6 mm. Intra-fraction tumor motion was found to be highly variable between and within patients with esophageal cancer over the course of nCRT. Correction for deep inhales and tumor drift reduced peak-to-peak motion. The stochastic nature of both deep inhales and tumor drift indicates that real-time tumor motion management during radiotherapy is a prerequisite to safely reduce treatment margins.
