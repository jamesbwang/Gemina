  An abasic ( AP) site is a ubiquitous DNA lesion<symptom> that is produced via several cellular processes. Although AP sites are cytotoxic and mutagenic , cells are protected from them by different DNA damage tolerance and repair pathways , including base excision repair ( BER). AP lesions<symptom> are alkali-labile , but the half-life for strand scission is several weeks in free DNA at around neutral pH. The AP lifetime is reduced ∼ 100-fold in nucleosome core particles ( NCPs) because the histone proteins promote strand scission. The reactivity of other DNA lesions<symptom> to BER enzymes and exogenous reagents is highly dependent upon rotational positioning within the NCP. We examined strand scission at AP sites as a function of rotational position over approximately one helical turn of DNA. The rate constant for strand scission at AP varies ∼ 4-fold , a range of reactivity much smaller than that observed for processes that involve reaction with diffusible reagents in solution. In addition , the change in rate constant does not exhibit an obvious pattern with respect to rotational position. The small dependence of reactivity on rotational position is attributed to interactions with histone proteins. A molecular model based upon NCP X-ray crystal structures indicates that histone protein tails access AP sites via the major or minor groove and are therefore not limited to regions where one particular groove is exposed to solvent. Determining the roles of individual proteins is difficult because of the unstructured nature of the histone tails and the chemical mechanism , which involves reversible Schiff base formation , followed by irreversible elimination.
