  This study aimed to build on the current clinical findings and investigate physicians ' experiences and level of satisfaction in using insulin degludec/liraglutide ( IDegLira) to treat patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D). This multicountry , European online survey included respondents from primary ( n = 132) and secondary ( n = 103) care and examined physicians ' use , confidence and satisfaction with IDegLira. To standardize responses , 24 of 28 questions pertained to an ` average patient ' with T2D who has no major comorbidities , aged 35-70 years , with average cognitive ability/normal mental<symptom> status<symptom> and body mass index â‰¥ 25 kg/m The majority ( 70 %) of respondents prescribe IDegLira in the same visit they first mention it , with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) ( 44 %) and weight gain ( 22 %) being the most common reasons. On average , physicians reported that patients weighed 95 kg and the HbA1c level was 9.0 % at initiation. Physicians also reported the average HbA1c target set was 7.1 %; 76 % of patients achieved their target. On average , patients achieved their HbA1c target in < 6 months , and the average dose of IDegLira in patients in glycemic control was 28 dose steps. Respondents were more satisfied with IDegLira than basal-bolus therapy across all parameters assessed , including reaching HbA1c targets ( 59 %) , number of injections ( 77 %) and avoiding weight gain ( 84 %). Correspondingly , 77 % of physicians reported that IDegLira had more potential to improve patient motivation compared with basal-bolus to reach target blood glucose levels. Real-world experience of IDegLira is consistent with previous trials/studies , with no major differences between primary and secondary care. Importantly , the majority of respondents were more/much more satisfied with IDegLira than with basal-bolus therapy.
