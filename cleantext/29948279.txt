  To investigate the effects of two disinfection/sterilization methods on the permeability of dentin specimens. Forty intact human third molars were freshly extracted and cut , close to the pulp chamber , into dentin disks with a 500-Î¼m thickness. The disks were randomized ( n = 20 each) into a 70 % ethanol group ( acid-etched dentin disks soaked in 70 % ethanol for 15 min) and a steam autoclaving group ( acid-etched dentin disks autoclaved for 25 min). The permeability ( Lp) of each dentin disk was measured before and after either treatment using a hydraulic device , and intra- and inter-group differences in values before and after treatment were analyzed using t tests. Field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM) micrographs of the dentin surface were acquired and examined. FE-SEM samples were prepared using the critical point drying ( CPD) method. Immersion in 70 % ethanol increased the Lp values of dentin specimens by 17 % , which was not statistically significant. Steam autoclaving significantly reduced dentin permeability by 66 % because the dentin collagen mesh became compact and collapsed , as detected by FE-SEM. The disinfection of acid-etched dentin disks using 70 % ethanol for 15 min does not significantly affect dentin permeability , whereas sterilization of acid-etched dentin disks via autoclaving significantly reduces dentin permeability. Considering the influences of dentin permeability by disinfection/sterilization methods , the disinfection of the acid-etched dentin disks using 70 % ethanol for 15 min could be used for the study related to dentin permeability , while the sterilization of autoclaving could not.
