  Aortic stenosis is accompanied by progressive left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease>. We investigated the natural history of these processes in asymptomatic patients and their potential reversal post-aortic valve replacement ( AVR). Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis underwent repeat echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Changes in peak aortic-jet velocity , left ventricular mass index , diffuse fibrosis<disease> ( indexed extracellular volume) , and replacement fibrosis<disease> ( late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE)) were quantified. In 61 asymptomatic patients ( 43 % mild , 34 % moderate , and 23 % severe aortic stenosis) , significant increases in peak aortic-jet velocity , left ventricular mass index , indexed extracellular volume , and LGE mass were observed after 2.1 ± 0.7 years , with the most rapid progression observed in patients with most severe stenosis. Patients with baseline midwall LGE ( n = 16 ( 26 %); LGE mass , 2.5 g ( 0.8-4.8 g)) demonstrated particularly rapid increases in scar burden ( 78 % ( 50 % -158 %) increase in LGE mass per year). In 38 symptomatic patients ( age , 66 ± 8 years; 76 % men) who underwent AVR , there was a 19 % ( 11 % -25 %) reduction in left ventricular mass index ( In patients with aortic stenosis , cellular hypertrophy and diffuse fibrosis<disease> progress in a rapid and balanced manner but are reversible after AVR. Once established , midwall LGE also accumulates rapidly but is irreversible post valve replacement. Given its adverse long-term prognosis , prompt AVR when midwall LGE is first identified may improve clinical outcomes. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
