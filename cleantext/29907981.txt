  Catalytic conversion of dinitrogen ( N2) into ammonia<pathogen> under ambient conditions represents one of the Holy Grails in sustainable chemistry. However , owning to the kinetically complex and energetically challenging N2 reduction reaction ( NRR) process , NRR electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and high selectivity are rare. In this contribution , as a proof-of-concept , we demonstrate that both the NH3 yield and NH3 faradaic efficiency ( FE) at ambient conditons can be improved by modification of the hematite nanostructure surface. Introducing more oxgygen vancancies to the hematite surface renders improved performance toward NRR , leading to an average NH3 production rate of 0.46 µg · h-1 · cm-2 and a corresponding NH3 FE of 6.04 % at -0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl in 0.10 M KOH electrolyte. The durability of the electrochemical system was also investigated. A surprisingly high average NH3 production rate of 1.45 µg · h-1 · cm-2 and a corresponding NH3 FE of 8.28 % was achieved after the first 1 h chrono-amperometry test. This is among the highest FEs reported so far of non-precious metal based catalysts using a polymer-electrolyte-membrane type cell and much higher than the FEs of precious metal catalysts ( e.g. Ru/C) under comparable reaction conditions. However , the NH3 yield and the NH3 FE dropped to 0.29 µg · h-1 · cm-2 and 2.74 % respectively after 16 h of chrono-amperometry tests , indicating poor durability of the system.
