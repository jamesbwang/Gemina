  Annonaceous acetogenins are a well-established family of natural products with significant bioactivities , especially high cytotoxic and antitumor activities. AA005 is an annonaceous acetogenin mimic that has shown significant cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cell lines , but its in vivo antitumor effects have not been demonstrated so far , and its anticancer mechanisms remain ambiguous. In this study , we investigated the effects of AA005 on human colon cancer cell lines in vivo. Human colon carcinoma cell line SW620 xenograft nude mice were treated with AA005 ( 5 mg/kg/day , i.p.) for 21 days. AA005 administration markedly inhibited the tumor growth via promoting nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor ( AIF) and inducing AIF-dependent cell death. Subsequent studies in human colon carcinoma cell lines SW620 and RKO in vitro revealed that after the colon cancer cells exposed to AA005 , downregulation of a B-cell lymphoma 2 family protein , myeloid cell leukemia-1 ( Mcl-1) , was an early event due to the inhibition of Mcl-1 mRNA level and protein synthesis in a time-dependent manner. Intriguingly , knockdown of Mcl-1 using small interfering RNA markedly accelerated the nuclear translocation of AIF and upregulation of receptor interacting protein-1 , and enhanced AA005-mediated lethality , whereas ectopic expression of Mcl-1 substantially attenuated AA005-mediated lethality in the colon cancer cells. Finally , silencing Mcl-1 expression markedly enhanced AA005-induced lethality in SW620 xenograft nude mice , demonstrating a pivotal role of Mcl-1 downregulation in mediating the in vivo antitumor effects of AA005. Taken together , this study demonstrates for the first time the anticancer effects of AA005 against human colon cancer cell lines in vivo , which is mediated through the downregulation of Mcl-1.
