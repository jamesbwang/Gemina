  Anethole is an ingredient in many flavours , fragrances and pharmaceutical formulations. To reduce the dependence of its supply on natural oils , a green route for anethole synthesis was designed on the basis of Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley ( MPV) reduction and dehydration<symptom> of 4 '- methoxypropiophenone. The one-pot cascade reactions were heterogeneously catalysed by dual-functional Zr-MSU-3 , a predominantly Lewis-acidic catalyst with a Si/Zr ratio of 10 and pores with sizes in the range of 3.2-4.2 nm. The use of 2-pentanol as solvent and hydrogen donor for the MPV reduction was advantageous , as its high boiling point enhances the rate of the reactions , especially the dehydration<symptom> of the MPV product , 1- ( 4-methoxyphenyl)- propan-1-ol. This dispenses with the need for a strong acid catalyst that could result in by-products of acid-catalysed reactions. Anethole yields of 91 % with a trans/cis isomer ratio of about 92:8 , similar to that of natural anethole , were obtained. In comparison , microporous Zr-beta ( Si/Zr 12.5) gave lower activity owing to pore-size constraints. Hence , through design of the reactions and catalyst , 4 '- methoxypropiophenone can be efficiently converted to anethole in a sustainable and green manner.
