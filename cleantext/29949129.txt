  Children with obesity demonstrate increased risk for eating disorders and internalizing psychopathology. Research in adults indicates unique facets of social anxiety<symptom> differentially relate to eating pathology. These associations remain understudied in pediatric samples. The current study evaluated associations between social anxiety<symptom> and disordered eating , and tested the relative importance of distinct social anxiety<symptom> constructs-fear of negative evaluation , social anxiety<symptom> in general situations , and social anxiety<symptom> in new situations-for disordered eating in weight-loss treatment-seeking youth with obesity. One-hundred and thirty-five youth ( M Social anxiety<symptom> subscales did not correlate with Dieting scores. Dominance analyses indicated Fear of Negative Evaluation ( FNE) evinced complete dominance , thus , emerging as the most important predictor relative to other social anxiety<symptom> components for Body/Weight Concern and Food Preoccupation. General dominance weights for FNE accounted for more than twice the shared and unique variance , relative to other independent variables within the Body/Weight Concern and Food Preoccupation models , respectively. Unique facets of social anxiety<symptom> differentially relate to disordered eating in youth with obesity. Findings suggest nuanced assessment of anxiety<symptom> constructs , such as FNE , in pediatric obesity treatment settings may aid in identifying youth at risk for disordered eating attitudes and behaviors.
