  Considerable research from high-income countries has characterized the amount , nature and effects of movie smoking depiction. However , in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) where tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases are growing , little research has investigated smoking imagery in movies. This study examined the extent and nature of smoking portrayal in locally produced Ethiopian movies , and estimated the number of tobacco impressions movies delivered. Sample movies were taken from YouTube. Keyword searches were conducted using ` Ethiopian movies ' and ` Ethiopian drama ' on 18 September 2016. In each search , the first 100 most viewed movies were examined. Excluding repeated results , a total of 123 movies were selected for content analysis. Three coders participated. Results indicated that 86 ( 69.9 % , 95 % CI 63-78 %) of the 123 most viewed movies contain at least one tobacco incident ( TI). The movies depict a total of 403 TIs , with an average of 4.7 ( 95 % CI 3.7-5.6) TIs in each movie. The average length of TIs is 1 min and 11 s. On average , the movies were viewed more than half a million times by September 2016 , and received more ` likes ' than ` dislikes ' , z = -8.05 , p = 0.00. They delivered over 194 million tobacco impressions via YouTube alone from July 2012 through September 2016. Most TIs portray smoking as a socially acceptable behavior with no negative health consequences. The findings suggest that as with transnational Western movies , locally produced movies in LMICs should be scrutinized for compliance with national and international regulatory efforts.
