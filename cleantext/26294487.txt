  Environmental sensors are exploited in smart homes for many purposes. Sensor data inherently carries behavioral information , possibly useful to infer wellness and health-related insights in an indirect fashion. In order to exploit such features , however , powerful analytics are needed to convert raw sensor output into meaningful and accessible knowledge. In this paper , a complete monitoring architecture is presented , including home sensors and cloud-based back-end services. Unsupervised techniques for behavioral data analysis are presented , including: ( i) regression and outlier detection models ( also used as feature extractors for more complex models); ( ii) statistical hypothesis testing frameworks for detecting changes in sensor-detected activities; and ( iii) a clustering process , leveraging deep learning techniques , for extracting complex , multivariate patterns from daily sensor data. Such methods are discussed and evaluated on real-life data , collected within several EU-funded projects. Overall , the presented methods may prove very useful to build effective monitoring services , suitable for practical exploitation in caregiving activities , complementing conventional telemedicine techniques.
