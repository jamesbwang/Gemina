  The objective of this study was to evaluate semen quality and fertility in beef bulls grazing the ergot alkaloid ( EA) producing tall fescue cultivar , Kentucky 31 ( KY31) , compared to a novel endophyte ( NE) cultivar lacking EA. Two studies were conducted over a 3-year period. In studies 1 ( n = 10; ages ≥ 24 mo) and 2 ( n = 53 over two years; ages 12-16 mo) , Angus ( AN) bulls were stratified by body<symptom> weight ( BW) , body condition score ( BCS) , and scrotal circumference ( SC) , and then allotted to graze either KY31 or NE for 56 days. Semen samples were collected , and BW , BCS , and SC were evaluated at the start of treatment ( TRT) on day ( d) 0 and every 28 days to the end of each study. In addition , blood samples were collected on d 0 and every 28 days for assessment of circulating prolactin ( PRL) levels in study 2. On d 56 , for both studies , semen from bulls ( n = 2 per treatment in study 1 and n = 4 per treatment in study 2) with similar and acceptable quality were extended , kept at 19 ° C , and used for timed artificial insemination ( TAI) of primi- and multiparous AN and AN- crossbred females. Pregnancy was evaluated at 35 and 90 days post-TAI via transrectal ultrasonography to determine pregnancy rates. Serum PRL concentrations showed a TRT by d effect ( P ≤ 0.05) , with values for bulls grazing KY31 decreased on d 28 and d 56 of grazing compared to NE. In studies 1 and 2 , bull BW and BCS were affected by d ( P ≤ 0.05) , but not by TRT. No TRT or TRT by d effect on semen quality was observed in either study; however , d impacted both velocity and concentration in study 2 ( P ≤ 0.05). In study 1 , TAI pregnancy rates at 35 days post-TAI were lower ( P ≤ 0.05) in the group inseminated with semen from bulls grazing KY31; however , in study 2 , pregnancy rates did not differ due to treatment 35 post-TAI ( P > 0.05). Grazing KY31 negatively impacted serum PRL concentrations , supporting previous observations; however , consumption of KY31 had no effect on growth or semen quality of AN bulls ranging from 12 to ≥ 24 mo of age. Furthermore , fertility data is inconsistent between studies and requires further investigation.
