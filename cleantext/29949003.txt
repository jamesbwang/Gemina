  Prior studies of patients in the intensive care unit have suggested racial/ethnic variation in end-of-life decision making. We sought to evaluate whether race/ethnicity modifies the implementation of comfort measures only status ( CMOs) in patients with spontaneous , non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH). We analyzed data from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage<symptom> ( ERICH) study , a prospective cohort study specifically designed to enroll equal numbers of white , black , and Hispanic subjects. ICH patients aged â‰¥ 18 years were enrolled in ERICH at 42 hospitals in the USA from 2010 to 2015. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were implemented to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and CMOs after adjustment for potential confounders. A total of 2705 ICH cases ( 912 black , 893 Hispanic , 900 white) were included in this study ( mean age 62 ( SD 14) , female sex 1119 ( 41 %)). CMOs patients comprised 276 ( 10 %) of the entire cohort; of these , 64 ( 7 %) were black , 79 ( 9 %) Hispanic , and 133 ( 15 %) white ( univariate p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis , compared to whites , blacks were half as likely to be made CMOs ( OR 0.50 , 95 % CI 0.34-0.75; p = 0.001) , and no statistically significant difference was observed for Hispanics. All three racial/ethnic groups had similar mortality rates at discharge ( whites 12 % , blacks 9 % , and Hispanics 10 %; p = 0.108). Other factors independently associated with CMOs included age ( p < 0.001) , premorbid modified Rankin Scale ( p < 0.001) , dementia ( p = 0.008) , admission Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale ( p = 0.009) , hematoma volume ( p < 0.001) , intraventricular hematoma volume ( p < 0.001) , lobar ( p = 0.032) and brainstem ( p < 0.001) location and endotracheal intubation ( p < 0.001). In ICH , black patients are less likely than white patients to have CMOs. However , in-hospital mortality is similar across all racial/ethnic groups. Further investigation is warranted to better understand the causes and implications of racial disparities in CMO decisions.
