  To explore the potential of albumin nanoparticles for oral drug delivery. Sub-150 nm human serum albumin nanoparticles were fabricated via a desolvation technique. Nanoparticle cell uptake and epithelial translocation were tested in Caco-2 monolayers , while comparing with albumin solution. Data suggest epithelial transcytosis of albumin , applied in solution form , via neonatal Fc receptor. Cell uptake of albumin nanoparticles demonstrated behaviors indicating a different cell uptake pathway compared with albumin solution. Importantly , application of equivalent concentrations of albumin solution or nanoparticles resulted in higher epithelial transport capacity of the latter , suggesting improvement of intestinal delivery via nanoformulation. This study highlights for the first time that simply fabricated , nontoxic human serum albumin nanoparticles may find application in oral drug delivery.
