  Dogs play a pivotal role in the transmission of cystic echinococcosis ( CE) , a zoonosis caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus<pathogen>. We showed previously that dogs vaccinated with two E. granulosus<pathogen> adult-worm specific proteins , EgM9 and EgM123 , emulsified with Freund 's adjuvants induced significant protective efficacy in terms of reduction in worm burden and egg production after 45 days post-infection. It was not known whether this protection can be sustained using adjuvants suitable for use in dogs. Recombinant EgM9 and EgM123 were mixed with Quil A or ISCOMs for vaccinating dogs. After three vaccine injections , all the dogs were orally challenge-infected with 200000 protoscoleces of E. granulosus<pathogen>. After 45 days of infection , all the dogs were euthanized and necropsied for collecting and counting E. granulosus worms. Immunoglobins , including the IgG subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 , were detected in the sera of vaccinated dogs by ELISA. To determine whether the protection efficacy could be maintained after 45 days post-infection , we implemented a longevity trial to count eggs in dog faeces for 170 days after infection. The dogs vaccinated with EgM9 and EgM123 mixed with Quil A and ISCOMs showed similar protective efficacy as the proteins emulsified with Freund 's adjuvants in our previous study in terms of reduction of worms and eggs at 45 days post-infection. The longevity trial showed that EgM9 protein-vaccinated group released lower number of eggs per gram compared with the egg counts in the control dogs during the dog trial study. EgM9 and EgM123 are thus suitable vaccine candidates against E. granulosus<pathogen> infection in dogs.
