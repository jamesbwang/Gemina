  Systematic evaluation of the metabolism , distribution , and effect of thiamethoxam in Mongolian racerunner ( Eremias argus) was carried out after oral exposure. HPLC equipped with Q Exactive focus was used for identification and concentration analysis of thiamethoxam and its metabolites. Percutaneous and urine excretions were the primary ways for the elimination of thiamethoxam and its metabolites , and the limiting factor was urine output. Demethylated thiamethoxam and clothianidin were the main metabolites of thiamethoxam in lizards. CYP3A4 , CYP3A7 , and CYP2C9 played a crucial role in the metabolism process. Aldehyde oxidase only dominated the nitro-reduction process of demethylated thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Glutathione S-transferase might be related to the clearance process of thiamethoxam and its metabolites. The findings indicated that thiamethoxam might pose potential carcinogenic and hepatic injury risk to lizards. The results enrich and supplement the knowledge of the environmental fate of thiamethoxam in reptiles.
