  Mobile markets are an increasingly popular method for providing access to fresh fruits and vegetables ( F/V) in underserved communities; however , evaluation of these programs is limited , as are descriptions of their development , study designs , and needs of the populations they serve. Our aim was to describe the development and theoretical basis for Veggie Van ( VV) , a mobile produce market intervention , the study design for the VV evaluation , and baseline characteristics of the study population. The protocol and sample for a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 12 sites are described. Community partner organizations in the Triangle region of North Carolina that primarily served lower-income families or were located in areas that had limited access to fresh produce were recruited. Eligible individuals at each site ( older than 18 years of age , self-identified as the main shoppers for their household , and expressed interest in using a mobile market) were targeted for enrollment. A total of 201 participants at 12 sites participated in the VV program and evaluation , which was implemented from November 2013 to March 2016. Change in F/V intake ( cups/day) , derived from self-reported responses to the National Cancer Institute F/V screener , was the main outcome measure. We performed a descriptive analysis of baseline sample characteristics. Mean reported F/V intake was 3.4 cups/day. Participants reported generally having some access to fresh F/V , and 57.7 % agreed they could afford enough F/V to feed their family. The most frequently cited barriers were cost ( 55.7 %) and time to prepare F/V ( 20.4 %). Self-efficacy was lowest for buying more F/V than usual and trying new vegetables. By addressing cost and convenience and building skills for purchasing and preparing F/V , the VV has the potential to improve F/V consumption in underserved communities.
