  Evidence suggests a relevant role for liver and mitochondrial dysfunction in allergic disease. However , the role of hepatic mitochondrial function in food allergy is largely unknown. We aimed to investigate hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in a murine model of peanut allergy. Three-week-old C3H/HeOuJ mice were sensitized by the oral route with peanut-extract ( PNT). We investigated: 1. the occurrence of effective sensitization to PNT by analysing acute allergic skin<symptom> response<symptom> , anaphylactic symptoms score , body temperature , serum mucosal mast cell protease-1 ( mMCP-1) and anti-PNT immunoglobulin E ( IgE) levels; 2. hepatic involvement by analysing interleukin ( IL) -4 , IL-5 , IL-13 , IL-10 and IFN- & gamma; mRNA expression; 3. hepatic mitochondrial oxidation rates and efficiency by polarography , and hydrogen peroxide ( H ₂ O ₂) yield , aconitase and superoxide dysmutase activities by spectrophotometry. Sensitization to PNT was demonstrated by acute allergic skin<symptom> response<symptom> , anaphylactic symptoms score , body temperature decrease , serum mMCP-1 and anti-peanut IgE levels. Liver involvement was demonstrated by a significant increase of hepatic Th2 cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-5 and IL-13) mRNA expression. Mitochondrial dysfunction was demonstrated by lower state 3 respiration<symptom> rate in the presence of succinate , decreased fatty acid oxidation in the presence of palmitoyl-carnitine , increased yield of ROS proven by the inactivation of aconitase enzyme and higher H ₂ O ₂ mitochondrial release. We provide evidence of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in a murine model of peanut allergy. These data could open the way to the identification of new mitochondrial targets for innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies against food allergy.
