  Dentin dysplasia ( DD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder associated with disturbance of the dentin. While the crowns appear clinically normal , on radiography , the pulp spaces appear partially or completely obliterated , with short blunted roots , and multiple periapical radiolucencies affecting the apparently sound teeth. Clinical signs include spontaneous abscess<disease> formation or increased tooth mobility which can lead to exfoliation. DD can therefore have a significant impact on the patient 's dentition , and treatment is often challenging. Shields ' classification of dentin disorders has been recently criticised for failing to consider differential variations and expressions of these disorders. This paper describes a case of a 23-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed DD , who presented with clinical and histological features belonging to several of these diseases , thus highlighting the potential diagnostic challenges faced with Shields ' classification.
