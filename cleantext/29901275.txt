  My concern in this presentation is with the falling standard of papers , particularly primary research articles , in the scientific and medical literature. Few of our younger generation of scientists ( and many older ones) have never had specific training in how to write a good paper , and yet this is the major product of all research effort that has been done , perhaps over a year or more. This is a situation that has to be corrected by all institutions , universities and similar bodies , who need to introduce into the curriculum a course ( not just a token lecture) that deals with the complexity of writing a lucid paper that is succinct and written with style. To assist in this exercise , I have now produced a manual ( 1) that goes step-by-step through the process of writing and publishing scientific papers in such a way that they have a much greater chance of being accepted by learned journals.
