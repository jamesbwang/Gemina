  Several studies have shown that signaling via the interleukin 23 ( IL23) receptor is required for development of colitis<disease>. We studied the roles of IL23 , dietary factors , alterations to the microbiota , and T cells in development and progression of colitis<disease> in mice. All mice were maintained on lab diet 5053 , unless otherwise noted. We generated mice that express IL23 in CX3CR1-positive myeloid cells ( R23FR mice) upon cyclic administration of tamoxifen dissolved in diet 2019. Diet 2019 and 5053 have minor differences in the overall composition of protein , fat , fiber , minerals , and vitamins. CX3CR1 Expression of IL23 led to development of a relapsing-remitting colitis<disease> that was dependent on the microbiota and CD4 We developed mice that express IL23 in CX3CR1-positive myeloid cells ( R23FR mice) and found they are more susceptible to diet-induced colitis<disease> than mice that do not express IL23. The R23FR mice have a population of CD4
