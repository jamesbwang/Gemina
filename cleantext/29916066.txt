  In contrast to a one-level cervical corpectomy , a multilevel corpectomy without posterior fusion is accompanied by a high material failure rate. So far , the adequate surgical technique for patients , who receive a two-level corpectomy , remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term clinical outcome of patients with cervical myelopathy , who underwent a two-level corpectomy. Outcome parameters of 21 patients , who received a two-level cervical corpectomy , were retrospectively analyzed concerning reoperations and outcome scores ( VAS , Neck Disability Index ( NDI) , Nurick scale , modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score ( mJOAS) , Short Form 36-item Health Survey Questionnaire ( SF-36)). The failure rate was determined using postoperative radiographs. The choice over the surgical procedures was exercised by every surgeon individually. Therefore , a distinction between two groups was possible: ( 1) anterior group ( ANT group) with a two-level corpectomy and a cervical plate , ( 2) anterior/posterior group ( A/P group) with two-level corpectomy , cervical plate , and additional posterior fusion. Both groups benefitted from surgery concerning pain , disability , and myelopathy. While all patients of the A/P group showed no postoperative instability , one third of the patients of the ANT group exhibited instability and clinical deterioration. Thus , a revision surgery with secondary posterior fusion was needed. Furthermore , the ANT group had worse myelopathy scores ( mJOAS
