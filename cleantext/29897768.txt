  A novel Ru ( II)- catalyzed C-H activation and annulation reaction of N-arylpyrazol-5-ones and diaryl/arylalkyl-substituted alkynes is developed. Unlike the reported metal-catalyzed C-H activation and annulation reactions , in the present bidentate amine-ligand controlled C-H activation and annulation reaction , the annulation occurs via a 1,2-aryl shift to afford quaternary carbon-centered pyrimidoindolones.
