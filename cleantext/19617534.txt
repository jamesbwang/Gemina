  Aurora A kinase ( AURKA) is a major regulator of mitosis and an important driver of cancer progression. The roles of AURKA outside of mitosis , and how these might contribute to cancer progression , are not well understood. Here , we show that a fraction of cytoplasmic AURKA is associated with mitochondria , co-fractionating in cell extracts and interacting with mitochondrial proteins by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. We have also found that the dynamics of the mitochondrial network are sensitive to AURKA inhibition , depletion or overexpression. This can account for the different mitochondrial morphologies observed in RPE-1 and U2OS cell lines , which show very different levels of expression of AURKA. We identify the mitochondrial fraction of AURKA as influencing mitochondrial morphology , because an N-terminally truncated version of the kinase that does not localize to mitochondria does not affect the mitochondrial network. We identify a cryptic mitochondrial targeting sequence in the AURKA N-terminus and discuss how alternative conformations of the protein may influence its cytoplasmic fate.
