  The yeast Malassezia<pathogen> pachydermatis<pathogen> is a common commensal and occasional opportunistic pathogen of theskin microbiota of animals and humans. In this study , the susceptibility of M.<pathogen> pachydermatis<pathogen> isolates to fluconazole ( FLC) , itraconazole ( ITZ) , ketoconazole ( KTZ) , clotrimazole ( CLZ) , and miconazole ( MCZ) alone and in combination with terbinafine ( TRB) , nystatin ( NYS) , and caspofungin ( CSP) was evaluated in vitro based on the M27-A3 technique and the checkerboard microdilution method using Sabouraud dextrose broth with 1 % tween 80 ( SDB). Based on the mean FICI values , the main synergies observed were combinations of ITZ+CSP and CLZ+CSP ( 55.17 %). The most significant combinations deserve in vivo evaluations because might provide effective alternative treatments against M.<pathogen> pachydermatis<pathogen> due to their synergistic interactions.
