  To assess human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) knowledge and vaccine awareness , intention , and uptake among adult inmates in Kansas jails. We administered a survey with questions adapted from the US National Cancer Institute 's Health Information National Trends Survey to 571 adult inmates in 3 Kansas jails from October 10 to 12 , 2016 , and January 25 to 27 , 2017 , to assess HPV<pathogen> knowledge and vaccine awareness , intention , and uptake. Although most adults across demographic groups recognized HPV<pathogen> as causing cervical cancer , knowledge was lower about other HPV-related cancers. Vaccine awareness was higher for women ( 70 %) than men ( 41 %). Only 8 % of age-eligible men reported ever receiving the vaccine. Most adults across demographic groups reported `` definitely '' wanting to get the vaccine if offered in jail at no cost. Low uptake of HPV<pathogen> vaccine and high interest in receiving the vaccine in jails may indicate that vaccination availability for jail populations needs to be reexamined. Public Health Implications. Expanding HPV<pathogen> vaccine programs or partnerships to facilitate vaccine provision in jails could increase inmates ' knowledge of and intention to receive vital health services.
