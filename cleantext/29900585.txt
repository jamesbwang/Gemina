  The levels of neurohormones were assessed in continuous-flow left ventricular assist device ( CF-LVAD) recipients and compared to patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) and to healthy controls ( HCs) , and CF-LVAD recipients with closed or open aortic valves ( AVs). Aldosterone , norepinephrine , and renin levels were assessed in a total of 46 participants , including CF-LVAD recipients ( n = 18) , HF patients ( n = 14) , and HC individuals ( n = 14). Echocardiographic assessments were performed to evaluate cardiac functions and aortic valve status and neurohormone levels were compared between CF-LVAD recipients with closed or open AVs. Aldosterone , norepinephrine , and renin levels were elevated to a similar extent in CF-LVAD recipients and HF patients , compared to HC individuals. In the CF-LVAD group , no differences were found between the levels of norepinephrine and aldosterone between recipients with AV opened or closed. With an open AVs , CF-LVAD recipients had higher levels of renin compared to recipients with closed AVs. However , an open AV was only a weak predictor of higher levels of renin. The findings that aldosterone , norepinephrine , and renin were elevated after restoration of hemodynamic functions during LVAD support suggest that the levels of neurohormones did not normalize. Future studies should investigate whether AV status in CF-LVAD recipients affects the levels of RAAS neurohormones and the mechanisms and clinical implications of elevated levels of neurohormones in CF-LVAD patients.
