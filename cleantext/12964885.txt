  The carbon-carbon triple bond (- C ≡ C-) is an elementary constituent for the construction of conjugated molecular wires and carbon allotropes such as carbyne and graphyne. Here we describe a general approach to in situ synthesize- C ≡ C- bond on Cu ( 111) surface via homo-coupling of the trichloromethyl groups , enabling the fabrication of individual and arrays of poly ( p-phenylene ethynylene) molecular wires. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a delocalized electronic state extending along these molecular wires , whose structure is unraveled by atomically resolved images of scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy. Combined with density functional theory calculations , we identify the intermediates formed in the sequential dechlorination process , including surface-bound benzyl , carbene , and carbyne radicals. Our method overcomes the limitation of previous on-surface syntheses of- C ≡ C- incorporated systems , which require the precursors containing alkyne group; it therefore allows for a more flexible design and fabrication of molecular architectures with tailored properties.
