  Synthesis , characterization , and applications of strongly fluorescent , multicolored protein nanoparticles ( GlowDots) are reported here. Bovine serum albumin was cross-linked under controlled conditions to form nanoparticles , where particle size was controlled from 20 to 100 ± 10 nm by choosing appropriate reaction conditions. The absorption as well as the emission wavelengths were controlled without changing the particle size , unlike quantum dots. Each GlowDot was loaded with up to 214 ± 50 chromophores , and hence , the particles have high molar absorptivities ( 10
