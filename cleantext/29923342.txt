  In recent years , nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials have attracted a great deal of attention due to their unique and potentially useful features. In this review , several representative types of nanocellulose and modification methods for antimicrobial applications are mainly focused on. Recent literature related with the preparation and applications of nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials is reviewed. The fabrication of nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials for wound<disease> dressings , drug carriers , and packaging materials is the focus of the research. The most important additives employed in the preparation of nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials are presented , such as antibiotics , metal , and metal oxide nanoparticles , as well as chitosan. These nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials can benefit many applications including wound<disease> dressings , drug carriers , and packaging materials. Finally , the challenges of industrial production and potentials for development of nanocellulose-based antimicrobial materials are discussed.
