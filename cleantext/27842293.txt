  This study investigated the effectiveness of Water Safety Plans ( WSP) implemented in 99 water supply systems across 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. An impact assessment methodology including 36 indicators was developed based on a conceptual framework proposed by the Center for Disease Control ( CDC) and before/after data were collected between November 2014 and June 2016. WSPs were associated with infrastructure improvements at the vast majority ( 82) of participating sites and to increased financial support at 37 sites. In addition , significant changes were observed in operations and management practices , number of water safety-related meetings , unaccounted-for water , water quality testing activities , and monitoring of consumer satisfaction. However , the study also revealed challenges in the implementation of WSPs , including financial constraints and insufficient capacity. Finally , this study provided an opportunity to test the impact assessment methodology itself , and a series of recommendations are made to improve the approach ( indicators , study design , data collection methods) for evaluating WSPs.
