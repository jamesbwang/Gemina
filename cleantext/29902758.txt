  The viewpoint that radial oxygen loss ( ROL) of submerged macrophytes induces changes in redox conditions and the associated phosphorus ( P) availability has been indirectly confirmed at larger spatial scales using conventional , destructive techniques. However , critical information about microniches has largely been overlooked due to the lack of satisfactory in situ mapping technologies. In this study , we deployed a recently developed hybrid sensor in the rhizosphere of Vallisneria spiralis ( V. spiralis) during two vegetation periods to provide 2-D imaging of the spatiotemporal co-distribution of oxygen ( O
