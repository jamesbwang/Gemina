  In this study , a compound of 532.24 Da named BF-4 was separated from the ribose-tryptophan Maillard reaction products by solvent extraction and purified through reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified compound BF-4 was identified as 3- ( ( 1 H-indol-3-yl) methyl) -8- ( 5- ( ( 1 H-indol-3-yl) methyl) -6-oxomorpholin-2-yl) -9-hydroxy-1,7,4-dioxazecan-2-one in accordance with 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. BF-4 significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide ( NO) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α) in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. It inhibited nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) phosphorylation through suppressing phosphorylation of IκBα , P65 , P38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK). The anti-inflammatory activity of BF-4 was comparable to dexamethasone , and more importantly , BF-4 showed less cytotoxicity than dexamethasone on the normal human liver cell LO2. The results indicate that BF-4 is a promising anti-inflammatory agent with pharmaceutical potential.
