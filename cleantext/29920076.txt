  The conventional synthesis of metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) through soluble metal-salt precursors provides little control over the growth of MOF crystals. The use of alternative metal precursors would provide a more flexible and cost-effective strategy for direction- and shape-controlled MOF synthesis. Here , we demonstrate for the first time the use of insoluble metal-carbon matrices to foster directed growth of MOFs. Aluminum carbide was implemented as both the metal precursor and growth-directing agent for the generation of MIL-53 ( Al). A unique needle-like morphology of the MOF was grown parallel to the bulk surface in a layer-by-layer manner. Importantly , the synthesis scheme was found to be transferrable to the production of different linker analogues of the MOF and other topologies. Given the variety of metal carbides available , these findings can be used as a blueprint for controlled , efficient , and economical MOF syntheses and set a new milestone toward the industrial use of MOFs at large-scale.
