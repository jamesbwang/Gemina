  In situ heart valve tissue engineering using cell-free synthetic , biodegradable scaffolds is under development as a clinically attractive approach to create living valves right inside the heart of a patient. In this approach , a valve-shaped porous scaffold `` implant '' is rapidly populated by endogenous cells that initiate neo-tissue formation in pace with scaffold degradation. While this may constitute a cost-effective procedure , compatible with regulatory and clinical standards worldwide , the new technology heavily relies on the development of advanced biomaterials , the processing thereof into ( minimally invasive deliverable) scaffolds , and the interaction of such materials with endogenous cells and neo-tissue under hemodynamic conditions. Despite the first positive preclinical results and the initiation of a small-scale clinical trial by commercial parties , in situ tissue formation is not well understood. In addition , it remains to be determined whether the resulting neo-tissue can grow with the body and preserves functional homeostasis throughout life. More important yet , it is still unknown if and how in situ tissue formation can be controlled under conditions of genetic or acquired disease. Here , we discuss the recent advances of material-based in situ heart valve tissue engineering and highlight the most critical issues that remain before clinical application can be expected. We argue that a combination of basic science- unveiling the mechanisms of the human body<symptom> to respond to the implanted biomaterial under ( patho) physiological conditions- and technological advancements- relating to the development of next generation materials and the prediction of in situ tissue growth and adaptation- is essential to take the next step towards a realistic and rewarding translation of in situ heart valve tissue engineering.
