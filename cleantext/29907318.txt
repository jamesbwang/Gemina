  The present study aims to test if the environmental conditions prevailing during the growing period can determine the physiological profiles of specimens differentiated as fast ( F) or slow ( S) growers in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. We reared mussel spats in the laboratory under two different conditions. In Treatment I ( continuous feeding during discontinuous immersion) , two mussel groups were submitted to a daily air exposure of 8 h and fed continuously during immersion-time , with either high-quality food dosed below the pseudofaeces threshold ( BP group) or low organic content food dosed above the pseudofaeces threshold ( AP group). In Treatment II ( discontinuous feeding during continuous immersion) , mussels were continuously immersed but fed only 1 day per week ( RC group). Mussels were reared for 7 and 11 months ( time required for size-differentiation) in Treatments I and II , respectively , and the smallest and largest individuals from each group were selected as S and F specimens. A series of feeding experiments ( with different food quality , food ration and under continuous food supply) were performed to analyse the physiological performance of selected F and S mussels. In Treatment I , no significant differences were found in the metabolic rates between F and S mussels , and the faster growth rate of F-mussels resulted from their capacity to display higher clearance-ingestion rates and pre-ingestive selections. The physiological basis of growth rate differences between F and S mussels were found to be the same in mussels reared with diets below or above a pseudofaeces threshold ( F
