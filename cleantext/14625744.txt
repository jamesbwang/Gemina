  Image-guided navigation is an effective intra-operative technology in select surgical sub-specialties. Laparoscopic and open lymph node biopsy are frequently undertaken to obtain adequate tissue of difficult lesions<symptom>. Image-guided navigation may positively augment the precision and success of surgical lymph node biopsies. In this prospective pilot study , pre-operative imaging was uploaded into the navigation platform software , which superimposed the imaging and the subject 's real-time anatomy. This required anatomical landmarks on the subject 's body<symptom> to be spatially registered with the platform using an infrared camera. This was then used to guide dissection and biopsy in laparoscopic and subcutaneous biopsies. Image-guided lymph node biopsy was undertaken in 15 cases. Successful biopsy locations included: retroperitoneum , porta hepatis , mesentery , iliac region , para-aortic , axilla , and inguinal region. There was an 87 % total absolute success rate in biopsies ( 89 % in laparoscopic image-guided navigation ( LIGN) and 83 % in subcutaneous image-guided navigation ( SIGN)). There was a 92 % absolute success rate in lesions<symptom> with fixed locations. There was a 67 % absolute success rate in lesions<symptom> with mobile locations. The investigators successfully incorporated image-guidance into surgical biopsy of lymph nodes in a diverse variety of locations. This image-guided technique for surgical biopsy can accurately and safely localize target lesions<symptom> minimizing unnecessary dissection , conversion to open procedure , and re-operation for further tissue characterization. This technique was useful in the morbidly obese , instances of limited foci of disease , PET-active lesions<symptom> , identifying areas of highest PET-avidity , and lesions<symptom> with critical surrounding anatomy.
