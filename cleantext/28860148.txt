  Airway fibrin casts are clinically important complications of severe inhalational smoke-induced acute lung injury ( ISIALI) for which reliable evidence-based therapy is lacking. Nebulized anticoagulants or a tissue plasminogen activator; tPA , has been advocated , but airway bleeding is a known and lethal potential complication. We posited that nebulized delivery of single chain urokinase plasminogen activator , scuPA , is well-tolerated and improves physiologic outcomes in ISIALI. To test this hypothesis , we nebulized scuPA or tPA and delivered these agents every 4 h to sheep with cotton smoke induced ISIALI that were ventilated by either adaptive pressure ventilation/controlled mandatory ventilation ( APVcmv; Group 1 , n = 14) or synchronized controlled mandatory ventilation ( SCMV)/ limited suctioning; Group 2 , n = 32). Physiologic readouts of acute lung injury included arterial blood gas analyses , PaO In Group 1 , tPA at the 2 mg dose was ineffective , but at 4 mg tPA or scuPA , the PaO Physiologic outcomes improved in sheep in which better delivery of the PAs occurred. The benefits of nebulized scuPA were achieved without airway bleeding associated with tPA , but were transient and largely abrogated at 48 h , in part attributable to the progression and severity of ISIALI.
