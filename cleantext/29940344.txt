  Currently there is a lack of consensus on the possible adverse health effects of E-cigarettes ( ECs). Important factors including cell model employed and exposure method determine the physiological relevance of EC studies. The present study aimed to evaluate EC cytotoxicity using a physiologically relevant in-vitro multicellular model of human airways. Human bronchial epithelial cells ( CALU-3) and pulmonary fibroblasts ( MRC-5) were co-cultured at air-liquid-interface for 11-14 days post which they were exposed to whole cigarette smoke ( WCS) or EC vapour ( ECV) at standard ISO-3308 regime for 7 m using a bespoke aerosol delivery system. ECV effects were further investigated at higher exposure times ( 1 h-6 h). Results showed that while WCS significantly reduced cell viability after 7 m , ECV decreased cell viability only at exposure times higher than 3 h. Furthermore , ECV caused elevated IL-6 and IL-8 production despite reduced cell viability. ECV exposure also produced a marked increase in oxidative stress. Finally , WCS but not ECV exposure induced caspase 3/7 activation , suggesting a caspase independent death of ECV exposed cells. Overall , our results indicate that prolonged ECV exposure ( â‰¥ 3 h) has a significant impact on pro-inflammatory mediators ' production , oxidative stress and cell viability but not caspase 3/7 activity.
