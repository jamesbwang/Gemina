  We examined associations of 5 plasma choline metabolites with carotid plaque among 520 HIV-infected and 217 HIV-uninfected participants ( 112 incident plaque cases) over 7 years. After multivariable adjustment , higher gut microbiota-related metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO) was associated with an increased risk of carotid plaque in HIV-infected participants ( risk ratio = 1.25 ( 95 % CI , 1.05-1.50) per standard deviation increment; P = 0.01). TMAO was positively correlated with biomarkers of monocyte activation and inflammation<symptom> ( sCD14 , sCD163). Further adjustment for these biomarkers attenuated the association between TMAO and carotid plaque ( P = 0.08). Among HIV-infected individuals , plasma TMAO was associated with carotid atherosclerosis progression , partially through immune activation and
