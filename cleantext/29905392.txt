  Human cholesteatoma perimatrix fibroblasts ( hCPFs) can stimulate the endothelial cells of nearby microvessels to proliferate and migrate in a paracrine manner. Exosomes , secreted from various cell types , are one of the most important paracrine factors and play critical roles in intercellular communication. However , whether exosomes derived from human cholesteatoma perimatrix fibroblasts ( hCPFs-Exo) can promote angiogenesis has not been reported. In this study , we isolated exosomes secreted by hCPFs and observed that hCPFs-Exo was able to promote migration and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs). Advanced studies revealed hCPFs-Exo with low expression of miR-106b-5p was transferred into HUVECs , and decreased expression of miR-106b-5p could promote angiogenesis by targeting Angiopoietin 2 ( Angpt2) via binding to its 3 '- UTR. Furthermore , low levels of miR-106b-5p triggered overexpression of Angpt2 , and significantly increased HUVEC migration and tube formation. Taken together , our results suggest that hCPFs-Exo transports low expressed exosomal miR-106b-5p to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis by overexpression of Angpt2.
