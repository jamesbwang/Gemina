  A novel multiparameter brain sensor ( MPBS) allows the simultaneous measurement of brain tissue oxygenation ( ptiO The study group consisted of 17 juvenile male pigs. Four MPBS and four reference probes were implanted per pig and compared simultaneously. The measured parameters were challenged by standardized provocations such as hyperoxia , dobutamine , and norepinephrine application , hypercapnia and hypoxia in combination with and without a controlled cortical impact ( CCI) injury. Mean values over 2 min were collected for predefined time points and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. The protocol was successfully conducted in 15 pigs of which seven received CCI. ICP and ptiO The MPBS is a promising measurement tool for multiparameter neuromonitoring. The conducted study demonstrates the in vivo functionality of the probe. Comparison with standard probes revealed a deviation which is mostly analogous to other multiparameter devices. However , further evaluation of the device is necessary before it can reliably be used for clinical decision making.
