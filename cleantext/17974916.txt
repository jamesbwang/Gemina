  Phosphorylation-dependent YAP translocation is a well-known intracellular mechanism of the Hippo pathway; however , the molecular effectors governing YAP cytoplasmic translocation remains undefined. Recent findings indicate that oncogenic YAP paradoxically suppresses Wnt activity. Here , we show that Wnt scaffolding protein Dishevelled ( DVL) is responsible for cytosolic translocation of phosphorylated YAP. Mutational inactivation of the nuclear export signal embedded in DVL leads to nuclear YAP retention , with an increase in TEAD transcriptional activity. DVL is also required for YAP subcellular localization induced by E-cadherin , Î±-catenin , or AMPK activation. Importantly , the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is dependent on the p53-Lats2 or LKB1-AMPK tumor suppressor axes , which determine YAP phosphorylation status. In vivo and clinical data support that the loss of p53 or LKB1 relieves DVL-linked reciprocal inhibition between the Wnt and nuclear YAP activity. Our observations provide mechanistic insights into controlled proliferation coupled with epithelial polarity during development and human cancer.
