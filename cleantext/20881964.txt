  Most human genes contain multiple introns , necessitating mechanisms to effectively define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions , but how these work together is unclear. We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. U1 subcomplex bound to the 5 ' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5 ' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3 ' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5 ' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5 ' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.
