  Autophagy is a common process during development. Abnormal autophagy can impact cell apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that apoptosis is present during bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD). However , there is no consensus on the level of coexisting autophagy. This study was designed to investigate the role of autophagy and the effects of autophagy inducers in a BPD model. A total of 100 newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to model and control groups. BPD models were established by hyperoxic induction ( FiO As compared to the control group , more autophagic bodies were found within Type II alveolar epithelial cells ( AT-II cells) under transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) in the model group at 3 d. These autophagic bodies were also accompanied by apoptotic bodies and expression of both bodies peaked at 7 d. As shown by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL) , there were more apoptotic cells in the model group than in the control group. Protein expression levels of LC3B-II , p62 , Lamp1 , and cleaved Caspase-3 increased with increased hyperoxic exposure time. No significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression levels of LC3B , p62 , and Lamp1. After introducing an autophagy inducer , either rapamycin or lithium chloride , the radial alveolar count ( RAC) value of BPD model group increased as compared with placebo group , the thickness of alveolar septum decreased , while apoptosis decreased. Reduced autophagy resulting from blocked autophagy flow may be a key link in the pathogenesis of BPD. By enhancing repressed autophagy , apoptosis could be reduced and alveolar development improved.
