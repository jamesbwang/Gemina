  In classic examinations of the representativeness heuristic , Kahneman and Tversky ( 1973) presented adult participants with a description of an individual who fit their stereotype of a typical engineer. Importantly , even when participants were told that the individual was drawn from a sample of 70 lawyers and 30 engineers , they estimated that the individual was an engineer at very high levels , showing that they relied almost exclusively on the personality description. Relying on the representativeness heuristic can lead to base-rate neglect and , thus , biased judgments. Two experiments provide insight into the development of the representativeness heuristic in young children using an adaptation of the classic lawyer-engineer problem. Experiment 1 ( N = 96) established that 3- to 5-year-olds can use base-rate information on its own , and 4- and 5-year-olds can use individuating information on its own , to make inferences. Experiment 2 ( N = 192) varied the relevance of the individuating information across conditions to assess the pervasiveness of this bias early in development. Here 5- and 6-year-olds , much like adults , continue to attempt to rely on individuating information when making classifications even if that information is irrelevant. Together , these experiments reveal how the representativeness heuristic develops across the preschool years and suggest that the bias may strengthen between 4 and 6 years of age.
