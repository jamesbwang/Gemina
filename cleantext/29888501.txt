  Human telomeres can form DNA G-quadruplex ( G4) , an attractive target for anticancer drugs. Human telomeric G4s bear inherent structure polymorphism , challenging for understanding specific recognition by ligands or proteins. Protoberberines are medicinal natural-products known to stabilize telomeric G4s and inhibit telomerase. Here we report epiberberine ( EPI) specifically recognizes the hybrid-2 telomeric G4 predominant in physiologically relevant K
