  This paper reports a versatile template-free method based on the hydrogen reduction of metallic salts for the synthesis of nanoporous Ni and alloys. The approach involves thermal decomposition and reduction of metallic precursors followed with metal cluster nucleation and ligament growth. Topological disordered porous architectures of metals with a controllable distribution of pore size and ligament size ranging from tens of nanometers to micrometers are synthesized. The reduction processes are scrutinized through X-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy , and transmission electron microscopy. The formation mechanism of the nanoporous metal is qualitatively explained. The as-prepared nanoporous Ni was tested as binder-free current collectors for nickel oxalate anodes of lithium ion batteries. The nanoporous Ni electrodes deliver enhanced reversible capacities and cyclic performances compared with commercial Ni foam. It is confirmed that this synthesis method has versatility not only because it is suitable for different types of metallic salts precursors but also for various other metals and alloys.
