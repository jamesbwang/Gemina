  Specialist training is based on the gradual acquisition of expertise , skills and responsibilities. The aim of this study is to determine the opinion of residents regarding their training. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study based on an online survey of 5th-year residents during February and March 2017. A total of 194 residents ( 62.8 % of the total) responded to the survey , 62.9 % of whom were women and 50 % of whom were younger than 30 years , representing hospitals from all levels and from the 17 autonomous communities. More than 80 % of the residents choose the specialty once again and believed that the duration of the residence was appropriate; however , 76.3 % would eliminate some of their rotations. Most of the residents did not know the objectives of each rotation , and 37.1 % felt they were not adequately supervised. Some 82.5 % would change the evaluation system , and 68.0 % would favour performing an excellence test. Most of the residents had published at least one article or performed one presentation at a congress; however , only 27.8 % had completed a doctoral thesis. Although 74.7 % of the internists believed they would find employment , only 28.4 % had an offer 1 month after completing their residence. The residents are satisfied with their training , although there is still a deficit in supervision and dissatisfaction with the method of assessing their knowledge and the precarious job market during the first year for specialists.
