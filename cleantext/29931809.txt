  To determine differences in coronary plaque composition and inflammatory biomarkers between men and women with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes without known cardiovascular disease. A total of 88 people with newly diagnosed ( < 1 year) Type 2 diabetes underwent contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography. Advanced coronary plaque analysis was performed using semi-automated software. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers were determined. There were no significant differences between men ( n = 60) and women ( n = 28) regarding age or cardiovascular risk factors ( all P > 0.05). The median ( quartiles) serum levels of fibrinogen ( 10.9 ( 9.8-12.6) μmol/l vs 9.7 ( 8.8-10.9) μmol/l) , fibrin d-dimer ( 0.3 ( 0.2-0.4) mg/l vs 0.27 ( 0.2-0.4) mg/l) and C-reactive protein ( 3.1 ( 1.1-5.2) mg/l vs ( 0.8-2.6) 1.6 mg/l) were significantly higher in women ( all P < 0.05). Overall , men more often had multi-vessel involvement ( 28 men ( 47 %) vs 4 women ( 14 %)) , and higher total plaque burden ( median ( quartiles) 11.6 ( 2.3-36.0) % vs 2.0 ( 0.4-5.4) %; both P < 0.05). The median ( quartiles) total plaque volume ( 269.9 ( 62.6-641.9) mm In people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes , women had lower absolute coronary plaque volumes but a more unfavourable plaque composition and enhanced systemic inflammation<symptom> compared with men.
