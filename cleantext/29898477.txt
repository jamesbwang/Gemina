  The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of syringomyelia in clinically unaffected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels ( CKCS) in Germany. From 2006 to 2016 a total of 339 asymptomatic CKCSs from all over Germany were included. Age ranged from 3 months to 11 years ( mean 3.72 years Â± 2.17 years). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the head and cervical spine were obtained. Overall , 163 out of 339 ( 48.1 %) CKCSs showed evidence of syringomyelia. The results ( odds ratio of 1.27 per year; p < 0.0001) corroborate the findings of other studies , in which the risk of developing syringomyelia increases with age. In conclusion , around half of the dogs within the German CKCS population are affected by syringomyelia. The prevalence of syringomyelia of the German CKCS population is similar to that of the British CKCS population , which is subjected to breeding strategies on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging investigations.
