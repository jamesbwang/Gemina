  Most investigations to date aiming to identify the genetic basis of the stress response of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) have focused on the response to single stress agents such as high temperature or drought , even though in the natural situation , these stresses tend often to occur together. Here , a panel of 108 spring type bread wheat cultivars was phenotyped for 15 yield and yield related traits for two years ( 2014/15 and 2015/16) under non-stressed conditions , under high temperature stress , under drought and under a combined high temperature and drought regime. The mean loss in grain yield caused by all stress regimes was 51.33 %. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA) of yield trait showed significant differences among genotypes environments and their interactions ( G × E). All the studied traits had higher heritability values which ranged from 0.35-0.94 under ( C) , 0.58-0.95 under ( D) , 0.62-0.93 under ( H) and 0.60-0.95 under ( HD). GWAS was performed by using 9,646 informative SNP markers and based on these polymorphic SNPs population structure analysis divided whole germplasm into five major sub-populations. Mixed model association analysis detected 503 marker-trait associations ( MTAs) at P ≤ 0.001 while 329 MTAs crossed FDR ≤ 0.05 for all traits with phenotypic variances ( R2) ranged from 24.83 % to 12.51 %. Seven new pleiotropic SNPs on chromosome 7D and IAAV8258 ( 86.91 cM) and wsnp_Ex_c7168_12311649 ( 57.93 cM) on chromosome 5A were most stable association in present study. Furthermore , candidate genes Psy and Sr25 ( TG0040) were also significant in present study , these genes were previously mapped on 7A and 7D. The region on 7D was assiociated with 7DL .7 Ag translocation from Lophopyrum carring rust resistance Yr16 and many other genes. Similarly region on chromosome 7A which was associated with Psy gene was linked with grain yellow pigment content QTLs. Favourable alleles controlling grain yield were of vital importance and incorporation of these alleles after validation through marker assisted selection and fine mapping could be helpful in wheat yield improvement stress and non-stress conditions.
