  The medical treatment options for patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD) are limited and patients resistant to those therapies are left requiring surgical operations that usually only achieve some symptomatic relief. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) have been shown to be effective for the treatment of CD , and we have demonstrated in animal experiments that human amnion-derived MSCs ( AMSC) are a potential new therapeutic strategy. Therefore , we designed this study to investigate the safety and efficacy of AMSCs in patients with treatment-resistant CD. This is the protocol for an ongoing phase I/II , dual-centre , open-label , uncontrolled , dose-response study. The estimated enrolment is 6-12 patients with treatment-resistant , moderate CD. A dose of 1.0 Ã— 10 The Institutional Review Board of Hokkaido University Hospital approved this study protocol ( approval number H29-6). A report releasing study results will be submitted to an appropriate journal. This study is the first to investigate the safety and efficacy of AMSC use for CD treatment. Our results will advance studies on more efficient and convenient methods to overcome the limits of available CD treatments. UMIN000029841.
