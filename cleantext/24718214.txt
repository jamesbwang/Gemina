  A novel kind of fiber optic ultrasonic sensor based on matching fiber Bragg gratings ( FBGs) is proposed and demonstrated. The sensors consist of a pair of matching FBGs fixed to a special bracket. The bracket plays a role in stretching and squeezing the FBGs , with the push ‚Åª pull effect efficiently coupling the ultrasonic signal to the sensor , thus , improving the sensor & rsquo; s sensitivity. Side-band filtering technology-based intensity interrogation was used to detect ultrasounds in water. With the synergic effect of the matching FBGs , the sensor performed with a high signal-to-noise ratio ( 56.9 dB at 300 KHz , 53 dB at 1 MHz and 31.8 dB at 5 MHz) and the observed ultrasonic sinusoidal signals were undistorted and distinguishable in the time domain.
