  Amphiphilic cyclodextrins ( aCDs) are an intriguing class of carrier systems which , recently , have been proposed to deliver porphyrinoids and anticancer drugs or combined dose of both for dual therapeutic applications. The design of nanoassemblies based on aCD and photosensitizers ( PSs) aims to preserve the photodynamic therapy ( PDT) efficacy of PS , reducing the tendency of PS to self-aggregate , without affecting the quantum yield of singlet oxygen (
