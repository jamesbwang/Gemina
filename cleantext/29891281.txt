  Nano-fibrillated cellulose ( NFC) is of interest in several fields due to its unique physical properties derived from its nanoscale dimensions. NFC has potential use in food systems as a dietary fiber that increases viscosity and limit diffusion of glucose. This study focused on the effects of added NFC on solution viscosity , starch digestion and glucose absorption. NFC did not affect α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity , but significantly retarded glucose diffusion , delayed amylolysis and reduced the amount of glucose released during in vitro digestion of starch. Specifically , 1 % NFC retarded ∼ 26.6 % of glucose released during the amylolysis process. The greatly increased viscosity of NFC at concentrations > 0.5 % was thought to be the main mechanism for its potential hypoglycemic effects. NFC suspensions also had higher glucose adsorption capacity than those containing cellulose. In addition , NFC bound 35.6 % of the glucose when the initial glucose level was within the range of 5-200 mM. These results suggest that NFC may be useful for building viscosity in food products and serving to inhibit glucose absorption in vivo in starch-containing products.
