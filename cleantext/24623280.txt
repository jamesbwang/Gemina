  Cardiomyocyte proliferation stops at birth when the heart is no longer exposed to maternal blood and , likewise , to regulatory T cells ( Tregs) that are expanded to promote maternal tolerance towards the fetus. Here , we report a role of Tregs in promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation. Treg-conditioned medium promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation , similar to the serum from pregnant animals. Proliferative cardiomyocytes are detected in the heart of pregnant mothers , and Treg depletion during pregnancy decreases both maternal and fetal cardiomyocyte proliferation. Treg depletion after myocardial infarction results in depressed cardiac function , massive inflammation<symptom> , and scarce collagen deposition. In contrast , Treg injection reduces infarct size , preserves contractility , and increases the number of proliferating cardiomyocytes. The overexpression of six factors secreted by Tregs ( Cst7 , Tnfsf11 , Il33 , Fgl2 , Matn2 , and Igf2) reproduces the therapeutic effect. In conclusion , Tregs promote fetal and maternal cardiomyocyte proliferation in a paracrine manner and improve the outcome of myocardial infarction.
