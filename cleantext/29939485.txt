  The GACKIX activator-binding domain has been a compelling target for small molecule probe discovery because of the central role activator-GACKIX complexes play in diseases ranging from leukemia<disease> to memory disorders. Additionally , GACKIX is an ideal model to dissect the context-dependent function of activator-coactivator complexes. However , the dynamic and transient PPIs formed by GACKIX are difficult targets for small molecules. An additional complication is that activator-binding motifs such as GACKIX are found in multiple coactivators , making specificity difficult to attain. In this study , we demonstrate that the strategy of Tethering can be used to rapidly discover highly specific covalent modulators of the dynamic PPIs between activators and coactivators. These serve as both orthosteric and allosteric modulators , enabling the tunable assembly or disassembly of the activator-coactivator complexes formed between the KIX domain and its cognate activator binding partners MLL and CREB. The molecules maintain their function and selectivity even in human cell lysates and in bacterial cells and thus will ultimately be useful probes for cellular studies.
