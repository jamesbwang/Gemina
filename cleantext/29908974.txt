  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) after open aortic repair is subject to multiple patient- and operation-related variables. Hostile neck morphology in open aneurysm<disease> repair is thought to contribute to this AKI risk postoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate if large neck atheroma is a possible risk factor in the postoperative development of AKI. Retrospectively 137 patients were evaluated for neck atheroma and AKI incidence. Atheroma load measurements were performed by 2 different techniques. Results were compared , and secondly a univariate analysis was performed for multiple additional risk factors regarding AKI occurrence. Significant ( > 30 %) neck atheroma was not associated with a higher risk for developing AKI ( odds ratio ( OR): 1.81; 95 % confidence intervals: 0.74-4.44). Overall incidence of AKI based upon Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria was 19.7 %. In univariate analysis coronary artery disease and the presence of a renal artery stenosis were both significantly associated with AKI ( OR: 2.38 , 3.31 , respectively) as well as the use of B-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( OR 3.05 , 2.48 , respectively). Cross-clamping in case of significant neck atheroma during open aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair is not associated with increased risk of AKI. Defining high-risk patients based on additional risk factors must be a part of preoperative patient selection.
