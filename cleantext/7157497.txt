  Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors ( SLCT) represent < 2 % of primary ovarian tumors , which range from benign to malignant; majority of the latter are low-grade. We present the case of a 12-year-old pre-pubertal female with poorly differentiated SLCT and heterologous rhabdomyosarcoma ( FIGO stage-IA). She presented with worsening abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , pelvic mass , and elevated pre-operative serum Alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP , 77.1 ng/mL). She underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , and lymphadenectomy. The high-risk histology warranted 4-cycles of adjuvant BEP chemotherapy. There was no clinical evidence of recurrence at the 20-month follow-up. High-grade sex cord-stromal tumors are rare , present with low-stage disease , and have good progression-free survival following chemotherapy. Rarity of these tumors poses challenges in their diagnosis and treatment. Review of literature suggests that the presented case is youngest patient with dedifferentiated SLCT.
