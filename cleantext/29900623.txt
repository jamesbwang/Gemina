  Gender and age patterns of drinking are important in guiding country responses to harmful use of alcohol. This study undertook cross-country analysis of drinking across gender , age groups in some high-and middle-income countries. Surveys of drinkers were conducted in Australia , England , Scotland , New Zealand , St Kitts and Nevis ( high-income) , Thailand , South Africa , Mongolia and Vietnam ( middle-income) as part of the International Alcohol Control Study. Drinking pattern measures were high-frequency , heavier-typical quantity and higher-risk drinking. Differences in the drinking patterns across age and gender groups were calculated. Logistic regression models were applied including a measure of country-level income. Percentages of high-frequency , heavier-typical quantity and higher-risk drinking were greater among men than in women in all countries. Older age was associated with drinking more frequently but smaller typical quantities especially in high-income countries. Middle-income countries overall showed less frequent but heavier typical quantities; however , the lower frequencies meant the percentages of higher risk drinkers were lower overall compared with high-income countries ( with the exception of South Africa). High-frequency drinking was greater in high-income countries , particularly in older age groups. Middle-income countries overall showed less frequent drinking but heavier typical quantities. As alcohol use becomes more normalised as a result of the expansion of commercial alcohol it is likely frequency of drinking will increase with a likelihood of greater numbers drinking at higher risk levels.
