  Novel heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by impregnation of titania with a solution of cobalt acetate/melamine and subsequent pyrolysis. The resulting materials show an unusual nitrogen-modified titanium structure through partial implementation of nitrogen into the support. The optimal catalyst displayed good activity and selectivity for challenging pyridine hydrogenation under acid free conditions in water as solvent.
