  This study included 51 osteoporosis patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) who were treated with anti-resorption drug , denosumab. To date , there has been no report on the changes of bone-related minerals after anti-resorption drug therapy. Fifty one osteoporotic patients with RA were retrospectively enrolled. Serum Zinc ( Zn) , Magnesium ( Mg) , Iron ( Fe) , and Copper ( Cu) were examined at 1 week , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 months. Lumbar spine ( L1-4) bone mineral density ( L-BMD) , and bilateral total hip BMD ( H-BMD) were examined before and at 6 and 12 months after treatment commencement. Serum Fe gradually increased except at 4 and 10 months , and significantly increased at 12 months. Serum Mg slightly decreased at 1 week and 1 month , then increased up to 4 months , then gradually decreased to 8 months , then increased thereafter. Serum Zn significantly increased at every time point except at 1 week during the period. Serum Cu increased during the period but slightly decreased at 2 , 8 , and 12 months. L-BMD as well as H-BMD significantly increased at 12 months ( 5.1 % and 5.1 % , respectively). Denosumab might be a good option to improve bone-related minerals in OP patients with RA even without dietary supplement. Serum Fe and Mg values became approximately within normal range after the therapy. On the other hand , serum Zn significantly increased for 12 months , however , the Zn values showed still low status after the treatment. Thus , Zn supplementation and/or nutrition education are basically required for OP patients with RA , even though denosumab increases serum Zn level.
