  The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiologic outcomes using a newly developed device for maxillary sinus membrane elevation. Patients with a residual bone height of at least 3 mm were enrolled. Crestal sinus lift elevation and sinus graft were performed using the crestal approach sinus ( CAS) kit. Graft was avoided if the residual bone crest was ≤ 2 mm less than the length of the planned implant. Outcome measures were implant and prosthesis failure , any biologic or technical complications , and marginal bone loss ( MBL). A total of 35 consecutive patients underwent 49 crestal elevations of the sinus membrane. All the implants were followed for at least 2 years after placement ( mean follow-up 37.3 months; range 24 to 54 months). No implants or prostheses failed during follow-up , and no membrane tears or other intraoperative or postoperative adverse events were observed. At the 2-year follow-up , mean MBL was 0.33 ± 0.24 mm ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.08 to 0.30 mm). A total of 32 implants were placed after filling the sinus with anorganic bovine bone , while 17 implants were placed without grafting the sinus. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the sinus grafting remodeling index ( SGRI) to evaluate radiographically the tissue remodeling patterns. The SGRI was statistically significantly higher when the sinus was grafted ( P = .000). The CAS kit may provide a new option for minimally invasive crestal sinus surgery. Long-term randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are needed to confirm these preliminary results.
