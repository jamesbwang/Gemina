  In 2002 , Ken Poss discovered that zebrafish , at that time an emerging vertebrate model organism in basic research , were able to regenerate their heart upon resection of the ventricular apex. This finding set in motion a new field of research on heart regeneration , which has recently expanded in other model organisms including mammals. We interviewed Ken Poss to find out more about his motivation and vision for the future of tissue regeneration research.
