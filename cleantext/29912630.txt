  Previous research suggests that labelling emotions , or describing affective states using emotion words , facilitates emotion regulation. But how much labelling promotes emotion regulation? And which emotion regulation strategies does emotion labelling promote? Drawing on cognitive theories of emotion , we predicted that labelling emotions using fewer words would be less confusing and would facilitate forms of emotion regulation requiring more cognitively demanding processing of context. Participants ( N = 82) mentally immersed themselves in an emotional vignette , were randomly assigned to an exhaustive or minimal emotion labelling manipulation , and then completed an emotion regulation strategy planning task. Minimal ( vs. exhaustive) emotion labelling promoted higher subjective emotional clarity. Furthermore , in terms of specific emotion regulation strategies , minimal emotion labelling prompted more plans for problem solving and marginally more plans for reappraisal , but did not affect plans for behavioural activation or social support seeking. We discuss implications for the cognitive mechanisms supporting the generation of emotion regulation strategies.
