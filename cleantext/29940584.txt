  Coronary microembolization ( CME) is a common complication of acute coronary syndrome<symptom> ( ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI); Myocardial inflammation<symptom> , caused by CME , is the main cause of cardiac injury. TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling plays an important role in the development of myocardial inflammation<symptom> , but its effects on CME remain unclear. To assess the cardiac protective effects of TAK-242 ( TLR4 specific inhibitor) on CME-induced myocardial injury , and explore the underlying mechanism. Cardiac function , serum c-troponin I level , microinfarct were examined by cardiac ultrasound , myocardial enzyme assessment , HBFP staining. The levels of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway were detected by ELISA , qRT-PCR and western blot. The results showed inflammatory responses in the myocardium after CME , with increased expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-18. Meanwhile , TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome were involved in the inflammatory process. TAK-242 administration before CME effectively inhibited the inflammatory response in the rat myocardium after CME and reduced myocardial injury , mainly by inhibiting TLR4/ MyD88/NF-κB signaling and reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition , in vitro assays with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes further confirmed that TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling was significantly activated in the inflammatory response of LPS-induced cardiomyocytes , via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Inhibition of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling resulted in increased survival of cardiomyocytes mainly by reducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling participates in the inflammatory response of the myocardium after CME , activating the NLRP3 inflammasome , promoting the inflammatory cascade , and aggravating myocardial injury. Blocking TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling may help reduce myocardial injury and improve cardiac function after CME.
