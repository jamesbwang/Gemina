  Understanding where and how young black men who have sex with men ( YBMSM) in the southern United States meet their sexual partners is germane to understanding the underlying factors contributing to the ongoing HIV<pathogen> transmission in this community. Men who have sex with men ( MSM) commonly use geosocial networking apps to meet sexual partners. However , there is a lack of literature exploring geosocial networking app use in this particular population. Our aim was to examine the characteristics , preferences , and behaviors of a geographically diverse sample of geosocial networking app-using YBMSM in the southern United States. Data were collected from a sample of 75 YBMSM across three cities ( Gulfport , Mississippi; Jackson , Mississippi; and New Orleans , Louisiana). Multiple aspects of geosocial networking app use were assessed , including overall app use , age of participant at first app use , specific apps used , reasons for app use , photos presented on apps , logon times and duration , number of messages sent and received , and characteristics of and behaviors with partners met on apps. Survey measures of app-met partner and sexual behavior characteristics assessed at midpoint ( Day 7) and completion visits ( Day 14) were compared using McNemar 's test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition , we assessed activity spaces derived from GPS devices that participants wore for 2 weeks. Of the 70 participants who responded to the overall app-use item , almost three-quarters ( 53/70 , 76 %) had ever used geosocial networking apps. Jack 'd was the most commonly used geosocial networking app ( 37/53 , 70 %) , followed by Adam4Adam ( 22/53 , 42 %) , and Grindr ( 19/53 , 36 %). The mean and median number of apps used were 4.3 ( SD 2.7) and 4.0 ( range 0-13) , respectively. Most app-using participants displayed their face on the profile picture ( 35/52 , 67 %) , whereas fewer displayed their bare legs ( 2/52 , 4 %) or bare buttocks ( or ass; 2/52 , 4 %). The mean age at the initiation of app use was 20.1 years ( SD 2.78) ranging from 13-26 years. Two-thirds ( 35/53 , 66 %) of the sample reported using the apps to `` kill time '' when bored. A minority ( 9/53 , 17 %) reported using the apps to meet people to have sex/hook up with. The vast majority of participants reported meeting black partners for sex. Over two-thirds ( 36/53 , 68 %) reported that the HIV<pathogen> status of their app-met partners was negative , and 26 % ( 14/53) reported that they did not know their partner 's HIV<pathogen> status. There was a significant difference in GPS activity spaces between app using YBMSM compared to nonapp using YBMSM ( 2719.54 km Use of geosocial networking apps to meet sexual partners among our sample of YBMSM in the southern United States was common , with a diverse range of app use behaviors being reported. Further research should characterize the association between geosocial networking app use and engagement in sexual behaviors that increase risk for HIV<pathogen> acquisition and transmission. In addition , geosocial networking apps present a promising platform for HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions targeting YBMSM who use these apps.
