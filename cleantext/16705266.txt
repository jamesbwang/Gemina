  In this paper various types of electrodes for stimulation and recording activity of peripheral nerves for the control of neuroprosthetic limbs are reviewed. First , an overview of interface devices for ( feedback-) controlled movement of a prosthetic device is given , after which the focus is on peripheral nervous system ( PNS) electrodes. Important electrode properties , i.e. , longevity and spatial resolution , are defined based upon the usability for neuroprostheses. The cuff electrode , longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes ( LIFE) , transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode ( TIME) , Utah slanted electrode array ( USEA) , and the regenerative electrode are discussed and assessed on their longevity and spatial resolution. The cuff electrode seems to be a promising electrode for the control of neuroprostheses in the near future , because it shows the best longevity and good spatial resolution and it has been used on human subjects in multiple studies. The other electrodes may be promising in the future , but further research on their longevity and spatial resolution is needed. A more quantitatively uniform study protocol used for all electrodes would allow for a proper comparison of recording and stimulation performance. For example , the discussed electrodes could be compared in a large
