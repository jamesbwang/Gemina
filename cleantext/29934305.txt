  Leishmania<pathogen> species are intracellular protozoan pathogens that have evolved to successfully infect and deactivate host macrophages. How this deactivation is brought about is not completely understood. Recently , microRNAs ( miRNAs) have emerged as ubiquitous regulators of macrophage gene expression that contribute to shaping the immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Conversely , several pathogens have evolved the ability to exploit host miRNA expression in order to manipulate host cell phenotype. However , very little is known about the mechanisms used by intracellular pathogens to drive changes in host cell miRNA abundance. Using miRNA expression profiling of Leishmania<pathogen> donovani-infected human macrophages , we show here that leishmania<pathogen> infection induced a genome-wide down-regulation of host miRNAs. This repression occurred at the level of miRNA gene transcription , as the synthesis rates of primary miRNAs were significantly decreased in infected cells. MiRNA repression depended on the host macrophage transcription factor c-Myc. Indeed , the expression of host c-Myc was markedly up-regulated by leishmania<pathogen> infection , and c-Myc silencing reversed the miRNA suppression. Furthermore , c-Myc silencing significantly reduced intracellular survival of leishmania<pathogen> , demonstrating that c-Myc is essential for leishmania<pathogen> pathogenesis. Taken together , these findings identify c-Myc not only as being responsible for miRNA repression in leishmania-infected macrophages , but also as a novel and essential virulence factor by proxy that promotes leishmania<pathogen> survival.
