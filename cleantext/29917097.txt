  Studies have demonstrated that statin therapy decreases the growth rate of abdominal aneurysms<disease>. However , the effect of statin therapy on the proximal aortic disease has not been sufficiently elucidated. We aimed to analyze the association between statin treatment and the severity of proximal aortopathy in patients with aortic valve disease. Cross-sectional study. We prospectively identified 458 patients who were referred for aortic valve surgery from 2008 to 2014. Preoperative measurement of the proximal aorta was performed by TEE , CT or MRT scan. Data of dyslipidemia treatment was obtained by questionnaire. The mean ascending aortic diameter in the whole study population was comparable in patients with vs. without statin therapy ( i.e. , 42.7 mm vs. 43.6 mm , p = 0.46). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association between statin therapy and proximal aortopathy â‰¥ 40 mm in the whole study group ( OR = 0.69 , p = 0.10). For the BAV subgroup , HDL ( OR = 0.54 , p = 0.038) and cholesterol levels ( OR = 2.00 , p = 0.038) were found significantly associated with the proximal aortic disease. In the BAV cohort , the statin users with target HDL levels presented a significantly smaller proximal aortic diameter ( 40.1 mm vs. 46 mm , p = 0.02). Preoperative statin therapy demonstrated no significant association with the expression of proximal aortopathy. However , more than 40 % of the statin users presented uncontrolled lipid levels at the time of the study. In the BAV subgroup , the statins users with target HDL levels showed a significantly smaller ascending aorta diameter. Target HDL and cholesterol levels were strongly associated with proximal aortic dilation in BAV patients.
