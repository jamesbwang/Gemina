  Bladder cancer ( BC) has become a serious health prob-lem and represents the second most commonly diagnosed urological tumor. Curcumin is a principal active natural component of turmeric and has long been used in Asia as a traditional herbal medicine. Curcumin suppresses cell growth in various types of cancer , including BC , by regulating numerous molecular signaling pathways. The human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 ( Trop2) belongs to the tumor-associated calcium signal transducer gene family. Trop2 has been described as a cancer driver and is deregulated in various types of cancer. However , whether Trop2 is involved in curcumin-induced BC cell inhibition remains to be elucidated. The present study hypothesized that Trop2 may be a promising target of curcumin in BC cells. It was found that Trop2 was closely involved in curcumin-induced cell proliferation suppression , mobility inhibition , apoptosis , and cell cycle arrest in BC cells. Curcumin decreased the expression of Trop2 and its downstream target cyclin E1 , and increased the level of p27. The overexpression of Trop2 enhanced the oncogenic activity of BC cells , whereas downregulation of the expression of Trop2 suppressed cell proliferation and mobility , increased apoptosis , and sensitized BC cells to curcumin treatment. Therefore , Trop2 may be a promising target of curcumin in BC cells and the inhibition of Trop2 may be an important method for the therapeutic management of patients with BC.
