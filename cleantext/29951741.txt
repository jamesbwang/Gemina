  Tissue engineering-based regenerative applications can involve the use of stem cells for the treatment of non-healing wounds<disease> Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells have become a focus of skin injury treatments along with many other injury types owing to their unprecedented advantages. However , there are certain limitations concerning the solo use of stem cells in skin wound<disease> repair. Natural bioactive extracellular matrix-based scaffolds have great potential for overcoming these limitations by supporting the regenerative activity and localization of stem cells. This chapter describes the use of bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells together with decellularized bovine small intestinal submucosa ( SIS) , for the treatment of a critical-sized full-thickness skin defect in a small animal model.
