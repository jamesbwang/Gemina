  Substrate-controlled reactions have been developed for the synthesis of spirocyclopropylpyrazolones and bicyclic 4,5-dihydropyrazoles from 1,2-diaza-1,3-dienes and sulfur ylides. These protocols were carried out under mild reaction conditions without any additives in generally moderate to good yields. Plausible mechanisms for the transformations were proposed.
