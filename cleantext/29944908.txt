  Gratitude has been shown to reduce economic impatience. In particular , individuals induced to experience heightened gratitude are more willing to choose delayed larger rewards over immediate smaller rewards ( i.e. , they have lower discounting rates) than those in a neutral condition. Using the event-related potential ( ERP) method , we investigated the relation between gratitude level and neurophysiological correlates. Of interest was motivated information processing , as indexed by the P3 component. Participants were administered a gratitude or a neutral mood induction followed by a temporal discounting task ( choosing between a fixed immediate reward versus a future reward that varied across trials) while electroencephalogram ( EEG) activity was recorded. Individuals in the gratitude condition had greater P3 amplitude , suggesting greater attention to the future-reward option ( the choice option that varied across trials) , even when this option was not selected , and providing the first evidence of gratitude-induced changes in electrophysiological activity.
