  The diaphragm is a mammalian skeletal muscle that plays a fundamental role in the process of respiration<symptom>. Alteration of its mechanical properties due to a diaphragmatic hernia contributes towards compromising its respiratory functions , leading to the need for surgical intervention to restore the physiological conditions by means of implants. This study aims to assess via numerical modeling biomechanical differences between a diaphragm in healthy conditions and a herniated diaphragm surgically repaired with a polymeric implant , in a mouse model. Finite Element models of healthy and repaired diaphragms are developed from diagnostic images and anatomical samples. The mechanical response of the diaphragmatic tendon is described by assuming an isotropic hyperelastic model. A similar constitutive model is used to define the mechanical behavior of the polymeric implant , while the muscular tissue is modeled by means of a three-element Hill 's model , specifically adapted to mouse muscle fibers. The Finite Element Analysis is addressed to simulate diaphragmatic contraction in the eupnea condition , allowing the evaluation of diaphragm deformation in healthy and herniated-repaired conditions. The polymeric implant reduces diaphragm excursion compared to healthy conditions. This explains the possible alteration in the mechanical functionality of the repaired diaphragm. Looking to the surgical treatment of diaphragmatic hernia in human neonatal subjects , this study suggests the implementation of alternative approaches based on the use of biological implants.
