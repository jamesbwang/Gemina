  Growing evidence suggests that social identities may have profound implications for physical activity participation. Real-world examinations of this relationship have , however , been lacking , with research predominantly examining intentions and hypothetical scenarios. To address this shortcoming and further advance understanding in this area , the present study tested relationships between group identification , participation , two exercise-specific outcomes ( exercise-specific satisfaction and group cohesion) , and a broad health indicator ( life satisfaction) among individuals recruited from parkrun. Participants ( N = 289) completed questionnaires measuring all variables except participants ' parkrun participation , which was objectively assessed. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that group identification was significantly associated with greater participation , exercise-specific satisfaction , group cohesion , and life satisfaction. Findings provide real-world evidence of the health-related benefits associated with forming strong social identities in exercise settings.
