  Fluorine plays more and more important roles in drug design and development. In recent years , fluorine-containing organic drugs have already been applied in a broad range of therapeutic areas. Herein , we report our attempt to introduce an axial fluorine ligand to Pt ( IV) complexes by oxidizing oxaliplatin with electrophilic fluorinating reagents in different protic solvents. The crystal structure of one representative complex is presented. The fluorinated Pt ( IV) complexes are further expanded by functionalization with different anhydrides , and their analogues bearing one different axial ligand ( OAc or OH group) are also synthesized. Further investigations show that the axial fluorine atom has dramatic effects on the chemical properties of these prodrugs. These new fluorinated Pt ( IV) complexes are proved to be stable in physiological conditions. For most of the fluorinated Pt ( IV) complexes , a higher reduction potential indicates its greater tendency to be reduced by ascorbate. Introducing an axial fluorine ligand in Pt ( IV) complexes does not lead to the increase of their lipophilicity. Moreover , these new fluorinated Pt ( IV) complexes show better cytotoxicity than nonfluorinated analogues which may derive from their higher cellular accumulation in cancer cells. Therefore , the good stability and high cytotoxicity of these fluorinated Pt ( IV) prodrugs indicate their great potential as a building block for further functionalization.
