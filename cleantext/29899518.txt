  The second messenger cyclic diguanylate ( c-di-GMP) is ubiquitously used by bacteria to modulate and shift between different phenotypes including motility , biofilm formation and virulence. Here we show that c-di-GMP-associated genes are widespread on plasmids and that enzymes that synthesize or degrade c-di-GMP are preferentially encoded on transmissible plasmids. Additionally , expression of enzymes that synthesize c-di-GMP was found to increase both biofilm formation and , interestingly , conjugative plasmid transfer rates.
