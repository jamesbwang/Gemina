  Porcine galectin-3 ( GAL3) is a 29-kDa protein encoded by a single gene , LGALS3 , located on chromosome 1. Here , using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library from porcine alveolar macrophage cells ( PAMs) , we report for the first time that GAL3 interacts with nonstructural protein 12 ( Nsp12) of the porcine reproductive and respiratory<disease> syndrome<disease> virus ( PRRSV). Although extensive research has focused on porcine reproductive and respiratory<disease> syndrome<disease> ( PRRS) , little is known about the pathogen and host interactions involving individual nonstructural viral proteins , especially Nsp12. Here , we showed that GAL3 interacted with viral Nsp12 following co-transfection of HEK293 cells with GAL3- and Nsp12-expressing plasmids. Additionally , we observed that PPRSV infection led to reduced GAL3 levels during the late phase of infection in both MARC-145 cells and PAMs. Importantly , GAL3 overexpression significantly suppressed the replication of both type 1 and 2 PRRSV strains , whereas knockout of endogenous LGALS3 in MARC-145 cells significantly increased viral titer and expression of the nucleocapsid protein. These results strongly support a direct inhibitory effect of GAL3 on PRRSV replication , which might contribute to an overall antiviral effect. Furthermore , our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of the role Nsp12 plays in PRRSV pathogenesis.
