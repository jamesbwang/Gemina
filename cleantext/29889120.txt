  We describe qualitative and quantitative development and preliminary validation of the Patient Assessment for Low Back Pain- Impacts ( PAL-I) , a patient-reported outcome measure for use in chronic low back pain ( cLBP) clinical trials. Concept elicitation and cognitive interviews ( qualitative methods) were used to identify and refine symptom concepts. Classical test theory and Rasch measurement theory ( quantitative methods) were used to evaluate item-level and scale-level performance of the PAL-I using an iterative approach between qualitative and quantitative methods. cLBP patients participated in concept elicitation interviews ( N = 43) , cognitive interviews ( N = 38) , and assessment of paper-to-electronic format equivalence ( N = 8). A web-based sample of self-reported cLBP patients participated in quantitative studies to evaluate preliminary ( N = 598) and revised ( n = 401) drafts and patients with physician-diagnosed cLBP ( N = 45) participated in preliminary validation of the PAL-I. The instrument contained 9 items describing cLBP impacts ( walking , sitting , standing , lifting , sleep , social activities , travelling , climbing , body<symptom> movements<symptom>). Item-level performance , scale structure , and scoring appeared to be appropriate. One-week test-retest reproducibility was acceptable ( intraclass correlation coefficient 0.88 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.78-0.94). Convergent validity was demonstrated with PAL-I total score and Roland Morris Disability questionnaire ( Pearson correlation 0.82) , MOS-36 Physical Functioning ( -0.71) , and MOS-36 Bodily Pain ( -0.71). Individual item scores and total score discriminated between NRS tertile groups and painDETECT categories. Interpretation of paper and electronic administration modes were equivalent. The PAL-I demonstrated content validity and is potentially useful to assess treatment benefit in clinical trials of cLBP therapies.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
