  Adolescents with excess weight suffer social stress more frequently than their peers with normal weight. To examine the impact of social stress , specifically negative social evaluation , on executive functions in adolescents with excess weight. We also examined associations between subjective stress , autonomic reactivity , and executive functioning. Sixty adolescents ( aged 13-18 years) classified into excess weight or normal weight groups participated. We assessed executive functioning ( working memory , inhibition , and shifting) and subjective stress levels before and after the Trier Social Stress Task ( TSST). The TSST was divided into two phases according to the feedback of the audience: positive and negative social evaluation. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded. Adolescents with excess weight showed poorer executive functioning after exposure to TSST compared with adolescents with normal weight. Subjective stress and autonomic reactivity were also greater in adolescents with excess weight than adolescents with normal weight. Negative social evaluation was associated with worse executive functioning and increased autonomic reactivity in adolescents with excess weight. The findings suggest that adolescents with excess weight are more sensitive to social stress triggered by negative evaluations. Social stress elicited deterioration of executive functioning in adolescents with excess weight. Evoked increases in subjective stress and autonomic responses predicted decreased executive function. Deficits in executive skills could reduce cognitive control abilities and lead to overeating in adolescents with excess weight. Strategies to cope with social stress to prevent executive deficits could be useful to prevent future obesity in this population.
