  Fibrous dysplasia is a benign tumor of the skeleton. Mostly 2 forms are described: a monostotic and a poliostotic form. The maxilla and the mandible are the most interested of the facial district. The authors report a patient of a huge maxillary fibrous dysplasia. A 63-year-old patient was treated for a 20-year progressive left maxillary neoformation. A total maxillectomy was performed. The defect was reconstructed with a custom-made midface implant associated with a temporal and a pericranial flap.
