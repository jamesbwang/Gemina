  In utero exposure to immunosuppressive drugs might be a contraindication to rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine , but that may vary according to the immunosuppressive regimen. We evaluated 24 infants born to kidney transplanted mothers exposed to 3 immunosuppressants during pregnancy ( prednisone , azathioprine , and tacrolimus or cyclosporine) and 31 control infants not exposed to these medications. No differences in adverse events were detected after rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination at 2 and 4 months.
