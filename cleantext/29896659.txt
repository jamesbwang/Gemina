  An overall three-dimensional picture of the distribution of epidermal cells at a given time point is of importance to better characterize epidermal progenitors. We introduce a whole-mount immunofluorescent staining coupled to a multicolor lineage tracing model for analyzing the spatiotemporal organization of epidermal stem cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy with multiple labelling allows for robust imaging of dorsal skin with excellent resolution.
