  The association between vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) is an active area of growing research. However , data in Saudi Arabia are scarce. This study aimed to define serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D levels among Saudi women with naïve PCOS , and to investigate the associations of their 25 ( OH) D status with their serum adiponectin and follistatin levels , along with indices of insulin resistance and hormonal deteriorations. In this case-control observational study , 63 women with PCOS and 65 age-and body mass index ( BMI)- matched control women were assessed. PCOS was diagnosed based on the revised criteria of Rotterdam. Fasting serum levels of 25 ( OH) D , adiponectin , follistatin , insulin , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) , luteinizing hormone ( LH) , total testosterone ( TT) , androgen ( Δ The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D ( serum 25 ( OH) D < 30 ng/ml) was higher in PCOS group than control group ( 77.8 % Hypovitaminosis D , coexisted and correlated with hypoadiponectinemia and hyperfollistatinemia , is being an alarming risk factor in Saudi women with PCOS. Further investigational and explanatory studies in large size samples are warranted to realize these findings and to improve both diagnostic and treatment tools in Saudi women with PCOS.
