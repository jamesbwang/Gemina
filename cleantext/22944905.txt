  Double strand breaks ( DSB) in the DNA backbone are the most lethal type of defect induced in the cell nucleus by chemical and radiation treatments of cancer. However , little is known about the outcomes of damage in nucleosomal DNA , and on its effects on damage repair. We performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics computer simulations of nucleosomes including a DSB at various sites , to characterize the early stages of the evolution of this DNA lesion<symptom>. The damaged structures are studied by the essential dynamics of DNA and histones , and compared to the intact nucleosome , thus exposing key features of the interactions. All DSB configurations tend to remain compact , with only the terminal bases interacting with histone proteins. Umbrella sampling calculations show that broken DNA ends at the DSB must overcome a free-energy barrier to detach from the nucleosome core. Finally , by calculating the covariant mechanical stress , we demonstrate that the coupled bending and torsional stress can force the DSB free ends to open up straight , thus making it accessible to damage signalling proteins.
