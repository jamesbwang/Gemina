  A faithful characterization of nanomedicine ( NM) is needed for a better understanding of their in vivo outcomes. Size and surface charge are studied with well-established methods. However , other relevant parameters for the understanding of NM behavior in vivo remain largely inaccessible. For instance , the reactive surface of nanomedicines , which are often grafted with macromolecules to decrease their recognition by the immune system , is excluded from a systematic characterization. Yet , it is known that a subtle modification of NMs ' surface characteristics ( grafting density , molecular architecture and conformation of macromolecules) is at the root of major changes in the presence of biological components. In this work , a method that investigates the steric hindrance properties of the NMs ' surface coverage based on its capacity to exclude or allow adsorption of well-defined proteins was developed based on capillary electrophoresis. A series of proteins with different molecular weights ( MW) were used as molecular probes to screen their adsorption behavior on nanoparticles bearing different molecular architectures at their surface. This novel strategy evaluating to some degree a functionality of NMs can bring additional information about their shell property and might allow for a better perception of their behavior in the presence of biological components. The developed method could discriminate nanoparticles with a high surface coverage excluding high MW proteins from nanoparticles with a low surface coverage that allowed high MW proteins to adsorb on their surface. The method has the potential for further standardization and automation for a routine use. It can be applied in quality control of NMs and to investigate interactions between proteins and NM in different situations.
