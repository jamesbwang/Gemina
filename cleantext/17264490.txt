  Age-related para-inflammation in the retina-choroidal interface is featured by low-levels of complement activation and subretinal macrophage accumulation. This study aimed to understand how complement expression in macrophages is regulated by retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE). Bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDMs) and RPE cells were cultured from 8-10 weeks old C57BL/6J mice. The BMDMs were co-cultured with normal RPE , or oxidized photoreceptor outer segment ( oxPOS) or TNF-α pre-treated RPE , or apoptotic RPE , or RPE-choroid eyecups. Macrophages were then isolated and processed for real-time RT-PCR. The expression of complement inhibitor C1INH in BMDMs was significantly upregulated by RPE and RPE-choroid eyecups. The eyecups also upregulated CFH , CD59a , and Crry in BMDMs. oxPOS pre-treated RPE upregulated C1qb but down-regulated C3 expression in BMDMs. TNF-α pre-treated RPE enhanced C1INH and CFB expression. When BMDMs were treated with apoptotic RPE , the expression of C1qb , CFH , and CD59a was reduced , whereas the expression of C3 , CFB and C1INH was increased. Our results suggest that RPE can modulate macrophages complement expression at the retina-choroidal interface even under aging or oxidative conditions. However , during inflammation<symptom> , they may promote the alternative pathway of complement activation through down-regulating CFH and CD59a and upregulating CFB and C3.
