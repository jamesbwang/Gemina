  Aspects of isomorph theory , Rosenfeld-Tarazona temperature scaling , and thermodynamic geometry are comparatively discussed on the basis of the Lennard-Jones potential. The first two approaches approximate the high-density fluid state well when the repulsive interparticle interactions become dominant , which is typically the case close to the freezing line. However , previous studies of Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling for the isochoric heat capacity and its relation to isomorph theory reveal deviations for the temperature dependence. It turns out that a definition of a state region in which repulsive interactions dominate is required for achieving consistent results. The Riemannian thermodynamic scalar curvature R allows for such a classification , indicating predominantly repulsive interactions by R > 0. An analysis of the isomorphic character of the freezing line and the validity of Rosenfeld-Tarazona temperature scaling show that these approaches are consistent only in a small state region.
