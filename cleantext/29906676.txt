  The volatile fatty acids ( VFAs) accumulation pattern and microbial community succession were studied during excess sludge ( ES) alkaline fermentation at pH of 10.0 with expanded granular sludge blanket reactor over 5 cyclers. Microbial community shifted conspicuously as ES suffered alkaline fermentation. Both VFAs and acid-producing bacteria increased rapidly during the first 8 days fermentation time , and they showed a quite positive correlation relationship. In addition , soluble chemical oxygen demand ( SCOD) also dramatically increased during the first 8 days , which implied 8 day was the optimum sludge retention time ( SRT) for ES alkaline fermentation and VFAs accumulation time. Illumina Miseq Sequencing analysis indicated that Clostridium<pathogen> , Bacillus , Amphibacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae were the dominant bacteria genus to produce VFAs. Acetic acid took about 84 % in total VFAs because among the total acid-producing bacteria most bacteria could produce acetic acid.
