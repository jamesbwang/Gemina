  Single-nucleotide-resolution sequencing of DNA damage is required to decipher the complex causal link between the identity and location of DNA adducts and their biological impact. However , the low abundance and inability to specifically amplify DNA damage hinders single-nucleotide mapping of adducts within whole genomes. Despite the high biological relevance of guanine oxidation and seminal recent advances in sequencing bulky adducts , single-nucleotide-resolution whole genome mapping of oxidative damage is not yet realized. We coupled the specificity of repair enzymes with the efficiency of a click DNA ligation reaction to insert a biocompatible locator code , enabling high-throughput , nucleotide-resolution sequencing of oxidative DNA damage in a genome. We uncovered thousands of oxidation sites with distinct patterns related to transcription , chromatin architecture , and chemical oxidation potential. Click-code-seq overcomes barriers to DNA damage sequencing and provides a new approach for generating comprehensive , sequence-specific information about chemical modification patterns in whole genomes.
