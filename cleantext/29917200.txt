  To investigate the effects of hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning ( HBO-PC) on neuronal apoptosis , Ca2 + concentration , and Caspases expression after spinal cord injury ( SCI) in rats. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into control group ( CON group) , hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning group ( HBO-PC group) and spinal cord injury group ( SCI group) , with 12 rats in each group. Rats in group HBO-PC were given HBO-PC intervention before modeling. SCI model was established by modified Allen method in group HBO-PC and group SCI. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan ( BBB) locomotor rating scale and motor evoked potential ( MEP) examination were used to assess the neurological function. The expression of apoptosis gene caspase ( 3 , 7 , 8 , 12) mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). The concentration of Ca2 + in spinal cord tissue of each group was detected. CON group , HBO-PC group , and SCI group were gradually diminishing in BBB score and potential value and amplitude of MEP , respectively. The differences between groups were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). The expressions of Caspase-3 and 7 , 8 and 12 mRNA in SCI group were significantly higher than those in CON group and HBO-PC group , respectively ( p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between CON group and HBO-PC group ( p > 0.05). The concentrations of Ca2 + in the CON group , HBO-PC group and SCI group were gradually increased; differences between groups were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). HBO-PC can reduce the loss of motor function of SCI rats , which may inhibit the activation of endoplasmic reticulum pathway of neural apoptosis , and reduce the calcium overload through inhibiting the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins ( Caspase-3/ 7/8/12) , thus reducing the cell apoptosis and protecting neurons.
