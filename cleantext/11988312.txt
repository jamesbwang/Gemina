  Luteinizing hormone ( LH) , produced in the anterior pituitary , has been detected in cadaver eyes and LH receptors ( LHRs) have been identified in the retina , with the highest density in cone photoreceptors. Our aim was to confirm the presence of LH in the living , human eye as well as to examine the potential impact of a reduction in LHR signaling on visual processing. Vitreous samples were collected from 40 patients ( 23 diabetics , 17 non-diabetics) who were undergoing vitrectomies for various indications. LH concentration was quantified in each sample via an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay and Meso Scale Discovery platform and normalized to total protein. In addition , full-field electroretinography ( ERG) was performed on 11 adult LHR knockout heterozygous mice ( B6; 129X1-Lhcgr
