  Cytokines are signalling molecules , which play an important role in both immune system function and brain development and function , and subsequently mental states and behaviour. Cytokines have been implicated in eating disorders ( EDs) due to their role in psychological health , body<symptom> weight and appetite<symptom> regulation. This meta-analysis examined cross-sectional and longitudinal studies measuring concentrations of cytokines in individuals with EDs. Using PRISMA guidelines , we systematically reviewed relevant articles in PubMed , Web of Science , and MEDLINE. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-6 , transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , independently , firstly with all EDs combined and then stratified by ED diagnosis. Twenty-five studies were included: serum/plasma cytokine concentrations were measured in people with anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN) in 23 studies and bulimia nervosa ( BN) in 4 studies. TNF-α and IL-6 were elevated in ED participants compared to healthy controls ( HCs). Specifically , this pattern was seen only when comparing AN participants to HCs. Concentrations of these cytokines did not differ between people with BN and HCs. IL-1β and TGF-β did not differ between HCs and any ED group. Therefore , AN seems to be associated with elevated concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6. Considering the role of cytokines in appetite<symptom> , mood regulation , and anxiety<symptom> , these pro-inflammatory cytokines could be a potential future drug target to help people with AN , not only with weight gain , but also with various coexisting psychological problems. Future studies should consider confounding factors that affect cytokine concentrations and report ED-relevant clinical characteristics.
