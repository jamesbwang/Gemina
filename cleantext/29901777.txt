  Tubulin polymerization promoting protein 3 ( TPPP3) is known to be expressed in the endometrium in a cyclic manner , its functional role in the physiology of implantation remains unknown. Here we demonstrate a novel function of TPPP3 during the window of implantation and in the establishment of pregnancy using a mouse model. The increased protein expression of TPPP3 and β-catenin during peri-implantation period i.e. D5 ( receptive phase , 0800 h) was observed as compared to that on D1 ( non-receptive phase , 0800 h). SiRNATPPP3- mediated knockdown of uterine TPPP3 resulted in implantation failure and inhibited the expression of receptivity markers: LIF , Integrin-β3 , IHH , and Wnt4. TPPP3-silencing in mouse endometrial epithelial cells also prevented blastocyst attachment and the adhesion reaction. In delayed implantation experiment , expression of TPPP3 was increased in active implantation group ( E2 + P4) compared to delayed implantation group ( P4). The increased expression of TPPP3 in E2 + P4- treated Ishikawa cells compared to vehicle or P4 or E2 alone- treated Ishikawa cells , also revealed its upregulation by E2. The suppression of β-catenin in uterus under the condition of transient knockdown of TPPP3 and the co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that regulation of β-catenin was mediated via TPPP3 during implantation. Additionally , in order to gain insight into TPPP3 collaborators , we identified TPPP3 interacting proteins by nanoLC-MS analysis in mouse uterus which might be involved during implantation. In conclusion , our study suggests that TPPP3 is important for embryo implantation and for the establishment of early pregnancy through modulation of β-catenin.
