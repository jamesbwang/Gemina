  The effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs) on the expression of a subset of immune response , apoptosis and cell proliferation- associated genes was studied in normal human astrocytes ( line NHA/TS). In the cells treated with SWCNTs ( 2 , 10 and 50 ng/ml of medium for 24 h) we observed a strong dose-dependent down-regulation of the expression of a cell surface glycoproteins HLA-DRA ( major histocompatibility complex , class II , DR alpha) and HLA-DRB1. At the same time , the expression of HLA-F ( major histocompatibility complex , class I , F) , LMNB1 ( lamin B1) , and HTRA1 ( high temperature requirement A1) genes as well as the level of miR-190b and miR-7 was up-regulated in NHA/TS subjected to different concentrations of SWCNTs. After 24 h of treatment with SWCNTs we detected a dose-dependent suppression of PHLDA2 ( pleckstrin homology-like domain , family A , member 2) gene expression in these cells. Obtained data show that SWCNTs may affect an immune response , in particular through suppression of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 gene expressions and that miR-190b and miR-7 possibly participated in this suppression. Deregulation of lamin B1 expression indicates the possibility of alterations in genome stability following treatment of astrocytes with SWCNTs. Thus , more caution is needed in biomedical application of SWCNTs.
