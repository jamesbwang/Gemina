  Echocardiography is the most commonly used technique for evaluating patients with mitral regurgitation ( MR) and estimating MR severity. However , in clinical practice , echocardiographic assessment of MR severity remains challenging in many cases , particularly in patients with forms of intermediate or borderline severity. The main causes are the improper application of the echocardiographic methods for assessment of MR severity and the lack of a validated standardized approach for quantification of various types of MR , including organic and functional MR. In this review , we describe how best to use echocardiography for assessing MR severity in the light of current knowledge and guidelines.
