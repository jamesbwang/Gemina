  The safety of direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) in oldest old patients with nonvalvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF) in daily clinical practice has not been systematically assessed. This study examined the safety of DOACs and dicumarol ( a vitamin K antagonist) in NVAF geriatric patients. Prospective study from January 2010 through June 2015 , with follow-up through January 2016. Geriatric medicine department at a tertiary hospital. A total of 554 outpatients , 75 years or older , diagnosed of NVAF and starting oral anticoagulation. The main outcome was bleeding , which was classified into major ( including those life-threatening) and nonmajor episodes. Statistical analyses were performed with Cox regression. A total of 351 patients received DOACs and 193 dicumarol. Patients on DOACs were older , with more frequent comorbidities , mobility limitation and disability in activities of daily living , as well as higher mortality , than those treated with dicumarol. The incidence of any bleeding was 19.2/ 100 person-years among patients on DOACs and 13.7/ 100 person-years on dicumarol; corresponding figures for major bleeding were 5.2 for those on DOACs , and 3.3 for those on dicumarol. In crude analyses , hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals) for any bleeding , and for mayor bleeding in patients on DOACs vs dicumarol were 1.60 ( 1.04-2.44) and 2.22 ( 0.88-5.59) , respectively. Excess risk of bleeding associated with DOACs vs dicumarol disappeared after adjustment for clinical characteristics , so that corresponding figures were 1.19 ( 0.68-2.08) and 1.01 ( 0.35-2.93). Results did not vary across subgroups of high-risk patients. In very old patients with NVAF , the higher risk of bleeding associated with DOACs vs dicumarol could be mostly explained by the worse clinical profile of patients receiving DOACs. Risk of bleeding was rather high , and warrants close clinical monitoring.
