  Robots autonomously interact with their environment through a continual sense-decide-respond control loop. Most commonly , the decide step occurs in a central processing unit; however , the stiffness mismatch between rigid electronics and the compliant bodies of soft robots can impede integration of these systems. We develop a framework for programmable mechanical computation embedded into the structure of soft robots that can augment conventional digital electronic control schemes. Using an origami waterbomb as an experimental platform , we demonstrate a 1-bit mechanical storage device that writes , erases , and rewrites itself in response to a time-varying environmental signal. Further , we show that mechanical coupling between connected origami units can be used to program the behavior of a mechanical bit , produce logic gates such as AND , OR , and three input majority gates , and transmit signals between mechanologic gates. Embedded mechanologic provides a route to add autonomy and intelligence in soft robots and machines.
