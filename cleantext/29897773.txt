  The selective synthesis of cis-3,4-disubstituted pyrrolidines and piperidines is achieved by a Pd-catalyzed C-H arylation with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity using an aminoquinoline auxiliary at C ( 3). The arylation conditions are silver free , use a low catalyst loading , and employ inexpensive K
