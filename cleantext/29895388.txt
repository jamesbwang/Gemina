  To investigate if magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) features of the placenta are different in fetuses with and without central nervous system ( CNS) abnormalities. Institutional research ethics board approval was obtained. Fetal MRI of 97 singleton pregnancies were analysed retrospectively ( 19-25 weeks gestation) , 65 with CNS morphological abnormalities and 32 controls. Placental T2 signal intensity , placental and fetal volumes , placental-to-fetal volume ratio , and placental apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values were assessed. Measurements were compared with the presence or absence of CNS fetal abnormalities using the Mann-Whitney test. Separate slopes models and intercept models were used to check for significant differences in the slopes and intercepts , respectively , among the groups. Placental ADC values were significantly lower in placentas of fetuses with CNS abnormalities compared to controls ( p = 0.04). Placental T2 signal intensity , fetal and placental volumes did not differ between the two groups. The rate of increase in fetal-to-placental volume ratio with gestational age ( GA) was greater among the controls. The presence of fetal CNS abnormalities is associated with reduced ADC values of the placenta. Moreover , placentas of fetuses with CNS abnormalities show a less rapid increase in fetal to placental volume ratio with GA.. Therefore , ADC mapping , as well as different growth kinetics of the placenta relative to the fetus , may potentially serve as early markers of pathological neurodevelopment.
