  Endogenous and exogenous enzymatic hydrolysis carried out to obtain vanilla extracts with higher concentrations of vanillin using green vanilla beans. Sequences initiated with freezing of green vanilla beans at- 1 °C for 24 h , followed by endogenous hydrolysis under optimal β-glucosidase activity at 4.2 and 35 °C for 96 h , exogenous hydrolysis with Crystalzyme PML-MX at pH 5.0 and 40 °C for 72 h , and ethanol extraction at 40 % ( v v
