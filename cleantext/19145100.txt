  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma<pathogen> ( NPC) with cystic liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> is so rarely observed that there are only three cases<pathogen> reported in the published literature<pathogen>. We present a case<pathogen> of NPC that received complete response<pathogen> after chemotherapy<pathogen> and definitive radiotherapy<pathogen> , but a liver<pathogen> cystic lesion<pathogen> was revealed on abdominal sonogram<pathogen> three months<pathogen> after the initial therapy<pathogen>. The cystic liver<pathogen> lesion<pathogen> initially resembled a simple liver<pathogen> cyst<pathogen> with fast growth<pathogen> , and then evolved into an abscess-like mass<pathogen> after a short term<pathogen>. Though abscess<pathogen> drainage<pathogen> was performed , and the mass<pathogen> shrank significantly , but it returned to previous size<pathogen> two months later. Surgical<pathogen> resection<pathogen> was administrated both for diagnosis<pathogen> and treatment<pathogen> , and eventually the lesion<pathogen> was histologically demonstrated to be a liver<pathogen> metastasis<pathogen>. Eight months<pathogen> after the partial hepatectomy<pathogen> , cystic liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> recurred on computed tomography<pathogen> ( CT) scan. Though palliative systematic chemotherapy<pathogen> including paclitaxel<pathogen> , cisplatin<pathogen> , gemcitabine<pathogen> , navobine<pathogen> and anti-epidemal growth<pathogen> factor<pathogen> receptor<pathogen> ( anti-EGFR molecular-targeted therapy<pathogen> were performed , the cystic metastases<pathogen> still gradually progressed. Then Transcatheter<pathogen> Hepatic Artery<pathogen> Chemoembolization<pathogen> ( TACE) was administrated for five times<pathogen> , and all the lesions<pathogen> were obviously decreased in size<pathogen>. After TACE treatment<pathogen> , the liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> maintained stable for six months<pathogen> , but lung<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> were noted. Finally , the patient<pathogen> died of liver<pathogen> failure<pathogen>. The rare cystic appearance<pathogen> may be a special form<pathogen> which exists for liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> of NPC , indicating poor prognosis<pathogen>. Oncologists<pathogen> need to enhance the recognition<pathogen> and diagnosis<pathogen> level<pathogen> of this type<pathogen> of metastases<pathogen>. Intense follow-up<pathogen> and early diagnosis<pathogen> are important. While emphasizing the importance<pathogen> of local therapy<pathogen> and personal principles<pathogen> for liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> , TACE may be a preferred method<pathogen> for unresectable cystic liver<pathogen> metastases<pathogen> from NPC.
