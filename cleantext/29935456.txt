  In the present study , a sodium hydroxide-methanol solution ( SMs) pretreatment of corn stover was described to overcome biomass recalcitrance for the first time. Effects of sodium hydroxide loading , solid-to-liquid ratio , processing time and temperature on enzymatic saccharification were studied in detail. The SMs pretreatment could significantly enhance the enzyme accessibility of corn stover , minimize the degradation of sugar polymers , and decrease the energy consumption. 97.5 % glucan and 83.5 % xylan were preserved in the regenerated corn stover under the optimal condition. Subsequent enzymatic digestibilities of glucan and xylan reached 97.2 % and 80.3 % , respectively. The enzyme susceptibility of the regenerated samples was explained by their physical and chemical characteristics. This strategy provides a promising alternative for better techno-economic of the lignocelluloses-to-sugars routes.
