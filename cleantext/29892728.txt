  Inorganic and organic lead halide perovskite materials attract great interest in the scientific community because of their potential for low-cost , high efficiency solar cells. In this report we add a new property of these materials , namely their photochemical activity in the visible light range. Both inorganic ( CsPbBr3) and organic ( CH3NH3PbBr3-MAPbBr3) perovskite thin films were demonstrated to promote photo-dissociation of adsorbed ethyl chloride ( EC) , employing 532 nm pulsed laser irradiation under ultra-high vacuum ( UHV) conditions. From the post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption ( TPD) analysis , the yield of photoproduct formation was found to be up to two orders of magnitude higher than for UV light-excited EC molecules on metallic and oxide surfaces. Photo-reactivity on top of the CsPbBr3 surface is almost an order of magnitude more efficient than on the CH3NH3PbBr3 surface , apparently due to the lower density of defect and surface states. A direct correlation was found between electron-induced luminescence and photoluminescence intensities and the photoreactivity cross-sections. We conclude that both the intense luminescence and the well-known photovoltaic properties associated with these halide perovskite materials are consistent with the efficiency of photo-reactivity in the visible range , reported here for the first time.
