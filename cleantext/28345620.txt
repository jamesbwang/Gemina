  The MiT/TFE transcription factors play a pivotal role in the regulation of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. The subcellular localization and activity of MiT/TFE proteins are primarily regulated through phosphorylation. And the phosphorylated protein is retained in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocates to the nucleus upon dephosphorylation , where it stimulates the expression of hundreds of genes , leading to lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy induction. The transcription factor-mediated lysosome-to-nucleus signaling can be directly controlled by several signaling molecules involved in the mTORC1 , PKC , and AKT pathways. MiT/TFE family members have attracted much attention owing to their intracellular clearance of pathogenic factors in numerous diseases. Recently , multiple studies have also revealed the MiT/TFE proteins as master regulators of cellular metabolic reprogramming , converging on autophagic and lysosomal function and playing a critical role in cancer , suggesting that novel therapeutic strategies could be based on the modulation of MiT/TFE family member activity. Here , we present an overview of the latest research on MiT/TFE transcriptional factors and their potential mechanisms in cancer.
