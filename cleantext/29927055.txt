  To determine the effect of 5 % sodium chloride ophthalmic ointment ( 5 % NaCl) on thickness and morphology of the normal canine cornea using ultrasonic pachymetry ( USP) , in vivo confocal microscopy ( IVCM) , and Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography ( FD-OCT). Five healthy laboratory Beagles received ophthalmic examinations including USP , IVCM , and FD-OCT prior to and at fixed intervals following treatment. The right and left eyes were treated with 5 % NaCl and artificial tears ophthalmic ointment ( AT) , respectively , every 2 hours for 4 treatments/d ( days 2-9) , and then hourly for 7 treatments/d ( day 10). Treatment groups were statistically compared using mixed-effects linear regression. Treatment with 5 % NaCl resulted in a 12 μm decrease in corneal thickness from baseline ( P < .001) , while there was no significant difference in corneal thickness between values obtained at baseline and following treatment with AT ( P = .82). Epithelial cell density significantly increased from baseline ( 530 ± 52 cells/mm Short-term topical treatment with 5 % NaCl decreased corneal thickness in normal dogs with no observable changes in corneal morphology or signs of ocular toxicity.
