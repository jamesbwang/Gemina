  Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( In the present study , we investigated the expression profile of lincROR in EML-ALK NSCLC tissues , and the potential role of lincROR in prognosis was then analyzed. Subsequently , its association with stem cell-like properties of EML-ALK The results showed that lincROR expression was upregulated in EML4-ALK We found that lincROR expression was significantly inhibited because of the increased concentration of crizotinib in EML4-ALK
