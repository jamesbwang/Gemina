  The accuracy of quantitative models for near-infrared ( NIR) spectroscopy is dependent upon calibration samples with concentration variations. Conventional sample-collection methods have shortcomings ( especially time-consumption) , which creates a `` bottleneck '' in the application of NIR models for Process Analytical Technology ( PAT) control. We undertook a study to solve the problem of sample collection for construction of NIR quantitative models. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate oral dosage forms ( ODFs) were used as examples. The aim of this study was to find an approach to construct NIR quantitative models rapidly using a NIR spectral library based on the idea of a universal model. The NIR spectral library of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate ODFs was defined and comprised the spectra of 377 batches of samples produced by 26 domestic pharmaceutical companies , including tablets , dispersible tablets , chewable tablets , oral suspensions , and granules. The correlation coefficient ( r
