  The feasibility of the long-term ( > 170 days) culture of a dinoflagellate microalga in a raceway photobioreactor is demonstrated for the first time. Amphidinium carterae was chosen for this study as it is producer of interesting high-value compounds. Repeated semicontinuous culture provided to be a robust operational mode. Different concentration levels of the f/2 medium nutrients ( i.e. f/2 × 1-3) were assayed. The composition f/2 × 3 ( N :P = 5) , combined with a sinusoidal irradiance pattern ( L/D = 24:0) with a 570 µE m
