  There is an increasing effort to understand the many sources of population variability that can influence drug absorption , metabolism , disposition , and clearance in veterinary species. This growing interest reflects the recognition that this diversity can influence dose-exposure-response relationships and can affect the drug residues present in the edible tissues of food-producing animals. To appreciate the pharmacokinetic diversity that may exist across a population of potential drug product recipients , both endogenous and exogenous variables need to be considered. The American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics hosted a 1-day session during the 2017 Biennial meeting to explore the sources of population variability recognized to impact veterinary medicine. The following review highlights the information shared during that session. In Part I of this workshop report , we consider sources of population variability associated with drug metabolism and membrane transport. Part II of this report highlights the use of modeling and simulation to support an appreciation of the variability in dose-exposure-response relationships.
