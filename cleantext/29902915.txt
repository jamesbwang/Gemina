  Two main digital signal processing technologies inside the modern hearing aid to provide the best conditions for hearing aid users are directionality ( DIR) and digital noise reduction ( DNR) algorithms. There are various possible settings for these algorithms. The present study evaluates the effects of various DIR and DNR conditions ( both separately and in combination) on listening comfort among hearing aid users. In 18 participants who received hearing aid fitting services from the Rehabilitation School of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences regularly , we applied acceptable noise level ( ANL) as our subjective measure of listening comfort. We evaluated both of these under six different hearing aid conditions: omnidirectional-baseline , omnidirectional-broadband DNR , omnidirectional-multichannel DNR , directional , directional-broadband DNR , and directional-multichannel DNR. The ANL results ranged from -3 dB to 14 dB in all conditions. The results show , among all conditions , both the omnidirectional-baseline condition and the omnidirectional-broadband DNR condition are the worst conditions for listening in noise. The DIR always reduces the amount of noise that patients received during testing. The DNR algorithm does not improve listening in noise significantly when compared with the DIR algorithms. Although both DNR and DIR algorithms yielded a lower ANL , the DIR algorithm was more effective than the DNR. The DIR and DNR technologies provide listening comfort in the presence of noise. Thus , user benefit depends on how the digital signal processing settings inside the hearing aid are adjusted.
