  The Rorschach Inkblot Method ( RIM) is a performance-based personality assessment instrument used in both clinical and research settings worldwide. This investigation examines response-level , interrater reliability of U.S. graduate students enrolled in the same doctoral program and divided into two unique participant groups: 20 of those with previous Comprehensive System ( CS) training background who are now trained in Rorschach Performance Assessment System ( R-PAS; initial coders N = 11 , blind coders N = 9) , and 19 of those trained solely with R-PAS ( initial coders N = 10 , blind coders N = 9). Trainees ' coding was analyzed based on a sample of 50 protocols ( half per group) representing a total of 1,189 responses. Blind coding was used among trainees and coding between the two investigated training groups was analyzed for each variable at the response level and expressed as percent agreement , Gwet 's AC , and kappa values. Rates of agreement between the trainees were similar across both groups , and most of the concordance rates can be characterized as excellent. Overall , these results suggest that trainees may learn how to code R-PAS variables with similar reliability levels whether or not they had prior CS knowledge.
