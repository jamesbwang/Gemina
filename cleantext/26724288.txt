  The aim was to describe which elements of nurses ' knowledge , training needs , behavior , and attitude can prevent Medication errors ( Acronym MEs) in the emergency department during all steps of the administration of intravenous ( IV) medications. An anonymous questionnaire made up of 43 items has been drafted and delivered to a sample of 103 nurses of a university hospital in Rome. The study has been supported by specific literature review. Majority of the sample ( 94 %) answered that topics related to the preparation and administration of IV medications were covered during the basic course while 63.2 % only during the postbasic course. Only 15.6 % of nurses judged excellent their level of knowledge about preparation and administration of IV medications while 89.3 % considered that it is important to improve their knowledge; 85.6 % said that the teaching about the use of IV medications should be increased during the degree course they attended; 30.3 % agreed that specific postgraduate courses on the use of IV drugs should be designed. Moreover , only 22 % of the sample believed that the coaching of new recruit nurses is critical to prevent errors. The sample showed appropriate knowledge , positive attitudes , and right behavior related to the preparation and administration of IV medications. The skills that nurses must have in pharmacology are still rising , both due to the safety of drug therapy and to the increasing number of drugs available; the result is that nurses have to update their knowledge regularly.
