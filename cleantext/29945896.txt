  To investigate the incidence , clinical features and risk factors of premacular membrane ( PMM) formation after primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD) repair with scleral buckling ( SB) alone. This institutional , prospective and consecutive case series included phakic eyes with RRD , treated with SB alone within 7 days from the occurrence of symptoms , with a follow-up of 6 months. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images were reviewed. The association of PMM development and morphology with preoperative and intraoperative RRD features was analysed. Ninety-two patients with a mean age of 56 ± 13 years completed the 6 months follow-up period. Postoperatively , eyes with any PMM stage were 30 out of 92 ( 32.6 %) at 1 month and 47 out of 92 ( 51,1 %) at both 3 months and 6 months. Over the follow-up period , 17 out of 47 PMMs ( 36.2 %) progressed to later stages. Progression of PMMs to later stages were observed only in RRDs involving the macular region ( 17 out of 35 eyes , 48.5 %) , while none of the PMMs in macula-sparing detachments progressed to later stages ( p = 0.020). The risk factors significantly associated with postoperative new onset of PMM were preoperative RRDs involving the macular region ( p = 0.001) , cryopexy time ( p = 0.045) , presence of horseshoe tears ( p = 0.003) , worse preoperative visual acuity ( p = 0.004) and subretinal fluid drainage ( p = 0.047). The incidence of postoperative PMM formation after RRD repair with SB alone was high. In retinal detachments involving the macular region PMM were more severe , tending to anatomical progression and functional deterioration. Activation of foveal Müller cell in detachments involving the macula may be a key factor in PMM progression.
