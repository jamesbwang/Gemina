  Understanding how the Antarctic ice sheet will respond to global warming relies on knowledge of how it has behaved in the past. The use of numerical models , the only means to quantitatively predict the future , is hindered by limitations to topographic data both now and in the past , and in knowledge of how subsurface oceanic , glaciological and hydrological processes interact. Incorporating the variety and interplay of such processes , operating at multiple spatio-temporal scales , is critical to modeling the Antarctic 's system evolution and requires direct observations in challenging locations. As these processes do not observe disciplinary boundaries neither should our future research.
