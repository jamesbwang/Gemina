  The beamforming performance has a large impact on image quality in ultrasound imaging. Previously , several adaptive weighting factors including coherence factor ( CF) and generalized coherence factor ( GCF) have been proposed to improved image resolution and contrast. In this paper , we propose a new adaptive weighting factor for ultrasound imaging , which is called signal mean-to-standard-deviation factor ( SMSF). SMSF is defined as the mean-to-standard-deviation of the aperture data and is used to weight the output of delay-and-sum ( DAS) beamformer before image formation. Moreover , we develop a robust SMSF ( RSMSF) by extending the SMSF to the spatial frequency domain using an altered spectrum of the aperture data. In addition , a square neighborhood average is applied on the RSMSF to offer a more smoothed square neighborhood RSMSF ( SN-RSMSF) value. We compared our methods with DAS , CF , and GCF using simulated and experimental synthetic aperture data sets. The quantitative results show that SMSF results in an 82 % lower full width at half-maximum ( FWHM) but a 12 % lower contrast ratio ( CR) compared with CF. Moreover , the SN-RSMSF leads to 15 % and 10 % improvement , on average , in FWHM and CR compared with GCF while maintaining the speckle quality. This demonstrates that the proposed methods can effectively improve the image resolution and contrast.
