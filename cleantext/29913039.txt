  Regulatory T cells ( Treg) are currently being evaluated in clinical allotransplantation for tolerance induction , with proven safety in humans with autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host disease. A considerable amount of recent data suggests that additional factors may need to be validated , including the stability and commitment of newly discovered Treg subsets under inflammatory conditions , to further warrant safe and effective Treg-based therapeutic approaches. This review explores the opportunities and challenges of Treg-based cell therapy in xenotransplantation. The emerging new technologies for genetic modifications of the donor pig offer a major advantage for Treg therapy to improve xenograft protection. Particularly , the feasibility of ( i) ex vivo expansion of donor ( pig)- specific Treg for infusion , and ( ii) development of Treg in situ for the life of the xenograft. Our understanding of the Treg biology and their role in xenograft protection , under the newly developed immunosuppressive protocols remains limited. The incidence of various Treg subpopulations in xenograft recipients and their suppressive efficacy across species barriers are largely unknown. Finally , deciphering the dynamics of Treg function , and their interaction with adaptive and innate immune cells are of critical importance to design safe , effective and clinically relevant Treg-based therapeutic approaches in xenotransplantation.
