  Extracellular vesicles ( EVs)- including exosomes , microvesicles and apoptotic bodies- have received much scientific attention last decade as mediators of a newly discovered cell-to-cell communication system , acting at short and long distances. EVs carry biologically active molecules , thus providing signals that influence a spectrum of functions in recipient cells during various physiological and pathological processes. Recent findings point to EVs as very attractive immunomodulatory therapeutic agents , vehicles for drug delivery and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in liquid biopsies. In addition , EVs interact with and regulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM) components , which is crucial for organ development and wound<disease> healing , as well as bone and cardiovascular calcification. EVs carrying matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) are involved in ECM remodeling , thus modifying tumor microenvironment and contributing to premetastatic niche formation and angiogenesis. Here we review the role of EVs in control of cell function , with emphasis on their interaction with ECM and microenvironment in health and disease.
