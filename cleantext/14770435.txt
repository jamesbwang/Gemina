  Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct ( IPNB) is a rare variant of bile duct tumors characterized by papillary growth within the bile duct lumen and recognized precursor of invasive carcinoma. IPNB was detected incidentally in a 60-year-old woman during check up. Radiologic images revealed a huge cystic mass with papillary projection and markedly dilated bile ducts. Biopsies revealed high-grade IPNB. Cholangioscopy detected a connection between the right posterior bile duct and cyst<symptom> lumen with epithelial dysplasia of the bile duct. Right posterior sectional duct opened in the left hepatic duct. Consequently , right trisectionectomy and extrahepatic bile duct resection were conducted. Histological studies revealed intraductal papillary neoplasm with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia ( carcinoma in situ). IPNB patients without distant metastases are candidates for surgery and complete resection should be conducted to achieve long-term survival.
