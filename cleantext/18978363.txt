  Coronary artery spasm ( CAS) can result in life-threatening arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Although this disorder has been known for a long time , little is known about it , and its mechanisms have been not identified yet. We describe a 52-year-old woman with no significant cardiovascular risk factors who experienced several episodes of spontaneous and coincident multivessel coronary artery spasm , which led to myocardial infarction as well as malignant arrhythmias. Coronary angiography revealed severe migratory narrowing in the left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. Simultaneous multivessel coronary artery spasm develop multisite myocardial infarction ( MI) , and malignant arrhythmias could occur even in the absence of significant stenosis and triggering factors , which would lead to an increased risk of life-threatening cardiac events.
