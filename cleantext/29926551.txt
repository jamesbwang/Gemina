  Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancers have emerged as key predictive biomarkers in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) treatment. However , a few patients with wild-type EGFR also respond to EGFR TKIs. This study investigated the factors predicting successful EGFR TKI treatment in lung adenocarcinoma patients with wild-type EGFR. We examined 66 patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma carrying wide-type EGFR who were treated with EGFR TKIs. The EGFR gene copy number was assessed by silver in situ hybridization ( SISH). We evaluated the clinical factors and EGFR gene copy numbers that are associated with a favorable clinical response to EGFR TKIs. The objective response rate was 12.1 % , while the disease control rate was 40.9 %. EGFR SISH analysis was feasible in 23 cases. Twelve patients tested EGFR SISH-positive , and 11 were EGFR SISH-negative , with no significant difference in tumor response and survival between EGFR SISH-positive and- negative patients. The overall median progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) of 66 patients were 2.1 months and 9.7 months , respectively. Female sex and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status ( PS) of 0-1 were independent predictors of PFS. ECOG PS 0-1 and a low tumor burden of extrathoracic metastasis were independent predictors of good OS. Factors such as good PS , female sex , and low tumor burden may predict favorable outcomes following EGFR TKI therapy in patients with EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. However , EGFR gene copy number was not predictive of survival.
