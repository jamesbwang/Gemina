  The aim of this work was to study acetyl-assisted autohydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse for the production of xylo-oligosaccharides without additional chemicals. A xylo-oligosaccharide yield of 50.35 % was obtained in 10 min through sugarcane bagasse autohydrolysis at 200 °C; this yield was 49.64 % after acetyl-assisted autohydrolysis of a 65:35 mixture of sugarcane bagasse/white birch at 160 °C for 100 min. The yield of xylo-oligosaccharides was close to that obtained at 180 °C/ 40 min and 200 °C/ 10 min through the autohydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. Compared to sugarcane bagasse alone , the xylo-oligosaccharide ( degree of polymerization 2-5) yield from the acetyl-assisted autohydrolysis at 200 °C for 10 min was 52.99 %. In addition , the yield of glucose from the solid residue following autohydrolysis pretreatment was 96.87 % after 72 h of enzymatic hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that acetyl-assisted autohydrolysis is a promising method for the production of xylo-oligosaccharides.
