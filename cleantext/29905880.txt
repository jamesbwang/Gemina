  To review the entity `` black esophagus '' and sequela of a slipped laparoscopic adjustable band. The patient 's history , physical examination , imaging , and endoscopic findings were reviewed. Detailed review of pathophysiology , presentation , diagnosis , management , and natural history was conducted. `` Black esophagus , '' also known as acute esophageal necrosis<symptom> ( AEN) , is a rare condition resulting in black discoloration of the mid to distal esophagus with less than a hundred reported cases. It has not been previously documented in bariatric surgery or following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The volvulus was reduced at surgery , and the esophageal changes resolved without sequela. `` Black esophagus '' is an acute , ominous-appearing condition with a spectrum ranging from superficial mucosal disease to transmural involvement with perforation. Fortunately , esophageal resection is rarely required.
