  The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of four finishing and polishing protocols in Surface Roughness ( Ra) and Surface Gloss ( Ga) of two different nanocomposites. In total , 50 disc samples of a nanofilled resin and a nanohybrid resin were prepared. The samples were assigned randomly to one of the five groups to which different polishing protocols were applied. Analysis of surface roughness was performed using an Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM) , with the gloss evaluated using a gloss meter.Statistical evaluation of the results were analyzed using SPSS software , based on one-way ANOVA parametric tests along with the Welch correction and the Dunnett test for multiple comparisons of the tested protocols. The results evidence the significant influence of the applied Protocol Types and Resin Types on Surface Roughness ( Ra) and Surface Gloss ( Ga). The multiple comparisons between polishing systems highlight the contrast between the most complex protocol , evidencing the lowest average Ra and the highest value Ga , and control protocol , evidencing the highest average Ra and the lowest percentage Ga.. Filtek ™ Supreme XT provided the best results in both Ra and Ga , in Protocol 4 , while Brilliant Everglow ™ performed better in Protocols 2 and 3. Both Ra and Ga are dependent on the type of protocol used , as protocol 4 evidence a higher performance , depending also on the type of resins tested in the research , as nanofilled resin provided the best results. Furthermore , the gloss is influenced significantly by the surface roughness of the composite resin. In order to achieve excellent aesthetic appearance and high durability of the direct restoration , it is important to select initially the appropriate biomaterial for use and then to base preference for a polishing technique on achieving perfect results in the surface texture.
