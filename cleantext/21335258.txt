  SmartQuit ® is a smartphone application ( app) for smoking cessation based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy , a behavioural therapy that encourages individuals to accept internal experiences , such as cravings to smoke , without acting on those experiences or urges. We used a single-subject ( A-B-A) design with 10 participants to examine whether SmartQuit ® use would reduce cigarette intake in a New Zealand sample. 10 smokers tallied their own cravings experienced and cigarettes smoked then sent those tallies to the first author every day until we observed stable patterns ( Phase A1). We then gave the participants individual access to the SmartQuit ® app ( Phase B). When they advised that they had ceased using the app , they again recorded daily cravings and cigarettes smoked for a minimum of three days ( Phase A2). We also collected follow-up smoking and craving data at 1 , 2 and up to 13 months after completion of Phase A2. Using SmartQuit ® reduced our participants ' daily cigarette intake significantly in the short-term and three individuals remained smoke-free up to 13 months later. Cravings to smoke did not differ significantly across Phases A1 , B and A2 , but graphical analysis showed a trend for decreasing cravings. Our results suggest that SmartQuit ® provides another readily accessible intervention to help people stop smoking and is suited for use with a New Zealand population.
