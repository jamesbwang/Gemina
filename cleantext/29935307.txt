  The adult nucleus pulposus ( NP) and articular cartilage are similar in terms of their histocytological components and biomechanical functionalities , requiring a deep understanding of NP-specific markers to better evaluate stem-cell-based NP regeneration. Here , we seek to distinguish NP cells from articular chondrocytes ( ACs) , focusing on differences in their embryonic formation and evolutionary origin. Embryonically , NP cells are conservatively derived from the axial notochord , whereas ACs originate in a diversified manner from paraxial mesoderm and neural crest cells. Evolutionarily , although the origins of vertebrate NP and AC cells can be traced to similar structures within protostomia-like bilaterian ancestors , the distant phylogenetic relationship between the two groups of animals and the differences in the bodily origins of the tissues suggest that the tissues may in fact have undergone parallel evolution within the protostomia and deuterostomia. The numbers of supposedly NP-specific markers are increasing gradually as microarray studies proceed , but no final consensus has been attained on the specificity and physiology of `` exclusive '' NP markers because of innate variations among species; intrinsic expression of genes that destabilize the circadian clock; and cooperation by , and crosstalk among , different genes in terms of physiology-related phenotypes. We highlight the embryonic and evolutionary boundaries between NP and AC cells , to aid in recognition of the challenges associated with evaluation of the role played by nucleopulpogenic differentiation during stem-cell-based intervertebral disc regeneration.
