  Previous studies suggested that apolipoprotein E ( ApoE) genetic polymorphisms ( SNPs) may result in abnormal lipid metabolism. Therefore , genetic polymorphisms in ApoE may be associated with the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH). A case control study was designed to include 580 patients with steroid-induced ONFH and 560 age- and sex-matched non steroid-induced ONFH control subjects to analyze the association between ApoE polymorphisms and susceptibility of steroid-induced ONFH. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP) method was utilized to differentiate two genotypes SNPs ( rs7412 C/T and rs429358 T/C) in ApoE gene. Both rs7412 C/T and rs429358 T/C were found to be associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. However , no significant association was observed between the haplotypes T-T , T-C and C-C in ONFH. Furthermore , T allele of rs7412 and C allele of rs429358 carriers were associated with higher levels of TG in steroid-induced ONFH patients ( P < 0.05). The study suggested that ApoE genetic polymorphisms conferred susceptibility to steroid-induced ONFH in Chinese Han population. However , the results need further investigation with large sample size and various populations.
