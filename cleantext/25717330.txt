  Fast and accurate diagnosis is needed to eradicate and manage economically important and invasive diseases like fire blight. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) is known as the best on-site diagnostic , because it is fast , highly specific to a target , and less sensitive to inhibitors in samples. In this study , LAMP assay that gives more consistent results for on-site diagnosis of fire blight than the previous developed LAMP assays was developed. Primers for new LAMP assay ( named as DS-LAMP) were designed from a histidine-tRNA ligase gene ( EAMY_RS32025) of
