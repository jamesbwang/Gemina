  This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of hydroxysafflor yellow A ( HSYA) on ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R)- induced acute kidney injury via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway , both in vitro and in vivo. Rats were subjected to removal of the right kidney and I/R injury to the left kidney. Rats subjected to renal I/R injury were treated with HSYA at 0.5 h prior to I/R injury. Renal function , histopathological analysis , and cells apoptosis were measured in vivo. In vitro , proximal renal tubular cells ( HK-2) were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R). Apoptotic cell death and inflammatory cytokines , Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) , and nuclear factor ( NF)- κB expression were determined. Treatment of I/R rats with HSYA markedly reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen , attenuated renal cell apoptosis , alleviated changes in renal tissue morphology , and reduced IL-1β , TNF-α , and caspase-3 release. In vitro , HSYA effectively decreased NF-κB p65 and inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1β , TNF-α , and IL-6. Thus , HSYA can protect renal function from I/R injury by ameliorating acute kidney injury and partly by promoting tubular cell survival via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. These results suggest that HSYA can be used to prevent I/R-induced acute kidney injury.
