  To assess corneal subbasal nerve density ( SBND) and corneal sensitivity ( CS) after pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD) without intraoperative 360-degree laser treatment using contact or noncontact panoramic viewing systems. This is a prospective study of 34 eyes affected by RRD , which underwent PPV using contact ( 18 eyes) and noncontact ( 16 eyes) panoramic viewing systems; 12 eyes which underwent scleral buckling , and 17 eyes which underwent cataract surgery. SBND and CS were assessed before surgery and 3 and 6 months postoperatively by in vivo confocal microscopy and Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry. Compared with baseline values , at 6 months , SBND and CS decreased in both contact PPV ( SBND preoperative value: 19.1 ± 3.7 mm/mm; SBND postoperative value: 3.5 ± 1.3 mm/mm; CS preoperative value: 5.1 ± 0.5 cm; CS postoperative value: 1.5 ± 0.4 cm) and in noncontact PPV groups ( SBND preoperative value: 19.5 ± 3.8 mm/mm; SBND postoperative value: 8.7 ± 2.3 mm/mm; CS preoperative value: 5.3 ± 0.5 cm; CS postoperative value: 2.5 ± 0.7 cm) ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons). SBND reduction was greater in the contact PPV group than in the noncontact PPV group ( P < 0.001). By contrast , the scleral buckling and cataract surgery group values were unchanged ( P > 0.1 for all comparisons). In multivariate analysis , no significant effect was found for cataract surgery associated with PPV , pseudophakia , surgical time , intraocular pressure , or for laser in horizontal sectors for PPV groups. SBND was highly correlated with CS ( r = 0.93). A contact viewing system reduces SBND after PPV more than a noncontact system does.
