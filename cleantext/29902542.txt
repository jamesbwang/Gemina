  This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel spray-applied growth factor therapy containing recombinant human epidermal growth factor ( rhEGF) for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers<disease> ( DFU). This study was a phase III double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial. 167 adult patients at six medical centers were randomized to receive routine wound<disease> care plus either topical spray treatment with 0.005 % rhEGF ( n = 82) or an equivalent volume of saline spray ( n = 85) twice a day until ulcer<disease> healing or for up to 12 weeks. Demographics , medical status , and wound<disease> characteristics were comparable between rhEGF and placebo groups. More patients in the rhEGF group significantly had complete wound<disease> healing compared to placebo ( 73.2 % versus 50.6 % , respectively; P = .001). Wound<disease> healing velocity was faster in the rhEGF group ( P = .029) regardless of HbA1c levels. The rhEGF group had a shorter median time to 50 % ulcer<disease> size reduction ( 21 versus 35 days; hazard ratio = 3.13 , P < .001) and shorter time to complete ulcer<disease> healing ( 56 versus 84 days; hazard ratio = 2.13 , P < .001). This study confirms that application of spray-applied rhEGF in DFU patients results in faster healing velocity and higher complete healing rate regardless of HbA1c levels.
