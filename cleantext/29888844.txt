  Galectins are carbohydrate binding proteins ( lectins) , which characteristically bind Î²-galactosides. Galectins play a role in tumour progression through involvement in proliferation , metastasis , angiogenesis , immune evasion and drug resistance. There is need for inhibitors ( antagonists) that are specific for distinct galectins and that can interfere with galectin-carbohydrate interactions during cancer progression. Here , we propose that lactulose , a non-digestible galactose-fructose disaccharide , presents a novel inhibitor scaffold for design of inhibitors against galectins. Thermodynamic evaluation displays binding affinity of lactulose against the galectin-1 and galectin-3 carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD). Crystal structures of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in complex with lactulose reveal for the first time the molecular basis of the galectin-lactulose interactions. Molecular modelling was implemented to propose novel lactulose derivatives as potent anti-cancer agents.
