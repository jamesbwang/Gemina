  Face perception is susceptible to contextual influence and perceived physical similarities between emotion cues. However , studies often use structurally homogeneous facial expressions , making it difficult to explore how within-emotion variability in facial configuration affects emotion perception. This study examined the influence of context on the emotional perception of categorically identical , yet physically distinct , facial expressions of disgust. Participants categorized two perceptually distinct disgust facial expressions , `` closed '' ( i.e. , scrunched nose , closed mouth<symptom>) and `` open '' ( i.e. , scrunched nose , open mouth<symptom> , protruding tongue) , that were embedded in contexts comprising emotion postures<symptom> and scenes. Results demonstrated that the effect of nonfacial elements was significantly stronger for `` open '' disgust facial expressions than `` closed '' disgust facial expressions. These findings provide support that physical similarity within discrete categories of facial expressions is mutable and plays an important role in affective face perception. ( PsycINFO Database Record
