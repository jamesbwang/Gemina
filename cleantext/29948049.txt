  Bladder cancer is a major public health concern and the treatment options available are unable to significantly prevent disease recurrence and progression. The need for experimental tumor models to efficiently reproduce the pathology of human cancers has prompted researchers to attempt various approaches. A PubMed search combining the MeSH bladder cancer and models was executed in March 2017. We review the advantages and limitations of currently available in vitro 2D and 3D bladder cancer models as well as in vivo rodent models. To date , despite the description of a variety of animal models ( including transplantable , carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models) , the establishment of reliable , simple , practicable and reproducible animal models remains an ongoing challenge. Recently , sophisticated 3D culture systems have been designed to better recapitulate the phenotypic and cellular heterogeneity as well as microenvironmental aspects of in vivo tumor growth , while being more flexible to conduct repeated experiments. Selecting the most appropriate model for a specific application will maximize the conversion of potential therapies from the laboratory to clinical practice and requires an understanding of the various models available.
