  A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of multi-substituted allenes has been developed by a nickel catalyzed SN2 ' substitution reaction of propargyl esters with organic aluminium reagents under mild conditions , which gave the corresponding multi-substituted allenes in good to excellent yields ( up to 92 %) and high selectivities ( up to 99 %) at 60 Â°C for 6 h in THF. Aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in propargyl esters gave products in good yields. In addition , the multi-substituted allenes bearing a thienyl or a pyridyl group were obtained in 95-97 % selectivities with isolated yields of 72-83 %. Furthermore , the SN2 ' substitution reaction worked efficiently with propargyl carbonate compounds as well. On the basis of the experimental results , a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.
