  Metabolic Syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is a cardio-metabolic cluster that confers an increased risk of developing both diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD). The mechanisms governing the increased ASCVD risk remains to be elucidated. Moreover , lipidomics poses as an exciting new tool that has potential to shed more light on the pathogenesis of MetS. The aim of this study was to explore the lipidome in an unbiased fashion in patients with nascent MetS uncomplicated by diabetes and CVD. Patients with nascent MetS ( n = 30) without diabetes or ASCVD and controls ( n = 20) who participated in the study had normal hepatic and renal function. Early morning urine samples from patients were collected and frozen at -70 Â° until analysis. Lipidomic analyses were undertaken at the National Institute of Health Western Metabolomics Center. Phosphatidylcholine 34:2 , PC ( 34:2) was significantly increased in patients with MetS compared to controls. PC ( 34:2) had a significant positive correlation with waist circumference , plasma glucose , free fatty acid , and triglyceride levels. It had a significant positive correlation with pro-inflammatory markers such as plasma hs CRP , IL-1b , and IL-8. Additionally , PC ( 34:2) significantly correlated positively with Leptin and inversely with adiponectin. Levels of various acyl carnitines and PC34: 1 were not significantly altered. We propose that PC ( 34:2) could emerge as a novel biomarker in MetS that promotes a pro-inflammatory state.
