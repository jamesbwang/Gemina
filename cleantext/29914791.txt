  Osteoclasts are specialised cells that resorb bone and develop from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. While there is a wealth of information on the regulation of macrophage function through metabolic activity , the connection between osteoclast differentiation and metabolism is less well understood. Recent data show that mitochondria participate in switching macrophages from an inflammatory phenotype towards differentiation into osteoclasts. Additionally , it was found that reactive oxygen species ( ROS) actively take place in osteoclast differentiation by acting as secondary signalling molecules. Bone resorption is an energy demanding process and differentiating osteoclasts triggers the biogenesis of mitochondria. In addition , the activity of specific OXPHOS components of macrophages and osteoclasts is differentially regulated. This review summarises our knowledge on macrophage-mediated inflammation<symptom> , its impact on a cell 's metabolic activity and its effect on osteoclast differentiation.
