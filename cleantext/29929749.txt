  The tripartite motif 66 ( TRIM66) is an important member of the TRIM protein superfamily , which can participate in the expression of multiple proteins , and is closely associated with the behaviors of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). In this study , we aimed to explore the effect of TRIM66 in this process in vitro using NSCLC cell lines , and the role of TRIM66 in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in NSCLC. Western blotting was used to detect the TRIM66 protein expression levels in NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B. We silenced its expression in A549 cells by transient siRNA transfection to ascertain the function of TRIM66 in NSCLC cells. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of EMT-related proteins. TRIM66 protein content was highest in NSCLC cell line A549 , compared with BEAS-2B , it showed that the TRIM66-siRNA group lung cancer cell proliferation was significantly reduced after knockdown of TRIM66 , and knockdown of TRIM66 also suppressed invasion , migration and clonogenic ability of A549 cells. Finally , we found that siRNA-mediated TRIM66 silencing suppressed EMT by downregulating expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and upregulating that of E-cadherin in NSCLC cells , which could effectively reduce the invasive , migratory , and proliferative capacities of lung cancer cells. Silence TRIM66 expression suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion , and migration. The siRNA-mediated TRIM66 silencing could block the occurrence of EMT. TRIM66 could be a promising novel target for future NSCLC treatments.
