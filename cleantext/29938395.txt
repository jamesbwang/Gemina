  HER2 + breast cancer ( BC) is an aggressive subtype with high rates of brain metastases ( BCBM). Two-thirds of HER2 + BCBM demonstrate activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway driving resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. This phase II study evaluated everolimus ( E) , a brain-permeable mTOR inhibitor , trastuzumab ( T) , and vinorelbine ( V) in patients with HER2 + BCBM. Eligible patients had progressive HER2 + BCBM. The primary endpoint was intracranial response rate ( RR); secondary objectives were CNS clinical benefit rate ( CBR) , extracranial RR , time to progression ( TTP) , overall survival ( OS) , and targeted sequencing of tumors from enrolled patients. A two-stage design distinguished intracranial RR of 5 % versus 20 %. 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity , 26 for efficacy. Intracranial RR was 4 % ( 1 PR). CNS CBR at 6 mos was 27 %; at 3 mos 65 %. Median intracranial TTP was 3.9 mos ( 95 % CI 2.2-5). OS was 12.2 mos ( 95 % CI 0.6-20.2). Grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia ( 41 %) , anemia<symptom> ( 16 %) , and stomatitis ( 16 %). Mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were common in BCBM. Mutations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway were not associated with response. ERBB2 amplification was higher in BCBM compared to primary BC; ERBB2 amplification in the primary BC trended toward worse OS. While intracranial RR to ETV was low in HER2 + BCBM patients , one-third achieved CNS CBR; TTP/OS was similar to historical control. No new toxicity signals were observed. Further analysis of the genomic underpinnings of BCBM to identify tractable prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers is warranted. ( NCT01305941).
