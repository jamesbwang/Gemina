  To study the clinical impact of respiratory viral<disease> infection<disease> in children with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF). Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary care referral centre for CF in India. Children with CF attending a pediatric chest clinic. Case records of the children with CF who had a pulmonary exacerbation with documented acute respiratory viral<disease> infection<disease> between October 2013 and December 2014 ( Group I) and an equal number of controls ( Group II) with pulmonary exacerbation in absence of acute respiratory viral<disease> infection<disease> were reviewed. The two groups were compared for the following outcomes over a period of 12-18 months: bacterial colonization , antibiotics usage , pulmonary exacerbations , numbers of outpatient visits , hospitalization and oxygen therapy and spirometric parameters. In total , 46 children ( 23 each with viral<disease> infection<disease> ( Group I) and without viral<disease> infection<disease> ( Group II)) of age 7-264 months were enrolled; baseline clinical status and pulmonary function tests were comparable. Mean ( SD) follow-up duration in those who had viral<disease> infection<disease> and who had no viral<disease> infection<disease> was 15.7 ( 7.1) and 17.5 ( 5.4) months , respectively. On follow-up , children with viral<disease> infection<disease> ( Group I) had adverse outcome in form of greater worsening of Shwachman clinical scores , number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic usage ( 4 ( 2.1 %)) and ( 2.8 ( 1.7 %)) , need for intravenous antibiotics 30.4 % vs. 8.7 % , hospitalization rates 31.8 % vs. 4.3 % and mortality 30.4 % vs. 4.7 % , respectively. Acute viral<disease> infection<disease> in children with CF affected course of illness on follow-up , including frequent and severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization , intravenous antibiotics , decline in CF scores and increased mortality over next 12-18 months.
