  Seasonal variability of dissolved and particulate methylmercury ( F-MeHg , P-MeHg) concentrations was studied in the waters of the Amazon River and its associated Curuai floodplain during hydrological year 2005-2006 , to understand the MeHg exchanges between these aquatic systems. In the oxic white water lakes , with neutral pH , high F-MeHg and P-MeHg concentrations were measured during the rising water stage ( 0.70 ± 0.37 pmol/L , n = 26) and flood peak ( 14.19 ± 9.32 pmol/g , n = 7) respectively , when the Amazon River water discharge into the lakes was at its maximum. The lowest mean values were reported during the dry season ( 0.18 ± 0.07 pmol/L F-MeHg , n = 10 and 1.35 ± 1.24 pmol/g P-MeHg , n = 8) , when water and suspended sediments were outflowing from the lakes into the River. In these lakes , the MeHg concentrations were associated to the aluminium and organic carbon/nitrogen changes. In the black water lakes , with acidic pH and reducing conditions , elevated MeHg concentrations were recorded ( 0.58 ± 0.32 pmol/L F-MeHg , n = 16 and 19.82 ± 15.13 pmol/g P-MeHg , n = 6) , and correlated with the organic carbon and manganese concentrations. Elevated values of MeHg partition coefficient ( 4.87 < K
