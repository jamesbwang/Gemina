  The use of cyanoacrylate for intravenous catheter securement is of interest to clinicians and patients , because of the superior adhesive strength and hemostatic effect of cyanoacrylate compared to current securement devices. The purpose of this study is to use novel in vitro and in vivo testing methods to analyze the hemostatic effect of a catheter securement cyanoacrylate ( cyanoacrylate). An unprecedented in vitro method was performed to determine the effects of a cyanoacrylate on a customized modified activated clotting time assay and blood flow inhibition assay by exposing blood or plasma to either one or three drops of cyanoacrylate. For the in vivo testing , full-thickness incisions were made on swine , and the bleeding was scored prior to treatment and at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 min after treatment. The cyanoacrylate rapidly achieved hemostasis in the presence of anticoagulated whole blood , platelet-poor plasma , and non-anticoagulated whole blood , in vitro. The cyanoacrylate achieved hemostasis 12-fold faster than thromboplastin in the modified activated clotting time assay. The cyanoacrylate does not alter normal blood clotting , as measured by prothrombin time. In vivo , the bleeding score of cyanoacrylate prior to treatment and at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 min after treatment were 2.3 ± 1.0 , 0.3 ± 0.5 , 0.2 ± 0.5 , 0.2 ± 0.4 , and 0.2 ± 0.4 , respectively. This study indicates that cyanoacrylate demonstrates a potent mechanical hemostatic effect and cyanoacrylate in the presence of anticoagulated whole blood has an activated clotting time that is 12 times quicker than thromboplastin. The cyanoacrylate was found to be significantly equivalent to two known hemostatic agents , in vivo.
