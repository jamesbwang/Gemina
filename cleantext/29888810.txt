  Renal transplantation remains the definitive treatment for end-stage renal disease ( ESRD). The shorter renal vein in right donor nephrectomies is associated with higher incidence of technical failure. We present here our experience with autologous internal jugular vein ( IJV) conduits to facilitate living-donor transplants. Six patients underwent right , living-donor kidney transplant with simultaneous IJV harvest over a 1-year period. All had bilateral jugular duplex scans preoperatively and were placed on aspirin 81 mg postoperatively. Patient demographics , comorbidities , and laboratories were retrospectively queried. Postoperative follow-up and examination were performed per institutional protocol. The mean age and BMI were 51 ± 4.6 years and 30 ± 1.4 kg/m
