  Sirolimus-based graft vs. host disease ( GVHD) prophylaxis is associated with higher incidence of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome<disease> ( VOD/SOS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT). However , whether the clinical manifestations and prognosis of VOD/SOS differs when diagnosed in the setting of sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis is not well studied. To address this question , we examined presenting features and treatment outcome of VOD/SOS cases identified in a large retrospective cohort of consecutive HCT procedures ( n = 818 total , sirolimus ( SIR)/ tacrolimus ( TAC) n = 308 , and methotrexate ( MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF)/ TAC n = 510). In multivariate analysis , sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis ( p = 0.006 , HR 3.33 , 1.94-5.7) increased risk for VOD/SOS. A total of 58 patients were clinically diagnosed with VOD/SOS ( SIR/TAC 38/308 , 12.3 % , vs. MTX or MMF/TAC 20/510 , 3.9 %). VOD/SOS diagnosed following SIR/TAC prophylaxis demonstrated later time of onset ( median 39 vs. 26 days; p = 0.005) , less severe hyperbilirubinemia ( Bili > 2 , 65 % vs. 90 % p = 0.04) , lesser degree of weight gain ( weight gain > 5 % , 52 % vs 80 % , p = 0.04) , and more frequent complete resolution of hepatic injury ( 79 % vs. 55 % , p = 0.05). Presenting features and natural history of VOD/SOS in the context of SIR/TAC GVHD prophylaxis differ and thus warrant particular clinical attention to later hepatic injury in these patients.
