  Accumulating evidence supports the concept of the amygdala as a complex of structurally and functionally heterogeneous nuclei rather than as a single homogeneous structure. However , changes in resting-state functional connectivity in amygdalar subregions have not been investigated in major depressive disorder ( MDD). Here , we explored whether amygdalar subregions- including the laterobasal , centromedial ( CM) and superficial ( SF) areas- exhibited distinct disruption patterns for different dynamic functional connectivity ( dFC) properties , and whether these different properties were correlated with clinical information in patients with MDD. Thirty untreated patients with first-episode MDD and 62 matched controls were included. We assessed between-group differences in the mean strength of dFC in each amygdalar subregion in the whole brain using general linear model analysis. The patients with MDD showed decreased strength in positive dFC between the left CM/SF and brainstem and between the left SF and left thalamus; they showed decreased strength in negative dFC between the left CM and right superior frontal gyrus ( The definitions of amygdalar subregions were based on a cytoarchitectonic delineation , and the temporal resolution of the fMRI was slow ( repetition time = 2 s). These findings confirm the distinct dynamic functional pathway of amygdalar subregions in MDD and suggest that the limbic-cortical-striato-pallido-thalamic circuitry plays a crucial role in the early stages of MDD.
