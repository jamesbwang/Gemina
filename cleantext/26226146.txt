  Human cell-based 3D tissue constructs play an increasing role in disease modeling and drug screening. Inflammation<symptom> , atherosclerosis , and many autoimmune disorders involve the interactions between immune cells and blood vessels. However , it has been difficult to image and model these interactions under realistic conditions. In this study , we fabricated a perfusion and imaging chamber to allow the real-time visualization of leukocyte perfusion , adhesion , and migration inside a tissue-engineered blood vessel ( TEBV). We monitored the elevated monocyte adhesion to the TEBV wall and transendothelial migration ( TEM) as the TEBV endothelium was activated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. We demonstrated that treatment with anti-TNF-α or an NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitor would attenuate the endothelium activation and reduce the number of leukocyte adhesion ( > 74 %) and TEM events ( > 87 %) close to the control. As the first demonstration of real-time imaging of dynamic cellular events within a TEBV , this work paves the way for drug screening and disease modeling in TEBV-associated microphysiological systems.
