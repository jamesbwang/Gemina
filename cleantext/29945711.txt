  Progesterone prophylaxis is widely used to prevent preterm birth but is not licensed and there is little information on long-term outcome. To determine the effect of progesterone prophylaxis in women at high risk of preterm birth on obstetric , neonatal and childhood outcomes. Double-blind , randomised placebo-controlled trial. Obstetric units in the UK and Europe between February 2009 and April 2013. Women with a singleton pregnancy who are at high risk of preterm birth because of either a positive fibronectin test or a negative fibronectin test , and either previous spontaneous birth at â‰¤ 34 weeks Fibronectin test at 18 There were three primary outcomes , as follows: ( 1) obstetric- fetal death or delivery before 34 In total , 96 out of 600 ( 16 %) women in the progesterone group and 108 out of 597 ( 18 %) women in the placebo group had the primary obstetric outcome ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.86 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.61 to 1.22). Thirty-nine out of 589 ( 7 %) babies of women in the progesterone group and 60 out of 587 ( 10 %) babies of women in the placebo group experienced the primary neonatal outcome ( OR 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.38 to 1.03). The mean Bayley-III cognitive composite score of the children at 2 years of age was 97.3 points ( standard deviation ( SD) 17.9 points; Overall compliance with the intervention was 69 %. There were no major harms , although there was a trend of more deaths from trial entry to 2 years in the progesterone group ( 20/600) than in the placebo group ( 16/598) ( OR 1.26 , 95 % CI 0.65 to 2.42). In this study , progesterone had no significant beneficial or harmful effects on the primary obstetric , neonatal or childhood outcomes.The OPPTIMUM trial is now complete. We intend to participate in a comprehensive individual patient-level data meta-analysis examining women with a singleton pregnancy with a variety of risk factors for preterm birth. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN14568373. This trial was funded by the Medical Research Council ( MRC) and managed by the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR) on behalf of the MRC-NIHR partnership.
