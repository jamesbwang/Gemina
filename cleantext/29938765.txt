  Why some animals can regenerate and others not has fascinated biologists since the first examples of regeneration were reported. Although many animal phyla include species with some regenerative ability , mainly restricted to particular cell types or tissues , there are some other species capable of regenerating complex structures , such as the vertebrate limb and heart. More remarkably , there are some examples of animals that can regenerate the whole body from a tiny piece of them. Understanding how regeneration is triggered and achieved in these animals is fundamental not only to understand this fascinating primary biological question , but also because of its implications for the field of regenerative medicine. Here , we discuss one of the models with higher regenerative capabilities: the freshwater planarians. Two key features make planarians an attractive model to study regeneration: the presence of adult pluripotent stem cells and the permanent activation of the morphogenetic mechanisms that instruct cell fate. Here , we revise our current knowledge of key events that lead to successful regeneration including: how heterogeneous is the stem cell population; what are the immediate changes at the gene level after amputation and what triggers the regenerative response; how is axial polarity re-established; how do the different cell types differentiate from lineage-committed progenitors and how is size and organ proportionality controlled. Finally , we point out some open questions that the field needs to address in the near future.
