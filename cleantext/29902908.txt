  To investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of active constituents of Guhong injection in rats with cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. The middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) model was established in our studies , and then all the rats received iv administration of Guhong injection ( 2.1 mL · kg ⁻¹). The blood concentrations of aceglutamide and hydroxysafflor yellow A ( HSYA) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) method at different time points. The concentration-time curves were drawn and pharmacokinetic data were obtained by DAS 3.2.6 software. The results showed that aceglutamide and HSYA showed good linear relationship within the ranges of 1.5-500 mg · L ⁻¹ ( R ² = 0.997 5) and 0.33-40 mg · L ⁻¹ ( R ² = 0.998 9) respectively. This quantitative method showed a high recovery rate , good precision and stability. The main pharmacokinetics parameters of t1/2α , t1/2β , CL ₁ , CL ₂ , AUC0-t , AUC0- ∞ , Vd1 , and Vd2 were ( 0.139 ± 0.007) and ( 0.155 ± 0.017) h , ( 0.803 ± 0.046) and ( 2.233 ± 0.410) h , ( 0.016 ± 0) and ( 0.149 ± 0.018) L · h ⁻¹ · kg ⁻¹ , ( 0.015 ± 0.001) and ( 0.446 ± 0.016) L · h ⁻¹ · kg ⁻¹ , ( 133.335 ± 3.844) and ( 9.298 ± 0.179) mg · h · L ⁻¹ , ( 143.851 ± 3.595) and ( 14.464 ± 1.451) mg · h · L ⁻¹ , ( 0.009 ± 0.001) and ( 0.223 ± 0.007) L · kg ⁻¹ , ( 0.006 ± 0.001) and ( 0.212 ± 0.032) L · kg ⁻¹ , respectively. The results showed that the established HPLC method was highly specific , and could be used for the simultaneous detection of aceglutamide and HSYA of Guhong injection in MCAO rats , which was conducive to pharmacokinetic studies. Pharmacokinetic data and parameters could provide reference for continuous administration and interval administration of the drug.
