  Amechanism of thermal dry etching process of cobalt thin films by using 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedione ( hexafluoroacetylacetone , hfacH) was investigated. This process , relevant to atomic layer etching ( ALE) technology directed towards oxidized cobalt films , requires adsorption of molecular organic precursor , such as hfacH , at moderate temperatures and is often thought of as releasing water and Co ( hfac)
