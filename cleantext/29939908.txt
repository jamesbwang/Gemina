  The aim of this study was to assess the role of hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( HepB) infection in the causation of pancreatic cancer and the predictors of pancreatic cancer and mortality. We identified pancreatic cancer patients 11 to 70 years of age from the 2013-2014 National Inpatient Sample. Pearson χ test and Student 's t-test were used for categorical and continuous variables , respectively. We assessed the association of HepB and pancreatic cancer and the independent mortality predictors by multivariate analyses. Of 69,210 pancreatic cancer patients , 175 patients with a history of HepB and 69,035 patients without a history of HepB were identified. Compared with the pancreatic cancer-non-HepB group , the pancreatic cancer-HepB group consisted more of younger ( mean , 60.4 ( standard deviation , 7.4) years vs 68.2 ( standard deviation , 12.1) years) , male , black , and Asian patients with low household income and nonelective admissions. The odds of developing pancreatic cancer among the HepB patients were significantly higher ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.24; 95 % confidence interval , 1.056-1.449; P = 0.008). Black race , age ≥ 65 years , and male sex demonstrated greater odds of mortality. This study concluded up to a 24 % increased likelihood of pancreatic cancer among the HepB patients. Blacks showed greater odds of pancreatic cancer and related mortality.
