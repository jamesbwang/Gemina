  An enzyme mixture containing bromelain ( NexoBrid ®) was found to be suitable for enzymatic debridement of burn wounds<disease> , as determined by the criteria of patient comfort and pain , selectivity , and efficiency. Nevertheless , daily experience showed that pretreatment of burn wounds<disease> with several other clinical agents may inhibit debridement efficiency. Therefore , the current study was performed to identify those agents and evaluate their debridement inhibition capabilities. The impact of several common agents as well pH , on NexoBrid ® debridement efficiency was evaluated in vitro. A collagen-based dermal substitute ( MatriDerm ®) was exposed to NexoBrid ® in the presence of different agents of varying concentrations. Digestion was documented. The criteria used for judging digestion were independently classified by 3 investigators at least 3 times in succession. When a low concentration ( 1.0 mg/ml) of NexoBrid ® was used , a ≥ 50 % concentration of Prontosan ® had an impact on enzymatic activity. Comparable results were obtained when even lower concentrations of Octenisept ® ( ≥ 10 %) were used. A 100-µmol/L concentration of copper inhibited the enzymatic activity of both a low ( 1.0 mg/ml) and high ( 10 mg/ml) concentration of NexoBrid ®. Silver-sulfadiazine at concentrations of 10 % and 90 % inhibited the activity of 1 mg/ml NexoBrid ®. No complete inhibition of NexoBrid ® activity occurred at any concentration of iron. We recommend using polyhexanide-containing agents ( Prontosan ®) to rinse and presoak burn wounds<disease> Pretreatment of burn wounds<disease> with agents containing silver and copper should be avoided. Experimentally , we found a partial inhibition of NexoBrid ® activity at the distinct pH values of 3 and 11.
