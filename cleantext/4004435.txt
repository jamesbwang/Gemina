  The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Tai Chi Chuan on static and dynamic balance<symptom> , and functional fitness in older adults. Forty-nine volunteers were divided into an exercise group ( EX: 9 men and 16 women , average age 72 ± 5 years) and control group ( 13 men and 11 women , average age 73 ± 6 years). The EX participated in a 12-week supervised exercise program ( 60 min/day , 2 days/week) that consisted of 10-min warm-up and stretching , 40-min Tai Chi Chuan exercise ( long-form Yang style with 108 movements) , and 10-min cool-down/relaxation exercises. The control group was asked to not change their physical activity habits. Static ( sway velocity standing on firm or foam surfaces with eyes open or closed) and dynamic balance<symptom> ( limits of stability ( LOS)) , as well as functional fitness measures of body mass; upper- and lower-body strength; and flexibility , mobility , and aerobic fitness were taken before and after the intervention. After the 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise program , there were no improvements in any functional fitness or balance<symptom> variable although components of LOS tended to increase ( 13.1 % , p = 0.052). These results indicate that 12 weeks of Tai Chi Chuan exercise has no significant effect on balance<symptom> and functional fitness parameters in older Japanese adults.
