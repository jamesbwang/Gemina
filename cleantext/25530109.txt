  Canola is one of the most economically important crops in Canada , and the root and rhizosphere microbiomes of a canola plant likely impact its growth and nutrient uptake. The aim of this study was to determine whether canola has a core root microbiome ( i.e. , set of microbes that are consistently selected in the root environment) , and whether this is distinct from the core microbiomes of other crops that are commonly grown in the Canadian Prairies , pea , and wheat. We also assessed whether selected agronomic treatments can modify the canola microbiome , and whether this was associated to enhanced yield. We used a field experiment with a randomized complete block design , which was repeated at three locations across the canola-growing zone of Canada. Roots and rhizosphere soil were harvested at the flowering stage of canola. We separately isolated total extractable DNA from plant roots and from adjacent rhizosphere soil , and constructed MiSeq amplicon libraries for each of 60 samples , targeting bacterial , and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the fungal ITS region. We determined that the microbiome of the roots and rhizosphere of canola was consistently different from those of wheat and pea. These microbiomes comprise several putative plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria , including
