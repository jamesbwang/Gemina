  In this longitudinal study , we applied linear regression analyses to examine season of birth as related to symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) in early midlife. We gathered longitudinal data on a prospective cohort of community-dwelling men and women ( N = 548) followed from adolescence to early midlife. The findings indicate that , as compared with participants who were born in the summer , those who were born in the spring ( Beta = 0.34; t-statistic = 3.59; p < 0.001) had significantly more ADHD symptoms. In addition , exposure to maternal cigarette smoking in adolescence significantly intensified ( p < 0.01) the association between season of birth and ADHD symptoms in early midlife. These findings suggest that exposure to greater maternal maladaptive behaviors , such as cigarette smoking , may result in a greater vulnerability to other environmental risk factors , such as season of birth.
