  Due to the presence of the rotational mode and the distributed surface charges , the dynamical behavior of polyatomic ions in water differs considerably from those of the monatomic ions. However , their fascinating dynamical properties have drawn scant attention. We carry out theoretical and computational studies of a series of well-known polyatomic ions , namely , sulfate , nitrate , and acetate ions. All three ions exhibit different rotational diffusivity , with that of the nitrate ion being considerably larger than the other two. They all defy the hydrodynamic laws of size dependence. Study of the local structure around the ions provides valuable insight into the origin of these differences. We carry out a detailed study of the rotational diffusion of these ions by extensive computer simulation and by using the theoretical approaches of the dielectric friction developed by Fatuzzo-Mason ( FM) and Nee-Zwanzig ( NZ) , and subsequently generalized by Alavi and Waldeck. A critical element of the FM-NZ theory is the decomposition of the total rotational friction , Î¶
