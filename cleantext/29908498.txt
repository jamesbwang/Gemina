  To test the hypothesis that nutrient-limited conditions can determine the responses of nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) stoichiometry to N addition , a meta-analysis was conducted to identify the different responses of foliar N and P concentrations and N-to-P ratios to N addition under N limitation , N and P co-limitation and P limitation. N addition increased the foliar N-to-P ratios and N concentrations by 46.2 % and 30.2 % , respectively , under N limitation , by 18.7 % and 19.7 % under N and P co-limitation , and by 4.7 % and 12.9 % under P limitation. However , different responses of foliar P concentrations to N addition were observed under different nutrient limitations , and negative , positive , and neutral effects on P concentrations were observed under N limitation , P limitation and N and P co-limitation , respectively. Generally , the effects of N addition on N-to-P ratios and N concentrations in herbaceous plants were dramatically larger than those in woody plants ( with the exception of the N-to-P ratio under N limitation) , but the opposite situation was true for P concentrations. The changes in N-to-P ratios were closely correlated with the changes in N and P concentrations , indicating that the changes in both N and P concentrations due to N addition can drive N and P stoichiometry , but the relative sizes of the contributions of N and P varied greatly with different nutrient limitations. Specifically , the changes in N-to-P ratios may indicate a minimum threshold , which is consistent with the homeostatic mechanism. In brief , increasing N deposition may aggravate P limitation under N-limited conditions but improve P limitation under P-limited conditions. The findings highlight the importance of nutrient-limited conditions in the stoichiometric response to N addition , thereby advancing our ability to predict global plant growth with increasing N deposition in the future.
