  Dorsoventral ( DV) patterning of the otocyst gives rise to formation of the morphologically and functionally complex membranous labyrinth composed of unique dorsal and ventral sensory organs. DV patterning results from extracellular signaling by secreted growth factors , which presumably form reciprocal concentration gradients across the DV axis of the otocyst. Previous work suggested a model in which two important growth factors , bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) and SHH , undergo crosstalk through an intersecting pathway to coordinate DV patterning. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA) lies at the heart of this pathway. Here , we provide further evidence that PKA signaling coordinates DV patterning , showing that both BMPs and SHH regulate cAMP levels , with BMPs increasing levels in the dorsal otocyst and SHH decreasing levels in the ventral otocyst. This , in turn , results in regional changes in the subcellular distribution of the catalytic domain of PKA , as well as DV regulation of PKA activity , increasing it dorsally and decreasing it ventrally. These new results fill an important gap in our previous understanding of how ligand signaling acts intracellularly during otocyst DV patterning and early morphogenesis , thereby initiating the series of events leading to formation of the inner ear sensory organs that function in balance<symptom> and hearing.
