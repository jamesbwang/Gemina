  We study explosive percolation ( EP) on an Erdös-Rényi network for product rule ( PR) and sum rule ( SR). Initially , it was claimed that EP describes discontinuous phase transition; now it is well accepted as a probabilistic model for thermal continuous phase transition ( CPT). However , no model for CPT is complete unless we know how to relate its observable quantities with those of thermal CPT. To this end , we define entropy and specific heat , redefine susceptibility , and show that they behave exactly like their thermal counterparts. We obtain the critical exponents ν , α , β , and γ numerically and find that both PR and SR belong to the same universality class and obey Rushbrooke inequality.
