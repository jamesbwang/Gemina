  Interleukin-12 ( IL12) ( p35/p40 complex) is a heterodimeric cytokine with potent anti-tumor activity. However , its short serum half-life and high dose-related toxicities limit its clinical efficacy. Here , we constructed heterodimeric immunoglobulin Fc-fused mouse IL12 ( mIL12) in a monovalent binding format ( mono-mIL12-Fc) to generate long-acting mIL12 in the naturally occurring heterodimeric form. Mono-mIL12-Fc exhibited a much longer plasma half-life than recombinant mIL12 , enabling twice-weekly systemic injections to remove established tumors in syngeneic mouse models. Mono-mIL12-Fc was more potent than wild-type Fc-based bivalent-binding IL12-Fc ( bi-mIL12-Fc) for eradicating large established immunogenic tumors without noticeable toxicities by enhancing interferon-Î³ production and the proliferation of immune effector cells in tumors. More importantly , mono-mIL12-Fc triggered weaker IL12 signaling than bi-mIL12-Fc , favoring the generation of functional and protective memory CD8
