  Degludec ( IDeg) is an ultralong-acting insulin , with stable pharmacodynamic profile which leads to lower fluctuations in glucose levels. The effect of IDeg has not been specifically assessed in patients with unstable diabetes , defined as increased glycemic variability ( GV). A prospective before-after pilot study was conducted , including patients managed at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in BogotÃ¡ , Colombia. The impact of the switch from a Glargine or Detemir insulin to a basal insulin regimen with IDeg for 12 weeks on GV measured by continuous glucose monitoring , on A1c levels , and on the incidence of episodes of global and nocturnal hypoglycemia was assessed in a group of patients with ( coefficient of variation > 34 %) or without increased basal GV using a Generalised Estimating Equation ( GEE) analysis. 60 patients with basal bolus therapy and history of hypoglycemia were included. 18 patients had High GV ( HGV). In this group a significant reduction of 11.1 % of CV ( 95 % CI: 6.3 , 15.9 , p = 0.01) was found. GEE analysis confirmed a higher impact over time on patients with HGV ( p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia decreased from 66.6 % to 22.2 % ( p = 0.02) and from 37.14 % to 5.71 % ( p < 0.01) for global and nocturnal hypoglycemia , respectively. Changes were not significant in patients with low GV. A reduction of A1c was observed in both groups ( p < 0.001). The results suggest that treatment with IDeg reduces GV , A1c levels and the incidence of global and nocturnal hypoglycemia events in patients with HGV , but not in patients with low GV.
