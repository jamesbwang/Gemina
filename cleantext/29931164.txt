  Individuals with total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) often experience pain and reduced balance<symptom> control , which may predispose them to greater fall risk. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and circumstance of falls and fall-related risk factors within a 6-month follow-up period in individuals after TKA. This study was a prospective cohort study. Knee proprioception<symptom> , the Balance<symptom> Systems Evaluation Test , knee pain , knee extension and flexion muscle strength , knee range of motion , and balance<symptom> confidence were evaluated in 134 individuals ( 39 men , 95 women; mean age = 66.3 years ( SD = 6.6 years)) 4 weeks after TKA. Monthly follow-up sessions , via face-to-face or telephone interviews , were implemented to obtain data on fall incidence over 6 months. Twenty-three individuals after TKA ( 17.2 %) sustained at least 1 fall during the 6-month follow-up period. The median time of the first fall episode was 15 weeks after TKA. Of the 31 fall episodes , most occurred during walking ( 67.7 %). Slipping ( 35.5 %) and tripping ( 35.5 %) were identified as the most frequent causes of falling. Most falls occurred at home ( 45.2 %) or another indoor environments ( 29.0 %). Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that younger age ( odds ratio: 0.91) , reduced proprioception<symptom> of the knee that had undergone surgery ( `` operated knee '') ( odds ratio: 1.62) , reduced sensory orientation ( odds ratio: 0.92) , and greater operated knee pain ( odds ratio: 1.68) were significantly associated with more falls during the follow-up period. The results of this study may be generalizable only up to 6 months after TKA. Intervention efforts should target deficits in knee proprioception<symptom> and sensory orientation and operated knee pain to prevent future falls in individuals with TKA.
