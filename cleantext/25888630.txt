  Holmes tremor<symptom> ( HT) is a rare movement disorder that is typically associated with cerebellar , thalamic or brainstem lesions<symptom> following a delay. Treatment of HT with deep brain stimulation ( DBS) has yielded positive results however; it is unclear which deep brain targets provide optimal therapeutic effects. Here we describe a case report in which a 34 year old man with HT treated successfully with DBS. The ventrointermediate nucleus ( VIM) of the thalamus was considered as the initial target. Following electrode placement we determined that the ventral-most electrode contacts were located in the prelemniscal radiations ( Raprl). When stimulating from the Raprl contacts , the patient demonstrated robust , stable therapeutic improvements using remarkably low voltages. Our case report corroborates prior evidence suggesting the Raprl as a viable therapeutic target for treating HT with DBS.
