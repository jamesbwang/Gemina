  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction , verbal and non-verbal communication , and stereotypic behaviors. Many studies support a significant relationship between many different environmental factors in ASD etiology. These factors include increased daily exposure to various toxic metal-based environmental pollutants , which represent a cause for concern in public health. This article reviews the most relevant toxic metals , commonly found , environmental pollutants , i.e. , lead ( Pb) , mercury ( Hg) , aluminum ( Al) , and the metalloid arsenic ( As). Additionally , it discusses how pollutants can be a possible pathogenetic cause of ASD through various mechanisms including neuroinflammation in different regions of the brain , fundamentally occurring through elevation of the proinflammatory profile of cytokines and aberrant expression of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-ÎºB). Due to the worldwide increase in toxic environmental pollution , studies on the role of pollutants in neurodevelopmental disorders , including direct effects on the developing brain and the subjects ' genetic susceptibility and polymorphism , are of utmost importance to achieve the best therapeutic approach and preventive strategies.
