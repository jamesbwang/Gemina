  Odorant binding proteins and chemosensory proteins play essential roles in insect chemosensory recognition. Here we identified 9 OBPs and 9 CSPs from M. persicae transcriptome and genome. Genomic structure analysis showed that the number and length of the introns are much higher and this appears to be a unique feature of aphid OBP genes. Three M. persicae OBP genes ( OBP3/7/8) as well as CSP1/4/6 , CSP2/9 and CSP5/8 are tandem arrayed in the genome. Phylogenetic analyses of five different aphid species suggest that aphid OBPs and CSPs are conserved in single copy across all aphids ( with occasional losses) , indicating that each OBP and CSP class evolved from a single gene in the common ancestor of aphids without subsequent duplication. Motif pattern analysis revealed that aphid OBP and CSP motifs are highly conserved , and this could suggest the conserved functions of aphid OBPs and CSPs. Three OBPs ( MperOBP6/7/10) are antennae-specific expressed , five OBPs ( MperOBP2/4/5/ 8/9) are antennae-enriched expressed , consistent with their putative olfactory roles. M. persicae CSPs showed much broader expression profiles in non-sensory organs than OBPs. None of the nine MperCSPs were found antennae-specific , but five of them ( MperCSP1/2/4/ 5/6) showed higher expression levels in the legs than in other tissues. MperCSP10 mainly expressed in the antennae and legs. The broad and diverse expression patterns of M. persicae CSPs suggest their multi-functions in olfactory perception , development and other processes. This article is protected by copyright.
