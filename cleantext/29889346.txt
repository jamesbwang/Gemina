  Reported is an unanticipated mechanism of attractive electrostatic interactions of fully neutralized polyacrylic acid ( PAA) with like-charged surfactants. Amphiphilic polymer-surfactant complexes with high interfacial activity and a solubilization capacity exceeding that of conventional micelles are formed by bridging with Ca
