  To overcome the challenge imposed by the presence of biofilm and reach significant bacterial reduction of the root canals , many irrigants have been indicated during endodontic treatment , among them nanoparticles solutions. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental solutions containing silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles ( ZnO Np) and conventional endodontic irrigants against Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> biofilm , in root canals. Seventy-six extracted human teeth were biomechanically prepared and sterilized. The root canal surface was exposed to E faecalis suspension to form a 7-day-old biofilm. Four teeth were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) to confirm the presence of biofilm. The remaining teeth were randomly divided into 6 groups ( n = 12) and treated with passive ultrasonic irrigation and different solutions: G1- 0.85 % saline ( control); G2- 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHX); G3- 5 % sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl); G4- 1 % NaOCl; G5- 1 % silver nanoparticles ( Ag Np) solution; and G6- 26 % ZnO Np solution. The susceptibility of E faecalis biofilms to disinfecting solutions ( n = 10) was determined by quantification of colony-forming units. SEM analysis was also carried out to examine the biofilm structure after treatments ( n = 2). Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post hoc tests ( P < 0.05). All tested solutions showed superior effectiveness compared to 0.85 % saline ( P < 0.05). Overall , 2 % CHX presented the most effective action against E faecalis biofilm , followed by 5 % NaOCl , 1 % Ag Np , 26 % ZnO Np , and 1 % NaOCl. 1 % Ag Np and 26 % ZnO Np were effective against E faecalis biofilm similarly to conventional endodontic irrigants.
