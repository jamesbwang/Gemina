  Scimitar syndrome<disease> is a rare complex of congenital anomalies of the cardiopulmonary system. In patients with scimitar syndrome<disease> , the right pulmonary vein abnormally drains into the inferior vena cava , right atrium , coronary sinus , azygos vein , portal vein , or hepatic vein. The syndrome<disease> gets its name from the Turkish sword-like image that appears on chest x-ray. Some patients with scimitar syndrome<disease> survive in adulthood undiagnosed. Herein , we discuss positional oxygenation and hemodynamic changes associated with scimitar syndrome<disease> , especially in the left lateral decubitus position , detected during preoperative anesthetic examination in an adult patient who underwent general anesthesia for left mastectomy.
