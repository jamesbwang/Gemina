  Sensitive flow or pressure triggers are usually applied to improve ventilator response time. Conversely , too sensitive triggers can incur risk of auto-triggering , a type of asynchrony in which a breath is triggered without inspiratory muscle activity. A frequent cause of auto-triggering is cardiogenic oscillations , characterized by cyclical variations in pressure and flow waveforms caused by cardiac contractions. Our goal was to test trigger performance and capacity to abolish auto-triggering in 5 different ICU ventilators using different simulated levels of cardiogenic oscillations. A mechanical breathing simulator was used to test 5 different ICU ventilators ' trigger response time and capacity to minimize auto-triggering in conditions with 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 1 cm H Larger cardiogenic oscillations were associated with more frequent auto-triggering. To avoid auto-triggering , less sensitive triggers were required ( +2.51 L/min per 1 cm H More sensitive triggers led to faster ventilator response , but also to more frequent auto-triggering. To avoid auto-triggering , less sensitive triggers were required , with consequent slower trigger response. To compare trigger performance in a scenario that more closely represents clinical practice , evaluation of the tradeoff between time delay and frequency of auto-triggering should be considered.
