  A comprehensive monitoring of fitness , fatigue<symptom> , and performance is crucial for understanding an athlete 's individual responses to training to optimize the scheduling of training and recovery strategies. Resting and exercise-related heart rate measures have received growing interest in recent decades and are considered potentially useful within multivariate response monitoring , as they provide non-invasive and time-efficient insights into the status of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS) and aerobic fitness. In team sports , the practical implementation of athlete monitoring systems poses a particular challenge due to the complex and multidimensional structure of game demands and player and team performance , as well as logistic reasons , such as the typically large number of players and busy training and competition schedules. In this regard , exercise-related heart rate measures are likely the most applicable markers , as they can be routinely assessed during warm-ups using short ( 3-5 min) submaximal exercise protocols for an entire squad with common chest strap-based team monitoring devices. However , a comprehensive and meaningful monitoring of the training process requires the accurate separation of various types of responses , such as strain , recovery , and adaptation , which may all affect heart rate measures. Therefore , additional information on the training context ( such as the training phase , training load , and intensity distribution) combined with multivariate analysis , which includes markers of ( perceived) wellness and fatigue<symptom> , should be considered when interpreting changes in heart rate indices. The aim of this article is to outline current limitations of heart rate monitoring , discuss methodological considerations of univariate and multivariate approaches , illustrate the influence of different analytical concepts on assessing meaningful changes in heart rate responses , and provide case examples for contextualizing heart rate measures using simple heuristics. To overcome current knowledge deficits and methodological inconsistencies , future investigations should systematically evaluate the validity and usefulness of the various approaches available to guide and improve the implementation of decision-support systems in ( team) sports practice.
