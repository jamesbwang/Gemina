  Ovarian carcinoma histotypes are critical for research and patient management and currently assigned by a combination of histomorphology +/- ancillary immunohistochemistry ( IHC). We aimed to validate the previously described IHC algorithm ( Calculator of Ovarian carcinoma Subtype/histotype Probability version 3 , COSPv3) in an independent population-based cohort , and to identify problem areas for IHC predictions. Histotype was abstracted from cancer registries for eligible ovarian carcinoma cases diagnosed from 2002 to 2011 in Alberta and British Columbia , Canada. Slides were reviewed according to World Health Organization 2014 criteria , tissue microarrays were stained with and scored for the 8 COSPv3 IHC markers , and COSPv3 histotype predictions were calculated. Discordant cases for review and COSPv3 prediction were arbitrated by integrating morphology with IHC results. The integrated histotype ( N = 880) was then used to identify areas of inferior COSPv3 performance. Review histotype and integrated histotype demonstrated 93 % agreement suggesting that IHC information revises expert review in up to 7 % of cases. There was also 93 % agreement between COSPv3 prediction and integrated histotype. COSPv3 errors predominated in 4 areas: endometrioid carcinoma ( EC) versus clear cell ( N = 23) , EC versus low-grade serous ( N = 15) , EC versus high-grade serous ( N = 11) , and high-grade versus low-grade serous ( N = 6). Most problems were related to Napsin A-negative clear cell , WT1-positive EC , and p53 IHC wild-type high-grade serous carcinomas. Although 93 % of COSPv3 prediction accuracy was validated , some histotyping required integration of morphology with ancillary test results. Awareness of these limitations will avoid overreliance on IHC and misclassification of histotypes for research and clinical management.
