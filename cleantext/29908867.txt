  To compare outcomes of men with or without calcified plaques undergoing collagenase clostridium<pathogen> histolyticum ( CCH) injections for Peyronie 's Disease ( PD) and identify predictors of CCH success. From March 2014 through January 2017 , data were prospectively collected on 192 patients who underwent 1-4 cycles of CCH for the treatment of PD. Of these , 115 completed ≥ 2 CCH cycles and had data on curvature assessment. The primary outcome was the percentage of men with > 20 % improvement in composite curvature. Univariate analysis was performed to compare rate of success based on patient and disease characteristics , and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of successful treatment. Calcified plaques were identified in 34 of 115 ( 30 %) patients. Patients with calcified plaque were younger , had longer duration of disease , and higher rates of significant erectile dysfunction. On multivariate logistic regression controlling for calcification and degrees composite curvature , non-calcified plaque ( OR 2.50; 95 % CI 1.06-6.00; p = 0.03) and curvature ≥ 60 degrees ( OR 5.01; 95 % CI 1.34-21.62; p = 0.02) were found to be significant predictors of ≥ 20 % improvement in composite curvature. When differentiated by calcification severity , those with no calcification achieved significant improvements in curvature ( 28.1 ° vs. 10.3 ° , p = 0.04) , compared to moderate ( shadowing) or severe ( > 1 cm). Plaque calcification is associated with a significantly lower rate of success of CCH therapy for PD , while greater baseline curvature is associated with increased odds of successful curvature improvement.
