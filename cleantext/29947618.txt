  The simulation accuracy of transvertebral ultrasound propagation using a multi-layered ray acoustics model based on CT-derived vertebral geometry was investigated through comparison with experimental measurements of pressure fields in ex vivo human vertebral foramen. A spherically focused transducer ( 5 cm diameter , f-number 1.2 , 514 kHz) was geometrically focused to the centre of individual thoracic vertebral foramen , through the posterior bony elements. Transducer propagation paths through the laminae and the spinous processes were tested. Simulation transducer-vertebra configurations were registered to experiment transducer-vertebra configurations , and simulation accuracy of the simulation model was evaluated for predicting maximum transmitted pressure to the canal , voxel pressure in the canal , and focal distortion. Accuracy in predicting maximum transmitted pressure was calculated by vertebra , and it is shown that simulation predicts maximum pressure with a greater degree of accuracy than a vertebra-specific insertion loss. Simulation error in voxel pressure was evaluated using root-mean-square error and cross-correlation , and found to be similar to the water-only case. Simulation accuracy in predicting focal distortion was evaluated by comparing experiment and simulation maximum pressure location and weighted > 50 % focal volume location. Average simulation error across all measurements and simulations in maximum pressure location and weighted > 50 % focal volume location were 2.3 mm and 1.5 mm , respectively. These errors are small relative to the dimensions of the transducer focus ( 4.9 mm full width half maximum) , the spinal cord ( 10 mm diameter) , and vertebral canal diameter ( 15-20 mm diameter). These results suggest that ray acoustics can be applied to simulating transvertebral ultrasound propagation.
