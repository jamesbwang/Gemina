  Readily available α,α-dichlorotoluenes enter a vicarious nucleophilic substitution ( VNS) reaction with electron-deficient arenes to give α-chlorobenzylated nitrobenzenes , as well as six- and five-membered heterocycles. Oxidation of the initially formed α-chlorobenzylic carbanions instead of protonation results in formation of diaryl ketones , providing a means for overall nucleophilic C-H benzoylation of electron-deficient aromatic rings. Alternatively , benzoylated nitroarenes can be obtained via the reaction of isolated α-chlorodiarylmethanes with sodium azide.
