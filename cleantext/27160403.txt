  The endothelium that lines the interior of blood vessels is directly exposed to blood flow. The shear stress arising from blood flow is `` sensed '' by the endothelium and is `` transduced '' into biochemical signals that eventually control vascular tone and homeostasis. Sensing and transduction of physical forces occur via signaling processes whereby the forces associated with blood flow are ''
