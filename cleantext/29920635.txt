  The purpose of this study is to describe a single institution 's 11-year experience treating children with congenital pulmonary airway malformations ( CPAMs) and pleuropulmonary blastoma ( PPB). An institutional database was sampled for all patients aged 0 to 18 years from January 1 , 2005 , to December 31 , 2015. Patients with a pathologic diagnosis of CPAM or PPB during this period were reviewed. A total of 51 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of CPAM ( CPAM patients appear to recover faster from surgery , if performed before the onset of symptoms. There may be a benefit to waiting until at least 3 months of age to complete resection in the asymptomatic patient. A low threshold for resection should be maintained in patients where delineating CPAM from PPB is difficult.
