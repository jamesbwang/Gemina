  Some studies suggest a common degenerative path might contribute to a range of shoulder diseases involving subacromial pain syndrome<disease> and full-thickness rotator cuff tears. One could therefore theorize arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair as interventions at different stages of a degenerative shoulder disease. Few studies have compared long-term outcomes after these two procedures. Matched case-controls undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair combined with subacromial decompression ( N = 180) or subacromial decompression only ( N = 180) were evaluated pre- and 7.5 years postoperatively using QuickDASH score , VAS of function , VAS of pain and VAS of satisfaction. New surgery and complications were recorded. Baseline characteristics were related to outcomes to investigate predictors of good/poor outcome. A general improvement from baseline was seen- from 51 to 14 ( QuickDASH) in the combined group and from 53 to 16 in the decompression only group. No differences in outcomes were seen between groups ( n.s.). Age above 55 at surgery predicted better VAS of function ( P = .04) while acute onset of symptoms predicted better QuickDASH in the combined group ( P = 0.03). None in the decompression group had undergone later rotator cuff repair. Major improvements in pain/function were seen at mid- to long-term after isolated arthroscopic subacromial decompression and combined decompression/rotator cuff repair. Several patient-specific factors predicting worse outcomes were identified.
