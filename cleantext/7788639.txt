  Left-sided inferior vena cava ( IVC) is the second most common anatomical anomaly of the IVC. We report a drainage pattern of the left IVC into a left duplicated superior vena cava ( SVC) diagnosed during IVC filter placement consultation. The patient was a 66-year-old man with symptomatic hematuria<symptom> caused by bladder cancer diagnosed with IVC thrombus and a left IVC found on a staging computed tomography urogram. The patient underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiogram , which ruled out pulmonary embolism , but demonstrated hemiazygous continuation of the left IVC above the diaphragm to meet a persistent left SVC ( prevalence approximately 0.3 % -0.5 %) ( Kim et al. 1995) ( 1) emptying into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. We report a novel drainage pattern of the left IVC into a duplicated left SVC via hemiazygous continuation.
