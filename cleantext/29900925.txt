  In the recent past , the level of prevalence and incidence of dental<disease> caries<disease> and periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> in India and its comparison with South-Asian neighbors have not been reported. The manuscript estimates the same using the global disease burden 2016 approach. Secondary data analysis of primary data presented by Vos et al. , 2016 , was used for this study. Data from the global burden of disease , data at https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/ and http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool , and data for permanent dental<disease> caries<disease> , periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> , and overall dental disorders for both genders ( age standardized) at prevalence , incidence , and disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs) were obtained for India and South Asian region and compared qualitatively.: For every 100,000 Indians , as compared to South Asian males ( 30,903 in every 100,000) , Indian males ( 31,489) had prevalence of dental<disease> caries<disease> Among females , the same was 33,926 for South Asians and 34,426 for Indians. Similarly , the 2016 incidence of dental<disease> caries<disease> was higher among Indians as compared to South Asians and more females suffered from dental<disease> caries<disease> than males , whereas a reversal of gender trend was observed with periodontal<disease> disease<disease> Overall dental disorder burden from 1990 to 2016 is presented. There is a difference between genders in the prevalence , incidence , and DALYs of caries<disease> of permanent dentition and that of periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. As compared to South Asia , India has more burden of dental diseases. Indian dental workforce and oral health policy need to be realigned to counter the burden of oral disorders.
