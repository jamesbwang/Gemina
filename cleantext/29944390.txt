  Oxytocin , while classically known for its role in parturition , lactation and social behavior , also has been implicated in the control of sodium homeostasis in animal models. To improve our understanding of oxytocin physiology in humans , we measured basal oxytocin levels under low and liberal dietary sodium conditions and following a peripheral Angiotensin II ( Ang II) infusion. Ten healthy individuals underwent a 6-day standardized low sodium diet and a 6-day liberal sodium diet. Each diet was followed by a graded Ang II infusion for 30 minute sequential intervals at doses of 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 ng/kg/min. Fasting serum oxytocin was assessed before and after Ang II infusion. Basal oxytocin levels ( 1498.5 ± 94.7 vs. 1663.3 ± 213.9 pg/mL , P = 0.51) did not differ after the low and liberal sodium diets. Following the Ang II infusion , Ang II levels and mean arterial pressure significantly increased as expected. In contrast , the Ang II infusion significantly lowered oxytocin levels from 1498.5 ± 94.7 vs. 1151.7 ± 118.1 pg/mL ( P < 0.001) on the low sodium diet and from 1663.3 ± 213.9 vs. 1095.2 ± 87.4 pg/mL ( P = 0.03) on the liberal sodium diet. The percent change in oxytocin following the Ang II infusion did not differ by sodium diet ( -25 ± 5 % vs. -28 ± 7 % low vs. liberal sodium conditions , P > 0.99). Dietary sodium intake did not affect circulating oxytocin levels among healthy individuals. Systemic oxytocin levels were significantly suppressed following a peripheral Ang II infusion independent of dietary sodium conditions.
