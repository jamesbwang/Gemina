  Evaluate the prevalence , trends and outcomes of minimally invasive surgical staging ( MIS) of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors ( MOGCTs) apparently confined to the ovary. Retrospective cohort study ( Canadian Task Force classification II-2) SETTING: Participating hospitals in the National Cancer Data Base PATIENTS: Women diagnosed between 2010-2014 with a MOGCT apparently confined to the ovary with information on the planned surgical approach. Staging with MIS or laparotomy MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 918 patients were identified. MIS was planned for 294 ( 32 %) patients; a laparoscopic approach was selected for 237 patients and a robotic assisted approach for 57 patients. Rate of conversion to laparotomy was 11 % ( 46 cases); 1.7 % and 15.6 % in the robotic and laparoscopy groups , p = 0.003. No difference in the use of MIS was noted based on year of diagnosis ( p = 0.38). By multivariate analysis White race , higher level of education and smaller tumor size were associated with the receipt of MIS. Patients in the MIS group were less likely to undergo lymph node dissection ( 39.6 % vs 51.3 % , p = 0.001) and omentectomy ( 18.7 % vs 28.5 % , p = 0.002). Hospital stay following surgery was shorter for patients who had MIS ( median 2 vs 3 days , p < 0.001). Unplanned 30-day readmission rate was also lower in the MIS group ( 1.4 % vs 3.9 % , p = 0.043). No difference in overall survival was noted between the two groups , p = 0.81 CONCLUSION: MIS for apparent early stage MOGCTs was less comprehensive but associated with a decreased hospital stay and unplanned readmission rate.
