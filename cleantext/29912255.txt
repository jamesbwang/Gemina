  Plasma viremia is a factor whose role in the severity of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection has been widely discussed in recent years , with divergent results found in the multiple contexts evaluated. A systematic review of the literature using the Scopus , EBSCOhost , SpringerLink , Lilacs and Scielo databases was conducted. For inclusion in the review there were considered studies that evaluated the relationship between plasma viral load and clinical manifestations or severity of the disease. We obtained 80 references in the initial search , after the application of the inclusion/ exclusion criteria 20 articles were selected. In the study of this phenomenon there are multiple parameters from which viremia should be evaluated , not only from its magnitude , but also from the post-defervescence duration and the day in which the maximum value is reported , among others. The results of the studies indicate that the characteristics of viremia may play an important role that , along with other factors of the viral ( virus serotype , type of infection) and patient context ( age , genotype , comorbidities , etc.) , determine the clinical outcome of the infection.
