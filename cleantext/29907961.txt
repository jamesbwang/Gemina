  The molecular mechanism regulating dormancy release in grapevine buds is as yet unclear. It was formerly proposed that dormancy is maintained by abscisic acid ( ABA)- mediated repression of bud-meristem activity and that removal of this repression triggers dormancy release. It was also proposed that such removal of repression may be achieved via natural or artificial up-regulation of VvA8H-CYP707A4 , which encodes ABA 8 '- hydroxylase , and is the most highly expressed paralog in grapevine buds. The current study further examines these assumptions , and its experiments reveal that ( a) hypoxia and ethylene , stimuli of bud dormancy release , enhance expression of VvA8H-CYP707A4 within grape buds , ( b) the VvA8H-CYP707A4 protein accumulates during the natural transition to the dormancy release stage , and ( c) transgenic vines overexpressing VvA8H-CYP707A4 exhibit increased ABA catabolism and significant enhancement of bud break in controlled and natural environments and longer basal summer laterals. The results suggest that VvA8H-CYP707A4 functions as an ABA degrading enzyme , and are consistent with a model in which the VvA8H-CYP707A4 level in the bud is up-regulated by natural and artificial bud break stimuli , which leads to increased ABA degradation capacity , removal of endogenous ABA-mediated repression , and enhanced regrowth. Interestingly , it also hints at sharing of regulatory steps between latent and lateral bud outgrowth.
