  Erectile dysfunction ( ED) associated with radical prostatectomy ( RP) affects 25-75 % of patients and has a significant negative impact on their quality of life AIM: To analyze the maintenance of erectile function after RP depending on the type of endoscopic access and nerve-sparing. This retrospective study comprised 231 patients with localized prostate cancer , who underwent surgery between February 2015 and February 2016. Surgery was performed using one of three approaches: laparoscopic , extraperitoneoscopic or robot-assisted. Nerve-sparing surgery was chosen were based on the Briganti nomogram ( low risk of extraprostatic extension) , Partins table , and taking into account the patients desire to maintain EF. EF and the quality of life were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF-5) questionnaire and the QoL ( Quality of Life) scale. Nerve-sparing RP was performed in 153 patients. Nerve-sparing RP did not differ significantly from non-nerve sparing RP with regard to operative time ( p = 0.064) and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( p = 0.073). According to the pathomorphological study , the prostatic capsule was intact , and surgical margins were negative in all cases. The incidence of significant ED and complete loss of erectile function was greater in patients after non-nerve sparing RP compared with nerve sparing RP ( ( 5.0 ( 0-10.0) vs. 6.5 ( 0.8-19,0) points according to the IIEF-5 scale , p = 0.271)); 96.2 % versus 72.2 % ( p < 0.001). Nerve-sparing RP had a statistically significant better effect on the quality of life: 1.63 +/ -1.16 points against 1.88 +/ -1.02 points ( p = 0.035). The best outcomes were observed in patients undergoing robot-assisted RP. Nerve-sparing RP resulted in a lower rate of ED. This advantage without compromising the completeness of resection allows us to consider nerve-sparing RP as an appropriate and validated modality of preventing erectile dysfunction in properly selected patients.
