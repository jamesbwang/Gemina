  Breast reconstruction is an important component of multidisciplinary breast cancer management. The practice of breast reconstruction after mastectomy has evolved significantly in the past decade as a result of both increasing mastectomy rates and advances in reconstructive strategy. These changes have significantly influenced the contemporary surgical management of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to examine trends in breast reconstruction after mastectomy in an Irish population. Data were reviewed from a database of all patients who had mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction at Galway University Hospital , a tertiary breast cancer referral centre , between 2004 and 2014. Trends in breast reconstruction after mastectomy were explored with respect to patient demographics , clinicopathological features , and neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Of 1303 patients who underwent mastectomy during interval studied , 706 ( 54.2 per cent) had breast reconstruction after mastectomy. In 629 patients ( 89 · 1 per cent) , breast reconstruction was performed in the immediate setting. Reconstruction rates increased over time from 20 · 5 per cent in 2004 to 44 · 7 per cent in 2014. Reconstruction was more commonly performed in younger patients and those with benign , in situ and early-stage disease. A negative relationship between radiotherapy and reconstruction was observed. A pedicled flap with or without an implant was the most commonly used reconstructive approach in patients receiving radiotherapy. Breast reconstruction after mastectomy has become the standard of care in the surgical treatment of breast cancer. Recent trends show a transition favouring implant-based approaches.
