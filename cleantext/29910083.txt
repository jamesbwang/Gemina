  Recent analyses emphasize that The Benchmark Stroke Door-to-Needle Time ( DNT) should be 30 min. This study aimed to determine if a new in-hospital IVT protocol is effective in reducing door-to-needle time and correcting previously identified factors associated with delays. In 2014 , we gradually introduced a series of measures aimed to reduce door-to-needle time for patients receiving IVT , and compared it before ( 2009-2012) and after ( 2014-2017) the new protocol was introduced. The sample included 239 patients before and 222 after the introduction of the protocol. Median overall door-to-needle time was 27 min after the protocol was fully implemented ( a 48 % reduction on previous door-to-needle time ( 52minutes) , P < .001)). Median door-to-needle time was lower when pre-hospital code stroke was activated ( 22 min). We observed a 26-min reduction in the median time from onset to treatment ( P < .001). After the protocol was implemented , the `` 3-hour-effect '' did not affect door-to-needle time time ( P = .98). Computed tomography angiography studies performed before IVT were associated with increased door-to-needle time ( P < .001); however , the test was performed after IVT was started in most cases. Hospital reorganisation and multidisciplinary collaboration brought median door-to-needle time below 30 min and corrected previously identified delay factors. Furthermore , overall time from onset to treatment was also reduced and more stroke patients were treated within 90 min of symptom onset.
