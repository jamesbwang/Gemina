  We evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography ( US) plus superb microvascular imaging ( SMI) compared with conventional US alone for diagnosing acute cholecystitis<disease> We included 54 patients with suspected biliary disease. The SMI pixel count showing flow signal was measured in the region of interest of the gallbladder bed of the liver. Two radiologists independently evaluated imaging features and rated five-point diagnostic likelihood level before versus after the additional SMI using the cutoff SMI pixel count. The SMI pixel count was significantly higher in acute than in non-acute cholecystitis<disease> ( 169.84 vs. 27.48 , p < 0.001). The optimal SMI cutoff pixel count for predicting acute cholecystitis<disease> obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve was 56.67 ( 82.8 % sensitivity , 92.0 % specificity). The area under the curve value was significantly higher after the additional SMI than before ( 0.798-0.863 vs. 0.701-0.736 , p < 0.05). US plus SMI could objectively improve diagnostic performance compared with conventional US for acute
