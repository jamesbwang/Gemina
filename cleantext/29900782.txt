  The aim of the present study is to determine the basal parameters in opossums ( Didelphis virginiana) during physical examination in Yucatan , Mexico. Sixty-six opossums were captured and manually handled for physical examinations. Sex , age , cardiac and respiratory rate , body temperature , pulse , mucous<symptom> membranes<symptom> , capillary refill time , hydration , size of superficial lymph nodes , mental<symptom> status<symptom> , and body condition were evaluated. Also , comparisons between rectal and auricular temperatures were performed. The means of physiological parameters obtained were: cardiac frequency 146 beats per minute ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 138.91-155.24) , respiratory frequency 27.33 breaths per minute ( 95 % CI: 25.15-29.64) , and body temperature 34.01 °C ( 95 % CI: 33.71-34.31). In 54 % of animals , a sinus arrhythmia was present. A significant difference was found between rectal and auricular temperature measurements. A variation of -1.64 to 1.14 °C was obtained via the auricular thermometer compared with the rectal device.
