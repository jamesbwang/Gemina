  In activated sludge ( AS) process , the impact of the operational parameters on process efficiency is assumed to be correlated with the sludge properties. This study provides a better insight into these interactions by subjecting a laboratory-scale AS system to a sequence of operating condition modifications enabling typical situations of a wastewater treatment plant to be represented. Process performance was assessed and AS floc morphology ( size , circularity , convexity , solidity and aspect ratio) was quantified by measuring 100,000 flocs per sample with an automated image analysis technique. Introducing 3D distributions , which combine morphological properties , allowed the identification of a filamentous bulking characterized by a floc population shift towards larger sizes and lower solidity and circularity values. Moreover , a washout phenomenon was characterized by smaller AS flocs and an increase in their solidity. Recycle ratio increase and COD: N ratio decrease both promoted a slight reduction of floc sizes and a constant evolution of circularity and convexity values. The analysis of the volume-based 3D distributions turned out to be a smart tool to combine size and shape data , allowing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of floc structure under process disturbances.
