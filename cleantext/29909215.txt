  Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) is a non-invasive high-resolution imaging technique which was suggested to be a powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. The objective of our study is to assess the pattern of retinal OCT changes in patients with visual pathway tumors. A prospective clinical study was conducted and patients with single cerebral tumors with potential of compression on the visual pathway were included. Patients with multiple and/or metastatic tumors were excluded. Each patient underwent neurosurgical and ophthalmological evaluation , cranial-cerebral MRI , and ocular OCT in both eyes. The OCT parameters included circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ( average and sector thickness) and retinal thickness in the macular area ( average and sector thickness). Fifty patients were investigated clinically and by MRI , and 18 patients were excluded. Thirty-two patients were eligible for the study and completed the retinal OCT.. Eighteen patients had tumors with compressive potential on the optic chiasm , 11 patients had tumors close to the optic radiations , and 3 patients had tumors in the occipital lobe. A specific pattern of OCT changes was found for each site. Regional parameters of both optic nerve and macula were altered. Retinal OCT is a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of the neurodegeneration pattern in patients with intracranial tumors. The evaluation of single intracranial tumors with compressive potential on the visual pathway is a good candidate for the study of neurodegeneration.
