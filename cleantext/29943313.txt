  This study aimed to explore the clinical and prognostic significance of We retrospectively investigated 48 EOC patients who underwent preoperative The median ( range) SUVmax , SUVavg , and MTV values were 11.42 ( 3.14-20.20) , 4.8 ( 2.55-9.47) , and 150.11 ( 0.19-792.46) , respectively. Overall , 93.8 % ( 45/48) of patients had high-grade serous ovarian cancer. The SUVmax value had a positive correlation with the Ki67 index ( P = 0.030 , r = 0.314) , and a higher SUVmax level was associated with chemosensitivity ( P = 0.026). However , neither SUVavg nor MTV had associations with the patients ' clinicopathological parameters. None of these three PET/CT parameters were found to be potential predictors of OS. Preoperative
