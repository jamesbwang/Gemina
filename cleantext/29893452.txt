  This was a subgroup analysis of age group , dexamethasone use , and very highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( VHEC) use from a randomised , multicentre , double-blind , Phase 3 study of oral aprepitant in paediatric subjects. Subjects aged 6 months to 17 years scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agents associated with at least moderate risk for emesis were randomly assigned to receive either aprepitant plus ondansetron ( aprepitant regimen) or placebo plus ondansetron ( control regimen); both could be administered with or without dexamethasone. This secondary analysis evaluated subjects stratified by pre-specified age groups , dexamethasone use , and VHEC use. The primary endpoint of this analysis was the proportion of subjects who experienced complete response ( CR) during the delayed phase. CR rates in the delayed phase were numerically higher with the aprepitant than the control regimen across all age categories , and reached significance for subjects aged 12-17 years ( 51 % vs. 10 %; P < 0.0001). In subjects receiving dexamethasone , CR was twice as high for the aprepitant versus control regimen in the 6 months to < 2 year group ( 50 % vs. 25 %) and significantly higher in the 12-17 year group ( 40 % vs. 7 % , P < 0.05). CR was also significantly higher with aprepitant in the 6 months to < 2 year and 12-17 year age groups who received VHEC. Similar proportions of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event were seen in both regimens across age categories. A 3 day aprepitant regimen seemed effective and safe for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> in paediatric subjects across subgroups ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01362530).
