  Monitoring indicator species is a pragmatic approach to natural resource assessments , especially when the link between the indicator species and ecosystem state is well justified. However , conducting ecosystem assessments over representative spatial scales that are insensitive to local heterogeneity is challenging. We examine the link between polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB) contamination and population density of an aquatic habitat specialist over a large spatial scale using non-invasive genetic spatial capture-recapture. Using American mink ( Neovison vison) , a predatory mammal and an indicator of aquatic ecosystems , we compared estimates of density in two major river systems , one with extremely high levels of PCB contamination ( Hudson River) , and a hydrologically independent river with lower PCB levels ( Mohawk River). Our work supports the hypothesis that mink densities are substantially ( 1.64-1.67 times) lower in the contaminated river system. We demonstrate the value of coupling the indicator species concept with well-conceived and spatially representative monitoring protocols. PCBs have demonstrable detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems , including mink , and these effects are likely to be profound and long-lasting , manifesting as population-level impacts. Through integrating non-invasive data collection , genetic analysis , and spatial capture-recapture methods , we present a monitoring framework for generating robust density estimates across large spatial scales.
