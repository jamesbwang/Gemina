  The inverse association between physical activity and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is well- established and has previously been shown in people with and without single CVD risk factors. We examined whether level of global cardiovascular risk , on the basis of the pooled cohort equation or Reynolds risk score , which include multiple risk factors , modified the physical activity-CVD association. Participants in the prospective WHS ( Women 's Health Study; n = 27 536) reported their leisure-time physical activity at study entry ( 1992-1995) and during follow-up through 2013. Participants were divided into 10-year cardiovascular risk groups on the basis of the pooled cohort equation and Reynolds risk score. The primary outcome was incident total CVD. The CVD hazard ratio for active ( â‰¥ 500 kcal/wk of physical activity) compared with inactive ( < 500 kcal/wk) individuals was 0.73 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.66-0.80) in multivariable models. This association was not modified by level of cardiovascular risk; physical activity was inversely associated with CVD within all pooled cohort equation and Reynolds risk score groups ( In this large prospective cohort of women , level of global cardiovascular risk did not modify the inverse association between leisure-time physical activity and incident CVD. Thus , promoting physical activity is important in women at both low and high cardiovascular risk.
