  The knowledge of the coordination environment around various atomic species in many functional materials provides a key for explaining their properties and working mechanisms. Many structural motifs and their transformations are difficult to detect and quantify in the process of work ( operando conditions) , due to their local nature , small changes , low dimensionality of the material , and/or extreme conditions. Here we use an artificial neural network approach to extract the information on the local structure and its in situ changes directly from the x-ray absorption fine structure spectra. We illustrate this capability by extracting the radial distribution function ( RDF) of atoms in ferritic and austenitic phases of bulk iron across the temperature-induced transition. Integration of RDFs allows us to quantify the changes in the iron coordination and material density , and to observe the transition from a body-centered to a face-centered cubic arrangement of iron atoms. This method is attractive for a broad range of materials and experimental conditions.
