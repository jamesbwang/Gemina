  Botulinum<pathogen> toxin ( BoNT) is the first line therapy for cervical dystonia ( CD) , with most patients receiving many treatment sessions , and so come to recognize and expect the benefits and harms of BoNT , making it difficult to separate which adverse events ( AEs) are driven by BoNT and which come from patients ' expectations. Using the results of three Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) we pooled results to calculate the risk of general and specific AEs associated with BoNT , and the proportion of AEs that can not be pharmacologically attributed to BoNT. Fifteen RCTs , enrolling 1604 patients , were included. BoNT was associated with an increased risk of AEs , but 79 % of this increased risk can not be pharmacologically attributed to BoNT. Patients with CD attach a considerable expectation of harm due to BoNT , reflected in the large proportion of non-pharmacologically-mediated AEs.
