  Ion channel activity in the plasma membrane of living cells generates voltage changes that are critical for numerous biological functions. The membrane of the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum ( ER/SR) is also endowed with ion channels , but whether changes in its voltage occur during cellular activity has remained ambiguous. This issue is critical for cell functions that depend on a Ca
