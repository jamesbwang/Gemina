  The majority of cervical cancer ( CC) cases are attributable to HPV infection. Altered Notch pathway signals and HPV are believed to modify clinicopathogenesis of CC , however , the involvement of each molecular player and its mechanism is still not known. Jagged-1 ( JAG1) is one of the ligands that induce Notch pathway. The involvement of JAG1 in the modulation of a disease condition is not very clear. Hence , this study aims to study the role of JAG1 in HPV-16/ 18 associated different histological sub-types of CC , especially ADC. 40 non-neoplastic cervical tissues , 30 precancer and 118 tumor specimens ( total 188 tissue biopsies) were studied for the expression of the JAG1 protein through immunohistochemistry , immunoblotting and for HPV infection. Two folds increase of cytoplasmic ( Mean ± S.E , 3.67 ± 0.33; p = 0.0001) and nuclear ( 3.70 ± 0.38 , p = 0.0001) JAG1 expression was identified in normal ( N) vs precancer and three folds cytoplasmic ( 4.44 ± 0.17 , p = 0.0001) and nuclear ( 4.64 ± 0.17; p = 0.0001) in N vs. ISCC. Total 85 % of ADC patients were found to be infected with HPV , which were 100 % infected with HPV-16. These findings suggest the complex synergistic interplay between JAG1 and HPV in regulating clinicopathological progression of CC through its deregulation.
