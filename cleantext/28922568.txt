  Over the last years , the SWATH data-independent acquisition protocol ( Sequential Window acquisition of All THeoretical mass spectra) has become a cornerstone for the worldwide proteomics community ( Collins et al. , 2017) ( 1). In this approach , a high-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS data by selecting not just a single precursor at a time , but by allowing a broad
