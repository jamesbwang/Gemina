  Surface-bound microarrays of multiple oligo- and macromolecules ( e.g. , peptides , DNA) offer versatile options in biomedical applications like drug screening , DNA analysis , or medical diagnostics. Combinatorial syntheses of these molecules in situ can save significant resources in regard to processing time and material use. Furthermore , high feature densities are needed to enable high-throughput and low sample volumes as generally regarded in combinatorial chemistry. Here , a scanning-probe-lithography-based approach for the combinatorial in situ synthesis of macromolecules is presented in microarray format. Feature sizes below 40 Âµm allow for the creation of high-density arrays with feature densities of 62 500 features per cm
