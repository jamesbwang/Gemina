  The ability to form an intramolecular structure plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic RNA biogenesis. Proximate regions in the primary transcripts fold into a local secondary structure , which is then hierarchically assembled into a tertiary structure that is stabilized by RNA-binding proteins and long-range intramolecular base pairings. While the local RNA structure can be predicted reasonably well for short sequences , long-range structure at the scale of eukaryotic genes remains problematic from the computational standpoint. The aim of this review is to list functional examples of long-range RNA structures , to summarize current comparative methods of structure prediction , and to highlight their advances and limitations in the context of long-range RNA structures. Most comparative methods implement the & ldquo; first-align-then-fold & rdquo; principle , i.e. , they operate on multiple sequence alignments , while functional RNA structures often reside in non-conserved parts of the primary transcripts. The opposite & ldquo; first-fold-then-align & rdquo; approach is currently explored to a much lesser extent. Developing novel methods in both directions will improve the performance of comparative RNA structure analysis and help discover novel long-range structures , their higher-order organization , and RNA ‚Åª RNA interactions across the transcriptome.
