  Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS). Edaravone , a free radical scavenger , was approved as a therapeutic drug for ALS in 2015 in Japan. A phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated a smaller decline in ALS functional scale scores compared with placebo. However , the long-term effects of edaravone on ALS patients remain unclear. This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the long-term effects of edaravone on the survival of ALS patients. We retrospectively analyzed 27 consecutive patients with ALS who were treated with edaravone and 30 consecutive ALS patients who were not treated with edaravone between 2010 and 2016. The differences of ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to 6 months was significantly reduced in the edaravone group , compared to the control group. The changes in serum creatinine , as a possible marker of ALS severity , from baseline to 6 and 12 months were significantly improved in the edaravone group , compared to the control group. The survival rate was significantly improved in the edaravone group compared with control patients. Our retrospective single-center analysis suggests slower progression and better prognosis of ALS patients with edaravone treatment. Further investigation , including prospective multicenter analysis , is warranted to confirm the usefulness of edaravone for a better prognosis of ALS.
