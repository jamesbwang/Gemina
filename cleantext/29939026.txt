  Reliable heats of formation are reported for numerous fluorinated and chlorinated methane and ethane derivatives by means of an accurate thermochemical protocol , which involves explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations augmented with anharmonic , scalar relativistic , and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. The theoretical results , along with additional experimental data , are further enhanced with the help of the thermochemical network approach. For 28 species , out of 50 , this study presents the best estimates , and discrepancies with previous reports are also highlighted. Furthermore , the effects of the less accurate theoretical data on the results yielded by thermochemical networks are discussed.
