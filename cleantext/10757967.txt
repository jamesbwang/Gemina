  Deciphering disulfide bond patterns in proteins remains a significant challenge. In the present study , interlinked disulfide bonds connecting peptide chains are homolytically cleaved with 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation ( UVPD). Analysis of insulin showcased the ability of UVPD to cleave multiple disulfide bonds and provide sequence coverage of the peptide chains in the same MS/MS event. For proteins containing more complex disulfide bonding patterns , an approach combining partial reduction and alkylation mitigated disulfide scrambling and allowed assignment of the array of disulfide bonds. The 4 disulfide bonds of lysozyme and the 19 disulfide bonds of serotransferrin were characterized through LC/UVPD-MS analysis of nonreduced and partially reduced protein digests.
