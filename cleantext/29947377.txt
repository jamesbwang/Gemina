  Three-stage pH-switchable organic second-order nonlinear optical ( SO NLO) chromophores are synthesized and characterized by wavelength-dependent linear and nonlinear spectroscopy. The chromophores exhibit huge SO NLO responses in their `` on '' stages , and large switching contrasts between adjacent stages in both SO NLO response and fluorescence quantum yield , with moreover different `` on/off '' sequences for closely related compounds.
