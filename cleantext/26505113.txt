  Extraction of cells of interest directly from whole blood is in high demand , yet extraordinary challenging due to the complex hemodynamics and hemorheology of the sample. Herein , we describe a new microfluidic platform that exploits the intrinsic complex properties of blood for continuous size-selective focusing and separation of cells directly from unprocessed whole blood. The novel system only requires routinely accessible saline solution to form a sandwiched fluid configuration and to initiate a strong effect of shear-induced diffusion of cells , which is coupled with fluid inertia for effective separation. Separations of beads and cells from whole blood have been successfully demonstrated with high efficiency ( 89.8 %) at throughput of 6.75 mL/hr ( 10
