  Achieving site-selectivity in arene functionalization that is complementary to the site-selectivity from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions has been a long-standing quest in organic synthesis. Palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis potentially offers a unique approach to this problem , but its use has been hampered by the ortho constraint , which is the requirement of an ortho substituent for mono ortho functionalization of haloarenes. Here , we show that such a challenge could be addressed using a new class of bridgehead-modified norbornenes , thereby enabling a broadly useful strategy for arene functionalization with complementary site-selectivity. A range of ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides , previously problematic substrates , can now be employed to provide mono ortho-functionalized products effectively. This method is applicable for late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules at positions that are difficult to reach by conventional approaches.
