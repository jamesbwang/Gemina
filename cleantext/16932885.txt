  Genetic improvement for stress tolerance requires a solid understanding of biochemical processes involved with different physiological mechanisms and their relationships with different traits. The objective of this study was to demonstrate genetic variability in altered metabolic levels in a panel of six wheat genotypes in contrasting temperature regimes , and to quantify the correlation between those metabolites with different traits. In a controlled environment experiment , heat stress ( 35:28 ± 0.08 °C) was initiated 10 days after anthesis. Flag leaves were collected 10 days after heat treatment to employ an untargeted metabolomics profiling using LC-HRMS based technique called IROA. High temperature stress produced significant genetic variations for cell and thylakoid membrane damage , and yield related traits. 64 known metabolites accumulated 1.5 fold of higher or lower due to high temperature stress. In general , metabolites that increased the most under heat stress ( L-tryptophan , pipecolate) showed negative correlation with different traits. Contrary , the metabolites that decreased the most under heat stress ( drummondol , anthranilate) showed positive correlation with the traits. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosysnthesis and plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways were most impacted by high temperature stress. The robustness of metabolic change and their relationship with phenotypes renders those metabolites as potential bio-markers for genetic improvement.
