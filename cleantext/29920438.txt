  We examined the association between the American Heart Association 's Life 's Simple 7 ( LS7) metrics and the risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA) , a prospective cohort study of adults free of cardiovascular disease ( CVD) at baseline. We analyzed data from 6506 participants. The LS7 metrics ( smoking , physical activity , body mass index , diet , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , total cholesterol and blood glucose) were each categorized into ideal ( assigned 2 points) , intermediate ( 1 point) or poor ( 0 points). Scores were summed for a maximum of 14. A score of 0-8 was considered inadequate; 9-10 , average and 11-14 , optimal for cardiovascular health. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> was ascertained using ICD-9 codes from hospital discharge records and Medicare claims data. Cox proportional hazard ratios ( HR) and incidence rates of AF per 1000 person-years were calculated. During a median follow-up of 11.2 years ( interquartile range: 10.6-11.7 years) , 709 ( 11 %) participants were hospitalized with a first AF episode. In the overall cohort , optimal scores at baseline were associated with a 27 % lower risk for AF compared with inadequate scores ( 0.73 ( 0.59-0.91)). A similar finding was observed when the results were stratified by race/ethnicity ( White , Chinese American , African American and Hispanic) , though many of the associations were not statistically significant. There was no interaction by race/ethnicity ( p = 0.15). In the overall cohort , optimal LS7 status was associated with a lower risk of AF. These findings suggest that promoting ideal cardiovascular health may reduce the incidence and burden of AF.
