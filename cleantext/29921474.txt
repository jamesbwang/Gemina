  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most frequent , malignant gastrointestinal tumors , and strategies and effectiveness of current therapy are limited. A series of benzimidazole-isoquinolinone derivatives ( BIDs) was synthesized and screened to identify novel scaffolds for CRC. Of the compounds evaluated , 7g exhibited the most promising anti-cancer properties. Employing two CRC cell lines , SW620 and HT29 , 7g was found to suppress growth and proliferation of the cell lines at a concentration of ∼ 20 µM. Treatment followed an increase in G
