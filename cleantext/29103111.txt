  We calculated four median datasets ( chlorophyll a , Chl a; total phosphorus , TP; and transparency) using multiple approaches to handling censored observations , including substituting fractions of the quantification limit ( QL; dataset 1 = 1QL , dataset 2 = 0.5 QL) and statistical methods for censored datasets ( datasets 3-4) for approximately 100 Texas , USA reservoirs. Trend analyses of differences between dataset 1 and 3 medians indicated percent difference increased linearly above thresholds in percent censored data ( n). This relationship was extrapolated to estimate medians for site-parameter combinations with n > 80 % , which were combined with dataset 3 as dataset 4. Changepoint analysis of Chl a- and transparency-TP relationships indicated threshold differences up to 50 % between datasets. Recursive analysis identified secondary thresholds in dataset 4. Threshold differences show that information introduced via substitution or missing due to limitations of statistical methods biased values , underestimated error , and inflated the strength of TP thresholds identified in datasets 1-3. Analysis of covariance identified differences in linear regression models relating transparency-TP between datasets 1 , 2 , and the more statistically robust datasets 3-4. Study findings identify high-risk scenarios for biased analytical outcomes when using substitution. These include high probability of median overestimation when n > 50-60 % for a single QL , or when n is as low 16 % for multiple QL 's. Changepoint analysis was uniquely vulnerable to substitution effects when using medians from sites with n > 50 %. Linear regression analysis was less sensitive to substitution and missing data effects , but differences in model parameters for transparency can not be discounted and could be magnified by log-transformation of the variables.
