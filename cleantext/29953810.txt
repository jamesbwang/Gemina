  We investigate the performance of a class of compact and systematically improvable Jastrow-Slater wave functions for the efficient and accurate computation of structural properties , where the determinantal component is expanded with a perturbatively selected configuration interaction scheme ( CIPSI). We concurrently optimize the molecular ground-state geometry and full wave function-Jastrow factor , orbitals , and configuration interaction coefficients-in variational Monte Carlo ( VMC) for the prototypical case of 1,3- trans-butadiene , a small yet theoretically challenging π-conjugated system. We find that the CIPSI selection outperforms the conventional scheme of correlating orbitals within active spaces chosen by chemical intuition: it gives significantly better variational and diffusion Monte Carlo energies for all but the smallest expansions , and much smoother convergence of the geometry with the number of determinants. In particular , the optimal bond lengths and bond-length alternation of butadiene are converged to better than 1 mÅ with just a few thousand determinants , to values very close to the corresponding CCSD ( T) results. The combination of CIPSI expansion and VMC optimization represents an affordable tool for the determination of accurate ground-state geometries in quantum Monte Carlo.
