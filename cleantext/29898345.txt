  Evaluate the change over time of psychosocial risk management for the nursing personnel of an intermediate complexity clinic of Bogota ( Colombia). Descriptive and correlational research performed under the approach of risk management ( identification , analysis , assessment and treatment). The psychosocial risk of the nursing personnel was studied through 10-year system dynamics models ( with and without the implementation of the policy of good practices on the risk treatment) in two scenarios: when the nursing personnel works shifts of 6 hours ( morning or afternoon) and when they work over 12 hours ( double shift or night shift). When implementing a policy of good practices on the risk treatment , the double shift scenario shows an improvement among 25 % to 88 % in the variables of: health , labor motivation , burnout , service level and productivity; as well as in the variables of the organization associated to number of patients , nursing personnel and profit. Likewise , the single shift scenario with good practices improves in all the above-mentioned variables and generates stability on the variables of absenteeism and resignations. The best scenario is the single shift scenario with the application of good practices of risk treatment in comparison with the double shift scenario with good practices , which allows concluding that the good practices have a positive effect on the variables of nursing personnel and on those associated to the organization.
