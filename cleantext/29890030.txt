  Whole-genome sequencing-based bulked segregant analysis ( BSA) for mapping quantitative trait loci ( QTL) provides an efficient alternative approach to conventional QTL analysis as it significantly reduces the scale and cost of analysis with comparable power to QTL detection using full mapping population. We tested the application of next-generation sequencing ( NGS)- based BSA approach for mapping QTLs for ascochyta blight resistance in chickpea using two recombinant inbred line populations CPR-01 and CPR-02. Eleven QTLs in CPR-01 and six QTLs in CPR-02 populations were mapped on chromosomes Ca1 , Ca2 , Ca4 , Ca6 and Ca7. The QTLs identified in CPR-01 using conventional biparental mapping approach were used to compare the efficiency of NGS-based BSA in detecting QTLs for ascochyta blight resistance. The QTLs on chromosomes Ca1 , Ca4 , Ca6 and Ca7 overlapped with the QTLs previously detected in CPR-01 using conventional QTL mapping method. The QTLs on chromosome Ca4 were detected in both populations and overlapped with the previously reported QTLs indicating conserved region for ascochyta blight resistance across different chickpea genotypes. Six candidate genes in the QTL regions identified using NGS-based BSA on chromosomes Ca2 and Ca4 were validated for their association with ascochyta blight resistance in the CPR-02 population. This study demonstrated the efficiency of NGS-based BSA as a rapid and cost-effective method to identify QTLs associated with ascochyta blight in chickpea.
