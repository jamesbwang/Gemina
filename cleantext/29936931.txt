  Cardiovascular diseases arising from atherosclerosis are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Lipid-lowering agents have been developed in order to treat hypercholesterolemia , a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. However , the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing , indicating a need to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop new treatment agents. Adenosine receptors ( ARs) are emerging as therapeutic targets in asthma , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , cancer , ischemia , and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. This study assessed whether LJ-1888 , a selective antagonist for A3 AR , can inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knock-out ( ApoE-/-) mice who are fed a western diet. Plaque formation was significantly lower in ApoE-/- mice administered LJ-1888 than in mice not administered LJ-1888 , without any associated liver damage. LJ-1888 treatment of ApoE-/- mice prevented western diet-induced hypercholesterolemia by markedly reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and significantly increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Reduced hypercholesterolemia in ApoE-/- mice administered LJ-1888 was associated with the enhanced expression of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis. These findings indicate that LJ-1888 , a selective antagonist for A3 AR , may be a novel candidate for the treatment of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.
