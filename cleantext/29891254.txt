  Vitamin E is a potent molecule , especially when loaded in cyclodextrin , in modulating oxidative stress during the freeze-thawing process. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of different concentrations of cyclodextrin-vitamin E complex ( CD-Vit E) on cryopreserved ram sperm. Ejaculates collected from five adult rams were pooled and divided into four aliquots. All aliquots were treated in Tris-extender ( Tris-glucose-citric acid) containing 2 mg cholesterol-loaded methyl-β- cyclodextrin/120 × 10
