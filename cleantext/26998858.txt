  TiO ₂ nanoparticles with surface porosity were prepared by a simple and efficient method and presented for the removal of malachite green ( MG) , a representative organic pollutant , from aqueous solution. Photocatalytic degradation experiments were systematically conducted to investigate the influence of TiO ₂ dosage , pH value , and initial concentrations of MG. The kinetics of the reaction were monitored via UV spectroscopy and the kinetic process can be well predicted by the pseudo first-order model. The rate constants of the reaction kinetics were found to decrease as the initial MG concentration increased; increased via elevated pH value at a certain amount of TiO ₂ dosage. The maximum efficiency of photocatalytic degradation was obtained when the TiO ₂ dosage , pH value and initial concentrations of MG were 0.6 g/L , 8 and 10
