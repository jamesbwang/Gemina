  To evaluate the safety , feasibility , and effectiveness of an all-arthroscopic technique for the intra- and extraarticular release of severe knee extension contractures. From 2012 to 2016 , 25 patients with severe knee extension contractures ( less than 45 ° range of flexion) were treated with an all-arthroscopic release technique. The patients underwent intra- and extraarticular arthroscopic release and arthroscopic-assisted mini-incision quadriceps plasty. The post-operative rehabilitation was initiated the first day after the procedures. Comprehensive clinical follow-up evaluations including the range-of-motion ( ROM) assessment , the Lysholm score , and the International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC) score were performed on all patients. The median follow-up time was 28 months ( range 12-65 months). The ROM improved from 23.9 ° ± 7.5 ° pre-operatively to 105.9 ° ± 6.5 ° at the final follow-up ( P < 0.001). In addition , the Lysholm score increased from 59.9 ± 5.2 pre-operatively to 89.7 ± 3.3 ( P < 0.001). The IKDC score increased from 47.6 ± 3.4 pre-operatively to 91.7 ± 2.4 ( P < 0.001). All patients were satisfied with their final ROM and functional outcomes. The all-arthroscopic release technique was a safe , feasible and effective method for treating severe knee extension contractures. The severe knee extension contractures may be successfully addressed by the all-arthroscopic release technique during our clinical practice. IV.
