  Few elder abuse ( EA) victims ever seek or receive assistance from formal support services designed to mitigate risk and harm of revictimization. This study examined whether the presence of third-party `` concerned persons '' in victims ' personal social networks plays a role in enabling formal support service utilization. A representative population-based survey administered to adults ( n = 800) in New<pathogen> York State identified 83 EA cases from the past year. Penalized likelihood logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between availability of a concerned person and victim formal support services usage. EA victims who had a concerned person in their personal life were significantly more likely to use formal EA support services than victims without a concerned person. EA victims who lived with their perpetrator were significantly less likely to use formal services. Third-party concerned persons represent a critical population to target in efforts designed to promote EA victim help-seeking.
