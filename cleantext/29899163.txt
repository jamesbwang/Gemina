  To investigate the effect of stimulation of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells ( HBEC) by arterial traffic ambient PM2 .5 ( TAPM2 .5) and wood smoke PM2 .5 ( WSPM2 .5) on the expression of lncRNAs in order to find new therapeutic targets for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). HBECs were exposed to TAPM2 .5 and WSPM2 .5 at a series of concentrations. The microarray analysis was used to detect the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles. Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathway analysis and gene ontology ( GO) enrichment were conducted to analyze the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. qRT-PCR were performed to confirm the differential expression of lncRNAs. Western blot was performed to study the expression of autophagy and apoptosis-associated proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic cells. The results indicated that PM2.5-induced cell damage of HBECs occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The microarray analysis indicated that treatment with TAPM2 .5 and WSPM2 .5 led to the alteration of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles. lncRNA MEG3 was significantly up-regulated in HBECs after PM2 .5 treatment. The results of western blot showed that PM2 .5 induced cell apoptosis and autophagy by up-regulating apoptosis-associated gene , caspase-3 , and down-regulating autophagy-associated markers , Bcl-2 and LC3 expression. In addition , we demonstrated that TAPM2 .5 and WSPM2 .5 accelerated apoptosis of HBE cells , silencing of MEG3 suppressed apoptosis and autophagy of HBE cells. These findings suggested that the lncRNA MEG3 mediates PM2.5-induced cell apoptosis and autophagy , and probably through regulating the expression of p53.
