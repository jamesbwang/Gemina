  We present the analysis and design of spatio-temporal channeled Stokes polarimeters. We extend our recent work on optimal pixelated polarizer arrays by utilizing temporal carrier generation , resulting in polarimeters that achieve super-resolution via the tradeoff between spatial bandwidth and temporal bandwidth. Utilizing the channel space description , we present a linear-Stokes design and two full-Stokes imaging polarimeter designs that have the potential to operate at the full frame rate of the imaging sensor of the system by using hybrid spatio-temporal carriers. If the objects are not spatially bandlimited , the achievable temporal bandwidth is more difficult to analyze; however , a spatio-temporal tradeoff still exists.
