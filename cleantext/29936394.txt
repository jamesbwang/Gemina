  To evaluate the risk of new-onset depression<symptom> in a cohort of US adult patients initiating lipophilic statin therapy compared to hydrophilic statin therapy. Retrospective cohort study. Large US commercial claims database PARTICIPANTS: 1:1 propensity score matched cohort of lipophilic ( atorvastatin , lovastatin and simvastatin) and hydrophilic ( pravastatin and rosuvastatin) statin initiators between January 2009 to June 2015. New onset of depression<symptom> In a propensity-score matched cohort of 299,298 statin initiators , the crude incidence of depression<symptom> in the hydrophilic and lipophilic group was 136.6 and 142.8 per 10,000 person-years respectively. Compared to hydrophilic statin use , lipophilic statin use was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of depression<symptom> , adjusted HR 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 1.00-1.10 , p = 0.078) and excess incidence of 6.3 ( 95 % CI , -0.7-13.7) per 10,000 person-years. Findings were consistent across the subgroups of patients with history of psychiatric conditions HR 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 0.94-1.16 , p = 0.41) , and those initiating statins for primary or secondary prevention , HR 1.03 ( 95 % CI , 0.97-1.10 , p = 0.33) and 1.07 ( 95 % CI , 0.99-1.16 , p = 0.10) respectively. Within individual lipophilic statins , only simvastatin was associated with a moderate increase in the risk of depression<symptom> HR 1.09 ( 95 % CI , 1.02-1.16 , p = 0.003) , followed by lovastatin HR 1.07 ( 95 % CI , 0.93-1.24 , p = 0.34) and atorvastatin HR 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 0.97-1.13 , p = 0.27). Findings are generalizable to patients with commercial insurance. Lipophilic statin use was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of incident
