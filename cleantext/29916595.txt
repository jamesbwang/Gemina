  Study 's objective is to assess psychopathological profiles in outpatients with a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder ( AD) who had positive evaluations of work related stress ( AD-W) versus those exposed to other stressful life events ( AD-O). The participants were 70 outpatients with AD-W , compared to 71 outpatients with AD-O , admitted at the Unit of Psychiatry and Occupational Medicine , Sant ` Andrea Hospital , Rome. Patients completed the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression<symptom> ( HRSD) , the Hamilton Anxiety<symptom> Rating Scale ( HAM-A) , the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 ( MMPI-2) , and the Rorschach test. The emerged data underline that patients with AD-W scored significantly higher than patients with AD-O in the MMPI-2 scales D , Pd , Pa , FAM , and in the Rorschach anxiety<symptom> scale ( Sum Y). Finally patients with AD-W showed greater levels of psychopathology compared to patients with AD-O. Further studies assessing the harm associated with stress might allow a better understanding of the diagnosis and therapeutic implications of AD.
