  The peptidoglycan cell wall provides an essential protective barrier in almost all bacteria , defining cellular morphology and conferring resistance to osmotic stress and other environmental hazards. The precursor to peptidoglycan , lipid II , is assembled on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However , peptidoglycan polymerization occurs on the outer face of the plasma membrane , and lipid II must be flipped across the membrane by the MurJ protein before its use in peptidoglycan synthesis. Due to its central role in cell wall assembly , MurJ is of fundamental importance in microbial cell biology and is a prime target for novel antibiotic development. However , relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of MurJ function , and structural data for MurJ are available only from the extremophile
