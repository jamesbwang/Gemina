  While numerous epidemiologic studies have found an association between higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentrations and lower breast cancer risk , few have assessed this association for concentrations > 40 ng/ml. To investigate the relationship between 25 ( OH) D concentration and breast cancer risk across a broad range of 25 ( OH) D concentrations among women aged 55 years and older. Analyses used pooled data from two randomized clinical trials ( N = 1129 , N = 2196) and a prospective cohort ( N = 1713) to examine a broad range of 25 ( OH) D concentrations. The outcome was diagnosis of breast cancer during the observation periods ( median: 4.0 years). Three analyses were conducted: 1) Incidence rates were compared according to 25 ( OH) D concentration from < 20 to ≥ 60 ng/ml ( < 50 to ≥ 150 nmol/L) , 2) Kaplan-Meier plots were developed and 3) multivariate Cox regression was used to examine the association between 25 ( OH) D and breast cancer risk using multiple 25 ( OH) D measurements. Within the pooled cohort ( N = 5038) , 77 women were diagnosed with breast cancer ( age-adjusted incidence: 512 cases per 100,000 person-years). Results were similar for the three analyses. First , comparing incidence rates , there was an 82 % lower incidence rate of breast cancer for women with 25 ( OH) D concentrations ≥ 60 vs < 20 ng/ml ( Rate Ratio = 0.18 , P = 0.006). Second , Kaplan-Meier curves for concentrations of < 20 , 20-39 , 40-59 and ≥ 60 ng/ml were significantly different ( P = 0.02) , with the highest proportion breast cancer-free in the ≥ 60 ng/ml group ( 99.3 %) and the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the < 20 ng/ml group ( 96.8 %). The proportion with breast cancer was 78 % lower for ≥ 60 vs < 20 ng/ml ( P = 0.02). Third , multivariate Cox regression revealed that women with 25 ( OH) D concentrations ≥ 60 ng/ml had an 80 % lower risk of breast cancer than women with concentrations < 20 ng/ml ( HR = 0.20 , P = 0.03) , adjusting for age , BMI , smoking status , calcium supplement intake , and study of origin. Higher 25 ( OH) D concentrations were associated with a dose-response decrease in breast cancer risk with concentrations ≥ 60 ng/ml being most protective.
