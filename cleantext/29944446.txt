  Keratin intermediate filaments ( IFs) are the major cytoskeletal component in epithelial cells. The dynamics of keratin IFs have been described to depend mostly on the actin cytoskeleton , but the rapid transport of fully polymerized keratin filaments has not been reported. In this work , we used a combination of photoconversion experiments and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 genome editing to study the role of microtubules and microtubule motors<symptom> in keratin filament transport. We found that long keratin filaments , like other types of IFs , are transported along microtubules by kinesin-1. Our data revealed that keratin and vimentin are nonconventional kinesin-1 cargoes because their transport did not require kinesin light chains , which are a typical adapter for kinesin-dependent cargo transport. Furthermore , we found that the same domain of the kinesin heavy chain tail is involved in keratin and vimentin IF transport , strongly suggesting that multiple types of IFs move along microtubules using an identical mechanism.-Robert , A. , Tian , P. , Adam , S.
