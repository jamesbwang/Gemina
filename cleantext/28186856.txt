  Magnolin is a multi-bioactive natural compound that possesses underlying anti-cancer properties. However , the mechanisms underlying remain to be elucidated. Here , we report the role of magnolin in suppressing human colorectal cancer ( CRC) cells via activating autophagy and cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. Pre-treatment of cells with specific autophagy inhibitor ( 3-methyladenine) or knockdown of endogenous LC-3B by siRNA significantly abrogates magnolin-induced cell cycle arrest. Molecular validation mechanistically shows that magnolin-induced autophagy and cell cycle arrest in CRC cells is correlated with decreased transcriptional levels of leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor ( LIF) , and we further find that inhibition of LIF decreases phosphorylation level of Stat3 and represses transcriptional expression of Mcl-1. Furthermore , magnolin-induced autophagy and cell cycle arrest suppress the growth of xenograft colorectal tumors without apparent toxicity. Finally , we evaluate the clinical correlation of LIF/Stat3/Mcl -1 in CRC patient tissues. As expected , LIF , p-Stat3 , and Mcl-1 levels are high in CRC tissue but are scarcely found in normal colon tissue. High positive expressions of LIF or Mcl-1 are associated with poor prognosis. Doubly positive cases have shown the worst outcome. Taken together , our results have clarified a novel molecular mechanism whereby magnolin induces autophagy and cell cycle arrest through LIF/Stat3/Mcl -1 pathway in CRCs. Our results also have revealed that magnolin has a promising therapeutic potential in CRCs.
