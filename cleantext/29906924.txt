  We introduce an alternative solution to Glauber multispin dynamics on random graphs. The solution is based on the recently introduced cavity master equation ( CME) , a time-closure turning the , in principle , exact dynamic cavity method into a practical method of analysis and of fast simulation. Running CME once is of comparable computational complexity as one Monte Carlo run on the same problem. We show that CME correctly models the ferromagnetic p-spin Glauber dynamics from high temperatures down to and below the spinoidal transition. We also show that CME allows an alternative exploration of the low-temperature spin-glass phase of the model.
