  A seed maturation protein gene ( CaSMP) from Coffea arabica is expressed in the endosperm of yellow/green fruits. The CaSMP promoter drives reporter expression in the seeds of immature tomato fruits. In this report , an expressed sequence tag-based approach was used to identify a seed-specific candidate gene for promoter isolation in Coffea arabica. The tissue-specific expression of the cognate gene ( CaSMP) , which encodes a yet uncharacterized coffee seed maturation protein , was validated by RT-qPCR. Additional expression analysis during coffee fruit development revealed higher levels of CaSMP transcript accumulation in the yellow/green phenological stage. Moreover , CaSMP was preferentially expressed in the endosperm and was down-regulated during water imbibition of the seeds. The presence of regulatory cis-elements known to be involved in seed- and endosperm-specific expression was observed in the CaSMP 5 '- upstream region amplified by genome walking ( GW). Additional histochemical analysis of transgenic tomato ( cv. Micro-Tom) lines harboring the GW-amplified fragment ( ~ 1.4 kb) fused to uidA reporter gene confirmed promoter activity in the ovule of immature tomato fruits , while no activity was observed in the seeds of ripening fruits and in the other organs/tissues examined. These results indicate that the CaSMP promoter can be used to drive transgene expression in coffee beans and tomato seeds , thus representing a promising biotechnological tool.
