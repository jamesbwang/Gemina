  The cannabinoid system exerts functional regulation of neural stem cell ( NSC) proliferation and adult neurogenesis , yet not all effects of cannabinoid-like compounds seen can be attributed to the cannabinoid 1 ( CB The effects of GPR55 agonists ( LPI , O-1602 , ML184) on human ( h) NSC proliferation in vitro were assessed by flow cytometry. Human NSC differentiation was determined by flow cytometry , qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Immature neuron formation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 and GPR55 Activation of GPR55 significantly increased proliferation rates of hNSCs in vitro. These effects were attenuated by ML193 , a selective GPR55 antagonist. ML184 significantly promoted neuronal differentiation in vitro while ML193 reduced differentiation rates as compared to vehicle treatment. Continuous administration of O-1602 into the hippocampus via a cannula connected to an osmotic pump resulted in increased Ki67 + cells within the dentate gyrus. O-1602 increased immature neuron generation , as assessed by DCX + and BrdU + cells , as compared to vehicle-treated animals. GPR55 Together , these findings suggest GPR55 activation as a novel target and strategy to regulate NSC proliferation and adult neurogenesis.
