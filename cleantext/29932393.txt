  The genus Lactobacillus<pathogen> encompasses a diversity of species that occur widely in nature and encode a plethora of metabolic pathways reflecting their adaptation to various ecological niches , including humans , animals , plants and food products. Accordingly , their functional attributes have been exploited industrially and several strains are commonly formulated as probiotics or starter cultures in the food industry. Although divergent evolutionary processes have yielded the acquisition and evolution of specialized functionalities , all Lactobacillus<pathogen> species share a small set of core metabolic properties , including the glycolysis pathway. Thus , the sequences of glycolytic enzymes afford a means to establish phylogenetic groups with the potential to discern species that are too closely related from a 16S rRNA standpoint. Here , we identified and extracted glycolysis enzyme sequences from 52 species , and carried out individual and concatenated phylogenetic analyses. We show that a glycolysis-based phylogenetic tree can robustly segregate lactobacilli into distinct clusters and discern very closely related species. We also compare and contrast evolutionary patterns with genome-wide features and transcriptomic patterns , reflecting genomic drift trends. Overall , results suggest that glycolytic enzymes provide valuable phylogenetic insights and may constitute practical targets for evolutionary studies.
