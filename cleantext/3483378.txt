  A new miniplate applied differently from conventional application method for bone fixation has been developed. The novel approach is the insertion of the screw into the bone before miniplate installation. This study aimed to assess the stress distribution of a newly designed Yang 's Keyhole ( YK)- plate for segmental-bone fixation during sagittal split ramus osteotomy ( SSO). Moreover , the effectiveness of the YK-plate system based on the clinical results was determined. The YK-plate system has a widened hole in the anterior region to permit a screw-head to be screwed through the system. The stress distribution using the finite-element analysis method was compared between in the case of the YK-plate system and the case of existing mini-plate fixation technique. Moreover , the clinical results of patients were evaluated during the follow-up examination periods. No critical complications in any of the six patients were reported during the four-month follow-up period. The result of the stress distribution using finite-element analysis showed a similar trend in all four fixation methods. The YK-plate system can be applied to fixation during SSO and allow for mechanically stable and convenient application.
