  Consumers regularly use household care and personal care products ( HC&PCP s). Isothiazolinones are included in HC&PCP s as preservatives and are being held responsible for an epidemic rise in allergic contact dermatitis<disease> ( ACD). The objective of this study was to assess the origin and extent of dermal exposure in order to evaluate the risk of ACD from isothiazolinones in HC&PCP. Individual-based aggregate dermal exposure to four isothiazolinones was estimated using the newly proposed Probabilistic Aggregated Consumer Exposure Model-Kinetic , Dermal ( PACEM-KD) by combining the reported individual use patterns for HC&PCP in Switzerland ( N = 669 ( 558 adults) , ages 0-91) with isothiazolinone concentrations measured in products used by the individual person. PACEM-KD extends the original PACEM by considering exposure duration , product dilution and skin permeability. PACEM-KD-based higher-tier exposure on palms ( 99th percentile) was 15.4 ng/cm
