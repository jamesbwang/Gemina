  One Health is an effective approach for the management of zoonotic disease in humans , animals and environments. Examples of the management of bacterial zoonoses in Europe and across the globe demonstrate that One Health approaches of international surveillance , information-sharing and appropriate intervention methods are required to successfully prevent and control disease outbreaks in both endemic and non-endemic regions. Additionally , a One Health approach enables effective preparation and response to bioterrorism threats.
