  Four C-13 , C-14 side chain modified 9 ( R)- hydroxy-1-deoxy-taxane analogues 15 , 16 , 19 and 22 were semi-synthesized from 1-deoxybaccatin VI. The in vitro antitumor activity of these compounds was evaluated against A549 and A2780 cell lines. The preliminary SAR analysis showed that introduction of oxygen-containing group on C-14 could improve the cytotoxic activities.
