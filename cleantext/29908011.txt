  Structural alterations in the cirrhotic heart may contribute to electromechanical abnormalities , represented by QT prolongation. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in QTc according to the operative stage during pediatric LT and to identify which baseline echocardiographic parameters were associated with intraoperative QTc prolongation. Data were evaluated from 39 children undergoing LT for chronic liver disease ( median age 9 months). In 19 patients ( 48.7 %) , baseline QTc was prolonged ≥ 440 ms ( 462 ± 19 ms). Through the period of post-reperfusion , QTI , QTc , and JTI progressively increased , although values partially recovered toward the end of surgery. High LVMI ( ≥ 82.51 g/m
