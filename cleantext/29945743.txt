  To determine the role of total skin electron irradiation ( TSEI) as a cause of second malignancies in mycosis<disease> fungoides patients. Mycosis<disease> fungoides patients referred to TSEI were followed in a longitudinal study. Other diagnosed malignancies were obtained after cross-matching with the Israel National Cancer Registry database. Between 1974 and 2010 , 197 patients were treated: 134 ( 68 %) men , 63 ( 32 %) women; mean age 58 Â± 17 years. Topical/systemic treatment was given to 134 ( 68 %) patients. TSEI was given to 104 ( 68.9 %) patients. Seven ( 4.6 %) received sub-TSEI and 40 ( 26.5 %) received focal electron irradiation fields. Forty-six ( 23 %) patients did not receive radiotherapy. The second primaries rate was 6.7 times higher in male mycosis<disease> fungoides patients and 13.1 times higher in female mycosis fungoides patients than in the general Israeli population. Malignant melanoma developed in eight patients after radiotherapy , in one patient without irradiation. The skin-related cancer rate after irradiation versus no irradiation was higher ( P = 0.018). Combination radiotherapy with psoralen + ultraviolet A and/or nitrogen mustard yielded 11 cases of skin cancer versus no cases without irradiation. Mycosis<disease> fungoides patients have a high incidence of sequential malignancies. TSEI is associated with higher ` skin-related cancer ' rates. Close longitudinal follow-up of mycosis<disease> fungoides patients is obligatory.
