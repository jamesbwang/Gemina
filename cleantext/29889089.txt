  Contralesional ` drop foot ' after stroke is usually treated with an ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO). However , AFOs may hamper ankle motion during stance. Peroneal functional electrical stimulation ( FES) is an alternative treatment that provides active dorsiflexion and allows normal ankle motion. Despite this theoretical advantage of FES , the kinematic and kinetic differences between AFO and FES have been scarcely investigated. To test whether walking with implanted FES leads to improvements in stance stability , propulsion , and swing initiation compared to AFO. A 4-channel peroneal nerve stimulator ( ActiGait ®) was implanted in 22 chronic patients after stroke. Instrumented gait analyses were performed during comfortable walking up to 26 weeks ( n = 10) or 52 weeks ( n = 12) after FES-system activation. Kinematics of knee and ankle ( stance and swing phase) and kinetics ( stance phase) of gait were determined , besides spatiotemporal parameters. Finally , we determined whether differences between devices regarding late stance kine ( ma) tics correlated with those regarding the swing phase. In mid-stance , knee stability improved as the peak knee extension velocity was lower with FES ( β = 18.1 °/ s , p = 0.007) , while peak ankle plantarflexion velocity ( β = -29.2 °/ s , p = 0.006) and peak ankle plantarflexion power ( β = -0.2 W/kg , p = 0.018) were higher with FES compared to AFO. With FES , the ground reaction force ( GRF) vector at peak ankle power ( i.e. , ` propulsion ') was oriented more anteriorly ( β = -1.1 ° , p = 0.001). Similarly , the horizontal GRF ( β = -0.8 % body mass , p = 0.003) and gait speed ( β = 0.03 m/s , p = 0.015) were higher. An increase in peak ankle plantarflexion velocity and a more forward oriented GRF angle during late stance were moderately associated with an increase in hip flexion velocity during initial swing ( rs = 0.502 , p = 0.029 and rs = 0.504 , p = 0.028 , respectively). This study substantiates the evidence that implantable peroneal FES as a treatment for post-stroke drop foot may be superior over AFO in terms of knee stability , ankle plantarflexion power , and propulsion.
