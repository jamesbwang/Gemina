  Dehydroalanine has emerged in recent years as a non-proteinogenic residue with strong chemical utility in proteins for the study of biology. In this review we cover the several methods now available for its flexible and site-selective incorporation via a variety of complementary chemical and biological techniques and examine its reactivity , allowing both creation of modified protein side-chains through a variety of bond-forming methods ( C-S , C-N , C-Se , C-C) and as an activity-based probe in its own right. We illustrate its utility with selected examples of biological and technological discovery and application.
