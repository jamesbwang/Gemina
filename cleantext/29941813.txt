  Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria ( PSB) can promote plant growth by dissolving insoluble phosphate. Therefore , PSB may have the potential to improve the mobility of heavy metals in soils and enhance phytoextraction. This study isolated a few PSB strains that could dissolve CdCO â‚ƒ and solid Cd in soil. Two typical PSB , namely , high- and low-Cd-mobilizing PSB (
