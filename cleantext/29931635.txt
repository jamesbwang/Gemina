  The nature and fate of urban contaminants washed by stormwater events and accumulating in a detention basin ( DB) were investigated. Relations between bacterial and chemical contaminants of trapped urban sediments , and field parameters were analyzed. Fecal indicators and some pathogens known to be environmentally transmitted ( Nocardia , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , and Aeromonas<pathogen> caviae<pathogen> were tracked , and their persistence investigated. Six sampling campaigns were carried out over 3 years , using five sites including a settling chamber ( SC). Aerosolized bacteria at these sites were also monitored. Deposits in the basin were made of fine particles and their content in chemical pollutants was found highly variable. High polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) contents were measured but only three pesticides , over 22 , were detected. Deposits were significantly contaminated by fecal indicator bacteria ( FIB) , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , A.<pathogen> caviae<pathogen> , and by Nocardia. Only A.<pathogen> caviae<pathogen> showed significant numbers in aerosolized particles recovered over the detention basin. Nocardia<pathogen> spp. cells heavily contaminated the SC. The efficacy of the detention basin at reducing bacterial counts per rain event and over time were estimated. A slight drop in the counts was monitored for fecal indicators but not for the other bacterial groups. Hydrodynamic parameters had a strong impact on the distribution and features of the deposits. Multiple factors impacted the fate of FIB , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , A.<pathogen> caviae<pathogen> , and Nocardia<pathogen> cells , but in a group dependent manner. Nocardia<pathogen> counts were found positively correlated with volatile organic matter. FIB appeared highly efficient colonizers of the DB.
