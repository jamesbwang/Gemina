  The increasing global burden of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and failure of conventional treatments to stop neurodegeneration necessitates an alternative approach. Evidence of inflammation<symptom> , mitochondrial dysfunction , and oxidative stress prior to the accumulation of amyloid-Î² in the prodromal stage of AD ( mild cognitive impairment; MCI) suggests that early interventions which counteract these features , such as dietary supplements , may ameliorate the onset of MCI-like behavioral symptoms. We administered a polyphenol-containing multiple ingredient dietary supplement ( MDS) , or vehicle , to both sexes of triple transgenic ( 3xTg-AD) mice and wildtype mice for 2 months from 2-4 months of age. We hypothesized that the MDS would preserve spatial learning , which is known to be impaired in untreated 3xTg-AD mice by 4 months of age. Behavioral phenotyping of animals was done at 1-2 and 3-4 months of age using a comprehensive battery of tests. As previously reported in males , both sexes of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior at 1-2 months of age , prior to deficits in learning and memory , which did not appear until 3-4 months of age. The MDS did not reduce this anxiety<symptom> or prevent impairments in novel object recognition ( both sexes) or on the water maze probe trial ( females only). Strikingly , the MDS specifically prevented 3xTg-AD mice ( both sexes) from developing impairments ( exhibited by untreated 3xTg-AD controls) in working memory and spatial learning. The MDS also increased sucrose preference , an indicator of hedonic tone. These data show that the MDS can prevent some , but not all , psychopathology in an AD model.
