  The dismal prognosis of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) relapsing after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) requires exploration of novel strategies to prevent relapse. Azacitidine ( AZA) maintenance therapy could potentially reduce the recurrence rate post HSCT. Here , we presents the cases of three children with high-risk AML post HSCT who were treated with low-dose AZA maintenance therapy , demonstrating the feasibility of this therapy. Currently , all three are in complete remission for 13-41 months despite their high-risk characteristics. Our encouraging data warrant larger prospective studies to assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose AZA maintenance therapy post HSCT for pediatric patients with high-risk AML.
