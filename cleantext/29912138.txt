  Thoracoscopic resection is being used more commonly for the treatment of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in neonates and infants. However , in the rare case of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with congenital absence of lung fissure , thoracoscopic lobectomy can not be performed safely. Moreover , if the lung lesion<symptom> is deep-seated and can not be visualized on the pleural surface , wedge resection may result in residual lesion<symptom>. Here , we reported our approach of thoracoscopic resection under hookwire guidance to tackle this problem.
