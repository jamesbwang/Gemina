  Extensive research is being conducted to identify novel diagnostic , predictive and prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) , as only a few markers have been routinely used so far with limited success. Our aim was to assess the expression of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 9 ( NEDD9) , E-cadherin , and γ-catenin in PDAC in relation to clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. We also investigated if there is a correlation of NEDD9 expression with E-cadherin or γ-catenin. The protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 61 PDAC and 61 samples of normal pancreatic tissue. The log rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival curve were used for survival analysis. E-cadherin and γ-catenin expressions were reduced in PDAC , and completely retained in normal pancreatic tissue. Expression of NEDD9 was significantly increased in PDAC ( strong expression in 78.7 % of cases and moderate in 21.3 %) and reduced in normal pancreatic tissue ( strong positivity in 45.9 % of cases , moderate in 31.1 % , and weak in 23 %). There was a positive correlation between reduced E-cadherin and γ-catenin expression in PDAC ( p = 0.015). The loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin had a negative impact on patient survival ( p = 0.020). A negative correlation between E-cadherin expression and tumor grade was also observed ( p = 0.011). Decreased E-cadherin expression was more common in male patients with PDAC ( 81.3 % vs. 60 % for females , p = 0.005). γ-catenin and NEDD9 expressions were not statistically correlated with tumor stage and grade , gender , nor with patient survival. Our results support the role of NEDD9 , E-cadherin and γ-catenin proteins in PDAC , but further research should clarify in detail their mechanism of action in pancreatic cancer.
