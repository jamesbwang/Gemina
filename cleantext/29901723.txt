  Current recommendations for protein levels in infant formula are intended to ensure that growth matches or exceeds growth of breastfed infants , but may provide a surplus of amino acids ( AAs). Recent infant studies with AA-based formulas support specific adjustment of the essential amino acid ( EAA) composition allowing for potential lowering of total protein levels. With the use of a combination of intact protein and free EAAs , we designed a formula that meets these adjusted EAA requirements for infants. Our objective was to test whether this adjusted formula is safe and supports growth in a protein-restricted piglet model , and whether it shows better growth than an isonitrogenous formula based on free AAs. Term piglets ( Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc , n = 72) were fed 1 of 4 isoenergetic formulas containing 70 % intact protein and 30 % of an EAA mixture or a complete AA-based control for 20 d: standard formula ( ST-100) , ST-100 with 25 % reduction in proteinaceous nitrogen ( ST-75) , ST-75 with an adjusted EAA composition ( O-75) , or a diet as O-75 , given as a complete AA-based diet ( O-75AA). After an initial adaptation period , ST-75 and O-75 pigs showed similar growth rates , both lower than ST-100 pigs ( ∼ 25 compared with 31 g · kg-1 · d-1 , respectively). The O-75AA pigs showed further reduced growth rate ( 15 g · kg-1 · d-1) and fat proportion ( both P < 0.05 , relative to O-75). Formula based partly on intact protein is superior to AA-based formula in this experimental setting. The 25 % lower , but EAA-adjusted , partially intact protein-based formula resulted in similar weight gain with a concomitant increased AA catabolism , compared with the standard 25 % lower standard formula in artificially reared , protein-restricted piglets. Further studies should investigate if and how the specific EAA adjustments that allow for lowering of total protein levels will affect growth and body composition development in formula-fed infants.
