  We examined whether long-haul airline pilots without recurrent on-duty sleepiness obtain more prior sleep and use more effective in-flight alertness management strategies than their colleagues with recurrent on-duty sleepiness. There were 51 pilots who flew at least twice from Helsinki to Asia. Of them , 44 flew at least twice back to Helsinki following 1 local night. On-duty sleepiness was measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale ( KSS) , alertness management strategies by a diary , and sleep by a diary and activity monitor. Pilots who rated KSS ≥ 7 on each , some , or none of the flights were classified as `` regularly '' , `` sometimes '' , and `` never '' sleepy , respectively. This classification was performed separately for the outbound and inbound flights. On the outbound flights , 22 % of the pilots were `` never '' , 54 % `` sometimes '' , and 24 % `` regularly '' sleepy. For the inbound flights , the respective distribution was 25 % , 48 % , and 27 %. Compared to the `` regularly '' sleepy group , the `` never '' sleepy group obtained 54 min more night sleep prior to the outbound flights. For the inbound flights , the respective difference was 1 h 23 min. Also , the `` never '' sleepy pilots slept 31 min more between days off than the `` regularly '' sleepy pilots. The results of the in-flight alertness management strategies were mixed. The study demonstrates that pilots without recurrent on-duty sleepiness obtain more sleep than their colleagues with recurrent on-duty sleepiness. The result emphasizes the need to investigate whether the sleep of recurrently sleepy pilots can be increased and whether this increase would reduce their on-duty sleepiness.Sallinen M , Åkerstedt T , Härmä M , Henelius A , Ketola K , Leinikka M , Kecklund G , Sihvola M , Tuori A , Virkkala J , Puttonen S.
