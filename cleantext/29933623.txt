  A low percentage of novel drug candidates succeed and reach the end of the drug discovery pipeline , mainly due to poor initial screening and assessment of the effects of the drug and its metabolites over various tissues in the human body. For that , emerging technologies involving the production of organoids from human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs) and the use of organ-on-a-chip devices are showing great promise for developing a more reliable , rapid and cost-effective drug discovery process when compared with the current use of animal models. In particular , the possibility of virtually obtaining any type of cell within the human body , in combination with the ability to create patient-specific tissues using human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs) , broadens the horizons in the fields of drug discovery and personalized medicine. In this review , we address the current progress and challenges related to the process of obtaining organoids from different cell lineages emerging from hPSCs , as well as how to create devices that will allow a precise examination of the in vitro effects generated by potential drugs in different organ systems.
