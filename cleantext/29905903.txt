  The emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistant ( MDR) bacteria are major challenges for antimicrobial chemotherapy of bacterial infections. In this critical condition , cationic antimicrobial peptides are ` novel ' promising candidate antibiotics to overcome the issue. In this study , we investigated the antibacterial mechanism of new melittin-derived peptides ( i.e. , MDP1 and MDP2) against multidrug resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , Escherichia<pathogen> coli , and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> MDP1 was designed with deletion of three amino acid residues , i.e. , S
