  GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing ( PV +) interneurons provide powerful inhibitory modulation of grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex ( MEC LII). However , the molecular machinery through which PV + cells regulate grid cell activity is poorly defined. PV + interneurons impart inhibitory modulation primarily via GABA-A receptors ( GABA
