  This study compiled percentiles for cardiorespiratory parameters in healthy term neonates during quiet sleep. We enrolled 215 healthy term neonates born at Hannover Medical School , Germany , between October 2011 and March 2013. They were prospectively observed on the maternity ward at a median age of two days using six-hour recordings of pulse oximeter plethysmography , oxygen saturation , thoracic breathing movements and electrocardiogram during sleep in a supine position. We examined their heart rate , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation during quiet sleep , plus bradycardias<symptom> , apnoeas lasting at least four-seconds and desaturations below 85 %. The 3rd , 50th and 97th percentiles were calculated as follows: heart rate 87 , 112 and 133 beats per minute , respiratory rate 32 , 44 and 57 per minute and oxygen saturation 94 , 98 and 100 %. Desaturations , apnoeas and bradycardias<symptom> below 80 beats per minute were common and recorded in 54 % , 98 % and 30 % of participants. In contrast , only 7 % experienced bradycardias<symptom> of less than two-thirds of the baseline heart rate and 5 % experienced apnoeas exceeding 15 seconds. Our results will facilitate the evidence-based valuation of cardiorespiratory parameters in term neonates and help validate the significance of cardiorespiratory events in preterm infants at discharge.
