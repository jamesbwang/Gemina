  This quality improvement project aimed to change the practice of administration route of acetaminophen from intravenous ( IV) to oral to patients having a hysterectomy at a community hospital , reduce costs , and maintain postanesthesia care unit pain scores for patients who receive oral acetaminophen comparable to those who receive IV acetaminophen. There were 46 participants: 23 in the preintervention group and 23 in the postintervention group. Data retrieved from the electronic medical record included the route of acetaminophen administered , cost , and pain scores. Implementation of this quality improvement project resulted in no difference in the pain scores between the preintervention and postintervention groups ( P = .637). In addition , the hospital cost for acetaminophen decreased 95.25 % and patients saved $ 6,683 during the 3-month implementation period. The administration of oral acetaminophen provided equivalent postoperative analgesia compared with IV acetaminophen and reduced costs for both the hospital and patients.
