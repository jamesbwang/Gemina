  A novel high-sensitivity HBsAg quantification assay , Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ , was developed. However , its performance in practical application has not yet been adequately investigated. The aim of the study was to evaluate the agreement of serum HBsAg by Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ ( HBsAg-HQ) with HBsAg by Architect HBsAg-QT ( HBsAg-QT) and comparatively investigate the efficacy of serum HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT in predicting the liver tissue pathological states of chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB) patients. A total of 147 HBeAg-positive and 128 HBeAg-negative patients were enrolled. HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT were measured using CLEIA Lumipulse G1200 and CMIA Abbott Architect I2000 automatic analyzer , respectively. The Scheuer standard was used for the pathological diagnosis of liver tissue samples. In both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients , HBsAg-HQ was significantly positively correlated with HBsAg-QT ( r = 0.913 and r = 0.959 , respectively) , the overall disagreement rates between HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT were 2.72 % ( 4/147) and 4.69 % ( 6/128) , respectively. In HBeAg-positive patients , the area under the ROC curve ( AUC) of HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT for predicting the grade ≥ G3 ( 0.686 and 0.684 , respectively) and stage ≥ S4 ( 0.739 and 0.745 , respectively) were the greatest compared with other pathological states; the optimal cutoffs of HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT for predicting the grade ≥ G3 were < 2.244 × 107 mIU/mL and < 3.589 × 107 mIU/mL , and those for predicting the stage ≥ S4 were 7.328 × 106 mIU/mL and < 6.194 × 106 mIU/mL , respectively. HBsAg-HQ is highly correlated and in agreement with HBsAg-QT in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients; HBsAg-HQ and HBsAg-QT are very valuable in predicting the grade ≥ G3 and stage ≥ S4 in HBeAg-positive patients.
