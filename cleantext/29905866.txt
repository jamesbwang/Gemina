  Grapevine , Vitis vinifera , is an important economic fruit crop that is highly sensitive to gibberellin ( GA) , and the exogenous application of GA can efficiently induce grapevine parthenocarpy. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. In this study , morphological changes during flower development in response to GA treatments were examined in the ` Zuijinxiang ' cultivar. To obtain insights into the roles of miRNA159s in GA-induced grapevine parthenocarpy , VvmiR159a , VvmiR159b , VvmiR159c , and their target gene VvGAMYB were isolated , sequenced and characterized. Spatial-temporal expression analyses showed that VvmiR159c exhibited the highest expression levels at 4 d before flowering , followed by a gradual decrease , while VvGAMYB displayed an opposite pattern of expression with the lowest expression at the corresponding stage in response to GA treatment. A cleavage interaction between VvmiR159s and VvGAMYB and variations of their cleavage roles were confirmed in grapevine floral development. In addition , the potential roles of VvmiR159s in GA signaling were investigated through DELLA-protein repressors , indicating that GA-DELLA ( SLR1)- VvmiR159c-VvGAMYB is the key signaling regulatory module in grapevine. Our findings provide novel insights into the GA-responsive roles of VvmiR159s in modulating grapevine floral development , which have important implications for the molecular breeding of high-quality seedless grapevine berry.
