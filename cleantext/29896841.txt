  State-of-the-art relativistic coupled-cluster theory is used to construct many-body potentials for the noble-gas element radon to determine its bulk properties including the solid-to-liquid phase transition from parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations through either direct sampling of the bulk or from a finite cluster approach. The calculated melting temperature are 200 ( 3) K and 200 ( 6) K from bulk simulations and from extrapolation of finite cluster values , respectively. This is in excellent agreement with the often debated ( but widely cited) and only available value of 202 K , dating back to measurements by Gray and Ramsay in 1909.
