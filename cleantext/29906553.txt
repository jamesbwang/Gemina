  Antibody-drug conjugates ( ADCs) are currently considered to be promising agents for cancer therapy. However , especially in solid tumors , the uneven distribution of ADCs would decrease their efficacy in clinical studies. We suggest that in addition to optimizing ADC components , such as the linker structure and anticancer agent , it is necessary to consider the distribution of the ADC within tumor tissue. In this study , we established three kinds of anti-tissue factor ( TF) ADCs: 1849ADC with a low k
