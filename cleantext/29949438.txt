  Severe injury to the central nervous system of chordates often results in permanent and irreversible mental and physical challenges. While some chordates are able to repair and/or regenerate portions of their nervous system , no chordate has been shown to be able to regenerate all regions of its central nervous system after catastrophic injury or amputation. Some hemichordates , on the other hand , are able to efficiently regenerate all neural structures , including their dorsal , hollow neural tube after complete ablation. Solitary hemichordates are marine acorn worms and a sister group to the echinoderms. The hemichordate Ptychodera flava<pathogen> progresses from a pelagic , feeding tornaria larva to a tripartite benthic worm with an anterior proboscis , a middle collar region , and a long posterior trunk. The adult worm regenerates all body parts when bisected in the trunk , but it was unknown whether the regeneration process was present in tornaria larvae. Now , we show that P. flava<pathogen> larvae are capable of robust regeneration after bisection through the sagittal , coronal , and axial planes. We also use antibody staining to show that the apical sensory organ regenerates a rich , serotonin-positive complex of cells within two weeks after amputation. Cells labeled with 5-ethynyl-2 '- deoxyuridine confirm that regeneration is occurring through epimorphic processes as new cells are added at the cut site and throughout the regenerating tissue. This study verifies that P. flava<pathogen> larvae can be used for future functional studies aimed at identifying the genetic and morphological mechanisms controlling central nervous system regeneration in a stem deuterostome.
