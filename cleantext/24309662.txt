  Neural stem cells ( NSCs) play vital roles in brain homeostasis and exhibit a broad repertoire of potentially therapeutic actions following neurovascular injury. One such injury is stroke , a worldwide leading cause of death and disability. Clinically , extensive injury from ischemic stroke results from ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) , which is accompanied by inflammation<symptom> , blood-brain barrier ( BBB) damage , neural cell death , and extensive tissue loss. Tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA) is still the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved clot-lysing agent. Whereas the thrombolytic role of tPA within the vasculature is beneficial , the effects of tPA ( in a non-thrombolytic role) within the brain parenchyma have been reported as harmful. Thus , new therapies are needed to reduce the deleterious side effects of tPA and quickly facilitate vascular repair following stroke. The Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable ( STAIR) recommends that stroke therapies `` focus on drugs/devices/treatments with multiple mechanisms of action and that target multiple pathways ''. Thus , based on multifactorial ischemic cascades in various stroke stages , effective stroke therapies need to focus on targeting and ameliorating early IR injury as well as facilitating angiogenesis , neurogenesis , and neurorestorative mechanisms following stroke. This review will discuss the preclinical perspectives of NSC transplantation as a promising treatment for neurovascular injury and will emphasize both the subacute and chronic phase of ischemic stroke.
