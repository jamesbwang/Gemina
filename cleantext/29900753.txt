  Physical activity ( PA) is a potential therapy to improve quality of life in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer ( LC) , but no PA regimen has been shown to be beneficial , clinically practical , and sustainable. We sought to test the hypothesis that a patient-centered activity regimen ( PCAR) will improve patient participation and PA more effectively than weekly phone calls. In patients with advanced-stage LC , we implemented a walking-based activity regimen and motivated patients via either weekly phone calls ( n = 29; FitBit Zip accelerometer) or PCAR ( n = 15; FitBit Flex , an educational session , and twice-daily gain-framed text messages). Data collection over a 4-week period was compared , and a repeated-measures , mixed-effects model for activity level was constructed. Subjects receiving PCAR more frequently used the device ( 100 % vs 79 %) and less frequently had missing data ( 11 % vs 38 %). `` More active '' and `` less active '' groups were created based on mean step count in the first week. `` Less active '' patients in the PCAR group increased their PA level , whereas PA level fell in the `` more active '' group. Most subjects found PCAR helpful ( 92 %) and would participate in another activity study ( 85 %). Compared with weekly phone calls , PCAR has higher patient participation , is more likely to improve PA in `` less active '' subjects , and has high patient satisfaction. A multifaceted PA regimen may be a more efficacious mechanism to study PA in advanced LC. PCAR should be used in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate for improvements in symptom burden , quality of life , and mood.
