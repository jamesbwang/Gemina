  The aim of the study was to assess the effect of two levels of wasted date ( WD) by replacing commercial concentrate on the reproductive performance of Ouled Djellal ( OD) rams. Eighteen mature ( 2-year-old) OD rams were equally allocated to three groups and fed during 11 weeks with one of three different experimental diets , that contained 0 % ( 0 WD) , 50 % ( 50 WD) , or 75 % ( 75 WD) of WDs in concentrate diet. Live body<symptom> weight ( LBW) , body condition scoring ( BCS) , scrotal circumference ( SC) , testicular weight ( TW) , sperm production and quality , plasma testosterone concentration ( T) , and sexual behavior ( reaction time and number of mounts with ejaculation) were regularly recorded from every ram. LBW , SC , and TW changed significantly among diet groups and during the experimental period ( p < 0.001) , the highest averages were recorded in ( 0 WD) group. LBW , BCS , SC , TW , semen volume , and percentage of the positive hypo-osmotic swelling test were ( p < 0.001) positively influenced by flushing period. Nevertheless , sperm concentration showed a significant ( p < 0.001) decrease at day 30 , followed by a return to the initial values afterward. There were no differences ( p > 0.05) between diet groups for plasma testosterone concentration and semen attributes , except that ( 50 WD) group expressed the lowest overall value of semen concentration. Furthermore , neither time nor diet affected ( p > 0.05) sperm motility and reproductive behavior parameters. It is possible to introduce WD as unconventional local feeding resources in flushing diet of breeding rams without disturbing their reproductive performance.
