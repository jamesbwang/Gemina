  In the present study , we demonstrate a tunneling nanogap technique to identify individual RNA nucleotides , which can be used as a mechanism to read the nucleobases for direct sequencing of RNA in a solid-state nanopore. The tunneling nanogap is composed of two electrodes separated by a distance of < 3 nm and functionalized with a recognition molecule. When a chemical entity is captured in the gap , it generates electron tunneling currents , a process we call recognition tunneling ( RT). Using RT nanogaps created in a scanning tunneling microscope ( STM) , we acquired the electron tunneling signals for the canonical and two modified RNA nucleotides. To call the individual RNA nucleotides from the RT data , we adopted a machine learning algorithm , support vector machine ( SVM) , for the data analysis. Through the SVM , we were able to identify the individual RNA nucleotides and distinguish them from their DNA counterparts with reasonably high accuracy. Since each RNA nucleoside contains a hydroxyl group at the 2 '- position of its sugar ring in an RNA strand , it allows for the formation of a tunneling junction at a larger nanogap compared to the DNA nucleoside in a DNA strand , which lacks the 2 ' hydroxyl group. It also proves advantageous for the manufacture of RT devices. This study is a proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of an RT nanopore device for directly sequencing single RNA molecules , including those bearing modifications.
