  p-Coumaroyl ester 3-hydroxylase ( C3 ` H) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lignin , a phenylpropanoid polymer that is the major constituent of secondary cell walls in vascular plants. Although the crucial role of C3 ' H in lignification and its manipulation to upgrade lignocellulose have been investigated in eudicots , limited information is available in monocotyledonous grass species , despite their potential as biomass feedstocks. Here we address the pronounced impacts of C3 ' H deficiency on the structure and properties of grass cell walls. C3 ` H-knockdown lines generated via RNA interference ( RNAi)- mediated gene silencing , with about 0.5 % of the residual expression levels , reached maturity and set seeds. In contrast , C3 ` H-knockout rice mutants generated via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis were severely dwarfed and sterile. Cell wall analysis of the mature C3 ` H-knockdown RNAi lines revealed that their lignins were largely enriched in p-hydroxyphenyl ( H) units while being substantially reduced in the normally dominant guaiacyl ( G) and syringyl ( S) units. Interestingly , however , the enrichment of H units was limited to within the non-acylated lignin units , with grass-specific Î³-p-coumaroylated lignin units remaining apparently unchanged. Suppression of C3 ' H also resulted in relative augmentation in tricin residues in lignin as well as a substantial reduction in wall cross-linking ferulates. Collectively , our data demonstrate that C3 ' H expression is an important determinant not only of lignin content and composition but also of the degree of cell wall cross-linking. We also demonstrated that C3 ` H-suppressed rice displays enhanced biomass saccharification.
