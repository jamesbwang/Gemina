  The aim of this study was to evaluate the occupational health risks in the Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites ( NPCSs). Established cases of occupational diseases in 2010-2014 were extracted from the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work ( INAIL) archives. Standardized incidence ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were estimated by site and by disease group separately for genders. In the 44 NPCSs evaluated , 11015 cases of occupational diseases ( 8877 in men and 2138 in women) were ascertained. Overall , an excess of occupational diseases with respect to expected cases of 24.2 % was found in men residing in NPCSs. An increased occurrence was detected in 21 NPCSs for men and in eight for women. The findings suggest a role of occupational diseases in the health profile of NPCSs , reinforcing the need for a permanent surveillance system.
