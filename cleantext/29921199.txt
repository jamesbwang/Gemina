  Venoms , the secretions of venomous animals , are conventionally thought to be the source of toxic substances though the views about venoms in the recent era have been changed. Venoms are the proven source of many biologically and pharmacologically important useful molecules. Bioactive components present in different venoms are mainly proteins and peptides either enzymatic or non-enzymatic which have tremendous therapeutic potential and are being used for the treatment of variety of diseases including cancer. Many venoms proteins and peptides have been reported as potential anticancer agents. Venom proteins kill cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms which induce apoptosis and ultimately lead to cell death. Therefore , the understanding regarding sources and classification of venoms , biological role of venomous proteins , their anticancer potential and mechanisms to suppress/kill cancer cells needs to be addressed. The present review is an attempt to highlight the reported work and develop strategies to answer the key questions regarding the use of venomous proteins as therapeutic agents.
