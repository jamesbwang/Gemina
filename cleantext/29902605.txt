  Intradural extramedullary ( IDEM) spinal cord tumors account for two-thirds of all intraspinal neoplasms. Surgery for IDEM tumors carries risks for many different complications , which to date have been poorly described and quantified. In this study , we better characterize risk factors and complications for IDEM tumors , stratifying patients by spinal cord level and malignancy. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( ACS-NSQIP) database was queried to determine 30-day outcomes following surgery for IDEM tumors between 2005 and 2016. Patients with cervical , thoracic , and lumbar tumors were compared in terms of demographics , comorbidities , and postoperative complications. A similar analysis was performed comparing patients with benign and malignant tumors. A total of 991 patients with IDEM tumors were identified in the cohort. The majority of tumors were thoracic ( 44.3 %) , followed by lumbar ( 35.4 %) and cervical ( 20.3 %). Only 6.3 % of patients were readmitted within 30 days , 4.2 % returned to the operating room , and 1.0 % died. Significant associations were noted between spinal cord level and patient sex , age , functional status , American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) classification , prevalence of diabetes and hypertension , and risk of developing pneumonia<disease> Benign and malignant tumors differed by patient sex , baseline ASA class , risk of return to the operating room , mortality , and likelihood of transfusion. IDEM tumors are common and carry surgical risks , with different complication profiles for tumors at different spinal levels and degrees of malignancy. With definitive risk factors and outcomes , the ACS-NSQIP cohort provides a snapshot of national neurosurgery trends and outcomes in contemporary IDEM surgery.
