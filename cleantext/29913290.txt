  This study sought to determine whether implantation of a newly designed nonfusion intracorporeal enhancement ( NICE) system is an effective and safe way to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture ( OVCF). Thirteen patients with OVCF ( 10 women , 3 men; mean age 69 years , T11-L4) were included. From June 2014 to June 2016 , all patients were treated with the NICE system. The clinical and radiologic results were evaluated preoperatively , postoperatively , and at 24 months follow-up based on the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index , radiography , magnetic resonance imaging , and computed tomography ( height of fractured body and kyphosis Cobb angle). There was a significant improvement in pain intensity ( visual analog scale score decreased from 8.3 preoperatively to 2.2 postoperatively , and decreased to 1.5 twenty-four months postoperatively). Also , a significant reduction was observed in that the mean Oswestry Disability Index decreased from 71.9 % preoperatively to 17.6 % after 24 months. The mean Cobb angle had a significant improvement , which decreased from 6.6 ° preoperatively to 1.3 ° postoperatively and then decreased to 1.2 ° after 24 months. Height of fractured body improved significantly from 66.4 % to 86.5 % and slightly decreased to 82.4 % after 24 months. No specific complications were identified to be associated with this technique. With a low complication rate , the clinical midterm results are satisfactory. The treatment of symptomatic OVCF with the NICE system is a safe and effective procedure.
