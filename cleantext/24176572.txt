  To study metastasis to the infra-pyloric ( no. 6) lymph nodes and their subgroups and the related risk factors of gastric cancer patients. Gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy with complete postoperative pathological information on the no. 6 lymph node station and its subgroups from January 1 , 2008 , to December 31 , 2011 , were included. The clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were analyzed. A total of 121 patients were included; they had 6.1 ± 7.7 positive lymph nodes , and 35.1 ± 14.2 lymph nodes were examined. The overall lymph node positivity rate was 67.8 % ( 82/121) with a positivity rate of 28.1 % ( 34/121) for the no. 6 lymph nodes. The metastasis rate was 6.6 % for the no. 6a nodes , 6.6 % for the no. 6b nodes , and 21.5 % for the no. 6c nodes. Also , no. 8a ( OR = 1.329 , p = 0.017) and no. 9 ( OR = 1.250 , p = 0.022) nodal positivity and lower third tumor location ( OR = 1.278 , p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for no. 6 lymph nodal metastasis. There was a significant survival difference between patients with positive and negative no. 6 lymph nodes and patients with metastasis to other lymph node stations ( p < 0.001). Patients with no. 6 lymph node metastasis have poor survival outcomes. Complete infra-pyloric lymphadenectomy is necessary and crucial for gastric cancer patients.
