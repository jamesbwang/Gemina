Therefore Malaysia implements human papilloma virus ( HPV) vaccination as a national vaccination program. Parents play an important role in determining the success of this HPV vaccination program among schoolaged girls by their compliance. Objective: To assess parental knowledge , decision-making and acceptance of HPV vaccination. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted among 280 randomly selected parents of primary school students aged 11 in Kota Bharu using a pre-validated self-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge and decision-making with regard to HPV vaccination. Results: Most parents ( 62 %) were shown to have poor knowledge while most decision-making was shared. Age of respondents ( adjusted odds ratio ` AOR ' = 1.09; 95 % confidence interval ` CI ' = 1.04-1.14; p < 0.001) and good knowledge of HPV vaccination ( AOR = 16.32; 95 % CI = 7.32-36.4; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: The majority of parents exhibited poor knowledge which may affect their decision-making and uptake of HPV vaccination among their children.
