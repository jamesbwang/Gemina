  Due to late diagnosis and resistance to chemotherapy , most patients with cholangiocarcinoma have an unfavorable prognosis. Despite the use of immunohistochemistry ( IHC) in clinical routine , differentiation between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC) and secondary adenocarcinomas of the liver is frequently not clear , leading to false diagnosis and treatment decisions. Oligonucleotide microarrays ( Affymetrix Hu133A ©) were used for gene expression analysis of ICC ( n = 11) and secondary adenocarcinomas ( colorectal metastases; n = 6). By two-dimensional cluster analysis a specific gene expression profile of these tumors was established and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and IHC. A total of 338 genes were significantly dysregulated ( gene expression/fc ≥ 2; dysregulation in ≥ 60 %) in both tumor groups. Using two-dimensional cluster analysis a fast , clear , and reproducible differentiation between ICC and colorectal metastases was possible in all cases. As potential biomarkers for differentiation , twelve genes ( ICC: KRT7 , DBN1 , LCTB , LIF , STK17A , PIGF; metastases: TDGF1 , HOXA9 , TFF3 , MYB , ABP1 , BCL11A) were detected and will be used for further investigations. A specific gene expression profile for discrimination of primary and secondary adenocarcinoma of the liver could be established. In addition , marker genes for both cancers and their potential use as discrimination markers in clinical routine were also described partially for the first time.
