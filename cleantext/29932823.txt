  The presence of multiple faces during a crime may provide a naturally-occurring contextual cue to support eyewitness recognition for those faces later. Across two experiments , we sought to investigate mechanisms underlying previously-reported cued recognition effects , and to determine whether such effects extended to encoding conditions involving more than two faces. Participants studied sets of individual faces , pairs of faces , or groups of four faces. At test , participants in the single-face condition were tested only on those individual faces without cues. Participants in the two and four-face conditions were tested using no cues , correct cues ( a face previously studied with the target test face) , or incorrect cues ( a never-before-seen face). In Experiment 2 , associative encoding was promoted by a rating task. Neither hit rates nor false-alarm rates were significantly affected by cue type or face encoding condition in Experiment 1 , but cuing of any kind ( correct or incorrect) in Experiment 2 appeared to provide a protective buffer to reduce false-alarm rates through a less liberal response bias. Results provide some evidence that cued recognition techniques could be useful to reduce false recognition , but only when associative encoding is strong.
