  Research has demonstrated an association between social anxiety<symptom> and impaired Theory of Mind ( ToM). We assess whether ToM deficits occur even at a subclinical level of social anxiety<symptom> and whether group differences in ToM performance are consistent with interpretation bias. We also explore potential reasons as to why socially anxious individuals may perform differently on ToM tasks. Undergraduate participants high ( HSA; n = 78) and low ( LSA; n = 35) in social anxiety<symptom> completed a task of ToM decoding , the Reading the Mind in the Eyes ( MIE) , a task of ToM reasoning , the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition ( MASC) , and a post-task questionnaire about their experience completing the MASC. HSAs performed marginally worse than LSAs on the MIE on neutrally valenced trials , and their pattern of errors may be consistent with a negative interpretation bias. HSAs and LSAs did not differ overall in performance on the MASC , though HSAs reported experiencing more confusion<symptom> and distress than LSAs during the task , and this distress was associated with more MASC errors for HSA participants only. These results provide insight into the nature of ToM ability in socially anxious individuals and highlight important avenues for future research.
