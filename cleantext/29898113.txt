  The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the use of subcutaneous mineral supplementation would affect metabolic parameters , immunological response , milk quality and composition of dairy cows in the postpartum period. Twelve pregnant primiparous Holstein cows , were divided into two groups: six animals supplemented with the mineral complex ( magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , selenium and copper) , and six animals used as controls. Milk samples were collected every two other weeks postpartum up to sixty days of lactation to analyze composition and quality. Blood samples were collected , and the levels of ketone bodies , total proteins , glucose , albumin , and globulin were measured. The catalase and superoxide enzymes , reactive oxygen species , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor , and interleukins were determined. Animals supplemented with minerals showed lower levels of ketone bodies and somatic cell counts on days 30 , 45 and 60 of the experiment , without changes in milk composition compared to the control group. Supplemented cows had lower levels reactive oxygen species and increased superoxide enzymes activity. Total protein , globulin and cytokine levels were higher in cows supplemented with mineral complexes. Therefore , we can conclude that subcutaneous mineral supplementation improved the immune response and minimized the oxidative stress in dairy cows during lactation.
