  DNA single-strand breaks ( SSBs) have attracted much interest since they are highly related to carcinogenesis and ageing. Herein , we report a new liquid crystal ( LC)- based sensor for the detection of DNA SSBs generated by reactive oxygen species ( ROS) created from the Fenton reaction. The adsorption of single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) onto the cationic surfactant-laden aqueous/LC interface interferes with the surfactant layer , inducing a planar orientation of the LCs. However , the DNA SSBs generated by the Fenton reaction-produced ROS result in a decrease of the electrostatic interactions between the ssDNA<pathogen> and cationic surfactant molecules , causing rearrangement of the surfactant layer and reorientation of the LCs back to a homeotropic alignment. The changes in orientation of the LCs caused by the DNA SSBs are simply converted and observed as a shift from a bright optical image of the LCs to a dark one under a polarized light microscope. With this simple LC-based approach , the DNA SSBs could be detected more effectively and rapidly without any complex instrumentation or intricate processes. Therefore , our research provides a novel strategy for the detection of DNA damage as well as better insight into the DNA-damaging process.
