  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is associated with significant infectious complications leading to adverse health outcomes. This increased susceptibility to infection can be related to the nephropathy itself as observed in nephrotic syndrome<disease> , to the treatment especially in situations requiring immunosuppressive drugs or related to dialysis. Despite a less effective response to vaccination , some data emphasize similar benefits from immunization among people with CKD to the general population. However , some situations encountered in nephrology require adaptation of immunization practices. The aim of this review is to provide a synthesis of the existing guidelines for immunization in the field of nephrology.
