  An unrecognized latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) may be reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy and become life threatening. Diagnosing LTBI requires the combination of targeted patient history and physical examination with the results of an interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA) and in addition , a chest Xâ€‘ray is needed to rule out active tuberculosis<disease> Established therapies for LTBI reduce the reactivation risk by approximately 80 %. For the initial screening of an HBV infection HBsAg and anti-HBc are determined. Hereby , HBsAg carriers ( high HBV reactivation risk , indications for antiviral prophylaxis) and serologically resolved HBV infections ( low HBV reactivation risk , use of prophylaxis only in high-risk immunosuppression) can be reliably detected. A previously unrecognized HCV infection , with an increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis during immunosuppression , can be detected in screening by anti-HCV antibodies and be successfully treated with antivirals without interferon.
