  As the genome of experimental animals has become easier to manipulate , a number of mouse models have been developed to understand in vivo thyroid hormone action. A major site of thyroid hormone action is the HPT axis. While several methods are available that provide a detailed understanding of the HPT axis in mice , many authors choose to include only cursory data about this axis , which can lead to erroneous conclusions about in vivo thyroid hormone action. A standard protocol is proposed to evaluate the HPT axis in mice.
