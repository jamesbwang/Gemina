  Photoresponsive smart materials transform light energy into sophisticated functions. They find increasing biomedical applications in light-induced drug-release and photopharmacology , because they can provide the desired therapeutic effect locally due to precise spatiotemporal dosage control. However , the majority of reported studies rely on cytotoxic UV light that penetrates tissues poorly. Here , we report the first drug-releasing system based on photochromic low molecular weight supramolecular hydrogels that is triggered with visible light. We demonstrated green-light-induced release of structurally unmodified antibiotic , anticancer , and anti-inflammatory drugs under physiological conditions. Using the antibiotic-loaded gel , we selectively inhibited bacterial growth with green light.
