  Root border cells lie at the interface between the root cap and the soil , secreting mucilage containing polysaccharides and molecules influencing microbial growth around the root. Border cells are sloughed off from the root surface , and the detachment is associated with secretion of xylogalacturonan ( XGA). Recently , we showed that in alfalfa XGA secretion is mediated by large vesicles arising from the trans-Golgi in root cap cells. These vesicles are detected in precursor cells of border cells , but their fusion with the plasma membrane is observed only in border cells. We have now examined XGA secretion from maize border cells and Arabidopsis border-like cells using transmission electron microscopy and immunolabeling. In the root caps of both species , XGA is packaged into vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi , not in the vesicles from the trans-Golgi network as in the alfalfa root cap. Border cell-specific exocytosis of XGA was observed in the maize root suggesting that sorting and secretion of XGA in the root cap are conserved in monocot plants.
