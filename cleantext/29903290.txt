  To explore the association between maternal MTHFR gene polymorphism ( C677T) and neural tube defects in offspring through Meta-analysis in China. CNKI , Pub Med , Web of Science , Chinese Wan Fang Data databases , CBM , VIP for published articles were searched from the time of Database establishment to July 5 th 2017. The search strategy was based on combinations of the English and/or Chinese keywords , ` MTHFR ` and ` folate pathway'and ` polymorphism ` or ` SNP ` and ` NTDs or Neural Tube Defects '. References of reviews and retrieved studies were also scanned. All the case-control studies about MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism and susceptibility of neural tube defect were collected , which were fulfilled the followinginclusion criteria: case-control study and cohort study design , presentation of data necessary for calculating odds ratios ( ORs). Data were extracted from studies and analyzed by Rev Man 5. 3 software. A total of 13 papers were selected , including1500 patients and 1654 controls. Meta-analysis result showed that the combined odds ratio values of neural tube defect for offspring with maternal TT , TT + CT and T allele genotypes were 1. 94 , 1. 65 and 1. 39 , respectively. The present Meta-analysis suggests that MTHFR C677T is significantly associated with maternal risk for NTDs in the Chinese population , supplemental folic acid supplementation based on MTHFR polymorphisms will be an important means to further reduce the birth defects of newborns.
