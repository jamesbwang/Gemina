  Transcription factor cyclic Adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein plays a critical role in the cyclic AMP response pathway via its intrinsically disordered kinase inducible transactivation domain ( KID). KID is one of the most studied intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs) , although most previous studies focus on characterizing its disordered state structures. An interesting question that remains to be answered is how the order-disorder transition occurs at experimental conditions. Thanks to the newly developed IDP-specific force field ff14IDPSFF , the quality of conformer sampling for IDPs has been dramatically improved. In this study , molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations were used to study the order-to-disorder transition kinetics of KID based on the good agreement with the experiment on its disordered-state properties. Specifically , we tested four force fields , ff99SBildn , ff99IDPs , ff14IDPSFF , and ff14IDPs in the simulations of KID and found that ff14IDPSFF can generate more diversified disordered conformers and also reproduce more accurate experimental secondary chemical shifts. Kinetics analysis of MD simulations demonstrates that the order-disorder transition of KID obeys the first-order kinetics , and the transition nucleus is I127/L128/L141. The possible transition pathways from the nucleus to the last folded residues were identified as I127-R125-L138-L141-S143-A145 and L128-R125-L138-L141-S143-A145 based on a residue-level dynamical network analysis. These computational studies not only provide testable prediction/hypothesis on the order-disorder transition of KID but also confirm that the ff14IDPSFF force field can be used to explore the correlation between the structure and function of IDPs.
