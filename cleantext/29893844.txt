  Autophagy plays an essential role in intracellular degradation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis in all cells , including neurons. Although a recent study reported a copy number variation of Ulk2 , a gene essential for initiating autophagy , associated with a case of schizophrenia ( SZ) , it remains to be studied whether Ulk2 dysfunction could underlie the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we show that Ulk2 heterozygous ( Ulk2 +/-) mice have upregulated expression of sequestosome-1/ p62 , an autophagy-associated stress response protein , predominantly in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex ( PFC) , and exhibit behavioral deficits associated with the PFC functions , including attenuated sensorimotor gating and impaired cognition. Ulk2 +/- neurons showed imbalanced excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission , due in part to selective down-modulation of GABAA receptor surface expression in pyramidal neurons. Genetically reducing p62 gene dosage or suppressing p62 protein levels with an autophagy-inducing agent restored the GABAA receptor surface expression and rescued the behavioral deficits in Ulk2 +/- mice. Moreover , expressing a short peptide that specifically interferes with the interaction of p62 and GABAA receptor-associated protein ( GABARAP) , a protein that regulates endocytic trafficking of GABAA receptors , also restored the GABAA receptor surface expression , and rescued the behavioral deficits in Ulk2 +/- mice. Thus , the current study reveals a novel mechanism linking deregulated autophagy to functional disturbances of the nervous system relevant to SZ , through regulation of GABAA receptor surface presentation in pyramidal neurons.
