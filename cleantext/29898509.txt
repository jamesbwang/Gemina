  Urban wastewater treatment plant effluents represent one of the major emission sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( ARB) in natural aquatic environments. In this study , the effect of artificial solar radiation on total culturable heterotrophic bacteria and ARB ( including amoxicillin-resistant , ciprofloxacin-resistant , rifampicin-resistant , sulfamethoxazole-resistant , and tetracycline-resistant bacteria) present in secondary effluent was investigated. Artificial solar radiation was effective in inactivating the majority of environmental bacteria , however , the proportion of strains with ciprofloxacin-resistance and rifampicin-resistance increased in the surviving populations. Isolates of Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> , Serratia<pathogen> marcescens<pathogen> , and Stenotrophomonas<pathogen> maltophilia<pathogen> nosocomial pathogens were identified as resistant to solar radiation and to at least three antibiotics. Draft genome sequencing and typing revealed isolates carrying multiple resistance genes; where S maltophilia ( resistant to all studied antibiotics) sequence type was similar to strains isolated in blood infections. Results from this study confirm that solar radiation reduces total bacterial load in secondary effluent , but may indirectly increase the relative abundance of ARB.
