  Prostate cancer and osteosarcoma are the second most common type of cancer affecting men and the fifth most common malignancy among adolescents , respectively. The use of non-toxic natural or natural-derived products has been one of the current strategies for cancer therapy , owing to the reduced risks of induced-chemoresistance development and the absence of secondary effects. In this perspective , lactoferrin ( Lf) , a natural protein derived from milk , emerges as a promising anticancer agent due to its well-recognized cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic activity. Here , we aimed to ascertain the potential activity of bovine Lf ( bLf) against highly metastatic cancer cells. The bLf effect on prostate PC-3 and osteosarcoma MG-63 cell lines , both displaying plasmalemmal V-ATPase , was studied and compared with the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and the non-tumorigenic BJ-5ta cell lines. Cell proliferation , cell death , intracellular pH , lysosomal acidification , and extracellular acidification rate were evaluated. Results show that bLf inhibits proliferation , induces apoptosis , intracellular acidification , and perturbs lysosomal acidification only in highly metastatic cancer cell lines. By contrast , BJ-5ta cells are insensitive to bLf. Overall , our results establish a common mechanism of action of bLf against highly metastatic cancer cells exhibiting plasmalemmal V-ATPase. This study opens promising perspectives for further research on the anticancer role of Lf , which ultimately will contribute to its safer and more rational application in the human therapy of these life-threatening cancers.
