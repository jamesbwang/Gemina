  Small therapeutic proteins represent a promising novel approach to treat cancer. Nevertheless , their clinical application is often adversely impacted by their short plasma half-life. Controlled long-term delivery of small biologicals has become a challenge because of their hydrophilic properties and in some cases their limited stability. Here , an in-situ forming depot injectable polymeric system was used to deliver BiJ591 , a Bispecific T-cell Engager ( BiTE) targeting both prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) and the CD3 T-cell receptor in prostate cancer. BiJ591 induced T-cell activation , prostate cancer directed cell lysis and tumor growth inhibition. The use of diblock and triblock biodegradable polyethylene glycol- poly ( lactic acid) ( PEG-PLA) copolymers solubilized in tripropionin , a small chain triglyceride , allowed maintenance of BiJ591 stability and functionality in the formed depot and controlled its release. In mice , after a single subcutaneous injection , one of the polymeric candidates , TB1/DB4 , provided the most sustained release of BiJ591 for up to 21 days. Moreover , the use of BiJ591-TB1/ DB4 formulation in prostate cancer xenograft models showed significant therapeutic activity in both low and high PSMA expressing tumors whereas daily intravenous administration of BiJ591 was less efficient. Collectively , the present data provide new insights into the development of controlled delivery of small therapeutic proteins in cancer.
