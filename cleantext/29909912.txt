  Following the landmark approvals by the United States Food and Drug Administration , the adoptive transfer of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T-cells has now entered mainstream clinical practice for patients with chemotherapy-resistant or refractory B-cell malignancies. These approvals have followed on from a prolonged period of pre-clinical evaluation , informing the design of clinical trials that have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in this difficult to treat patient population. However , the delivery of autologous CAR-engineered T-cell therapy is complex , costly and not without significant risk. Here we summarize the key themes of CAR T-cell preclinical development and highlight a number of innovative strategies designed to further address toxicity and improve efficacy. In concert with the emerging promise of precision genome editing , it is hoped these next generation products will increase the repertoire of clinical applications of CAR T-cell therapy in malignant and perhaps other disease settings.
