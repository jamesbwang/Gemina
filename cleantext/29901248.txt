  The paradigm of homogenous-sugar-backbone of RNA and DNA has reliably guided the construction of many functional and useful Xeno Nucleic Acid ( XNA) systems to date. Deviations from this monotonous and canonical design , in many cases , results in oligonucleotide systems which lack base-pairing with themselves , or with RNA or DNA. Here we show that nucleotides of two such compromised XNA systems can be combined with RNA and DNA in specific patterns to produce chimeric-backbone oligonucleotides , which in certain cases demonstrate base-pairing properties comparable to- or stronger than- canonical systems , while also altering the conventional Watson-Crick pairing behavior. The unorthodox pairing properties generated from these chimeric-sugar-backbone oligonucleotides suggest a counterintuitive approach of creating modules consisting of non-base pairing XNAs with RNA/DNA in a set pattern. This strategy has the potential to increase the diversity of unconventional nucleic acids leading to orthogonal backbone-sequence-controlled informational systems.
