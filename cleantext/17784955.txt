  Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide , but the overall prognosis remains disappointing especially in the advanced-stage patients. Aberration expression of Aurora kinases is tumorigenic and thus it has attracted interests as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Here , we investigated the proteomic response of HCC Hep3B cells to danusertib ( Danu) , a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor , and then validated the proteomic results based on stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC). The proteomic data identified that Danu modulated the expression of 542 protein molecules ( 279 up-regulated; 260 down-regulated; 3 stable). Ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA) and KEGG pathway analysis identified 107 and 24 signaling pathways were regulated by Danu , respectively. IPA analysis showed cellular growth and proliferation , and cell death and survival were among the top five molecular and cellular functions regulated by Danu. The verification experiments showed that Danu inhibited the proliferation of Hep3B cells with a 24-hr IC
