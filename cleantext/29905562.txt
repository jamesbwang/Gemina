  The purpose of the work is the modeling in the experiment of guided regeneration of bone tissue with the use of osteoplastic materials Bioplast and Cerabone with the subsequent morphological study of their influence on the course of osteoreparation. The experimental-morphological part of the work was performed on 90 mature rats of the Wistar line. The animals were divided into 3 experimental groups. In the first group ( 30 rats) , the osteoplastic material Bioplast-Dent was used; in the second group ( 30 rats) , the osteoplastic material Cerabone was used. The third ( 30 rats) group was the control group. A defect in the bone region was formed in rats , a titanium screw ( BT1-00) was implanted , then the bone defects were filled with osteoplastic material. In the control group , the osteoplastic material was not used. The animals were removed from the experiment by decapitation under ether anesthesia in 30 , 60 and 90 days. For morphological examination the resection of the central part of the femur shaft was carried out , including a defect site with a regenerator and a titanium screw. Each studied case was subjected to a microscopy survey in which the general character of the bone structure was assessed , as well as the presence or absence of changes and their nature in the zone of implant and osteoplastic material , as well as in dependent bone areas. The result of the comparative morphological study of xenogeneic osteoplastic materials Bioplast-Dent and Cerabone resulted in the recommended use of one of the materials in this implantation technique. Regeneration time of bone structures and qualitative characteristics of the newly formed bone did not differ fundamentally , however , when using Bioplast-Dent material , osteoreparation proceeded more actively and with more optimal morphological characteristics; there were no inflammatory changes , rejections or allergic reactions in response to implantation at all stages of the experiment.
