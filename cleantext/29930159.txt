  Stent retriever thrombectomy ( SRT) in acute thromboembolic stroke can result in post-thrombectomy subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( PTSAH). Intraprocedural findings associated with PTSAH are not well defined. To identify angiographic findings and procedural factors during SRT that are associated with PTSAH. This was a retrospective , observational cohort study of consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery ( MCA) acute ischemic stroke treated with SRT. Inclusion criteria were: ( 1) age ≥ 18 years; ( 2) thromboembolic occlusion of the MCA; ( 3) at least one stent retriever pass beginning in an M2 branch; ( 4) postprocedural CT or MRI scan within 24 hours; ( 5) non-enhanced CT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score > 5. Exclusion criteria included multi-territory stroke before SRT. Eighty-five patients were enrolled; eight patients had PTSAH ( group 1) and 77 did not ( group 2). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the two groups. In group 1 , a significantly greater proportion of patients had more than two stent retriever passes ( 62.5 % vs 18.2 % , P = 0.01) , a stent retriever positioned ≥ 2 cm along an M2 branch ( 100 % vs 30.2 % , P = 0.002) , and the presence of severe iatrogenic vasospasm before SRT pass ( 37.5 % vs 5.2 % , P = 0.02). One patient with PTSAH and associated mass effect deteriorated clinically. An increased number of stent retriever passes , distal device positioning , and presence of severe vasospasm were associated with PTSAH. Neurological deterioration with PTSAH can occur.
