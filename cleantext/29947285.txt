  Chemotherapy-induced nausea<symptom> can be distressing and difficult to manage in children with cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of ginger aromatherapy in relieving chemotherapy-induced nausea<symptom> in children with cancer. This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of 49 children with cancer explored whether inhalation of the aroma of essential oil of ginger during chemotherapy decreased nausea<symptom> compared with a placebo ( water) or control ( Johnson 's baby shampoo) measured by prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy assessment with the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool ( PeNAT). While well received , well tolerated , nontoxic , and noninvasive , ginger aromatherapy did not significantly decrease nausea<symptom> in patients enrolled in this study. Among 21 patients who indicated feeling nausea<symptom> prechemotherapy , 67 % reported improvement , 5 % worsening , and 28 % no change in their postinfusion PeNAT score. We failed to detect a statistical significant difference in the change in PeNAT scores among the three groups.
