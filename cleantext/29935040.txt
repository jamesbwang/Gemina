  The naphterpins and marinones are naphthoquinone meroterpenoids with an unusual aromatic oxidation pattern that is biosynthesized from 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene ( THN). We propose that cryptic halogenation of THN derivatives by vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase ( VCPO) enzymes is key to this biosynthetic pathway , despite the absence of chlorine in these natural products. This speculation inspired a total synthesis to mimic the naphterpin/marinone biosynthetic pathway. In validation of this biogenetic hypothesis , two VCPOs were discovered that interconvert several of the proposed biosynthetic intermediates.
