  This study developed smartphone-based virtual experiential nursing applications to care for patients with chronic illness , especially patients with hypertension and diabetes , and evaluated the effect of the applications on nursing students ' knowledge , self-efficacy , and learning experiences. Applications using gamification elements were developed according to the steps of assessment , design , development , implementation , and evaluation. Knowledge and self-efficacy were assessed via questionnaires , while learning experiences were assessed via six focus group interviews after the applications were used for 1 week. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive analysis , Ï‡ test , Fisher 's exact test , t test for the homogeneity of participants ( experimental , 49; control , 43) , an independent t test , and a paired t test for effectiveness in each group. Qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Knowledge on hypertension ( t = 4.41 , P < .001) and diabetes ( t = 2.45 , P < .009) , as well as self-efficacy for hypertension ( t = 3.08 , P < .002) and diabetes ( t = 1.75 , P < .043) , significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group. Students may use the applications as complementary learning resources without the limitations of time and space , and students were satisfied overall with their use. The chronic illness care smartphone applications are effective learning resources that assist students in assessing patients ' health problems and implementing nursing care plans to improve patient conditions.
