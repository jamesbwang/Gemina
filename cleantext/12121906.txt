  Epstein ⁻ Barr virus ( EBV) infects up to 95 % of the adult human population , with primary infection typically occurring during childhood and usually asymptomatic. However , EBV can cause infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> in approximately 35 ⁻ 50 % cases when infection occurs during adolescence and early adulthood. Epstein ⁻ Barr virus is also associated with several B-cell malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. A number of antiviral drugs have proven to be effective inhibitors of EBV replication , yet have resulted in limited success clinically , and none of them has been approved for treatment of EBV infections.
