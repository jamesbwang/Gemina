  Zinc is an essential nutrient for human health and has anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory functions. The association between zinc deficiency and the development of cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs) has been supported by numerous studies. Supplementing zinc can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and protect against myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this review we summarize the evidence in the literature , to consolidate the current knowledge on the dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in CVDs , and to explore the significant roles of the zinc homeostasis-regulatory proteins in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. Moreover , this review also deliberates on the potential diagnostic and prognostic implications of zinc/zinc homeostasis-associated molecules ( ZIP , ZnT , and MTs) in CVDs.
