  Five-year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) range from 14 % to 49 % for stage I to stage IIIA disease , and are < 5 % for stage IIIB/IV disease. Improvements have been made in the outcomes of patients with NSCLC due to advancements in radiotherapy ( RT) techniques , the use of concurrent chemotherapy with radiation , and the emergence of immunotherapy as first- and second-line treatment in the metastatic setting. RT remains the mainstay treatment in patients with inoperable early-stage NSCLC , and is given concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable disease. There is emerging evidence that RT not only provides local tumor control , but may also influence systemic control. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that RT induces immunomodulatory effects in the local tumor microenvironment , supporting a synergistic combination approach with immunotherapy to improve systemic control. Immunotherapy options that could be combined with RT include programmed cell death-1/ programmed cell death ligand-1 blockers , as well as investigational agents such as OX-40 agonists , toll-like receptor agonists , indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 inhibitors , and cytokines. Here , we describe the rationale for the integration of RT and immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC , present safety and efficacy data that support this combination strategy , review planned and ongoing studies , and highlight unanswered questions and future research needs.
