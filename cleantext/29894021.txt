  The manganese-catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydroboration of alkenes has been developed using a single manganese ( II) precatalyst and reaction protocol. Both reactions proceed with excellent control of regioselectivity and in high yields across a variety of sterically and electronically differentiated substrates ( 25 examples).
