  The objective of this study is to examine the effect of non-traditional student status on abusive relationships , namely emotional , physical , and sexual abuse. Logistic regression models were employed as a statistical strategy by using the 2011-2014 American College Health Association National College Health Assessment II data. The results showed that non-traditional students compared to traditional ones indeed had higher odds ratios of having abusive relationships. Non-traditional students compared to traditional students , however , were more likely to experience emotional and physical abuse , but not sexual abuse. Thus , the prevention programs and policies related to abusive relationships need to be address differently based on the results of this study , which is also important for non-traditional students to adjust and succeed in higher education and further their careers.
