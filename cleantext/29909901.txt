  Thyroid angiosarcoma ( TAS) is rare and represents a very aggressive malignancy. Its rarity is principally linked to two major pitfalls. Firstly , TAS histopathology diagnosis can be difficult; second , the limited clinical experience with this condition can make its management complex. We conducted a detailed systematic review , focusing on the knowledge available regarding TAS etiopathogenesis , treatment options and prognosis. The aim is to present the main TAS characteristics and to summarize the clinical experiences described worldwide , in order to provide a useful clinical tool.
