  We study the ordering statistics of four random walkers on the line , obtaining a much improved estimate for the long-time decay exponent of the probability that a particle leads to time t , P _ ( lead) ( t) ∼ t ^ ( -0.91287850) , and that a particle lags to time t ( never assumes the lead) , P _ ( lag) ( t) ∼ t ^ ( -0.30763604). Exponents of several other ordering statistics for N = 4 walkers are obtained to eight-digit accuracy as well. The subtle correlations between n walkers that lag jointly , out of a field of N , are discussed: for N = 3 there are no correlations and P _ ( lead) ( t) ∼ P _ ( lag) ( t) ^ ( 2). In contrast , our results rule out the possibility that P _ ( lead) ( t) ∼ P _ ( lag) ( t) ^ ( 3) for N = 4 , although the correlations in this borderline case are tiny.
