  A series of benzofuran-2-carboxamide-N-benzyl pyridinium halide derivatives ( 6a-o) are synthesized as new cholinesterase inhibitors. The synthetic pathway involves the reaction of salicylaldehyde derivatives and ethyl bromoacetate , followed by hydrolysis and amidation with 3- and 4-picolyl amine. Subsequently , N- ( ( pyridin-4-yl) methyl) benzofuran-2-carboxamide and substituted N- ( ( pyridin-3-yl) methyl) benzofuran-2-carboxamides reacts with benzyl halides to afford target compounds ( 6a-o). The chemical structures of all derivatives were confirmed by spectroscopic methods. The studies reveal that some of the synthesized compounds are potent butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors with IC
