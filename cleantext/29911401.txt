  Background Detecting normal-sized metastatic pelvic lymph nodes ( LNs) in cervical cancers , although difficult , is of vital importance. Purpose To investigate the value of diffusion-weighted-imaging ( DWI) , tumor size , and LN shape in predicting metastases in normal-sized pelvic LNs in cervical cancers. Material and Methods Pathology confirmed cervical cancer patients with complete magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) were documented from 2011 to 2016. A total of 121 cervical cancer patients showed small pelvic LNs ( < 5 mm) and 92 showed normal-sized ( 5-10 mm) pelvic LNs ( 39 patients with 55 nodes that were histologically metastatic , 53 patients with 71 nodes that were histologically benign). Preoperative clinical and MRI variables were analyzed and compared between the metastatic and benign groups. Results LN apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values and short-to-long axis ratios were not significantly different between metastatic and benign normal-sized LNs ( 0.98 ± 0.15 × 10
