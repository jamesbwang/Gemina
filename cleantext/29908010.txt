  Insulin resistance ( IR) is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). This study aimed to explore the effects of rapamycin , a specific inhibitor of kinase mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) , on IR in T2DM rats , and to validate whether the underlying mechanism was associated with autophagy. In this study , the model of T2DM rats was established by feeding the animals with a high-fat diet ( HFD) and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin ( STZ). Diabetic rats were randomly divided into model of T2DM control group ( DM-C , n = 15) , metformin group ( DM-M , n = 15) , rapamycin group ( DM-Rapa , n = 15) , 3-methyladenine ( 3-MA) group ( DM-3-MA , n = 15) , and rapamycin + 3-MA group ( DM-Rapa-3-MA , n = 15). Rats in different treatment groups were given by corresponding therapy from gastric tube. Meanwhile , normal control group was established ( n = 10). As expected , HFD- and STZ- induced T2DM rats exhibited significantly impaired glucose tolerance , reduced insulin sensitivity , dysglycemia and dyslipidemia , aggravated hepatic steatosis , enhanced hepatic inflammation<symptom> , elevated p-mTOR , and suppressed hepatic autophagy. Importantly , rapamycin and metformin significantly ameliorated IR , relieved disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism , reduced inflammatory level , inhibited mTOR , and promoted autophagy. Importantly , the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA significantly reversed the effects exerted by rapamycin. Collectively , our study suggests that rapamycin improved IR and hepatic steatosis in T2DM rats via activation of autophagy.
