  Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry ( & Phi;- OTDR) is an effective technique to accomplish fully distributed vibration measurement along the entire fiber link. In this paper , a novel data matrix matching method is proposed and successfully employed in the & Phi;- OTDR system for real-time vibration detection and type identification. By using the novel method , the quantized response time is presented and improved to millisecond level for the first time. Meanwhile , the data can be extracted completely without packet loss , thus allowing vibration type identification to be obtained while maintaining the system simplicity. The experimental results demonstrate that the vibration signals can be detected and located with an average response time of 50.1 ms , under a data transmission speed which can go up to 77.824 Mbps. Moreover , different vibration types such as sine<disease> waves and square waves which are applied to the sensing fiber through a piezoelectric ceramic ( PZT) cylinder can also be successfully identified. This method provides an efficient solution for real-time vibration location and type identification , thus exhibiting considerable application potential in many practical situations.
