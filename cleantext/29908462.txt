  Scale deposition is a common issue in industrial plants , which creates technical problems , i.e. reduction of heat transfer , decrease of flow rate due to an obstruction of pipes. Therefore , the development of some appropriate methods based on well suitable in situ sensors to evaluate and predict the scaling propensity of water is a major concern in current research. This would be a good strategy for the optimization of anti-scaling treatments. In this study , scaling tests were carried out using a sensitive sensor , which has been developed using a quartz crystal microbalance with a pre-calcified electrode surface ( SQCM). This technique allowed studying the influence of the supersaturation on the scaling rate. The set-up was tested with different water samples which were brought to a given supersaturation coefficient by degassing the dissolved CO
