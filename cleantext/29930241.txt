  BACKGROUND There is currently little information on haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation ( haplo-HCT) for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma ( T-LBL). Data about peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC) as a reliable graft source for T-LBL treatment are lacking. MATERIAL AND METHODS T-LBL patients who underwent T cell-replete haploidentical peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplantation ( haplo-PBHCT) from July 2007 to January 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS A total of 25 patients ( age â‰¥ 15 years) with median age of 24 ( range 15-51) years were enrolled. The median number of CD34 + cells infused was 5.0 ( 1.6-14.4) 106/kg. Sustained myeloid engraftment with full donor chimerism was achieved in all patients. The cumulative incidence of grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) at day 100 was 24 %. Two-year extensive chronic GVHD cumulative incidence was 20 %. The 3-year overall survival rate for all patients was 70 %. The median survival time of the complete remission ( CR) group was better than that of the non-CR group ( not reached vs. 9 m) ( P < 0.01). The relapse rate was 17 % for patients who obtained CR and were given haplo-HCT as consolidation treatment. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that haplo-PBHCT is a safe and effective method for the treatment of T-LBL.
