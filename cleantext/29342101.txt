  Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are increasingly being deployed on mobile platforms operating in unstructured environments. To generate geometrically accurate hyperspectral composites , the intrinsic parameters of these cameras must be resolved. This article describes a method for determining the intrinsic parameters of a hyperspectral line-scan camera. The proposed method is based on a cross-ratio invariant calibration routine and is able to estimate the focal length , principal point , and radial distortion parameters in a hyperspectral line-scan camera. Compared to previous methods that use similar calibration targets , our approach extends the camera model to include radial distortion. It is able to utilize calibration data recorded from multiple camera view angles by optimizing the re-projection error of all calibration data jointly. The proposed method also includes an additional signal processing step that automatically detects calibration points in hyperspectral imagery of the calibration target. These contributions result in accurate estimates of the intrinsic parameters with minimal supervision. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulation and demonstrated on real hyperspectral line-scans.
