  To evaluate the success rate in sperm retrieval ( SR) through microdissection testicular sperm extraction ( micro-TESE) in infertile azoospermia factor c ( AZFc)- deleted men and determining their reproductive outcomes following ICSI , medical records of couples with AZFc-deleted male partners were reviewed on patient 's age , serum hormone levels , karyotype , testicular pathology and pregnancy outcomes. A comparison on age and serum hormone level was conducted between groups with positive and negative sperm retrieval in both azoospermic and oligozoospermic AZFc-deleted men. Of 225 who had AZFc deletion , 195 cases followed clinical treatments. From 195 cases , 116 were azoospermic , 79 were oligozoospermic. Pathology profile was available in 103 of 195 subjects which the predominant trait was SCOS and was seen in 66.9 % of cases ( 69 of 103). Success rate of sperm retrieval in azoospermic patients who underwent micro-TESE was 36.3 % ( 28/77). Forty-three oligozoospermic and 17 azoospermic patients started ART cycle. Pregnancy rate in oligozoospermic group was 35.4 % ( 17 cases) , whilst there was no clinical pregnancy in azoospermic group. In conclusion , the pregnancy and delivery in oligozoospermic patients with AZFc deletion are comparable with other studies , but despite of sperm retrieval in azoospermic patients with AZFc deletion , the chance of pregnancy or delivery in these patients was very low.
