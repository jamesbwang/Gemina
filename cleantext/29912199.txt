  The zebrafish is a globally recognized fresh water organism frequently used in developmental biology , environmental toxicology , and human<disease> disease<disease> related research fields. Thanks to its unique features , including large fecundity , embryo translucency , rapid and simultaneous development , etc. , zebrafish embryos are often used for large scale toxicity assessment of chemicals and drug/compound screening. A typical screening procedure involves adult zebrafish spawning , embryos selection , and arraying the embryos into multi-well plates. From there , embryos are subjected to exposure and the toxicity of chemical , or the effectiveness of the drugs/compounds can be evaluated relatively quickly based on phenotypic observations. Among these processes , embryos arraying is one of the most time-consuming and labor-intensive steps that limits the throughput level. In this protocol , we present an innovative approach that makes use of a 3D-printed arraying template coupled with vacuum manipulation to speed up this laborious step. The protocol herein describes the overall design of the arraying template , a detailed experimental setup and step-by-step procedure , followed by representative results. When implemented , this approach should prove beneficial in a variety of research applications using zebrafish embryos as testing subjects.
