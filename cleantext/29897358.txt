  Three-dimensional ( 3D) printing now enables the fabrication of 3D structural electronics and microfluidics. Further , conventional subtractive manufacturing processes for microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS) relatively limit device structure to two dimensions and require post-processing steps for interface with microfluidics. Thus , the objective of this work is to create an additive manufacturing approach for fabrication of 3D microfluidic-based MEMS devices that enables 3D configurations of electromechanical systems and simultaneous integration of microfluidics. Here , we demonstrate the ability to fabricate microfluidic-based acoustofluidic devices that contain orthogonal out-of-plane piezoelectric sensors and actuators using additive manufacturing. The devices were fabricated using a microextrusion 3D printing system that contained integrated pick-and-place functionality. Additively assembled materials and components included 3D printed epoxy , polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) , silver nanoparticles , and eutectic gallium-indium as well as robotically embedded piezoelectric chips ( lead zirconate titanate ( PZT)). Electrical impedance spectroscopy and finite element modeling studies showed the embedded PZT chips exhibited multiple resonant modes of varying mode shape over the 0-20 MHz frequency range. Flow visualization studies using neutrally buoyant particles ( diameter = 0.8-70 Î¼m) confirmed the 3D printed devices generated bulk acoustic waves ( BAWs) capable of size-selective manipulation , trapping , and separation of suspended particles in droplets and microchannels. Flow visualization studies in a continuous flow format showed suspended particles could be moved toward or away from the walls of microfluidic channels based on selective actuation of in-plane or out-of-plane PZT chips. This work suggests additive manufacturing potentially provides new opportunities for the design and fabrication of acoustofluidic and microfluidic devices.
