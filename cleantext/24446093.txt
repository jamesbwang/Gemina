  Evolution in the Hawaiian Islands has produced a unique avian assemblage. Unfortunately , many of these bird species are highly endangered or extinct. Despite numerous and increasing threats and great effort aimed at saving endemic birds , we lack basic science necessary for understanding many species of concern. One such species is the critically endangered Puaiohi ( Myadestes palmeri) , a rare songbird endemic to the island<disease> of Kaua'i and the only remaining native thrush on the island<disease>. At present , the Puaiohi 's breeding population is estimated to be ~ 500 birds restricted to the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve. We collected demographic data from 2007-2012 and supplemented it with published sources. Using Vortex , we developed stochastic population models to represent Puaiohi population dynamics under current and potential management scenarios to determine management 's potential efficacy in aiding species recovery. Management scenarios modeled included rat control , habitat improvement , general survival facilitation , and provision of nest boxes. The model indicated a decline in abundance with a growth rate ( r) of -0.267 under baseline conditions. Female and juvenile survival appeared to be the most influential parameters related to population growth and persistence , so management should focus on increasing female and juvenile Puaiohi survival. Rat control , even at more conservative levels , appeared to be the most effective method of increasing Puaiohi abundance. Our results indicate that practical , attainable management activities can increase Puaiohi and bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Such findings provide an example for other endangered species conservation efforts.
