  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) incidence and mortality can be significantly reduced by population screening. Several different screening methods are currently in use , and this review focuses specifically on the imaging technique computed tomographic colonography ( CTC). The challenges and logistics of CTC screening , as well as the importance of test accuracy , uptake , quality assurance and cost-effectiveness will be discussed. With comparable advanced adenoma detection rates to colonoscopy ( the most commonly used whole-colon investigation) , CTC is a less-invasive alternative , requiring less laxative , and with the potential benefit that it permits assessment of extra colonic structures. Three large-scale European trials have contributed valuable evidence supporting the use of CTC in population screening , and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate clinical management pathways based on initial CTC findings. Future research into CTC-screening will likely focus on radiologist training and CTC quality assurance , with identification of evidence-based key performance indicators that are associated with clinically-relevant outcomes such as the incidence of post-test interval cancers ( CRC occurring after a presumed negative CTC). In comparison to other CRC screening techniques , CTC offers a safe and accurate option that is particularly useful when colonoscopy is contraindicated. Forthcoming cost-effectiveness analyses which evaluate referral thresholds , the impact of extra-colonic findings and real-world uptake will provide useful information regarding the feasibility of future CTC population screening.
