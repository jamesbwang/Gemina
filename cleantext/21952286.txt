  Antineoplastic agents directly targeting tumor cells have represented the major strategy of systemic anticancer therapy for many years. Nevertheless , overcoming resistance mechanisms remains a great challenge because treatment options are limited in many cases. From this point of view , immunotherapeutic approaches seem promising in a broad spectrum of solid tumors. These include in particular the currently available inhibitors directed against immune checkpoints leading to a significant T-cell activation. To date , the programmed death receptor 1 ( PD-1) and its ligand are the most prominent targets in this context. However , the role of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer is still being debated , and the main focus is on triple-negative breast cancer patients as a target population in many ongoing trials. Moreover , the potential superiority of combinations with other anticancer drugs such as cytotoxics and targeted agents will be discussed.
