  Ign√°c Semmelweis did not publish his discovery in Vienna- i.e. , that the puerperal fever<disease> may be prevented by careful washing of the hand in chlorine solution ( asepsis)- for ten years. The Medical Weekly started its publications edited by Lajos Markusovszky in Pest in 1857. Semmelweis as a professor of theoretical and practical obstetrics at the University of Pest published a study about puerperal fever<disease> in the first volume , and Hungarian physicians became familiar with Semmelweis ' opinion from this medical journal. Semmelweis was not only an author of the Medical Weekly , but he also edited a supplement of the Medical Weekly entitled Gynaecology and Paediatry. The Medical Weekly published regular accounts of the work of the clinic written by lecturers of Semmelweis and articles describing the most interesting cases of the clinic.
