  Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular ( EPH) receptors are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Their extracellular domains bind specifically to ephrin A/B ligands , and this binding modulates intracellular kinase activity. EPHs are key players in bidirectional intercellular signaling , controlling cell morphology , adhesion , and migration. They are increasingly recognized as cancer drug targets. We analyzed the binding of NVP-BHG712 ( NVP) to EPHA2 and EPHB4. Unexpectedly , all tested commercially available NVP samples turned out to be a regioisomer ( NVPiso) of the inhibitor , initially described in a Novartis patent application. They only differ by the localization of a single methyl group on either one of two adjacent nitrogen atoms. The two compounds of identical mass revealed different binding modes. Furthermore , both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the isomers differ in their kinase affinity and selectivity.
