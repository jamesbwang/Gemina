  In 2015 , according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography ( INEGI) , malignant breast tumors were the first cause of cancer fatality in women ( 6,273 fatalities) in Mexico , whereas 2,793 fatalities in women were due to ovarian cancer. A total of 5‑10 % of breast cancer and 10‑15 % of ovarian cancer cases are caused by a hereditary breast‑ovarian cancer syndrome<disease> , with mutations predominantly identified in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Recently , the Mexican founder mutation BRCA1 ex9‑12del was identified ( deletion of exons 9‑12 with recombination between introns 8‑12). This is the most frequently reported mutation in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Mexico. Current detection methods include end‑point polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and Multiplex Ligation‑dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA). In the present study a cheap , sensitive and fast detection method was developed based on quantitative PCR and two TaqMan ® probes , one to detect the deletion ( recombination region between introns 8 and 12) , and the other one a region from exon 11. With this assay , 90 samples were able to be analyzed in 2 h using 2.5 ng of DNA/reaction at a cost of ~ 2‑3 USD. This method is capable of detecting positive samples for DNA deletion and excluding negative ones. Therefore , the method proposed may be a useful high‑throughput diagnostic option that could be useful in future association or prevalence studies that use large populations.
