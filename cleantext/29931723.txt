  Cognitively stimulating life experiences and activities are deemed to moderate the clinical impact of brain damage progressively building a neural and cognitive reserve ( CR). CR has been studied extensively in various neurodegenerative disorders , but not in corticobasal degeneration ( CBD). Using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 , years of education , as a determinant of CR , was correlated with tracer uptake on positron emission tomography with A cluster of relative hypometabolism was found associated with higher education in the left inferior regions of pre- and post-rolandic gyri and insula , which represent typical loci of neurodegeneration in CBD regardless of clinical presentation. The present findings extend to CBD the evidence gathered in other neurodegenerative disorders that a higher CR has a protective effect against the clinical manifestations of brain degeneration.
