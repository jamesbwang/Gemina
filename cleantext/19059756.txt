  ( Purpose) The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous injection with lidocaine in patients with chronic venous insufficiency in the early stage. ( Subjects and Methods) Patients ( n = 50) randomized to the treatment group received subcutaneous injections from a mixture of physiological saline sterile solution and lidocaine once a week to both legs below the knee for 5 sessions. Patients in the treatment group were also given ankle pumping exercises and compression stockings throughout the treatment. Patients randomized to the control group ( n = 50) received only ankle pumping exercises and compression stockings. Patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale ( VAS) for pain and Chronic Venous Disease Quality of life Questionnaire ( CIVIQ-20) for quality-of-life at months 1 , 3 , 6 , at the end of month 12 , and at the end of the injection treatment for 5 sessions. ( Results) CIVIQ-20 and VAS results were significantly lower in the treatment group , than in the control group at months 1 , 3 and 6. However , CIVIQ-20 and VAS results were not significantly different , compared with the pre-operative period at month 12. ( Conclusion) We observed that 5-week subcutaneous lidocaine injection treatment was effective in patients who do not respond to oral medical treatment or in whom surgery is not considered.
