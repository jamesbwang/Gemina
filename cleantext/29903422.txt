  Bladder irrigation can be performed to prevent catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( CAUTI) , but its efficacy has been not reported in short-term indwelling urinary catheterization. This clinical trial aimed to examine the efficacy of bladder irrigation with normal saline solution in preventing CAUTI in comatose patients admitted to intensive care units. Eligible patients were randomized to the experimental group or control group. The experimental group received daily bladder irrigation with 450 cc sterile normal saline , in 3 150-mL doses , for 3 consecutive days. Data on signs of CAUTI , including urine culture , axillary body temperature ( primary outcomes) , and other urine and blood parameters ( secondary outcomes) were obtained at baseline and 5 days later. Results of group comparisons and logistic regression analysis that controlled for fluid intake showed that the risk of CAUTI decreased by 99 % in the experimental group compared with the control group ( odds ratio , 0.01; P < .001). Additional findings indicated a decrease in axillary body temperature and improvements in urine appearance , urinary red cells and white cells , and erythrocyte sedimentation rates and white-cell counts in the blood following bladder irrigation. Daily bladder irrigation with normal saline during 3 days demonstrated efficacy in preventing CAUTI in comatose patients.
