  Cervical cancer is one of the most widespread diseases in women. Traditional cancer diagnosis is extremely complicated and relies on subjective interpretation of biopsy material. In this work , laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ( LIBS) was used in cervical cancer recognition. In order to improve identification accuracy of cervical cancer by LIBS , the chemometric methods of principal component analysis ( PCA) and support vector machine ( SVM) were combined. The results show that the content of trace elements in normal tissues and cervical cancer tissues was significantly different. Normalized peak intensities of Na , Mg , and K in the cervical cancer tissues were significantly higher than normal tissues , and the normalized peak intensities of Ca in the normal tissues were higher than cervical cancer tissues. The identification accuracies of PCA-SVM are better than SVM , with the achieved accuracies of 94.44 % and 93.06 % , respectively. It can be concluded that LIBS techniques coupled with chemometric method is a potential in cancer tissue identification , which provides a preliminary research basis for real-time diagnosis of cancer tissues using LIBS.
