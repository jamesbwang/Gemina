  Urbanization has profoundly altered the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle , especially the net primary productivity ( NPP). Many attempts have been made to assess the influence of urbanization on NPP at coarse resolutions ( e.g. , 250m or larger) , which may ignore many smaller and highly fragmented urban lands , and to a large extent , underestimate the NPP variations induced by urban sprawl. Hence , we attempted to analyze the NPP variations influenced by urban sprawl at a fine resolution ( e.g. , 30m) , toward which the accuracy of NPP was improved using remotely sensed data fusion algorithm. In this paper , this assumption was tested in the Pearl River Delta of China. The land cover datasets from the Landsat Thematic Mapper ( TM)/ Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ( ETM +) were acquired to quantify the urban sprawl. The synthetic Normal Differential Vegetation Index ( NDVI) data was obtained by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) NDVI via spatiotemporal fusion algorithm. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach ( CASA) model was driven by land cover map , synthetic NDVI and meteorological data to estimate the 30-m resolution NPP. Then , we analyzed the influence of urban sprawl on 30-m resolution NPP during the period of 2001-2009. Additionally , we also simulated the spatiotemporal change of future urban sprawl under different scenarios using the Future Land Use Simulation ( FLUS) model , and further analyzed its influence on 30-m resolution NPP. Our results showed that the accuracy of 30-m resolution NPP from synthetic NDVI is better than 500-m resolution NPP from MODIS NDVI. The loss in 30-m resolution NPP due to urban sprawl was much higher than 500-m resolution NPP. Moreover , the harmonious development scenario , characterized by a reasonable size of urban sprawl and a corresponding lower NPP loss from 2009 to 2050 , would be considered as a more human-oriented and sustainable development strategy.
