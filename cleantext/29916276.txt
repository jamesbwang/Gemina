  Despite the advances in in vitro fertilization ( IVF) , the implantation success rate for infertile women remains approximately only 15 %. In this study , we sought to determine whether implantation failure after repeated IVF treatments is influenced by the presence of common variants in estrogen α , progesterone and follicle stimulating hormone receptor genes. The study population included three groups of women: group 1 were 50 women who had the transfer of ≥ 3 high-quality embryos during the IVF procedure without ever having had a clinical pregnancy; group 2 were 50 women who achieved a clinical pregnancy after ≤ 3 high-quality embryos transfers and group 3 were 50 control subjects who achieved a clinical pregnancy without any fertility therapy that resulted in a one live-born infant. Genotype analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing for rs6165 , rs6166 , rs2234693 , rs9340799. While progesterone receptor single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) was genotyped based on the amplicon size , the repeats for the ESR1 TA-repeat polymorphism were calculated based on the fragment length. A higher frequency of the heterozygote AG genotype was observed in the infertile groups when compared to controls. Significantly , an allele combination of T of rs2234693 , A of rs9340799; S of ESR1 ( TA) , A of rs6166 , G of rs6165 and del of PROGINS had a higher frequency in women who had a successful IVF outcome compared to women who had an unsuccessful IVF outcome , indicating a possible protective combined genotype that could reduce a negative outcome during IVF. This study has demonstrated that combining several candidate genes is needed to assess which may play a role in fertility.
