  RNA interference has become a tool of choice in the development of drugs in various therapeutic areas of Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing ( PTGS). The critical element in developing successful RNAi therapeutics lies in designing small interfering RNA ( siRNA) using an efficient algorithm satisfying the designing criteria. Further , translation of siRNA from bench-side to bedside needs an efficient delivery system and/or chemical modification. Areas covered: This review emphasizes the importance of dicer , the criteria for efficient siRNA design , the currently available algorithms and strategies to overcome off-target effects , immune stimulatory effects and endosomal trap. Expert opinion: Specificity and stability are the primary concerns for siRNA therapeutics. The design criteria and algorithms should be chosen rationally to have a siRNA sequence that binds to the corresponding mRNA as it happens in the Watson and Crick base pairing. However , it must evade a few more hurdles ( Endocytosis , Serum stability etc.) to be functional in the cytosol.
