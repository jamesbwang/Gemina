  The efficacy of carbohydrate ( CHO) ingestion during high-intensity strength and conditioning type exercise has yield mixed results. However , little is known about shorter duration high-intensity exercise such as CrossFit. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance impact of CHO ingestion during high-intensity exercise sessions lasting approximately 30 min. Eight healthy males participated in a total of four trials; two familiarizations , a CHO trial , and a similarly flavored , non-caloric placebo ( PLA) trial. CrossFit 's `` Fight Gone Bad Five '' ( FGBF) workout of the day was the exercise model which incorporated five rounds of maximal repetition exercises , wall throw , box jump , sumo deadlift high pull , push press , and rowing , followed by one minute of rest. Total repetitions and calories expended were summated from each round to quantify total work ( FGBF score). No difference was found for the total work between CHO ( 321 ± 51) or PLA ( 314 ± 52) trials (
