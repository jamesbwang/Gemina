  Leiomyomas of the chest wall are very rare. In a review of the current literature twelve cases were found , of which only one concerns of an intercostal leiomyoma of the chest wall. We report a case of 1 year old male child with intercostal leiomyoma who presented with a painless rigid swelling of the right chest wall. The radiological control revealed a solid mass in the right anterior sixth intercostal space. En-bloc excision of the mass by abrading of the sixth rib through right anterior thoracotomy was performed. Histopatological analysis showed a localized intercostal leiomyoma. The patient has a close follow-up for 6 months without evidence of recurrence. This is the first case of a primary intercostal leiomyoma in a child which was excised totally without reconstruction of the chest wall.
