  Brucellosis<disease> is a serious infectious<disease> disease<disease> that continues to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide and across all ages. Despite early diagnosis and treatment , 10-30 % of patients develop chronic brucellosis<disease> Although there have been recent advances in our knowledge of Brucella virulence factors and hosts ' immune response to the infection , there is a lack of clear data regarding how the infection bypasses the immune system and becomes chronic. The present study investigated immunological factors and their roles in the transition of brucellosis<disease> from an acute to a chronic<disease> infection<disease> in CD4 + T cells. CD4 + T cells sorted from peripheral blood samples of patients with acute or chronic brucellosis<disease> and healthy controls using flow cytometry as well as more than 2000 miRNAs were screened using the GeneSpring GX ( Agilent) 13.0 miRNA microarray software and were validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR). Compared to acute cases , the expression levels of 28 miRNAs were significantly altered in chronic cases. Apart from one miRNA ( miR-4649-3p) , 27 miRNAs were not expressed in the acute cases ( p < 0.05 , fold change > 2). According to KEGG pathway analysis , these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of target genes that were previously involved in the MAPK signalling pathway , regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , endocytosis , and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. This indicates the potential role of these miRNAs in the development of chronic brucellosis<disease> We suggest that these miRNAs can be used as markers to determine the transition of the disease into chronicity. This is the first study of miRNA expression that analyses human CD4 + T cells to clarify the mechanism of chronicity in
