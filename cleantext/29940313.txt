  To assess the frequency , severity , and inpatient management of girls admitted with heavy menstrual bleeding and iron deficiency anemia<symptom> at US children 's hospitals , with a focus on hematologic considerations. Retrospective multicenter cohort study from October 2012 through September 2015. Children 's hospitals submitting data to the Pediatric Health Information System. Female patients , age 8-18 years , admitted with heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia<symptom> as either a primary or secondary diagnosis. Patients with cancer , immune thrombocytopenic purpura , aplastic anemia<symptom> , and pregnancy were excluded. Hemostatic evaluation; provision of iron therapy. We identified 1183 admissions ( 1134 unique patients). Patients ' median ( interquartile range) age was 14 ( 11-17) years. Forty-one percent were Caucasian ( n = 480) , 31 % African American ( n = 371) , and 26 % Hispanic ethnicity ( n = 310). Intensive care use occurred in 5 % of admissions ( n = 56). Hemostatic assessment was inconsistent; 15 % ( n = 182) had no such evaluation. Two-thirds ( n = 797; 67 %) involved transfusions , 37 % ( n = 433) received no inpatient iron therapy , and 17 % ( n = 197) received no hormonal or antifibrinolytic therapy. Hemostatic evaluation was associated with intensive care use: odds ratio ( OR) , 4.80 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.16-19.86; P = .03); emergency department visit: OR , 2.60 ( 95 % CI , 1.86-3.65; P < .01); private insurance: OR , 1.62 ( 95 % CI , 1.12-2.35; P = .01); and younger age: OR , 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.77-0.92; P < .01). Hundreds of girls with heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia<symptom> are hospitalized at US children 's hospitals each year with variable inpatient hematologic evaluation and management. Future guidelines should emphasize early identification of at-risk patients and promote effective implementation strategies to reduce the burden of this preventable complication.
