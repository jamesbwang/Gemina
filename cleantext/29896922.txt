  Although inflammatory markers , such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio , platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and local immune markers have been shown to have prognostic utility , limited information is available regarding inflammatory and pre-existing tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte<symptom> density and their association with prognosis in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We investigated the prognostic ability of inflammatory markers and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte<symptom> density in stage III and stage IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients receiving definitive treatment. Retrospective cohort study. Kurume University Hospital. Ninety-six stage III or stage IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated at the Kurume University Hospital between 2000 and 2014. Inflammatory markers and pre-treatment tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte<symptom> density were examined from recorded haematologic data and immunohistochemical analysis. Multivariate analyses showed that the CD8 Higher pre-treatment CD8
