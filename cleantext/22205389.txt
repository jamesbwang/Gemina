  Summarize features of the currently recognized congenital myasthenic syndromes<disease> ( CMS) with emphasis on novel findings identified in the past 6 years. Since the last review of the CMS in this journal in 2012 , several novel CMS were identified. The identified disease proteins are SNAP25B , synaptotagmin 2 , Munc13-1 , synaptobrevin-1 , GFPT1 , DPAGT1 , ALG2 , ALG14 , Agrin , GMPPB , LRP4 , myosin 9A , collagen 13A1 , the mitochondrial citrate carrier , PREPL , LAMA5 , the vesicular ACh transporter , and the high-affinity presynaptic choline transporter. Exome sequencing has provided a powerful tool for identifying novel CMS. Identifying the disease genes is essential for determining optimal therapy. The landscape of the CMS is still unfolding.
