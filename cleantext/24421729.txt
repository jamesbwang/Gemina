  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rule changes on game-related statistics in men 's water polo matches. A total of 856 men 's matches played in all Olympic Games and World Championship since 1936 was analysed. The game-related statistics considered were: total goals , winners ' goals , losers ' goals , goals per minute , goals difference , relationship difference goals and total goals , and relationship difference goals and winners ' goals. The rule changes were grouped by structural ( game and period) and functional changes ( possession time , exclusion time , timing , minimum distance to take a direct shot). Differences between rule changes were determined using a one-way ANOVA. In general , the changes in water polo rules were shown to have an effect on the final result of the matches. There were differences in each rule change of duration ( increased total goals and winners ' goals) , period ( increased total goals and winners ' goals) , possession time ( increased losers ' goals) , timing ( increased total , winners ' , losers ' , and decreased % goals and total goals) and fouls ( increased total goals and losers ' goals). The analysis in game-related statistics through the rule changes could be used to evaluate their effects and/or justify future modifications.
