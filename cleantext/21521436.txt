  Antibiotic resistance evolution in bacteria indicates that one of the challenges faced by phage therapy is that , sooner or later , bacteria will evolve resistance to phages. Evidently , this is the case of every known antimicrobial therapy , but here this is also part of a ubiquitous natural process of co-evolution between phages and bacteria. Fundamental evolutionary studies hold some clues that are crucial to limit the problematic process of bacterial resistance during phage applications. First , I discuss here the importance of defining evolutionary and ecological factors influencing bacterial resistance and phage counter-defense mechanisms. Then , I comment on the interest of determining the co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bacteria that may allow for selecting the conditions that will increase the probability of therapeutic success. I go on to suggest the varied strategies that may ensure the long-term success of phage therapy , including analysis of internal phage parameters and personalized treatments. In practical terms , these types of approaches will define evolutionary criteria regarding how to develop , and when to apply , therapeutic phage cocktails. Integrating this perspective in antimicrobial treatments , such as phage therapy , is among the necessary steps to expand its use in the near future , and to ensure its durability and success.
