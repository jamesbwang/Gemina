  Meningiomas WHO grade I and II are common intracranial tumors in adults that normally display a benign outcome , but are characterized by a great clinical heterogeneity and frequent recurrence of the disease. Although the presence of an immune cell infiltrate has been documented in these tumors , a clear phenotypical and functional characterization of the immune web is missing. Here , we performed an extensive immunophenotyping of peripheral blood and fresh tumor tissue at surgery by multiparametric flow cytometry in 34 meningioma patients , along with immunosuppressive activity of sorted cells of myeloid origin. Four subsets of myeloid cells , phenotypically corresponding to myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) are detectable in the blood and in the tumor tissue of patients and three of them are significantly expanded in the blood of patients , but show no evidence of suppressive activity. At the tumor site , a large leukocyte infiltrate is present , predominantly constituted by CD33
