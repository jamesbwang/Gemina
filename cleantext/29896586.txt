  We theoretically explore the structural and mechanical properties of metal-free fused-ring polyphthalocyanine ( H2PPc) and halogenated H2PPc ( F-H2PPc and Cl-H2PPc) membranes<symptom> , and the energy profiles for gaseous H2 , CO , CH4 , CO2 and N2 molecules adsorbing on and passing through these monolayers. Importantly , we reconsider in depth the values of the parameters in the definition of permeance , and corroborate the validity of the model from first-principles theory with the results of H2 diffusion from classic molecular dynamics simulations. With well-defined nanosized pores , halogenated H2PPc monolayers turn out to be multifunctional gas separation membranes<symptom> , i.e. F-H2PPc for H2/CO , H2/CH4 , CO2/N2 , CO2/CH4 , CO/CH4 and N2/CH4 separation as well as Cl-H2PPc for H2/CO , H2/CH4 and H2/CO2 separation , which should be of great potential in energy and environmental fields.
