  Primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI) is a clinical condition observed in women younger than 40 years of age , characterized by amenorrhea , hypoestrogenism , high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) , and infertility<symptom>. Mutations in some master regulators of the development , maturation , and maintenance of ovarian follicles such as BMP15 , FSHR , FOXL2 , and GDF9 have been suggested as etiological factors in the development of POI. The aim of this study , the first in the Mexican population , is to evaluate the presence of mutations or polymorphisms in these four candidate genes. In a sample of 20 Mexican patients with idiopathic POI , we looked for and analyzed genetic variants in BMP15 , FSHR , FOXL2 , and GDF9 genes. We observed two polymorphisms: a coding change , c. 919G > A ( p.Ala307Thr) , in the FSHR gene and a synonymous variant , c. 447C > T ( p.Thr149Thr) , in the GDF9 gene. These two variants have been reported previously as polymorphisms ( rs6165 and rs254286 , respectively). We observed no significant difference associated with POI in the patients when compared with a healthy control group ( p > 0.05). Also , no exonic variants were found for the genes BMP15 and FOXL2 in the individuals tested. The lack of association of the evaluated genes in this sample of Mexican women is consistent with the complex genetic etiology of POI that is observed across cohorts studied thus far.
