  Women 's contraceptive choices may change after an induced abortion<disease> , due to contraceptive counselling or a behavioural change prompted by the experience. The effect may vary between women; sociocultural background , for example , may affect their subsequent reproductive choices. We examined whether women 's current contraceptive use was differently associated with a history of induced abortion<disease> among immigrant groups in Finland ( Russian , Kurdish and Somali) and the general Finnish population. We analysed data from two surveys , the Migrant Health and Wellbeing study and the Health 2011 study , linked to the Finnish register of induced abortions<disease>. Propensity score weighted logistic regression was used to analyse the data. The likelihood of using contraceptives after an abortion<disease> varied depending on women 's sociocultural background. A history of induced abortion<disease> increased contraceptive use among all groups , except Russian women , in whom there was no effect. The effect was particularly strong for Kurdish women. Sociocultural background was an important determinant of post-abortion contraceptive use. Some immigrants may struggle to navigate the Finnish health care system due to language or literacy issues. Attention should be paid to improving access to family planning among these groups.
