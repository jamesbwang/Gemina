  Nimbolide is a novel , natural compound with promising potential as a drug candidate for anticancer activity. It is isolated from the Indian traditional medicinal plant Azadirachta indica<pathogen> popularly known as neem. The present study was undertaken to explore the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of nimbolide in rats using the LC/QTOF/MS method. A simple protein precipitation method using acetonitrile was employed for extracting nimbolide from rat plasma. The chromatographic separation of nimbolide and the internal standard ( regorafenib) was attained on an Aquity BEH C18 column ( 100 × 2.1 mm , 2.7 μm) , using ACN and 0.1 % of formic acid in water as mobile phase components in a gradient elution mode at a flow rate of 0.45 mL/min over a short run time of 4 min. A mass detection was carried out using target ions of ( M + H)
