  Gabapentinoids are currently the mainstay of pharmacological treatments for patients with neuropathic pain. Little is known about the effects of this therapy on the integrity of neuronal networks , especially in patients with an already-damaged nervous system. Since gabapentinoids can worsen cognitive functions and recent studies have shown alterations in the brains of patients with neuropathic pain , it may be possible that these drugs have neurotoxic effects. Rat clonal PC12 pheochromocytoma ( autonomic) and primary sensory dorsal-root ganglion ( DRG) neurons from newborn Wistar rats were employed for this study. To mimic neuronal damage , cells were exposed to cytotoxins using either hydrogen peroxide ( H No direct cytotoxic effects were observed after incubating PC12 cells for 24 hours with increasing concentrations of gabapentin or pregabalin using MTT cytotoxicity assays. Even a 7-day incubation did not cause cellular damage. Furthermore , in preinjured PC12 and DRG neurons , neither gabapentin nor pregabalin prevented or enhanced the cytotoxic effects of H Based on these results , gabapentinoids are unlikely to be neurotoxic in cultured autonomic ( PC12) and sensory DRG cells , even when cells are preinjured. These results are of high clinical relevance , as it seems unlikely that the morphological changes recently observed in the brains of neuropathic pain patients are caused or worsened by gabapentinoids.
