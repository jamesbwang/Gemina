  Antibiotic resistance has become a widely concerned issue due to the huge risk on the ecological environment and human health. China has the highest production and consumption of antibiotics than other countries. Thus , antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs) have been detected in various environmental settings ( e.g. , surface water , wastewater , sediment) in China. The occurrence of ARGs in these matrixes was summarized and discussed in this review. Sulfonamide resistance genes and tetracycline resistance genes were the most frequently detected ARGs in China. According to the abundance of these two classes of ARGs in the natural environment , sulfonamide resistance genes seem to be more stable than tetracycline resistance genes. Furthermore , the relationships between ARGs and antibiotics , antibiotic resistance bacteria ( ARB) , heavy metals , and environmental parameters ( e.g. , pH , organics) were also investigated. Specifically , relative abundance of total ARGs was found to correlate well with concentration of total antibiotics in aqueous phase but not in the solid phase ( soil , sediment , sludge , and manure). As for relationship between ARGs and ARB , metals , and environmental parameters in different media , due to complex and variable environment , some exhibit positive correlation , some negative , while others no correlation at all. Three potential risks are discussed in the text: transmission to human , synergistic effect of different ARGs , and variability of ARGs. However , due to the complexity of the environment , more work is needed to establish a quantitative approach of ARG risk assessment , which can provide a theoretical support for the management of antibiotics and the protection of human health.
