  Plant endophytes are a group of microorganisms that reside asymptomatically within the healthy living tissue. The diversity and molecular and biochemical characterization of industrial hemp-associated endophytes have not been previously studied. This study explored the abundance and diversity of culturable endophytes residing in petioles , leaves , and seeds of three industrial hemp cultivars , and examined their biochemical attributes and antifungal potential. A total of 134 bacterial and 53 fungal strains were isolated from cultivars Anka , CRS-1 , and Yvonne. The number of bacterial isolates was similarly distributed among the cultivars , with the majority recovered from petiole tissue. Most fungal strains originated from leaf tissue of cultivar Anka. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses grouped the endophytes into 18 bacterial and 13 fungal taxa , respectively. The most abundant bacterial genera were Pseudomonas , Pantoea , and Bacillus , and the fungal genera were Aureobasidium<pathogen> , Alternaria , and Cochliobolus<pathogen>. The presence of siderophores , cellulase production , and phosphorus solubilization were the main biochemical traits. In proof-of-concept experiments , re-inoculation of tomato roots with some endophytes confirmed their migration to aerial tissues of the plant. Taken together , this study demonstrates that industrial hemp harbours a diversity of microbial endophytes , some of which could be used in growth promotion and ( or) in biological control designed experiments.
