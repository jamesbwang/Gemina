  Diabetic retinopathy ( DR) , the primary retinal vascular complication of diabetes mellitus ( DM) , is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness<symptom> in working-age population globally. Despite mounting concerns about the emergence of DM as a major public health problem in the largest developing country , China , much remains to be understood about the epidemiology of DR. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for DR , and estimate the burden of DR in China in 2010. China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI) , Wanfang , Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database ( CBM-SinoMed) , PubMed , Embase and Medline were searched for studies that reported the prevalence of and risk factors for DR in Chinese population between 1990 and 2017. A random-effects meta-analysis model was adopted to pool the overall prevalence of DR. Variations in the prevalence of DR in different age groups , DM duration groups and settings were assessed by subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression. Odds ratios ( ORs) of major risk factors were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The number of people with DR in 2010 was estimated by multiplying the age-specific prevalence of DR in people with DM with the corresponding number of people with DM in China. Finally , the national number of people with DR was distributed into six geographic regions using a risk factor-based model. A total of 31 studies provided information on the prevalence of DR and 21 explored potential risk factors for DR. The pooled prevalence of any DR , nonproliferative DR ( NPDR) and proliferative DR ( PDR) was 1.14 % ( 95 % CI = 0.80-1.52) , 0.90 % ( 95 % CI = 0.56-1.31) and 0.07 % ( 95 % CI = 0.02-0.14) in general population; In people with DM , the pooled prevalence rates were 18.45 % ( 95 % CI = 14.77-22.43) , 15.06 % ( 95 % CI = 11.59-18.88) and 0.99 % ( 95 % CI = 0.40-1.80) for any DR , NPDR and PDR , respectively. The prevalence of any DR in DM patients peaked between 60 and 69 years of age , and increased steeply with the duration of DM. DM patients residing in rural China were at a higher risk to have DR than those in urban areas. In addition , insulin treatment , elevated FBG level and higher HbA1c concentration were confirmed to be associated with a higher prevalence of DR in people with DM , with meta-ORs of 1.99 ( 95 % CI = 1.34-2.95) , 1.33 ( 95 % CI = 1.12-1.59) and 1.15 ( 95 % CI = 1.09-1.20) respectively. In 2010 , a total of 13.16 million ( 95 % CI = 8.95-18.00) Chinese aged 45 years and above were living with DR , among whom the most were in South Central China and the least were in Northwest China. DR has become a serious public health problem in China. Optimal screening of and interventions on DR should be implemented. Improved epidemiological studies on DR are still required.
