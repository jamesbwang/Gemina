  Background and aims The influence of pain as well as Quality of Life ( QoL) varies in accordance with biological , social , psychological and existential factors. This study investigates the influence of such factors on the relationship between pain and QoL among older adults from a gender perspective. Methods The Swedish National Study on Aging and Care ( SNAC-Blekinge) baseline sample comprised 1402 individuals aged 60-96 years , of whom 769 ( 55 %) reported pain. The participants were invited by a letter to take part in the study , which was carried out by research staff in two sessions of three hour each. Participants gave informed consent and completed a questionnaire between the two sessions. The reason for non-participation was registered among subjects who declined the invitation. Pain and insomnia were self-reported. Data on age , gender and if living alone or not were collected from the questionnaire. Co-morbidity was obtained from electronic patients records for a period of up to two years prior to participating in the SNAC study. SoC was measured by a translated short form from the original twenty-nine question instrument. QoL , was estimated using the HRQL Medical Outcome Study-Short Form ( SF 12). In a model , pain , age , sex , insomnia , co-morbidity , living alone , sense of coherence ( SOC) , household economy , education and QoL were calculated through multivariate logistic regression. Results Among women , pain was found to have the highest OR ( odds ratio) for low QoL ( OR 2.27 ( CI 1.36-3.78)) , followed by low economic status ( OR 1.75 ( CI 1.08-2.84)) , co-morbidity ( OR 1.24 ( CI 1.05-1.46)) , low SOC ( OR 1.08 ( CI 1.06-1.10)) and lower age ( OR 1.05 ( CI 1.02-1.08)). In men , insomnia was found to be the main contributor to low QoL ( OR 1.86 ( CI 1.04-3.33)) , followed by low SOC ( OR 1.08 ( CI 1.05-1.11)) and lower age ( OR 1.04 ( CI 1.01-1.07)). Conclusions Pain has a strong relationship with low QoL among elderly women. Insomnia is associated with low QoL among men who suffer less from pain. Thus the main result is a striking gender difference: Elderly women suffer from pain , elderly men suffer from insomnia. Implications It is importanttotake accountof sex , age , sleep problems , co-morbidity , SOC and economic status in order to understand the relationship between pain and QoL among older adults.
