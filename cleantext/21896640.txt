  Liquid biopsy using circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) is a noninvasive and repeatable procedure , and is therefore useful for molecular assays. However , the rarity of CTCs remains a challenge. To overcome this issue , our group developed a novel technology for the isolation of CTCs on the basis of cell size difference. The present study isolated CTCs from patients with breast cancer using this method , and then used these cells for cancer gene panel analysis. Blood samples from eight patients with breast cancer were collected , and CTCs were enriched using size-based filtration. Enriched CTCs were counted using immunofluorescent staining with an epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM) and CD45 antibodies. CTC genomic DNA was extracted , amplified , and screened for mutations in 400 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel. White blood cells ( WBCs) from the same patient served as a negative control , and mutations in CTCs and WBCs were compared. EpCAM
