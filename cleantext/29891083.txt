  Patients who have diabetes mellitus ( DM) are at an increased risk of postoperative complications following total hip arthroplasty ( THA). Therefore , much interest has been paid to perioperative glycemic control. However , no prior studies have evaluated the patient variation of HbA1c levels on costs. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of obtaining preoperative HbA1c levels on ( 1) day of surgery ( DOS) cost; ( 2) subsequent 89-day costs; and ( 3) global 90-day cost. A retrospective query of the Humana insurance claims database was performed from 2007 to 2015 for all DM patients undergoing THA. Only patients with HbA1c ( %) levels within 3 months before or after the THA were included. Patients were stratified into 6 groups based on HbA1c starting at 5.5 % and increasing by 1 % increments to 11.5 %; one additional group ( 11.5 % -20 %) for extreme cases was analyzed. Correlations between HbA1c level and reimbursements for DOS , subsequent 89-day , and global 90-day period were performed. HbA1c level demonstrated a significant correlation to DOS ( correlation coefficient = 0.664) , subsequent 89-day ( correlation coefficient = 0.789) , and global 90-day period ( correlation coefficient = 0.747) costs. DOS , 89-day , and global 90-day costs significantly increased with increasing HbA1c levels ( P < .0001). Higher perioperative HbA1c levels increase the DOS , subsequent 89-day , and global 90-day costs of THA. This was expected as these patients require multidisciplinary care , have longer LOS , and develop more complications. Further investigation into postoperative complications based on glycemic control is warranted.
