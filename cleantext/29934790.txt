  The study aim was to compare the disease control in two groups of patients affected by liver metastases from CRC treated with microwave ablation ( MWA) or stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT). We extracted data of patients treated between 2009 and 2016. Inclusion criteria were: ( 1) maximum diameter of the liver lesions<symptom> less than 4 cm; ( 2) no more than three liver lesions<symptom>; ( 3) no evidence of progressive or untreated gross disease outside the liver; ( 4) adequate liver function; ( 5) no concurrent chemotherapy; ( 6) minimum age of 18. Tumour response was classified according to EORTC-RECIST criteria. Aim of the present study was to evaluate freedom from local progression ( FFLP). To reduce indication bias , an inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate treatment effect. A total of 135 patients with 214 lesions<symptom> were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 24.5 months ( range 2.4-95.8). The 1-year freedom from local progression ( FFLP) was 88 % ( 95 % CI 80-92). In the SBRT group , FFLP was statistically longer than MWA group ( p = 0.0214); the 1-year FFLP was 91 % ( 95 % CI 81-95) in SBRT group and 84 % ( 95 % CI 0.72-0.91) in MWA group. Patients treated with SBRT showed a reduce risk of local relapse compared to MWA ( adjusted HR 0.31; 95 % CI 0.13-0.70 , p = 0.005). As expected , analogous result obtained in the inverse probability weighting analysis ( HR 0.38; 95 % CI 0.18-0.80; p = 0.011). In conclusion , there seems to be an advantage of SBRT compared to MWA in treating CRC liver metastases , particularly for lesions<symptom> bigger than 30 mm.
