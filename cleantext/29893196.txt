  Substandard antibiotics are thought to be a major threat to public health in developing countries and a cause of antimicrobial resistance. However , assessing quality outside of a laboratory setting , using simple equipment , is challenging. The aim of this study was to validate the use of a portable Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectrometer for the identification of substandard antibiotics. Results are presented for amoxicillin packages from Haiti , Ghana , Sierra Leone , Democratic Republic of Congo , India , Papua New Guinea , and Ethiopia collected over the course of 6 months in 2017 , including two field trips with the FT-IR to Ghana and Sierra Leone. Canadian samples were used as a control. Regarding drug quality , of 290 individual capsules of amoxicillin analyzed , 13 were found to be substandard with total active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API) lying outside the acceptable range of 90-110 %. Of these 13 , four were below 80 % API. The FT-IR reliably identified these outliers and was found to yield results in good agreement with the established pharmacopeia liquid chromatography protocol. We conclude that the portable FT-IR may be suitable to intercept substandard antibiotics in developing countries where more sophisticated techniques are not readily available.
