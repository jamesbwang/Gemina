  The aims of the study were to translate into Persian and culturally adapt the Kessler Psychological Distress Scales , K10 and K6 , and to assess their reliability and validity. The sample was recruited from primary health care ( PHC) settings by quota nonprobability sampling , stratified by sex and age. Validity was assessed against the Composite International Diagnostic Interview ( v2 .1). The psychometric properties of K6 and K10 were also compared with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-12). A total of 818 participants completed the questionnaire. Cronbach 's alpha were 0.92 and 0.87 for K6 and K10 , respectively. Optimal cutoff scores for detecting any mood or anxiety<symptom> disorder in the past 30 days were 15 for K10 and 10 for K6. At these cutoff points , the measures had sensitivities of 0.77 and 0.73 , specificities of 0.74 and 0.78 , and positive predictive values of 0.48 and 0.52 , respectively. Psychometric properties of K10 and K6 were similar to GHQ-12. Persian K10 and K6 have acceptable psychometric properties as screening instruments for common mental health conditions. Given its brevity and similar psychometric properties to the longer instruments , the Persian K6 appears to be a suitable for use in PHC settings and , possibly , epidemiologic studies in Iran.
