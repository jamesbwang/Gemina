  Information on patterns of clinical care for elderly breast cancer patients is lacking. The aims of this study are two-fold , firstly , to clarify daily practice treatments for elderly breast cancer patients in Japan , and secondly , to plan a prospective clinical trial to address unresolved clinical questions. We investigated practice care of elderly breast cancer patients in 38 institutions of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group ( JCOG). Questionnaires asked: ( 1) definition of `` elderly '' for each treatment , ( 2) clinical standard anti-HER2 therapy in each age-group , ( 3) recommended docetaxel dose in each age-group , ( 4) considerations for future clinical trials , and ( 5) other information about geriatric oncology concerning breast cancer. The upper age-limit for surgery and irradiation therapy was generally 80 years , while many physicians considered anti-cytotoxic adjuvant therapy unsuitable for patients > 70-75 years. For HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer , 82 % of physicians recommended docetaxel ( DTX) plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab ( DTP) as standard care for patients aged 65-70 , although 54 % of physicians avoided DTP for those aged 71-75 as first-line standard preference. Most physicians recommended 75 mg/m
