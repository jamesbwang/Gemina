  Although screening mammography has delivered many benefits since its introduction in Canada in 1988 , questions about perceived harms warrant an up-to-date review. To help oncologists and physicians provide optimal patient recommendations , the literature was reviewed to find the latest guidelines for screening mammography , including benefits and perceived harms of overdiagnosis , false positives , false negatives , and technologic advances. For women 40-74 years of age who actually participate in screening every 1-2 years , breast cancer mortality is reduced by 40 %. With appropriate corrections , overdiagnosis accounts for 10 % or fewer breast cancers. False positives occur in about 10 % of screened women , 80 % of which are resolved with additional imaging , and 10 % , with breast biopsy. An important limitation of screening is the false negatives ( 15 % -20 %). The technologic advances of digital breast tomosynthesis , breast ultrasonography , and magnetic resonance imaging counter the false negatives of screening mammography , particularly in women with dense breast tissue.
