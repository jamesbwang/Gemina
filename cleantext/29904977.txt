  Chromosomal inversions often contribute to local adaptation across latitudinal clines , but the underlying selective mechanisms remain poorly understood. We and others have previously shown that a clinal inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster , In ( 3R) Payne , underpins body size clines along the North American and Australian east coasts. Here , we ask whether this polymorphism also contributes to clinal variation in other fitness-related traits , namely survival traits ( lifespan , survival upon starvation and survival upon cold shock<symptom>). We generated homokaryon lines , either carrying the inverted or standard chromosomal arrangement , isolated from populations approximating the endpoints of the North American cline ( Florida , Maine) and phenotyped the flies at two growth temperatures ( 18 °C , 25 °C). Across both temperatures , high-latitude flies from Maine lived longer and were more stress resistant than low-latitude flies from Florida , as previously observed. Interestingly , we find that this latitudinal pattern is partly explained by the clinal distribution of the In ( 3R) P polymorphism , which is at ~ 50 % frequency in Florida but absent in Maine: inverted karyotypes tended to be shorter-lived and less stress resistant than uninverted karyotypes. We also detected an interaction between karyotype and temperature on survival traits. As In ( 3R) P influences body size and multiple survival traits , it can be viewed as a ` supergene ' , a cluster of tightly linked loci affecting multiple complex phenotypes. We conjecture that the inversion cline is maintained by fitness trade-offs and balancing selection across geography; elucidating the mechanisms whereby this inversion affects alternative , locally adapted phenotypes across the cline is an important task for future work.
