  Pleurotus eryngii contains bioactive compounds that can activate the immune system. Here we report the identification , purification , and functional characterization of the bioactive P. eryngii protein ( PEP) 1b. PEP 1b was discovered to be a 21.9 kDa protein with the ability to induce the M1-polarization of the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells. Biochemical measurements showed that PEP 1b stimulated nitric oxide ( NO) , IL-1β , IL-6 and TNF-α production and regulated inducible NO synthase. Phosphorylation and inhibitor studies revealed that PEP 1b promoted the translocation of NF-kB from the cytosol to the nucleus allowing the induction of target gene expression and NO production. The phosphorylation of JNK and ERK1/2 was found to be necessary for NO production. Each phosphorylation pathway was found to require a Toll-like receptor ( TLR) 4 as a prerequisite for PEP 1b-induced NO production. This study suggests that PEP 1b is an immunomodulatory protein that can boost cellular immune responses through the activation of the TLR4-NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.
