  This paper deals with the study of the surface morphology of barbels , upper lips , and adhesive discs in four hill stream fish species collected from Basistha River , a torrential river in Guwahati city , Assam , India. The four species belonging to the genus Garra namely , Garra gotyla ( Gray , 1830) , Garra gravelyi ( Annandale , 1919) , Garra stenorhynchus ( Jerdon , 1849) , and Garra nasuta ( McClelland , 1838) were collected from the same torrential habitat. These fish revealed anatomical peculiarities in their barbels , lips , and adhesive discs which are believed to help them in adapting to such habitats. Organs exhibiting adaptive modifications ( barbels , lips , and adhesive discs) were studied with the scanning electron microscope. The study primarily revealed the presence of type I and type II taste buds in the barbels , lips , and adhesive discs , and numerous unculi surrounded by microridges in the upper lips and adhesive discs. A cumulative , intercalated action of these organs enables these fish to adhere and adapt to rocky , torrential streams. Special ability to adapt to these habitats was reflected from the two types of taste buds ( I and II) present in the barbels , and the clustering of excrescencies bearing unculi in the lips and adhesive discs of the fish.
