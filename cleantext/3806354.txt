  Many ecological- and individual-level analyses of voting behaviour use multiple regressions with a considerable number of independent variables but few discussions of their results pay any attention to the potential impact of inter-relationships among those independent variables-do they confound the regression parameters and hence their interpretation? Three empirical examples are deployed to address that question , with results which suggest considerable problems. Inter-relationships between variables , even if not approaching high collinearity , can have a substantial impact on regression model results and how they are interpreted in the light of prior expectations. Confounded relationships could be the norm and interpretations open to doubt , unless considerable care is applied in the analyses and an extended principal components method for doing that is introduced and exemplified.
