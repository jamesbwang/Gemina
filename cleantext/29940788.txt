  The case is reported of an individual ( N.K.) with a developmental spelling impairment ( dysgraphia) who has no apparent problems in reading. His performance therefore provides further evidence of a classical dissociation between impaired spelling and preserved reading in individuals with developmental literacy problems. The dissociation is observed when N.K. is asked to read and spell in either his first ( Greek) or his second language ( English). An investigation of his spelling performance revealed that his impairment was more selective than that of P.J.T. Although his spelling of regular words and nonwords was normal , N.K. had a problem in spelling words with atypical sound-letter associations despite having no problems in reading aloud or understanding the meaning of words of this kind. It is argued that N.K. 's pattern of performance can be best explained in terms of normal development of an orthographic system that allows access to the meaning and pronunciation of written words during reading. In terms of a dual-route model of spelling , his poor spelling appears to be the result of a developmental impairment that impedes access to the orthographic system from phonology and semantics. In terms of the triangle model , his poor spelling appears to be the result of a developmental impairment that affects activation of orthography from semantics.
