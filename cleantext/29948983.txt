  The adequate management of analgesia , by pharmacological methods or not , is a great challenge. Local anesthetics are used for pain relief , mainly by parenteral , intramuscular , catheter , and other routes of administration. The use of in situ forming systems becomes an alternative for the control of pain. The present research investigates development of thermogels containing poloxamer and levobupivacaine. All formulations were prepared by the cold method; the compatibilities of the excipients were evaluated by DSC , rheology and viscosities , transition temperature , syringeability , release kinetics , and permeation. The compatibility of the tested excipients with the drug was initially observed; all formulations had a viscosity increase at 37 Â°C. Different delivery rates were observed in both the release and permeation studies. The developed systems maintained the in vitro release of the drug for a long period , likely decreasing side effects in vivo and avoiding the need for supplementary analgesia by other routes.
