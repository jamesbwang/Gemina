  Tetramethylpyrazine ( TMP) is a biologically active ingredient , which is isolated from a popularChinese medicinal plant. It has been used effectively to treat ischemic heart problems , cerebrovascular and thrombotic vascular diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of TMP on calciumsensing receptors in pulmonary artery smooth muscle in chickens. For this purpose forty day-old chicks were distributed into five groups: the control group , the hypoxia group ( kept under low Oxygen treatment) , and TMP groups ( kept under low Oxygen treatment along with treatment of different concentrations of TMP). The pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were also cultured on 6-well plates in high glucose culture medium and divided into the same five groups. We used in vivo and in vitro study models by applying immunohistochemistry , RT-qPCR assay and Western blotting analysis. Our results showed that pre-incubation with hypoxia markedly stimulated the activation of calcium-sensing receptor ( CaSR) in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( PASMCs). The TMP decreased the mRNA and protein levels of CaSR. Treatment with TMP clearly inhibited the activation of all CaSR in a dose-dependent manner. Our data demonstrated that TMP can down-regulate the expression of CaSR. Therefore , these findings provide a new target to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) under hypoxic conditions.
