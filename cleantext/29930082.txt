  Oxysterol binding protein ( OSBP)- related protein 4L ( ORP4L , also known as OSBPL2) , a closely related paralogue and interacting partner of OSBP , binds sterols and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ( PI ( 4) P) and regulates cell proliferative signalling at the plasma membrane ( PM). Here , we report that ORP4L also interacts with the
