  To use mendelian randomisation to investigate whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration has a causal effect on gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. One and two sample mendelian randomisation analyses. Two European pregnancy cohorts ( Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children , and Generation R Study) , and two case-control studies ( subgroup nested within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study , and the UK Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Study). 7389 women in a one sample mendelian randomisation analysis ( 751 with gestational hypertension and 135 with pre-eclampsia) , and 3388 pre-eclampsia cases and 6059 controls in a two sample mendelian randomisation analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with vitamin D synthesis ( rs10741657 and rs12785878) and metabolism ( rs6013897 and rs2282679) were used as instrumental variables. Gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. In the conventional multivariable analysis , the relative risk for pre-eclampsia was 1.03 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.00 to 1.07) per 10 % decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level , and 2.04 ( 1.02 to 4.07) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 25 nmol/L compared with â‰¥ 75 nmol/L. No association was found for gestational hypertension. The one sample mendelian randomisation analysis using the total genetic risk score as an instrument did not provide strong evidence of a linear effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on the risk of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia: odds ratio 0.90 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.78 to 1.03) and 1.19 ( 0.92 to 1.52) per 10 % decrease , respectively. The two sample mendelian randomisation estimate gave an odds ratio for pre-eclampsia of 0.98 ( 0.89 to 1.07) per 10 % decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level , an odds ratio of 0.96 ( 0.80 to 1.15) per unit increase in the log ( odds) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 75 nmol/L , and an odds ratio of 0.93 ( 0.73 to 1.19) per unit increase in the log ( odds) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 50 nmol/L. No strong evidence was found to support a causal effect of vitamin D status on gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Future mendelian randomisation studies with a larger number of women with pre-eclampsia or more genetic instruments that would increase the proportion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels explained by the instrument are needed.
