  Planarians are flatworms with almost unlimited regenerative abilities , which make them an excellent model for stem cell-based regeneration. To study the process of regeneration at the cellular level , immunohistochemical staining methods are an important tool , and the availability of such protocols is one of the prerequisites for mechanistic experiments in any animal model. Here , we detail protocols for paraffin embedding and immunostaining of paraffin sections of the model species Schmidtea mediterranea. This protocol yields robust results with a variety of commercially available antibodies. Further , the procedures provide a useful starting point for customizing staining procedures for new antibodies and/or different planarian species.
