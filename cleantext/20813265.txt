  Wnt/β-catenin ( or canonical) signalling pathway activity is necessary and used independently several times for specification of vegetal fate and endoderm , gut differentiation , maintenance of epithelium in adult intestine and the development of gut-derived organs in various vertebrate and non-vertebrate organisms. However , its conservation in later stages of digestive tract development still remains questionable due to the lack of detailed data , mainly from Spiralia. Here we characterize the Our findings suggest that high Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the midgut might be necessary for proper differentiation of the endoderm to an epithelium capable of secreting digestive enzymes. Together , our data provide evidence for the role of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in gut differentiation in
