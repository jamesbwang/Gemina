  A comprehensive experimental and computational mechanistic study of the highly enantioselective hydroboration of ketones catalyzed by a manganese ( II) alkyl boxmi pincer complex is reported. The catalyst operates at low catalyst loadings ( down to 0.01 mol %) under very mild conditions ( typically -40 °C) and facilitates the reduction of both aryl alkyl and dialkyl ketones with excellent selectivity ( up to > 95). Catalyst activation pathways were investigated , demonstrating that a manganese ( II) hydride and a manganese ( II) alkoxide species are part of the catalytic cycle and can be generated via σ-bond metathesis of the alkyl precursor with the borane or by alcoholysis. Extensive kinetic experiments based on a `` one-pot sequential kinetic profiling '' approach under various conditions in combination with kinetic simulations reveal that two catalytic cycles are effective with this earth-abundant base metal catalyst: ( i) a minor MnH/borane-mediated insertion cycle , in which the subsequent , product-releasing metathesis step is rate determining ( k
