  Scabies is an allergic skin disease that affects millions of mammals worldwide , including humans. It is a neglected tropical disease that represents a significant public health threat , particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. An effective vaccine is not currently available , and the exact mode of pathogenesis remains unclear. Herein , we identified , cloned and recombinantly expressed triosephosphate isomerase from Sarcoptes scabiei ( S. scabiei). Immunohistochemical analyses showed that S. scabiei triosephosphate isomerase ( Ss-TIM) is localized in the legs and chewing mouthparts of mites , and in infected rabbit skin ( keratinized skin and embedded mites). Intradermal skin tests of rabbits injected with recombinant S. scabiei triosephosphate isomerase ( rSs-TIM) revealed a flare , erythema and wheal reaction. These findings suggest that Ss-TIM may contribute to host invasion and induce an allergic response in the host.
