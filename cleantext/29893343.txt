  Primary mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the kidney is extremely rare , with only nine cases reported in the English literature. We report a new case of this disease. A 35-year-old man , presented with flank pain , episodic gross hematuria<symptom> and a painless palpable mass in left abdominal<symptom> quadrant<symptom>. Computed tomography scan identified a left renal tumor with 20 cm , with no evidence of regional or metastatic spread disease. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy. The immunohistopathological diagnosis was mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the kidney. At 18 months of follow-up , there was no evidence of recurrence or distant metastasis. Primary renal chondrosarcoma is so rare that its prognosis is unknown. Disease recurrence is unpredictable and when it is detected , the prognosis is poor. The radical nephrectomy with complete resection of the tumor with wide resection free margins is recommended , and the patients need long-term and close surveillance , with particular attention to local recurrence and uncommon sites of metastization.
