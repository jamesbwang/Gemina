  Pyruvate kinase ( PK) is responsible for the final reaction in glycolysis. As PK is a glycolytic control point , the analysis of PK posttranslational modifications ( PTM) and kinetic changes reveals a key piece of the reorganization of energy metabolism in an anoxia tolerant vertebrate. To explore PK regulation , the enzyme was isolated from red skeletal muscle and liver of aerobic and 20-hr anoxia-exposed red eared-slider turtles ( Both muscle and liver isoforms showed decreased affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate substrate during anoxia , and muscle PK also had a lower affinity for ADP. Anoxia responsive changes in turtle muscle and liver PK coordinate with an overall reduced activity state. This reduced affinity for the forward glycolytic reaction is likely a key component of the overall metabolic rate depression<symptom> that supports long term survival in anoxia tolerant turtles. The coinciding methyl- and phospho- PTM alterations present the mechanism for tissue specific enzyme modification during anoxia.
