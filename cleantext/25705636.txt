  This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of drug eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization ( DEB-TACE) treatment by CalliSpheres ® in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) as well as the predicting factors for response. 99 patients with HCC were consecutively enrolled in this study. All participants were treated by CalliSpheres ® DEB-TACE. Clinical response was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( mRECIST) criteria. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) was used to assess the adverse events and liver dysfunction during and after the operation. Post treatment , 16 patients ( 16.2 %) achieved CR and 59 ( 59.6 %) achieved PR , the ORR was 75.8 %. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with higher BCLC stage were of worse CR and ORR rates , and the CR as well as ORR between patients with cTACE history and patients without cTACE history were similar. Univariate logistic regression analysis displayed that number of nodules<symptom> > 3 , higher BCLC stage and previous cTACE might be correlated with worse ORR but with no statistical significance. As to liver function , CTCAE grades of laboratory indexes for liver function were increased at 1 week compared to baseline and recovered to the baseline grades at 1-3 months post operation. Besides , most of the common adverse events were light and moderate in our study. In conclusion , DEB-TACE by CalliSpheres ® was efficient and well tolerated in Chinese HCC patients , and BCLC stage , number of nodules<symptom> and cTACE history were possibly correlated with treatment response.
