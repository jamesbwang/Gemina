  The adaptive evolution of influenza<pathogen> virus<pathogen> is an important question , but predicting its evolutionary future will be more challenging. Here , we investigated the mutation characteristic of influenza<pathogen> virus<pathogen> based on the complete genome data of 2009 ( H1N1)<pathogen> influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus.<pathogen> By assuming that evolution proceeds via the accumulation of mutations , we analyzed the mutation networks at four different time stages and found that the network structure follows the characteristics of a scale-free network. These results will be important for epidemiology and the future control of influenza<pathogen> viruses.<pathogen> Furthermore , we predicted the predominant mutation virus<pathogen> strain by using the early mutation network of influenza<pathogen> viruses<pathogen> , and this result was consistent with the WHO recommendation for the candidate vaccine of influenza<pathogen> virus.<pathogen> The key contribution of this study is that we explained the biological significance of this scale-free network for influenza<pathogen> pandemic and provided a potential method for predicting the candidate vaccine by using the early-stage network.
