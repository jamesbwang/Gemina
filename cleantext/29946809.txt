  The authors present the case of a previously healthy 12-year-old male with intractable seizures<symptom> localized to a right frontal area of encephalomalacia and porencephalic cyst<symptom> who underwent resection of the seizure<symptom> focus. The surgical resection cavity extended into the right lateral ventricle , and due to encountered hemorrhage<symptom> , Gelfoam was used for optimal hemostasis. The patient did well following the procedure , but presented 5 months later with headaches<symptom> and emesis and was discovered to have obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> on imaging studies. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy ( ETV) was performed , where Gelfoam was encountered in the third ventricle , obstructing the cerebral aqueduct. After the completion of the ETV , the patient did well and continues to be asymptomatic 1 year following the procedure.
