  Objective After spinal cord injury ( SCI) , hybrid stimulation patterns that interpose paired-pulse doublets over a constant-frequency background may enhance the metabolic `` work '' ( muscle torque) performed by paralyzed muscle. This study examined the effect of background stimulation frequency on the torque contribution of the doublet before and after fatigue<symptom>. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Research laboratory in an academic medical center. Participants Five men with chronic sensory and motor-complete SCI and ten non-SCI controls ( 6 males , 4 females). SCI subjects were recruited from a long-term study of unilateral plantar-flexor training; both limbs were tested for the present study. Interventions Subjects underwent plantar flexor stimulation at 5 , 7 , 9 , and 12 Hz. The four background frequencies were overlaid with 6 ms doublets delivered at the start , middle , or at both the start and middle of each train. The 5 Hz and 12 Hz frequencies were analyzed after fatigue<symptom>. Outcome Measures Mean torque , peak torque , torque fusion index , doublet torque. Results Trains with doublets at both the start and middle yielded the most consistent enhancement of torque ( all P < 0.028). Torque contribution of the doublet was greatest at low stimulus frequencies ( all P < 0.016). The low relative fusion of untrained paralyzed muscle preserved the efficacy of the doublet even during fatigue<symptom>. Conclusion Hybrid stimulus trains may be an effective way to increase contractile work in paralyzed muscle , even after fatigue<symptom>. They may be useful for rehabilitation strategies designed to enhance the metabolic work performed by paralyzed skeletal muscle.
