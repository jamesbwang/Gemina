  Oligonucleotides are widely used as effective tools to regulate gene expression and drugs for targeted gene therapy. Therefore , they are potentially useful for the treatment of viral , tumor and hereditary diseases. Therapeutic oligonucleotides include antisense oligonucleotide , small interference RNA ( siRNA) , Ribozyme , DNAzyme , anti-gene , CpG , decoy and aptamer. Therapeutic oligonucleotides usually carry certain modifications , such as phosphorothioates , fluoro or locked nucleic acids , to enhance the stability and specificity , and reduce the side-effects , because natural oligonucleotides have poor stability in vivo , low specificity and side effects. Now oligonucleotides are usually manufactured by chemical synthesis , with low purity and high cost. Here , we review a novel thermocyclic reaction for the amplification of oligonucleotides , referred to as Polymerase-endonuclease Amplification Reaction ( PEAR) catalyzed by two thermostable enzymes. PEAR is simple , efficient , and stable. Comparing with traditional chemical synthesis , PEAR-based enzymatic production of oligonucleotides could be a robust alternative method for the large-scale production of therapeutic or non-therapeutic oligonucleotides.
