  The aims of this study were to determine the nutritional status of HIV-positive versus HIV-negative adults in Senegal and to identify predictors of nutritional status among people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV). We conducted a retrospective study using data from individuals enrolled in previous studies in Senegal. Undernutrition was defined as body mass index ( BMI) < 18.5 and overnutrition was defined as BMI ≥ 25.0. Subcategories of overnutrition were overweight ( defined as BMI 25.0-29.9) and obesity ( BMI ≥ 30.0). Predictors of nutritional status were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Data from 2448 adults were included; 1471 ( 60 %) were HIV<pathogen> positive. Among HIV-negative individuals , the prevalence of undernutrition decreased from 23 % in 1994-1999 to 5 % in 2006-2012 , while the prevalence of overnutrition increased from 19 to 55 %. Among PLHIV , undernutrition decreased from 52 to 37 % and overnutrition increased from 10 to 15 %. Women had greater odds of obesity ( odds ratio ( OR) 11.4; p < 0.01). Among HIV-positive women , undernutrition was associated with WHO stage 3 or 4 and CD4 cell count < 200; antiretroviral therapy ( ART) and education were protective. Obesity was associated with age > 35 years , commercial sex work , and alcohol use. Among HIV-positive men , WHO stage 3 or 4 and CD4 cell count < 200 were predictive of undernutrition; ART was protective. Our study highlights the need for the integration of nutrition interventions into HIV<pathogen> programs in Senegal and suggests that for nutrition programs to be most effective , strategies may need to differ when targeting men versus women. Furthermore , improving access to education and focusing on women for nutrition interventions could be of particularly high impact at the household level.
