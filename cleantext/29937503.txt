  The chloroplast relies on proteins encoded in the nucleus , synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently transported into chloroplast through the protein complexes Toc and Tic ( Translocon at the outer/inner membrane of chloroplasts). A Tic complex member , Tic55 , contains a redox-related motif essential for protein import into chloroplasts in peas. However , Tic55 is not crucial for protein import in
