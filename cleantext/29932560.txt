  The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of implementing a multiple-behavior self-monitoring intervention within a diabetes education program. This study was a 3-month pre- post-design , conducted with African-Americans ( N = 20) , who attended diabetes education classes at a large Veteran 's Affairs ( VA) hospital in Southwest Texas. Participants selfmonitored their blood glucose , diet , exercise , and weight on either a smart phone application or paper diaries. Paired t tests showed strong evidence that patient self-monitoring of healthy lifestyle behaviors improved blood glucose ( t = -3.858 , p = .001) and HbAlc ( t = -4.428 , p < .001) , respectively. Moreover Spearman 's correlation coefficient showed significant correlations between blood glucose and exercise ( rs = -.68 , p = .008) and HbAlc and exercise ( rs = -.56 , p = .036). This feasibility study showed that multiple-behavior self-monitoring was effective in lowering blood glucose and HbA1c levels among African-American Veterans; however , a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample is needed to validate these preliminary findings.
