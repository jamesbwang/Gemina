  Faithful chromosome segregation depends on correct spindle microtubule-kinetochore attachment and requires certain spindle-associated proteins ( SAPs) involved in regulating spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation. Little is known about the spindle-associated proteome in the early divergent Trypanosoma brucei and its roles in chromosome segregation. Here we report the identification of a cohort of divergent SAPs through localization-based screening and proximity-dependent biotin identification. We identified seven new SAPs and seventeen new nucleolar proteins that associate with the spindle , and demonstrated that the kinetochore protein KKIP4 also associates with the spindle. These SAPs localize to distinct subdomains of the spindle during mitosis , and all but one localize to nucleus during interphase and post-mitotic phases. Functional analyses of three nucleus- and spindle-associated proteins ( NuSAPs) revealed distinct functions in chromosome segregation. NuSAP1 is a kinetoplastid-specific protein required for equal chromosome segregation and for maintaining the stability of the kinetochore proteins KKIP1 and KKT1. NuSAP2 is a highly divergent ASE1/PRC1/MAP65 homolog playing an essential role in promoting the G2/M transition. NuSAP3 is a kinetoplastid-specific Kif13-1-binding protein maintaining Kif13-1 protein stability and regulating the G2/M transition. Together , our work suggests that chromosome segregation in T. brucei requires a cohort of kinetoplastid-specific and divergent SAPs with distinct functions.
