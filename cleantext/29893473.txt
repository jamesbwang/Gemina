  Blood analysis has recently become a popular tool to assess the welfare of the wild cats. However , the estimates of blood parameters may depend on the sampling method. We have tested ( 1) if the sampling procedure influences blood parameters and ( 2) what parameters are the most efficient in assessing the physiological status in wild cat species. We assessed the effect of handling time on red blood cells ( RBC) and white blood cells ( WBC) counts , the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes ( N/L ratio) , and serum cortisol level within 1 hr after the capture of the animal in six far-east wild cats ( Prionailurus bengalensis euptilura). Also , we analyzed literature data in 17 cat species to assess the effect of place of study , type of immobilization , and handling time on WBC count and N/L ratio. Serum cortisol level varied significantly with the handling time. RBC and WBC counts were strongly affected by the handling time. N/L ratio was very robust and did not depend on the handling time. However , the analysis of literature data has shown that the prolonged handling time ( over 1 hr) and the type of immobilization significantly influence the N/L ratio , whereas the WBC count does not depend on any of considered factors. We conclude that while most blood parameters of cats are affected by routine handling time , the N/L ratio does not vary if the samples are collected within 1 hr after the capture of the animal. All other tested parameters should be treated with caution.
