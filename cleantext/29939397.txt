  Medical management of retained placenta could be a safe alternative to manual removal. To evaluate the efficacy of prostaglandin analogues for retained placenta. MEDLINE , EMBASE , CENTRAL , ICTRP , LILACS , and OpenSIGLE were searched without language restrictions from inception to January 31 , 2017 , by combining terms for retained placenta and prostaglandin analogues. Randomized controlled trials comparing prostaglandin analogues with any other intervention. Trials were independently assessed for inclusion , data extraction , and risk of bias. Data were extracted for meta-analyses. GRADE was used to evaluate the quality of data. Seven randomized controlled trials ( 851 patients) were included. Prostaglandins did not increase the placenta expulsion rate ( relative risk ( RR) 1.40 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.83-2.36) or decrease maternal transfusion ( RR 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.43-1.22). In comparison with oxytocin , prostaglandins did not modify the expulsion rate ( RR 1.26 , 95 % CI 0.90-1.78) , maternal transfusion ( RR 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.27-4.09) , or time for delivery of placenta ( mean difference -1.56 minutes , 95 % CI , -9.25-6.13). Three trials comparing prostaglandins with oxytocin agonists , ergometrine , and manual removal reported similar results. Prostaglandin analogues do not offer an effective alternative for management of retained placenta.
