  Although peritoneal lavage with povidone-iodine ( PVPI) is frequently performed after surgery on the gastrointestinal tract , the effects of PVPI on the intestinal epithelial barrier are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of abdominal irrigation with PVPI on the intestinal epithelial barrier in a colorectal cancer ( CRC)- induced rat model. The CRC model was induced in rats with azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. Next , a total of 24 male CRC-induced rats were randomly divided into three groups ( n = 8): ( 1) a sham-operated group , ( 2) an NS group ( peritoneal lavage 0.9 % NaCl) , and ( 3) a PVPI group ( peritoneal lavage with 0.45 % -0.55 % PVPI). The mean arterial pressure was continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The levels of plasma endotoxin and D-lactate , blood gases , and protein concentration were measured. The ultrastructural changes of the epithelial tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The mean arterial pressure after peritoneal lavage was lower in the PVPI group than that in the NS group. The protein concentration and levels of endotoxin and D-lactate were higher in the PVPI group than they were in the PVPI group. In addition , PVPI treatment resulted in a markedly severe metabolic acidosis and intestinal mucosal injury compared with NS rats. Peritoneal lavage with PVPI dramatically compromises the integrity of the intestinal mucosa barrier and causes endotoxin shock<symptom> in CRC rats. It is unsafe for clinical applications to include peritoneal lavage with PVPI in colorectal operations.
