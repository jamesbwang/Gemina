  H-index serves as an alternative to measure academic achievement. Our objective is to study the h-index as a measure of academic attainment in general surgery and surgical specialties. A database of all surgical programs in the United States was created. Publish or Perish software was used to determine surgeons h-index. A total of 134 hospitals and 3712 surgeons ( 79 % male) were included. Overall , mean h-index was 14.9 ± 14.8. H-index increased linearly with academic rank: 6.8 ± 6.4 for assistant professors ( n = 1557 , 41.9 %) , 12.9 ± 9.3 for associate professors ( n = 891 , 24 %) , and 27.9 ± 17.4 for professors ( n = 1170 , 31.5 %); P < 0.001. Thoracic surgery and surgical oncology had the highest subspecialty mean h-indices ( 18.7 ± 16.7 and 18.4 ± 17.6 , respectively). Surgeons with additional postgraduate degrees , university affiliations and male had higher mean h-indices; P < 0.001. Scatterplot analysis showed a strong correlation between h-index and the number of publications ( R2 = 0.817) and citations ( R2 = 0.768). The h-index of academic surgeons correlates with academic rank and serves a potential tool to measure academic productivity.
