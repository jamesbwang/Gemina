  Fetal hemodynamic changes have already been described during open myelomeningocele repair. This study aimed to access fetal myocardial performance index ( MPI) during this high-complexity surgery. Open myelomeningocele repair was performed in 37 fetuses between the 24th and 27th week of gestation. MPI was calculated at specific periods: pre-anesthesia , postanesthesia , neurosurgery ( early skin manipulation , spinal cord releasing , and sintesis) , and end of surgery. Mean Â± standard deviation ( SD) of MPI and its related times-isovolumetric contraction time ( ICT) , isovolumetric relaxation time ( IRT) , and ejection time ( ET)- was determined for each period. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to assess differences among these periods. Tukey multiple comparison times test compared global surgery stages. The mean of MPI in the specific time points was 0.32 , 0.32 , 0.34 , 0.48 , 0.36 , and 0.32 , respectively ( P < .001). In the two-tailed comparison times , neurosurgery stage presents MPI highest levels , especially on stage 3b ( early skin manipulation and spinal cord releasing) related to ICT and IRT rising and ET decreased levels. Fetal global cardiac function is altered during the open myelomeningocele repair. The neurosurgery stage represents the critical phase of the procedure.
