  Afuresertib ( AFU) , a novel inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase AKT , has clinical efficacy as a monotherapy against hematological malignancies and is expected to be used in combination with standard therapies for multiple myeloma ( MM). To develop a more effective and less toxic combination of immunomodulatory drugs ( IMiDs) for therapy , the antitumor effect of sub-optimal doses of AFU , pomalidomide plus dexamethasone ( PD) , and the AFU-PD combination on MM cells were examined in the present study. Two MM cell lines , XG-7 and U266 , with low sensitivity to both PD and AFU monotherapies , were subjected to these combinations and analyzed. Although the cell lines showed a slight reduction in viability with the sub-optimal doses of each monotherapy , the combination of the treatments resulted in a reduction in cell viability and the progression of apoptosis. Co-treatment with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFU enhanced caspase activation and highly suppressed the expression of IKZF1 and IKZF3. In addition , this combination promoted the dephosphorylation and stabilization of 4EBP1 , an inhibitor of eIF4E activation , which led to the impairment of eIF4E-mediated translational activity. Furthermore , AFU showed a sufficient inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of FOXO1 , a tumor suppressor , in monotherapy or in combination with PD , which may be attributable to the activation of FOXO1 , the subsequent inhibition of tumor growth , and the induction of cell death. In conclusion , the combination therapy with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFU exhibited potent antitumor activity in MM cells and may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of patients who experienced intolerable toxicity or insufficient response during IMiD therapy.
