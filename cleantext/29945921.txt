  Despite the importance of type I interferon ( IFN-I) in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) pathogenesis , the mechanisms of IFN-I production have not been fully elucidated. Recognition of nucleic acids by DNA sensors induces IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs) , but the involvement of cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( GMP)- AMP synthase ( cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes ( STING) in SLE remains unclear. We studied the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in the IFN-I-producing cascade driven by SLE serum. We collected sera from patients with SLE ( n = 64) , patients with other autoimmune diseases ( n = 31) and healthy controls ( n = 35) , and assayed them using a cell-based reporter system that enables highly sensitive detection of IFN-I and ISG-inducing activity. We used Toll-like receptor-specific reporter cells and reporter cells harbouring knockouts of cGAS , STING and IFNAR2 to evaluate signalling pathway-dependent ISG induction. IFN-I bioactivity and ISG-inducing activities of serum were higher in patients with SLE than in patients with other autoimmune diseases or healthy controls. ISG-inducing activity of SLE sera was significantly reduced in STING-knockout reporter cells , and STING-dependent ISG-inducing activity correlated with disease activity. Double-stranded DNA levels were elevated in SLE. Apoptosis-derived membrane vesicles ( AdMVs) from SLE sera had high ISG-inducing activity , which was diminished in cGAS-knockout or STING-knockout reporter cells. AdMVs in SLE serum induce IFN-I production through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Thus , blockade of the cGAS-STING axis represents a promising therapeutic target for SLE. Moreover , our cell-based reporter system may be useful for stratifying patients with SLE with high ISG-inducing activity.
