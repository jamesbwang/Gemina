  Oxidative stress is known to be associated with various age-related diseases. D-galactose ( D-gal) has been considered a senescent model which induces oxidative stress response resulting in memory<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. Pyrroloquinoline quinone ( PQQ) is a redox cofactor which is found in various foods. In our previous study , we found that PQQ may be converted into a derivative by binding with amino acid , which is beneficial to several pathological processes. In this study , we found a beneficial glutamate mixture which may diminish neurotoxicity by oxidative stress in D-gal induced mouse. Our results showed that PQQ may influence the generation of proinflammatory mediators , including cytokines and prostaglandins during aging process. D-gal-induced mouse showed increased MDA and ROS levels , and decreased T-AOC activities in the hippocampus , these changes were reversed by PQQ supplementation. Furthermore , PQQ statistically enhanced Superoxide Dismutase SOD2 mRNA expression. PQQ could ameliorate the memory deficits and neurotoxicity induced by D-gal via binding with excess glutamate , which provide a link between glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity , inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress. In addition , PQQ reduced the up-regulated expression of p-Akt by D-gal and maintained the activity of GSK-3β , resulting in a down-regulation of p-Tau level in hippocampus. PQQ modulated memory ability partly via Akt/GSK -3 β pathway.
