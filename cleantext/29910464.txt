  In the presented study , we aimed to systematically analyze plasma proteomes in cord blood samples from preterm infants stratified by their gestational age to identify proteins and related malfunctioning pathways at birth , possibly contributing to the complications observed among preterm infants. Preterm newborns were enrolled of three subgroups with different gestation age: newborns born â‰¤ 26 ( group 1) , between 27 and 28 ( group 2) and between 29 and 30 ( group 3) weeks of gestation , respectively , and compared to the control group of healthy , full-term newborns in respect to their plasma proteome composition. Preterm delivery is associated with multiple protein abundance changes in plasma related to a plethora of processes , including inflammation<symptom> and immunomodulation , coagulation , and complement activation as some key features. Plasma proteome analysis revealed numerous gestation-age-dependent protein abundance differences between term and preterm infants , which highlight key dysregulated pathways and potential new protein treatment targets.
