  The breast-milk composition in the first 6 wk postpartum of women who have undergone bariatric surgery ( BS) is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine 1) the breast-milk macronutrient and vitamin A composition in women who had and who had not undergone BS and 2) the impact of maternal diet on the breast-milk composition. We hypothesized that the milk of women who had undergone BS would be less energy dense and have a lower vitamin A concentration than that of other women. A multicenter prospective substudy was conducted at 2 university hospitals. Breast-milk samples were collected from 24 normal-weight ( NW; mean ± SD body mass index ( BMI; kg/m2): 21.5 ± 1.7; mean ± SD age: 29 ± 6 y) , 39 overweight ( OW; BMI: 26.9 ± 1.5; aged 29 ± 5 y) , and 12 obese women ( BMI: 35.0 ± 5.7; aged 29 ± 5 y) as well as from 11 women who had undergone BS ( BMI: 28.0 ± 4.4; aged 30 ± 4 y) from day 3 until week 6 of lactation. Milk energy and macronutrients ( Human Milk Analyzer; Miris) and vitamin A concentrations ( iCheck Fluoro; BioAnalyt) were determined at the end of each week. Maternal diet ( food-frequency questionnaire) and physical activity ( Kaiser Physical Activity Survey) were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and on day 3 or 4 and during week 6 of lactation. Statistical analyses include 1-factor ANOVA , Spearman and Pearson correlations , and multiple linear regression. In all women , a weekly increase in milk energy , total fat , and total carbohydrates was seen , whereas a weekly decrease in proteins and vitamin A was found during the first 2 wk of lactation , followed by a stable concentration of all nutrients. At week 4 , milk protein concentrations were higher in women who had undergone BS ( 14 g/L) compared with NW ( 8 g/L; P = 0.005) and OW ( 9 g/L; P = 0.019) women. At week 5 , milk carbohydrate concentrations were higher in women who had undergone BS ( 74 g/L) compared with NW women ( 68 g/L; P = 0.042). Breast milk of women who have undergone BS appears to be adequate in energy , macronutrients , and vitamin A during the first 6 wk of lactation. This supports the conclusion that breast feeding should not be discouraged in this group of women. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02515214.
