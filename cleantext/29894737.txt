  Five novel compounds , including four neoclerodane diterpenoids , named ajugacumbins KN ( 1-4) along with a phytoecdysterone , named ajugacetalsterone E ( 5) , were isolated from the whole herbs of Ajuga decumbens<pathogen> ( Labiatae). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis including IR , HRESIMS , CD , 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic experiments. Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities and the effects on superoxide anion generation and elastase release in FMLP/CB-induced human neutrophils.
