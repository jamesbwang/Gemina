  Overactive bladder ( OAB) , a symptom syndrome<disease> defined as urgency , is a common clinical condition , which sometimes can not be satisfactorily treated with current medications in every subject; therefore , alternatives are needed. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the effects of ivabradine , a selective pacemaker If current inhibitor , on agonist-induced isometric contractions of the bladder smooth muscles. Urinary bladder strips were isolated from adult male Wistar rats and suspended in a tissue bath containing physiological solution. The strips were contracted by bath applications of carbachol ( CCh , 1 μM). Ivabradine ( 30 μM , 60 μM or 90 μM) was added to the tissue bath either prior to or after the application of the agonist , and the resulting contractile activity was compared to the preceding contractile activity. The amplitude and area under force-time curves ( AUFC) of the isometric contractions were evaluated. The addition of CCh caused a marked stimulation of contractile force in isolated urinary bladder strips , which was significantly inhibited by ivabradine , both in terms of peak amplitude ( 29 % ± 3 % , 20 % ± 6 % and 18 % ± 6 % by 30 μM , 60 μM and 90 μM ivabradine , respectively) and AUFC ( 47 % ± 5.5 % , 35 % ± 8 % and 35 % ± 6 % by 30 μM , 60 μM and 90 μM ivabradine , respectively; n = 7 for each). Pre-treatment with ivabradine ( 10 μM) significantly attenuated the contractile response to CCh ( 1 μM; mean peak amplitude from 1493 ± 216 mg to 680 ± 95 mg; p < 0.003; n = 7). The results of this in vitro study demonstrated that ivabradine inhibits cholinergic agonistinduced bladder contractions , which means that in the future ivabradine may be used in OAB treatment.
