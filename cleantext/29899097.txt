  Alphaviruses are widely distributed in both hemispheres and circulate between mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts. Geographically separated alphaviruses have adapted to replication in particular organisms. The accumulating data suggest that this adaptation is determined not only by changes in their glycoproteins , but also by the amino acid sequence of the hypervariable domain ( HVD) of the alphavirus nsP3 protein. We performed a detailed investigation of chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CHIKV) nsP3 HVD interactions with host factors and their roles in viral replication in vertebrate and mosquito cells. The results demonstrate that CHIKV HVD is intrinsically disordered and binds several distinctive cellular proteins. These host factors include two members of the G3BP family and their mosquito homolog Rin , two members of the NAP1 family and several SH3 domain-containing proteins. Interaction with G3BP proteins or Rin is an absolute requirement for CHIKV replication , although it is insufficient to solely drive it in either vertebrate or mosquito cells. To achieve a detectable level of virus replication , HVD needs to bind members of at least one more protein family in addition to G3BPs. Interaction with NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 plays a more pro-viral role in vertebrate cells , while binding of SH3 domain-containing proteins to a proline-rich fragment of HVD is more critical for virus replication in the cells of mosquito origin. Modifications of binding sites in CHIKV HVD allow manipulation of the cell specificity of CHIKV replication. Similar changes may be introduced into HVDs of other alphaviruses to alter their replication in particular cells or tissues.
