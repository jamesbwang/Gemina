  Immunotherapeutic agents have demonstrated encouraging signs of clinical utility in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The goal of this study is to analyze the immune characteristics of Chinese patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) to inform the development of immunotherapies in this patient population. Tumor samples from 211 DLBCL patients were analyzed for cell of origin ( COO) and immune characteristics using the NanoString platform as well as MYC protein expression through immunohistochemistry. Lower incidence of the germinal center B-cell ( GCB) subtype<pathogen> ( 93/211 , 44.1 %) was observed in this cohort. Compared to the GCB subtype , the activated B-cell ( ABC) subtype<pathogen> was associated with significantly increased expression of multiple pro-inflammatory gene signatures and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory gene signatures. Instead of affecting the pro-inflammatory genes , MYC protein overexpression showed a negative correlation with the expression of T-cell receptor ( TCR) and T regulatory genes as well as the OX40 gene. Regardless of COO , higher PD-L1 or IDO1 gene expression correlated with increased expression of T effector and Interferon-Î³ gene signatures while the expression of multiple oncogenes including ACTR3B , ERBB2 , AKT2 and SMARCD1 was down-regulated. Our findings may thus be helpful in guiding further development of immunotherapies for the different subsets of Chinese DLBCL patients.
