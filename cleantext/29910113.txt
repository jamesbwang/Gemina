  To determine the predictive value of the inotropic score ( IS) and vasoactive-inotropic score ( VIS) in low cardiac output syndrome<disease> ( LCOS) in children after congenital heart disease surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) , and to establish whether mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin ( MR-proADM) and cardiac troponin I ( cTn-I) , associated to the IS and VIS scores , increases the predictive capacity in LCOS. A prospective observational study was carried out. A Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. A total of 117children with congenital heart disease underwent CPB. Patients were divided into two groups: LCOS and non-LCOS. The clinical and analytical data were recorded at 2 , 12 , 24 and 48h post-CPB. Logistic regression was used to develop a risk prediction model using LCOS as dependent variable. LCOS , IS , VIS , MR-proADM , cTn-I , age , sex , CPB time , PIM-2 , Aristotle score. While statistical significance was not recorded for IS in the multivariate analysis , VIS was seen to be independently associated to LCOS. On the other hand , VIS > 15.5 at 2h post-CPB , adjusted for age and CPB timepoints , showed high specificity ( 92.87 %; 95 % CI: 86.75-98.96) and increased negative predictive value ( 75.59 % , 95 % CI: 71.1-88.08) for the diagnosis of LCOS at 48h post-CPB. The predictive power for LCOS did not increase when VIS was combined with cTn-I > 14ng/ml at 2h and MR-proADM > 1.5 nmol/l at 24h post-CPB. The VIS score at 2h post-CPB was identified as an independent early predictor of LCOS. This predictive value was not increased when associated with LCOS cardiac biomarkers. The VIS score was more useful than IS post-CPB in making early therapeutic decisions in clinical practice post-CPB.
