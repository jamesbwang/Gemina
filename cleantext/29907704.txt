  Women 's groups interventions in Bangladesh reduced neonatal deaths by 38 % and improved hygienic delivery , newborn care practices and breast feeding. We explore the longer-term impact of exposure to women 's groups during pregnancy on child growth at 2-4 years. We performed a cross-sectional survey of child anthropometric measures ( analysed as z-scores) among children born to women who had participated in the women 's groups interventions while pregnant , compared with an age-matched and sex-matched sample of children born to control mothers. Results were stratified by maternal body mass index ( BMI) and adjusted for possible confounding effects of maternal education , household asset ownership and , in a separate model , mother-child height difference , a proxy for improved survival of small babies in intervention groups. Data were obtained from 2587 mother-child pairs ( 91 % response). After adjustment for asset ownership , maternal education and potential survival effects , children whose mothers were exposed to the women 's group intervention had higher head ( 0.16 ( 0.04 to 0.28)) , mid-upper arm ( 0.11 ( 0.04 to 0.19)) , abdominal ( 0.13 ( 0.00 to 0.26)) and chest ( 0.18 ( 0.08 to 0.29)) circumferences than their control counterparts. No significant differences in subcutaneous fat ( subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness) were observed. When stratified by maternal BMI , intervention children had higher weight , BMI and circumferences , and these effects decreased with increasing maternal BMI category. Women 's groups appear to have had a lasting , positive impact on child anthropometric outcomes , with most significant results clustering in children of underweight mothers. Observed differences are likely to be of public health significance in terms of the nutritional and metabolic development of children.
