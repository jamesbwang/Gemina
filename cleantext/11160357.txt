  Psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA) is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of joints , tendon sheaths , and entheses affecting patients with established skin psoriasis , or , less frequently , patients without a personal history of psoriasis with a positive familial history. Many treatment options are now available to deal with the different aspects of the disease , including traditional and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the recently released targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However , ~ 40 % of patients still fail to achieve a meaningful clinical response to first-line biologic therapy advocating the development of novel medications. It is now well accepted that T-cells participate in the immunopathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. For this reason , the potential intervention on T-cells represented an attractive therapeutic target for a long time , becoming a clinical reality with the development of abatacept. Abatacept is a biologic agent selectively targeting the T-cell costimulatory signal delivered through the CD80/86-CD 28 pathway and was approved in December 2005 by the US Food and Drug Administration and in May 2007 by European Medicines Agency for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> in combination with methotrexate. Based on the relevant role of T-cells in PsA pathogenesis and following the positive results obtained in a phase III clinical trial , abatacept recently received approval for treatment of patients with PsA. In this review , we will focus on the current knowledge about the emerging role of abatacept in treatment of PsA.
