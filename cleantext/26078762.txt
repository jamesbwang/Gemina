  Extracranial glioblastoma ( GB) metastasis is an uncommon entity , rarely described in the literature , representing 0.2 % of cases of GB. Several theories have been proposed to explain the extracranial dissemination of GB , such as surgical interventions , ventriculoperitoneal shunt , and radiation therapy. We present a case of a 15-year old adolescent girl , with an initial diagnosis of low-grade glioma and later transformation to a high-grade glioma. In the final phase of the disease , the patient presented with distention<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , secondary to peritoneal compromise of GB metastasis. The use of new therapies has increased survival times , leading to a rise in the probability of developing extracranial metastasis.
