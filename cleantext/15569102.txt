  The 13C-urea breath test is the main non-invasive test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. The availability of this test throughout the country is limited , mainly due to the difficulty in obtaining the labeled isotope from abroad. Recently , researchers from the Nuclear Energy Center in Agriculture at the University of SÃ£o Paulo ( CENA/USP) succeeded in synthesizing 13C-enriched urea for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> diagnosis. The aim of the study was to compare the performance of the 13C-urea breath test using 13C-urea acquired abroad with that of a test using 13C-urea synthesized in Brazil. Sixty-four dyspeptic patients participated in the study ( 24 men and 40 women). Initially , the patients performed the 13C-urea breath test using the imported substrate ( Euriso-Top , France). Seven to fourteen days later , all the patients repeated the test using the Brazilian substrate. The samples from both examinations were processed in an infrared isotope analyzer ( IRIS , Wagner Analisen Technik , Germany) , and all delta over baseline ( DOB) ( %) values above four were considered positive results. Twenty-seven patients ( 42 %) exhibited negative results for Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection , and thirty-seven patients ( 58 %) exhibited positive results when tested using the foreign substrate ( gold standard). There was a 100 % concordance regarding the presence or absence of infection when the gold standard results were compared with those obtained using the Brazilian substrate. Similar performance in the diagnosis of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection was demonstrated when using the 13C-urea breath test with the Brazilian 13C-urea substrate and the test with the substrate produced abroad. This validation represents an important step toward increasing the availability of the 13C-urea breath test throughout the country , which will have a positive influence on the management of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection.
