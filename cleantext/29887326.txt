  There is a diverse array of influenza<disease> viruses which circulate between different species , reassort and drift over time. Current seasonal influenza<disease> vaccines are ineffective in controlling these viruses. We have developed a novel universal vaccine which elicits robust T cell responses and protection against diverse influenza<disease> viruses in mouse and human models. Vaccine mediated protection was dependent on influenza-specific CD4
