  Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> rubredoxin-2 ( Rxn2) is an essential member of the alkane hydroxylation pathway and transfers electrons from a reductase to the membrane-bound hydroxylase. The regioselective hydroxylation of linear alkanes is a challenging chemical transformation of great interest for the chemical industry. Herein , we report the preparation and spectroscopic characterization of cobalt-substituted P.<pathogen> putida<pathogen> Rxn2 and a truncated version of the protein consisting of the C-terminal domain of the protein. Our spectroscopic data on the Co-substituted C-terminal domain supports a high-spin Co ( II) with a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment. Investigation of the two-domain protein Rxn2 provides insights into the metal-binding properties of the N-terminal domain , the role of which is not well understood so far. Circular dichroism , electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopies support an alternative Co-binding site within the N-terminal domain , which appears to not be relevant in nature. We have shown that chemical reconstitution in the presence of Co leads to incorporation of Co ( II) into the active site of the C-terminal domain , but not the N-terminal domain of Rxn2 indicating distinct roles for the two rubredoxin domains.
