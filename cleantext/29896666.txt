  Varicella-zoster virus ( VZV) is the first and only human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> for which a licensed live attenuated vaccine , vOka , has been developed. vOka has highly safe and effective profiles; however , worldwide herd immunity against VZV has not yet been established and it is far from eradication. Despite the successful reduction in the burden of VZV-related illness by the introduction of the vaccine , some concerns about vOka critically prevent worldwide acceptance and establishment of herd immunity , and difficulties in addressing these criticisms often relate to its ill-defined mechanism of attenuation. Advances in scientific technologies have been applied in the VZV research field and have contributed toward uncovering the mechanism of vOka attenuation as well as VZV biology at the molecular level. A subunit vaccine targeting single VZV glycoprotein , rationally designed based on the virological and immunological research , has great potential to improve the strategy for eradication of VZV infection in combination with vOka.
