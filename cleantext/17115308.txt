  We report two cases of gastrointestinal perforation by ventriculoperitoneal ( VP) shunts and review the literature on the topic. The time interval between shunt surgery and detection of bowel perforation is minimum in infants and increases with age. Sigmoid and transverse colon followed by stomach are the most frequent sites of gastrointestinal perforations by VP shunts.
