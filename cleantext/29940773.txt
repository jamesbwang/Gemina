  Cancer is the main leading cause of death in the world , although it has been made noteworthy advances in cancer research in the past decades. Early detection of cancer is extremely important in improving the chances of successful therapy. Thus , it is urgently needed to make further efforts to explore novel tumor markers for treatment.Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase ( NNMT) is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide to form 1-methylnicotinamide ( 1-MNA) , and plays an important role in controlling the intracellular concentration of nicotinamide. Nicotinamide , the precursor to NAD + , is an important cofactor that associates cellular redox states with energy metabolism. Growing evidence shows that NNMT protein levels are elevated in a variety of human cancers , and increased NNMT expression has been linked to tumor aggressiveness. This paper presents a review for the role of NNMT expressed in a series of human cancers and the regulating mechanism involved , and offers its potential value of NNMT in cancer detection and treatment.
