  This study aims to investigate the serum adiponectin , interleukin ( IL) -6 and oxidative stress in epilepsy patients who are refractory or non-refractory to treatments. The study comprised 31 refractory epilepsy , 29 well-controlled epilepsy patients and control group including 29 healthy individuals. The serum adiponectin , IL-6 , total antioxidant status ( TAS) , total oxidant status levels ( TOS) and oxidative stress index ( OSİ) were determined. The mean serum adiponectin and TAS levels were significantly lower in the refractory epilepsy patients than in the healty controls , and mean IL-6 , TOS and OSİ levels were significantly higher. The serum adiponectin , IL-6 , TAS , TOS and OSI levels were not significantly different between the well-controlled epilepsy patients and the healthy controls. The mean serum IL-6 and oxidative stress levels in refractory epilepsy patients were higher and the serum adiponectin level was lower than the healthy control group. These findings may be associated with an increased risk of seizures<symptom> , atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in refractory epilepsy patients.
