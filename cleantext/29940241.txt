  Interaction of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin ( SHBG) with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells has a protective role against estrogen exposure. No specific membrane receptor for SHBG had been identified by now , but a putative interaction of SHBG with extracellular matrix associated-proteins ( e.g. fibulins) was suggested. In this study we investigated the expression of fibulins , their functional relationship with SHBG and involvement in behavior of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. Gene expression of fibulins was performed by Real time-PCR on two estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines , MCF-7 and T47D. Fibulin-1 protein expression and localization were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence. SHBG interaction with-fibulin-1 was assessed by GST-pull down assay. MCF-7 cell growth and gene expression , after fibulin-1 silencing by siRNA , were evaluated. Finally , the expression of fibulin-1 was correlated to clinical and pathological data of 21 breast cancer tissue samples. Fibulin-1 was expressed in both cell lines and it was increased by estradiol. SHBG interacted with fibulin-1C; proteins co-localized at MCF-7 cell membranes<symptom> and SHBG localization at membranes<symptom> disappeared after silencing fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 silencing , moreover , generated MCF-7 cells unresponsive to estradiol and SHBG and characterized by increased proliferation. Finally , in breast cancer tissue samples expressing fibulin-1 the proliferation index was significantly lower than in fibulin-1 negative samples. Fibulin-1 interacts with SHBG , it is associated with a less aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> of breast cancer cells and correlates to a better prognosis of the tumor.
