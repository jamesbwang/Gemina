  Since 2010 , Swiss pharmacists have been offering their patients a Polymedication Check ( PMC) , a new cognitive pharmacy service in the form of a medication review for patients taking â‰¥ 4 prescribed medicines for a period > 3 months. While a first publication of this project reported on the impact of the PMC on patients ' adherence , the present paper focuses on humanistic outcomes. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 54 Swiss community pharmacies. After recruitment , the intervention group underwent a PMC in the pharmacy ( T-0) and 28 weeks after T-0 ( T-28) , while the control group did not receive the PMC until 28 weeks after the study started ( T-28). A clinical psychologist , blinded to the intervention , interviewed the patients 2 weeks ( T-2) and 16 weeks ( T-16) after T-0. Interviewer and patient both rated patient 's knowledge of own medicines use. Furthermore , patients reported satisfaction with their pharmacy and appraisal of their medicines use. The availability of a written medication plan was assessed at T-16. Acceptance of the service was measured using a patient 's self-report questionnaire at T-28. General linear model analysis for knowledge about medicines revealed a significant effect on the factor `` group '' ( For the first time , the benefits of a complex pharmacist-led intervention were evaluated in Swiss primary care with a randomized controlled trial. The PMC increased patients ' subjective knowledge of their medicines compared to no medication review. The effect remained sustainable over time. Recommendations resulting from the pharmacist-led service were highly appreciated by the patients.
