  Cell aggregates hold significant therapeutic promise for in vitro cell analysis , ex vivo tissue models , and in vivo cell therapy and tissue engineering. Traditional methods of making cell aggregates require long incubation times and can only produce three-dimensional-spheroid-shaped aggregates. We propose a novel method of making cell aggregates of diverse sizes and shapes using lipid-conjugated heparin. Shaking the cell suspension containing a small amount of lipid-conjugated heparin for approximately 30 min produced cell aggregates. This approach can be applied to any cell type , including stem cells , fibroblast cells , and T lymphocytes. The shape of biocompatible templates could modulate the shape of cell aggregates. In addition to layered , multicompartmental cell aggregates on template , template-free , tube-shaped cell aggregates could also be made. The cell aggregates formed were alive and maintained biological activities.
