  Although superior vena cava ( SVC) stenosis may be a life-threatening complication of haemodialysis ( HD) catheters , its prevalence and risk factors in HD patients are unknown. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and risk factors for SVC stenosis in HD patients with a tunnelled cuffed catheter ( TCC) and to describe its clinical presentation. In this single-centre , retrospective cohort study , all in-centre chronic HD patients carrying a TCC ( 1 January 2008-31 December 2012) were included ( n = 117 patients , 214 TCC , 80911 catheter-days). SVC stenosis was defined as a diameter reduction > 50 % on phlebography or computed tomography. Imaging was triggered by clinical SVC stenosis syndrome<disease> or vascular access ( VA)- related concerns. We recorded demographics , conditions potentially influencing catheter permeability ( medications , carriage of thoracic devices) , number of TCCs , total duration of TCC carriage , previous arteriovenous VA and last ( in use at time of stenosis detection) TCC details ( location , diameter and length). VAs created while a TCC was still used were also recorded. An SVC stenosis was found in 11 patients ( 9.4 % , 0.14/ 1000 catheter-days) , which represents almost one-quarter of patients undergoing imaging , whatever the cause ( 11/45). Only two presented with clinically obvious SVC stenosis. The number of TCCs per patient was 2.64 ± 1.8 in the SVC stenosis group versus 1.75 ± 0.94 in the negative group ( P = 0.13). On multivariate analysis ( Poisson) , diabetes ( incidence rate ratio ( IRR) 4.63 ( confidence interval ( CI) 1.2-17.8); P = 0.02) and total duration of TCC carriage ( IRR 1.47 ( CI 1.2-1.8) per year; P = 0.001) were associated with SVC stenosis , whereas age had a slightly protective effect ( IRR 0.96 ( CI 0.91-1.01); P = 0.01). Limitations are the retrospective design , detection and survivor bias. SVC stenosis is not a rare condition , is mostly asymptomatic in the absence of a peripheral VA , is strongly associated with diabetes and is promoted by long TCC carriage. Age is slightly protective.
