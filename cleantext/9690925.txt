  This article tested a model of parenting stress as a mediator between maternal depressive symptoms , emotion regulation , and child behavior problems using a sample of homeless , substance-abusing mothers. Participants were 119 homeless mothers ( ages 18-24 years) and their young children ( ages 0-6 years). Mothers responded to questions about their depressive symptoms , emotion regulation , parenting stress , and child behavior problems. A path analysis showed that maternal depressive symptoms were positively associated with child behavior problems through increased parenting stress whereas maternal cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with child behavior problems through decreased parenting stress. Moreover , maternal expressive suppression was negatively related to child externalizing problems. Findings support the parenting stress theory and highlight maternal parenting stress as a mechanism associated with homeless children 's mental health risk. This study has significant implications for understanding the parenting processes underlying child 's resilience in the context of homelessness and maternal substance use.
