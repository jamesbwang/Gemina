  A targeted CE-MS approach was developed for the chiral analysis of biologically relevant amino acids in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF). In order to achieve chiral resolution , the five amino acids ( Ser , Asn , Asp , Gln and Glu) were derivatized with ( +) -1- ( 9-fluorenyl) ethyl chloroformate ( ( +)- FLEC). The diastereoselectivity was found to be highly dependent on pH for all analytes and the optimized background electrolyte ( BGE) consisted of 150 mM acetic acid , adjusted to pH 3.7 with NH
