  Cannabis use has been associated with psychosis and cognitive dysfunction. Some evidence suggests that the acute behavioral and neurocognitive effects of the main active ingredient in cannabis , (-)- trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( ∆ 9-THC) , might be modulated by previous cannabis exposure. However , this has not been investigated either using a control group of non-users , or following abstinence in modest cannabis users , who represent the majority of recreational users. Twenty-four healthy men participated in a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , repeated-measures , within-subject , ∆ 9-THC challenge study. Compared to non-users ( N = 12; < 5 lifetime cannabis joints smoked) , abstinent modest cannabis users ( N = 12; 24.5 ± 9 lifetime cannabis joints smoked) showed worse performance and stronger right hemispheric activation during cognitive processing , independent of the acute challenge ( all P ≤ 0.047). Acute ∆ 9-THC administration produced transient anxiety<symptom> and psychotomimetic symptoms ( all P ≤ 0.02) , the latter being greater in non-users compared to users ( P = 0.040). Non-users under placebo ( control group) activated specific brain areas to perform the tasks , while deactivating others. An opposite pattern was found under acute ( ∆ 9-THC challenge in non-users) as well as residual ( cannabis users under placebo) effect of ∆ 9-THC. Under ∆ 9-THC , cannabis users showed brain activity patterns intermediate between those in non-users under placebo ( control group) , and non-users under ∆ 9-THC ( acute effect) and cannabis users under placebo ( residual effect). In non-users , the more severe the ∆ 9-THC-induced psychotomimetic symptoms and cognitive impairments , the more pronounced was the neurophysiological alteration ( all P ≤ 0.036). Previous modest cannabis use blunts the acute behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ∆ 9-THC , which are more marked in people who have never used cannabis.
