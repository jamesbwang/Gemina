  Background Postoperative nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> ( PONV) are among the most common unpleasant and distressing adverse events following surgery under general anesthesia. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS) is a common otolaryngology procedure. Prevention of PONV and early recovery are cost-effective. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the prophylactic effect of bilateral endoscopic injection of lidocaine with epinephrine in the sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG) on PONV in patients undergoing FESS. Methods One hundred patients with chronic rhinosinusitis undergoing general anesthesia for FESS were enrolled in this double-blind , placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive injection of 2 mL of 2 % lidocaine with epinephrine or 2 mL of saline at the end of surgery. Postoperatively , patients were observed for 24 h. PONV was evaluated immediately , 6 h , and 24 h after surgery. Results The 2 groups were comparable in characteristic and intraoperative features. In general , the incidence of PONV after FESS was 36 %. The average time that patients can tolerate oral feeding was 3.4 h after surgery. Endoscopic SPG injection with lidocaine significantly reduced the incidence of vomiting and PONV. In addition , SPG injection with lidocaine reduced the incidence of severe<symptom> vomiting<symptom> and decreased the number of vomiting episodes. No complications were encountered in either group. Conclusion SPG injection with lidocaine at the end of surgery is a safe , noninvasive , and an effective technique in reducing early PONV in endoscopic sinus surgery patients.
