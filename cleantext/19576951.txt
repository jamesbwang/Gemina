  Sex differences in body fat distribution and menopause-associated shifts in regional adiposity suggest that sex hormones play an important role in regulating the differentiation and distribution of adipocytes , but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explained. The aim of this study was to determine whether ovarian hormone status influences the production and distribution of adipocytes in adipose tissue arising from bone marrow-derived cells. Nine- to ten-week-old ovariectomized ( OVX) , surgery naïve ( WT) , and estrogen receptor alpha knockout ( αERKO) mice underwent bone<disease> marrow transplantation from luciferase or green fluorescent protein expressing donors. A subset of OVX animals had estradiol ( E
