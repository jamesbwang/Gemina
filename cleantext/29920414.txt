  Nanostructured gold thin films were built from deposition of colloidal gold nanoparticles on silanized glass slides , and used to study the adsorption of bovine serum albumin ( BSA) after chemical treatment of gold surface with the mercaptans 2-mercaptoethanol , 3-mercaptoproprionic acid , 1,3-propanedithiol and 1-propanethiol. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) spectroscopy was used for investigating the chemical interactions of BSA with the modified gold surfaces. In the presence of the surface modifier 2-mercaptoethanol , a promoter of hydrogen bonds , the stable interactions among BSA and gold surfaces led to high reproducibility of the SERS spectral pattern in the most monitored points of the mapped surface. The vibrational assignment endorsed the assumption that lysine residue , majority present in the molecular structure , were the principal anchor site of BSA involved in the interactions with 2-mercaptoethanol-modified gold surface.
