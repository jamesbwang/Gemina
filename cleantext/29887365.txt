  Integration of stem cell-derived neurons into the central nervous system ( CNS) remains a challenge. A co-culture system is developed to understand whether mouse embryonic stem cell ( ESC)- derived spiral ganglion neuron ( SGN)- like cells ( ESNs) synapse with native mouse cochlear nucleus ( CN) neurons. A Cre system is used to generate Cop-GFP ESCs , which are induced into ESNs expressing features similar to auditory SGNs. Neural connections are observed between ESNs and CN neurons 4-6 days after co-culturing , which is stimulated by thrombospondin-1 ( TSP1). Antagonist and loss-of-function small hairpin RNA studies indicate that the α2δ1 receptor is critical for TSP1-induced synaptogenesis effects. Newly generated synapse-like structures express pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Synaptic vesicle recycling , pair recording , and blocker electrophysiology suggest functional synaptic vesicles , transsynaptic activities , and formation of glutamatergic synapses. These results demonstrate the synaptogenesis capability of ESNs , which is important for pluripotent ESC-derived neurons to form functional synaptic connections to CNS neurons.
