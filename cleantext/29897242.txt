  Short Phe-rich oligopeptides , consisting of only four and five amino acids , worked as effective supramolecular hydrogelators for buffer solutions at low gelator concentrations ( 0.5-1.5 wt %). Among 10 different oligopeptides synthesized , peptide P1 ( Ac-Phe-Phe-Phe-Gly-Lys) showed high gelation ability. Transmission electron microscopy observations suggested that the peptide molecules self-assembled into nanofibrous networks , which turned into gels. The hydrogel of peptide P1 showed reversible thermal gel-sol transition and viscoelastic properties typical of a gel. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that peptide P1 formed a Î²-sheetlike structure , which decreased with increasing temperature. The self-assembly of peptide P1 occurred even in the presence of nutrients in culture media and common surfactants. Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and yeast successfully grew on the hydrogel. The hydrogel exhibited low cytotoxicity to animal cells. Finally , we demonstrated that functional compounds can be released from the hydrogel in different manners based on the interaction between the compounds and the hydrogel.
