  To compare the clinical outcomes of follicular versus luteal phase ovarian stimulation in women with poor ovarian response ( Bologna criteria) undergoing IVF. This retrospective study investigated 446 patients submitted to 507 cycles in three groups. First , the two larger cohorts were examined: 154 patients treated with luteal phase ovarian stimulation ( Group Lu); and 231 patients administered follicular phase ovarian stimulation ( Group Fo). Then the clinical outcomes of 61 patients submitted to double ovarian stimulation were analyzed. Clinical outcomes included number of retrieved oocytes , fertilization rate , cleavage rate , top-quality embryo rate , clinical pregnancy rate ( CPR) , and live birth rate ( LBR). Longer stimulation , higher dosages of HMG , and higher MII oocyte rates were achieved in Group Lu ( p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in CPR and LBR between the two groups offered frozen-thawed embryo transfer ( 28.4 % vs. 33.0 % , p = 0.484; 22.9 % vs. 25.5 % , p = 0.666). In the double ovarian stimulation group , the number of oocytes retrieved in the luteal phase stimulation protocol was higher ( p = 0.035) , although luteal phase stimulation yielded a lower rate of MII oocytes ( p = 0.031). CPR and LBR were not statistically different ( 13.8 % vs. 21.4 % , p = 0.525; 10.3 % vs. 14.3 % , p = 0.706). Luteal phase ovarian stimulation may be a promising protocol to treat women with POR , particularly for patients unable to yield enough viable embryos through follicular phase ovarian stimulation or other protocols.
