  Highly efficient proton exchange membrane electrolyzer in acidic media is of great importance for the hydrogen production from the electrochemical water splitting. Unfortunately , the electrochemical water splitting is limited by the slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics at anode. So far , the synthesis of active and stable electrocatalysts in acid media is still a challenging work. In the work , carbon nanobowls supported ultrafine iridium nanocrystals are synthesized by a simple complexation-reduction method with assistance of 1-hydroxyethane-1 , 1-diphosphonic acid , which effectively serves as as complexant , capping agent and surfactant during the synthesis. The good dispersion and ultrafine size of Ir nanocrystals , the modified interfacial property from phosphonate with excellent hydrophilicity , as well as carbon nanobowls as advanced carbon supports contribute to their excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in acid media. The as-prepared carbon nanobowls supported ultrafine iridium nanocrystals present an ultra-low overpotential of 290 mV to achieve the mass activity of 1000 A g
