  The aim of this study was to determine the face validity and the reliability of a pictorial scale to assess preschool children 's perceived movement skills. The pictorial scale examines the perceptions of the 12 fundamental movement skills presented in the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 ( six locomotor and six object control skills) and six active play skills ( e.g. cycling). A total of 91 Australian children aged four to five years from 14 preschools completed the scale on two occasions to determine test-retest reliability. Internal consistency was determined for all 18 items and for each subscale. After the second test , participants were asked open-ended questions to gain insight into their understanding of what was happening in the pictures to determine the face validity. Overall , children demonstrated a better understanding of object control and play skills compared to locomotor skills. Test-retest reliability values were good for object control ( intra-class correlation , ICC = 0.75) , locomotor ( ICC = 0.78) , active play skills ( ICC = 0.80) and all 18 skills combined ( ICC = 0.77). Internal consistency was acceptable for locomotor ( Test 1 0.64 , Test 2 0.75) , object control ( 0.71 , 0.76) , active play skills ( 0.76 , 0.74) and for all 18 skills combined ( 0.88 , 0.90). Overall , this instrument demonstrated an acceptable reliability in preschool children and has provided preliminary information for examining the perceptions of movement skills. This age group presents a key target area for occupational therapists , who can assist preschool children to further develop fundamental movement skills , integrate these skills in their roles and occupations and increase engagement in meaningful physical activity in the long term.
