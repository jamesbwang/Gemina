  We report a 76-year-old MS patient , treated with DMF for 3 years. Lymphocytes never showed values below 1240/µl. CSF analysis revealed 1,988,880 copies/ml of JCV-DNA , JCV-DNA was detectable in serum and anti-JCV-antibody in CSF and serum were highly positive. Stratify ®- JCV-test was positive. CD8-positive T-lymphocytes were reduced. Therapy with mefloquine , mirtazapine and cidofovir resulted in complete elimination of the virus in serum and 90 % reduction of viral load in CSF. This case shows that despite careful monitoring for lymphopenia JCV spreading to the CSF may occur during treatment with DMF.
