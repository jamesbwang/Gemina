  Flonicamid , a novel selective systemic pesticide , can effectively control a broad range of insect pests. However , the dissipation behaviors and the terminal residues of flonicamid and its metabolites in some crops and soils remain unclear. Herein , an easy , sensitive and reliable method using a modified QuEChERS extraction coupled with LC-MS/MS for the simultaneous analysis of flonicamid and its metabolites in cabbage and soil was developed. Based on this method , the dissipation behaviors of flonicamid and its metabolites as well as their persistence in cabbage and soil during harvest were investigated. Flonicamid degraded rapidly , and the half-lives of flonicamid only and total residues ( the sum of flonicamid and its metabolites) were 1.49-4.59 and 1.97-4.99 days in cabbage , and 2.12-7.97 and 2.04-7.62 days in soil , respectively. When 50 % flonicamid WG was sprayed once or twice at the recommended dose and 1.5-fold the recommended dose , the highest residues of total flonicamid in cabbage and soil from different pre-harvest intervals ( 3 , 7 and 14 days) were 0.070 and 0.054 mg kg
