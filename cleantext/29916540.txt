  Osteoclasts ( OCs) are resorptive cells responsible for bone erosion in diseases , including osteoporosis , periodontitis<disease> and rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 ( CysLTR1) antagonist clinically used for the treatment of asthma. In the present study , the role of CysLTR1 on OC formation and bone loss was investigated using montelukast. Montelukast inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB ligand ( RANKL) induced OC formation in cultures of mouse bone<disease> marrow macrophages. Additionally , montelukast suppressed actin ring formation and bone resorption activity of differentiated OCs. The inhibitory effect of montelukast was associated with impaired activation of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase , AKT serine/threonine kinase , and/or phospholipase Cγ2 signaling pathways downstream of RANK , followed by decreased expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1. Notably , OC formation was efficiently restored by addition of adenosine diphosphate , a P2Y12 agonist , as well as by addition of CysLT. Furthermore , similar to montelukast , P2Y12 blockade by a pharmacological inhibitor or siRNAs suppressed OC differentiation. These data indicate the involvement of the P2Y12 receptor in the inhibitory effect of montelukast on osteoclastogenesis. In vivo , montelukast significantly inhibited inflammation‑induced osteoclastogenesis in the calvarial model. Montelukast also served a protective role in a murine ovariectomy ( OVX) and unloading‑induced bone loss model. Altogether , these results confirmed that the CysLTR1 antagonist exerted an inhibitory effect on OC formation in vitro and in vivo. It may be useful for the treatment of bone diseases associated with excessive bone resorption.
