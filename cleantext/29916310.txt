  Women who have experienced intimate partner violence ( IPV) have significant detrimental physical and mental health consequences associated with the violence as well as numerous barriers to health-care and social service utilization. Service integration offers a solution to help support women who have experienced violence overcome negative health consequences as well as barriers to system navigation and use. The purpose of this scoping review was to examine research activity pertaining to IPV and primary health-care and women 's shelters integration. Namely , the aim was to determine the extent , range , and nature of research related to the effects of integrating primary health-care services and women 's shelters. Nineteen sources were identified as potentially relevant from four electronic databases , with four articles meeting the inclusion criteria of integration of primary health-care and women 's shelter services where outcomes were presented related to the efficacy of primary health-care received and integration. Numerical analysis revealed considerable homogeneity among articles in terms of methodological approaches , patient populations , and type of integration. Inductive thematic content analysis revealed three themes that resulted from integration: ( 1) increased access to and acceptability of services , ( 2) bridge back to health-care , and ( 3) decreasing future health-care burden. The findings from this scoping review represent a first attempt to summarize the literature , indicate a need for additional research , and suggest implications for practice.
