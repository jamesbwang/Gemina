  South Asian migrant populations have a high risk of non-communicable diseases , such as type 2 diabetes ( T2D). The aim of this study is to provide in-depth insight into key success factors and challenges in developing culturally adapted lifestyle interventions to prevent T2D within South Asian migrant populations. The study has a qualitative research design. In-depth interviews , using a semi-structured interview guide , were conducted with eight researchers and project leaders from five studies of culturally adapted lifestyle interventions for South Asian migrant populations. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Four main themes emerged as key factors for success: ` approaching the community in the right way ' , ` the intervention as a space for social relations ' , ` support from public authorities ' and ` being reflexive and flexible '. Two themes emerged as challenges: ` struggling with time ' and ` overemphasising cultural differences '. Our findings augment existing research by establishing the importance of cooperation at the organisational and institutional levels , of fostering the creation of social networks through interventions and of acknowledging the multiplicity of identities and resources among individuals of the same ethnic origin.
