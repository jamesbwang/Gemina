  Occupancy models are widely used in camera trap studies to analyze species presence , abundance , and geographic distribution , among other important ecological quantities. These models account for imperfect detection using a latent variable to distinguish between true presence/absence and observed detection of a species. Under certain experimental setups , parameter estimation in a latent variable framework can be challenging. Several studies have issued guidelines on the number of independent replicated observations ( surveys) needed for each unchanging occupancy field ( season) to ensure reliable estimation. In this paper we present a spatio-temporal occupancy model , and show through a simulation study that it can be fit to data obtained from a single survey per season , so long as the number of seasons is sufficiently large. We include an application using camera-trap data on the Thomson 's gazelle in the Serengeti in Tanzania This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
