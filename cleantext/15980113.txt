  Skeletal muscle maintains posture<symptom> and enables movement by converting chemical energy into mechanical energy , further contributing to basal energy metabolism. Thyroid hormones ( thyroxine , or T4 , and triiodothyronine , or T3) participate in contractile function , metabolic processes , myogenesis and regeneration of skeletal muscle. T3 classically modulates gene expression after binding to thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. Thyroid hormone effects depend on nuclear receptor occupancy , which is directly related to intracellular T3 levels. Sarcolemmal thyroid hormone levels are regulated by their transport across the plasma membrane by specific transporters , as well as by the action of deiodinases types 2 and 3 , which can activate or inactivate T4 and T3. Thyroid hormone level oscillations have been associated with the worsening of many myopathies such as myasthenia gravis , Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) and rhabdomyolysis. During aging skeletal muscle show a decrease in mass and quality , known as sarcopenia. There is increasing evidence that thyroid hormones could have a role in the sarcopenic process. Therefore , in this review , we aim to discuss the main effects of thyroid hormones in skeletal muscular aging processes and myopathy-related pathologies.
