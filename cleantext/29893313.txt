  This study aimed to compare the surgical outcome and ovarian reserve in premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy ( without oophorectomy) for benign cause between two methods of with and without prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy. In a prospective randomized clinical trial , 62 premenopausal women with benign indication underwent a laparoscopic hysterectomy. Patients were then randomized to undergo hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy ( Group 1; n = 15) or without bilateral salpingectomy ( Group 2; n = 15). We evaluated the impact of bilateral salpingectomy on surgical outcome and ovarian reserve using serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) that were measured preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively ( P < 0.001). Baseline characteristics such as age , uterine size , body mass index , and preoperative AMH and FSH levels were similar between the two study groups. The average operative time , estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , uterine size , uterine weight , and intraoperative complication were similar between two groups. The mean AMH levels were not significantly different at baseline ( 1.44 ng/mL vs. 1.2 ng/mL) and at 3-month postoperatively ( 1.13 ng/mL vs. 0.97 ng/mL) among women with salpingectomy versus no salpingectomy. At 3-month follow-up , in both groups , postoperative AMH levels were significantly lower and FSH levels were significantly higher than before surgery. Prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy neither has a negative effect on ovarian reserve nor increases the surgical risk. Therefore , we may recommend gynecologic surgeons to perform prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy during laparoscopic hysterectomy to conserve both ovaries.
