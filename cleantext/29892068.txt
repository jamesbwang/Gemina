  Detyrosinated microtubules provide mechanical resistance that can impede the motion of contracting cardiomyocytes. However , the functional effects of microtubule detyrosination in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or in human hearts have not previously been studied. Here , we utilize mass spectrometry and single-myocyte mechanical assays to characterize changes to the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and their functional consequences in human heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Proteomic analysis of left ventricle tissue reveals a consistent upregulation and stabilization of intermediate filaments and microtubules in failing human hearts. As revealed by super-resolution imaging , failing cardiomyocytes are characterized by a dense , heavily detyrosinated microtubule network , which is associated with increased myocyte stiffness and impaired contractility. Pharmacological suppression of detyrosinated microtubules lowers the viscoelasticity of failing myocytes and restores 40-50 % of lost contractile function; reduction of microtubule detyrosination using a genetic approach also softens cardiomyocytes and improves contractile kinetics. Together , these data demonstrate that a modified cytoskeletal network impedes contractile function in cardiomyocytes from failing human hearts and that targeting detyrosinated microtubules could represent a new inotropic strategy for improving cardiac function.
