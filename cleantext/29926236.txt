  Clinicopathologic factors relating to developing metachronous colorectal cancer ( CRC) have been reported. However , the effects of different diagnostic intervals on these risk factors required further analysis. This retrospective study comprised 14,481 patients diagnosed from January 1995 to December 2012. Metachronous CRC was defined as the occurrence of a second colorectal cancer at least 1 year post-operatively. A total of 153 ( 1.06 %) patients developed metachronous CRCs during the follow-up. Significantly higher rates of developing metachronous cancer occurred in male patients ( 1.2 vs 0.9 %) , patients with synchronous CRC ( 2.0 vs 1.0 %) , and patients with a positive family history of CRC ( 1.4 vs 0.9 %). Pertaining to diagnostic intervals related to clinicopathological features , more severe staging was significant in the diagnostic interval between 2 and 3 years ( 35 vs 7.7 % , 20.6 % , 17.5 % , P = .01) compared with other intervals. Male patients were more frequently detected to have CRC within 3 years compared with females ( 53.1 vs 29.1 % , P = .005). For a diagnostic interval ≧ 5 years , a significantly higher rate of metachronous CRC located at the right colon was observed than that located at the left colon ( 36.6 vs 19.7 % , p = 0.03). We evinced that a diagnostic interval between 2 and 3 years was a key time for metachronous CRC diagnosis with worse staging distribution. Based on current findings , we recommend the stratification of metachronous CRCs into diagnostic intervals of 1-2 , 2-3 , and ≧ 3 years , as they exhibit significantly different characteristics.
