  Despite the reputation of Canada 's healthcare system as being accessible to all Canadians , certain populations continue to face inequities within our healthcare system. In addition to promoting fairness , addressing healthcare inequities has the potential to reduce healthcare costs , which is increasingly important as healthcare costs continue to rise. Intentionally or otherwise , physicians are often leaders in healthcare teams , but there is a paucity of literature on physicians ' perceptions of the problem of healthcare inequities and their potential role in addressing inequities. In this pilot study , we use a grounded theory approach to explore contextual factors and mechanisms that associate with an individual physician 's involvement ( or otherwise) in initiatives to reduce healthcare inequity. Using purposeful sampling and a set of a priori questions , we interviewed ten physicians- five of whom self-identified as being actively involved and five not actively involved in addressing healthcare inequities- to explore potential reasons for physicians choosing to address the causes of healthcare inequities. We identified contextual barriers ( e.g. , lack of knowledge and time) and facilitators ( prior experience , protected time , mentorship and system supports) that we interpreted as interacting with the underlying mechanism ( motivation to address inequities) to influence a physician 's decision on whether or not to address healthcare inequities. Based upon our findings we propose further studies to understand and/or overcome barriers to physicians being involved in addressing healthcare inequities.
