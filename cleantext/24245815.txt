  Rhodamine group of molecules are widely used dyes for imaging of biological molecules. Application of these dyes however includes a limitation that these molecules absorb in the visible range of the spectrum , which does not fall in the ` biologically transparent window ' ( BTW). Two photon absorption ( TPA) process could come up with an alternate solution to this as these dyes could be excited in the near infrared ( NIR) window to extract similar information. To validate this we have investigated TPA cross section ( TPACS , Ïƒ
