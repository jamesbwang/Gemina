  Haploidentical stem cell transplantation with T cell-replete grafts and post-transplant cyclophosphamide ( PTCy) is increasingly used with encouraging outcome. Natural killer ( NK) cell alloreactivity , predicted by missing killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR) ligands in the recipient that are present in their donor improves outcome of T cell-depleted haploidentical transplants. We explored the role of KIR ligand mismatching in 444 acute leukemia<disease> patients after T cell-replete transplants with PTCy. Thirty-seven percent of all patients had KIR ligand mismatching. Patients were in first remission ( CR1) ( 39 %) , second remission ( CR2) ( 26 %) , or active disease ( 35 %). Stem cell source was peripheral blood ( PBSC , 46 %) or bone<disease> marrow ( 54 %). The 2-year relapse , non-relapse mortality ( NRM) , and survival rates were 36.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 31.4-40.7) , 23.9 % ( 20.0-28.0) , and 45.9 % ( 40.8-51.0) , respectively. Multivariate analysis identified acute myeloid leukemia<disease> compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.55 , P = 0.002) , female gender ( HR 0.72 , P = 0.04) , and good performance status ( HR 0.71 , P = 0.04) as factors associated with better survival , while advanced age ( HR 1.13 , P = 0.04) , active disease ( HR 3.38 , P < 0.0001) , and KIR ligand mismatching ( HR 1.41 , P = 0.03) as associated with worse survival. KIR ligand mismatching was associated with a trend for higher relapse but not with graft-versus-host disease or NRM. The KIR ligand-mismatching effect was more prominent in patients given PBSC. In conclusion , there is no evidence that KIR ligand mismatching results in better outcome in the PTCy setting.
