  From1995 ( Beijing Conference -RRB- the World Health Organization strongly did call the attention on the need of great attention to women health and on the lack of studies on the differences in medicine between men and women. From the women health attention we arrived to gender medicine that is a transversal dimension of medicine which describes the differences within the same disease of symptoms , clinical evolution , drug therapy as well as prevention between men and women. From some real life examples in this article we wish to make it clear that gender medicine is not a separated medical specialty but a dimension which pass through all specialties. Thus we should speak about gender-specific medicine since all medical specialties have to do a medical training on the basis of gender differences. Lastly it is underlined also the need of a social approach to gender health in order to pick up all social weight factors that influence diseases in the two genders.
