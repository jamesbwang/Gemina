  In vitro fertilization ( IVF) has been linked to an increased risk for imprinting disorders in offspring. The data so far have predominantly been retrospective , comparing the rate of IVF conceptions in affected patients with controls. We describe a series of fetuses with omphalocele that were tested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome<disease> ( BWS) and subsequently ascertained as to whether pregnancies were conceived by assisted reproductive technologies ( ART). Fetuses were tested for BWS by Southern blot , PCR based methods , and methylation analysis to identify the imprinting status at primarily the IC2 locus , KCNQ1OT1 , as well as IC1 , H19/IGF -2. Some fetuses were also tested for uniparental disomy of chromosome 11p. We tested 301 fetuses with omphalocele for BWS. Forty samples were positive. Sixteen were from IVF pregnancies , for an overall rate of 40 %. Such as high proportion of IVF pregnancies in a series of BWS-positive fetuses has not been described previously. Possible factors such as twinning and ascertainment bias are discussed. We found about a 20-fold overrepresentation of IVF cases in fetuses with BWS/omphalocele when compared with the rate of ART pregnancies in the USA ( p < .0001). Our series provides support for an association of IVF and BWS. Patients should be counseled about these risks and made aware of the availability of prenatal diagnosis for detection.
