  Brain metastases ( BM) from adult soft tissue or bone sarcomas<disease> are rare , and sparse data exist on their prognostic factors and management. A retrospective study was conducted in 15 centers of the French Sarcoma Group , plus one Canadian and one Swiss center , to report on clinical , histological , and treatment characteristics and to identify predictive factors of outcome. Between 1992 and 2012 , 246 patients with a median age of 50 years ( range: 16-86) were managed for BM. BM included 221 cerebral and cerebellar metastases and 40 cases of meningeal sarcomatosis. The most frequent histopathological subtype was leiomyosarcoma ( 18.7 %). Histological grade was high in 118 ( 48 %) cases. Surgery of BM was carried out for 38 ( 15.5 %) patients. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered in 168 ( 68.3 %) and 91 ( 37.0 %) patients , respectively. Irrespective of treatment modality , BM were controlled in 113 patients ( 45.9 %) , including 31 partial responses ( 12.6 %) and 18 complete responses ( 7.3 %). The median overall survival from diagnosis of brain metastasis was 2.7 months ( range: 0-133). In the multivariate analysis , the following parameters influenced overall survival: chemotherapy ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.38; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.26-0.48) , surgery ( HR = 0.40; 95 % CI: 0.22-0.72) , stereotactic radiotherapy ( HR = 0.41; 95 % CI: 0.19-0.90) , whole-brain radiotherapy ( HR = 0.51; 95 % CI: 0.35-0.76) , and grade ( HR = 0.65; 95 % CI: 0.43-0.98). BM of sarcomas<disease> are rare and associated with a dismal outcome. Multidisciplinary management with chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and surgery is associated with a better survival.
