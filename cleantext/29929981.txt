  Host cell infection with HIV-1 requires fusion of viral and cell membranes<symptom>. Sifuvirtide ( SFT) is a peptide-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitor approved for phase III clinical trials in China. Here , we focused on characterizing HIV-1 variants highly resistant to SFT to gain insight into the molecular resistance mechanism. Three primary substitutions ( V38A , A47I , and Q52R) located at the inhibitor-binding site of HIV-1 's envelope protein ( Env) and one secondary substitution ( N126K) located at the C-terminal heptad repeat region of the viral protein gp41 , which is part of the envelope , conferred high SFT resistance and cross-resistance to the anti-HIV-1 drug T20 and the template peptide C34. Interestingly , SFT 's resistance profile could be dramatically improved with an M-T hook structure-modified SFT ( MTSFT) and with short-peptide inhibitors that mainly target the gp41 pocket ( 2P23 and its lipid derivative LP-19). We found that the V38A and Q52R substitutions reduce the binding stabilities of SFT , C34 , and MTSFT , but they had no effect on the binding of 2P23 and LP-19; in sharp contrast , the A47I substitution enhanced fusion inhibitor binding. Furthermore , the primary resistance substitutions impaired Env-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry and changed the conformation of the gp41 core structure. Importantly , whereas the V38A and Q52R substitutions disrupted the N-terminal helix of gp41 , a single A47I substitution greatly enhanced its thermostability. Taken together , our results provide crucial structural insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 resistance to gp41-dependent fusion inhibitors , which may inform the development of additional anti-HIV drugs.
