  A complex network of functions and symbiotic interactions between a eukaryotic host and its microbiome is a the foundation of the ecological unit holobiont. However , little is known about how the non-fungal eukaryotic microorganisms fit in this complex network of host-microbiome interactions. In this study , we employed a unique wild blueberry ecosystem to evaluate plant-associated microbiota , encompassing both eukaryotic and bacterial communities. We found that , while soil microbiome serves as a foundation for root microbiome , plant-influenced species sorting had stronger effect on eukaryotes than on bacteria. Our study identified several fungal and protist taxa , which are correlated with decreased fruit production in wild blueberry agricultural ecosystems. The specific effect of species sorting in root microbiome resulted in an increase in relative abundance of fungi<pathogen> adapted to plant-associated life-style , while the relative abundance of non-fungal eukaryotes was decreased along the soil-endosphere continuum in the root , probably because of low adaptation of these microorganisms to host-plant defense responses. Analysis of community correlation networks indicated that bacterial and eukaryotic interactions became more complex along the soil-endosphere continuum and , in addition to extensive mutualistic interactions , co-exclusion also played an important role in shaping wild blueberry associated microbiome. Our study identified several potential hub taxa with important roles in soil fertility and/or plant-microbe interaction , suggesting the key role of these taxa in the interconnection between soils and plant health and overall microbial community structure. This study also provides a comprehensive view of the role of non-fungal eukaryotes in soil ecosystem.
