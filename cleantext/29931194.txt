  The enantioseparation of three fluoroquinoline antibacterial drugs , namely , flumequine , ofloxacin and lomefloxacin using high-performance liquid chromatography was optimized on seven polysaccharide-derived chiral stationary phases , namely , Chiralpak ® IB , chiralpak ® IA , Chiralpak ® AD , Chiralcel ® OJ , Chiralcel ® OD , Chiralcel ® OD-H and Chiralcel ® OZ-3 and applying different mobile phases in isocratic mode is described. The role of addition of organic additives was also investigated. A baseline separation of flumequine , ofloxacin and lomefloxacin enantiomers was achieved. Parameters influencing enantioseparation including mobile phase , organic additive and chemical nature of the chiral selector found to be highly influencing on the enantiomeric separation were investigated. Chiral recognition mechanism ( s) are also presented.
