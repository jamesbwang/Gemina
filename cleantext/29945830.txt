  To determine the incidence of illness , and identify the relationship between sleep , training load and illness in nationally competitive Australian football athletes. Second , to assess multivariate effect between training load and/or sleep variables. Cohort study. Retrospective analyses of prospectively collected cohort data were conducted on forty-four male athletes over a 46-week season. The primary outcome was illness incidence , recorded daily by medical doctors. Independent variables were acute , chronic and acute: chronic ratios of: sleep quality , sleep quantity , internal training load and external training load defined as: total running distance , high speed running distance and sprint distance. Generalised estimating equations using Poisson ( count) models were fit to examine both univariate and multivariate associations between independent variables and illness incidence. 67 incidences of illness were recorded , with an incidence rate of 11 illnesses per 1000 running hours. Univariate analysis showed acute and chronic sleep hours and quality , as well as acute sprint and total running distance to be significantly associated with illness. Multivariate analysis identified that only acute sleep quantity was significantly , negatively associated with illness incidence ( OR 0.49 , CI 0.25-0.94) once all univariate significant variables were controlled for. There was no relationship between external training load and illness when sleep metrics were controlled for. In a cohort of Australian football athletes , whose load was well monitored , reduced sleep quantity was associated with increased incidence of illness within the next 7 days. Monitoring sleep parameters may assist in identifying individuals at risk of illness.
