  Physician-assisted suicide is one of the features with very different legal solutions in the world. In Serbia , physician-assisted suicide is a crime , within a crime of the assisted suicide. The possibility of the legislation of the voluntary active euthanasia may open the door to the decriminalization of the physician-assisted suicide. Data were obtained from the Clinical Hospital Center in Kragujevac , Republic of Serbia collected during 2015. The research included 88 physicians: 57 male physicians ( representing 64.77 % of the sample) and 31 female physicians ( 35.23 % of the sample). Due to the nature , subject , and hypothesis of the research , the authors used descriptive method and the method of the theoretical content analysis. We have raised numerous questions. A slight majority of the physicians ( 58 %) believes that physician-assisted suicide should be legalized , while 42 % is for another solution. 90.9 % took a viewpoint that it is completely unacceptable legalization of the physician-assisted suicide for all age groups , while the remaining 9.1 % is to such legislative move. From the other side , 40.7 % of respondents would prescribe a lethal dose of the medicament to the patient , who is in the terminal stage of the incurable disease , but , 59.3 % would not do it. Interesting is that 13.8 % of the physician had a patient who asked for the information how to commit suicide , and 12.5 % gave them such information. Physicians in Serbia are divided on this issue.
