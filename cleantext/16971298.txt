  The average lifespan of people with human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV)<pathogen> has increased because of the enhanced access to anti-retroviral treatment. This increased longevity has led to a heightened focus on the comorbidities which may arise , allowing a clearer understanding of the contextual , personal , psychological and functional problems and their interrelations. Disability ( functional limitations) and insufficient nutritional intake may interact cyclically with HIV<pathogen> and/or acquired immunodeficiency<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> ( AIDS); however , no research to date has investigated this interaction. Aims: The objective of this article was to report on the nutritional outcomes using albumin and body mass index outcomes as a subset of a larger study among adults living with HIV<pathogen> and/or AIDS. Setting: This study was conducted at a large HIV<pathogen> clinic based in an urban area in Johannesburg , South Africa , which provides HIV<pathogen> treatment and support to over 6000 persons with HIV<pathogen> and TB. This clinic is part of a large public health regional hospital where extensive HIV<pathogen> research is undertaken. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional observational study. The sample composed of 278 participants between 18 and 65 years of age and had been on highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART) for more than six months. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: The results indicated that albumin level had significant inverse associations with functional limitations and physical health symptoms. Women were significantly more likely to have lower nutritional levels. A logistic regression analysis suggested that gender and physical health symptoms were the primary predictors of albumin levels. Conclusion: The findings presented in this article can be applied to HIV<pathogen> and/or AIDS treatment programmes , such as HAART. It re-emphasises the importance of providing individuals on anti-retroviral therapy with affordable and adequate nutrition , education on the importance of nutritional intake and the benefits of potentially adopting supplement programmes. As females seem to be more adversely affected by low nutritional levels , with the findings showing an increased likelihood of developing physical health symptoms , focus also needs to be given to cultural or social factors that impact nutritional intake in women.
