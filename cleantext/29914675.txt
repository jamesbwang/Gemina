  Effective disease management of wildlife relies on the strategic application of ante-mortem diagnostic tests for early identification and removal of M. bovis-infected animals. To improve diagnostic performance , interferon-gamma release assays ( IGRAs) are often used in conjunction with the tuberculin skin test ( TST). Since buffaloes are major maintenance hosts of M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> , optimal application of bovine TB diagnostic tests are especially important. We aimed to determine whether the timing of blood collection relative to the TST has an influence on IFN-γ production and diagnostic outcome in African buffaloes. Release of IFN-γ in response to bovine purified protein derivative ( PPD) , avian PPD and PC-HP
