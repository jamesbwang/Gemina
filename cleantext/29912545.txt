  As the importance of anisotropic nanostructures and the role of surfaces continues to rise in applications including catalysis , magneto-optics , and electromagnetic interference shielding , there is a need for efficient and economical synthesis routes for such nanostructures. The article describes the application of cycled microwave power for the rapid synthesis of highly branched pure-phase face-centered cubic crystalline nickel multipod nanostructures with > 99 % multipod population. By controlling the power delivery to the reaction mixture through cycling , superior control is achieved over the growth kinetics of the metallic nanostructures , allowing formation of multipods consisting of arms with different aspect ratios. The multipod structures are formed under ambient conditions in a simple reaction system composed of nickel acetylacetonate ( Ni ( acac)
