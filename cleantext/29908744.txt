  The Marano and Grado Lagoon is well known for being contaminated by mercury ( Hg) from the Idrija mine ( Slovenia) and the decommissioned chlor-alkali plant of Torviscosa ( Italy). Experimental activities were conducted in a local fish farm to understand Hg cycling at the sediment-water interface. Both diffusive and benthic fluxes were estimated in terms of chemical and physical features. Mercury concentration in sediments ( up to 6.81 Î¼g/g) showed a slight variability with depth , whereas the highest methylmercury ( MeHg) values ( up to 10ng/g) were detected in the first centimetres. MeHg seems to be produced and stored in the 2-3cm below the sediment-water interface , where sulphate reducing bacteria activity occurs and hypoxic-anoxic conditions become persistent for days. DMeHg in porewaters varied seasonally ( from 0.1 and 17 % of dissolved Hg ( DHg)) with the highest concentrations in summer. DHg diffusive effluxes higher ( up to 444ng/m
