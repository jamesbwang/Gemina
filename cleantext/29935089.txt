  Up to 80 % of patients with diabetes mellitus develop lower urinary tract complications , most commonly diabetic bladder dysfunction ( DBD). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes on the function of the inner bladder lining ( urothelium). Bladder compliance and intraluminal release of urothelial mediators , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) and acetylcholine ( ACh) in response to distension were investigated in whole bladders isolated from 2- and 12-week streptozotocin ( STZ)- diabetic rats. Intact and urothelium-denuded bladder strips were used to assess the influence of the urothelium on bladder contractility. Intraluminal ATP release was significantly enhanced at 2 weeks of diabetes , although not at 12 weeks. In contrast , intraluminal ACh release was unaltered by diabetes. Bladder compliance was also significantly enhanced at both 2 and 12 weeks of diabetes , with greatly reduced intravesical pressures in response to distension. Nerve-evoked contractions of bladder strips were significantly greater at 2 weeks of diabetes. When the urothelium was absent , nerve-evoked contractions were reduced , but contractions remained significantly elevated at lower frequencies of stimulation ( < 5 Hz) in diabetics. Interestingly , although relaxations of bladder strips to isoprenaline were unaltered by diabetes , removal of the urothelium unmasked significantly enhanced relaxations in strips from 2- and 12-week diabetic animals. In conclusion , diabetes alters urothelial function. Enhanced urothelial ATP release may be involved in the hypercontractility observed at early time points of diabetes. These alterations are time-dependent and may contribute to the mechanisms at play during the development of diabetic bladder dysfunction.
