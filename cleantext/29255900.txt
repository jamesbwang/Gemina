  Primary headache<symptom> disorders , such as migraine and cluster headache<symptom> , are common and often debilitating. When preventive therapy is needed , several oral medications are used. Patients tend to have poor adherence and persistence on their preventive therapy. The introduction of treatments blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) is anticipated to begin a new era in migraine preventive treatment. In addition , non-triptan serotonin receptor agonists , newer delivery systems for older therapies , and innovative devices represent other exciting advances in acute and preventive migraine and cluster treatment and shall also be discussed in this review.
