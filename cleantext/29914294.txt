  OBJECTIVE The opioid crisis is identified as a national emergency and epidemic in the United States. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with opioid dependence in patients undergoing surgery for degenerative spondylolisthesis ( DS). METHODS The authors queried MarketScan databases to investigate the factors affecting postsurgery opioid use in patients with DS between 2000 and 2012. The outcome of interest was opioid dependence , which was defined as continued opioid use , > 10 opioid prescriptions , or diagnosis of or prescription for opioid dependence disorder in the period of 1 year before or 3-15 months after the procedure. Comparisons of outcomes were performed using nonparametric 2-group tests and generalized regression models. RESULTS A cohort of 10,708 patients was identified from the database. The median patient age was 61 years ( interquartile range 54-69 years) , and 65.1 % were female ( n = 6975). A majority of patients had decompression with fusion ( n = 10,068; 94 %) and underwent multilevel procedures ( n = 8123; 75.9 %). Of 10,708 patients , 14.85 % ( n = 1591) were identified as having opioid dependence within 12 months prior to the index surgical procedure and 9.90 % ( n = 1060) were identified as having opioid dependence within 3-15 months after the procedure. Of all the variables , prior opioid dependence ( OR 16.29 , 95 % CI 14.10-18.81 , p < 0.001) and younger age ( 1-year increase in age: OR 0.972 , 95 % CI 0.963-0.980 , p < 0.001) were independent predictors of opioid dependence following surgery for DS. The use of fusion was not associated with opioid dependence following the procedure ( p = 0.8396). Following surgery for DS , patients were more likely to become opioid independent than they were to become opioid dependent ( 8.54 % vs 3.58 % , p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients underwent fusion for DS. Surgical decompression with fusion was not associated with increased risk of postsurgery opioid dependence in patients with DS. Overall , opioid dependence was reduced by 4.96 % after surgery for DS. Prior opioid dependence is associated with increased risk and increasing age is associated with decreased risk of opioid dependence following surgery for DS.
