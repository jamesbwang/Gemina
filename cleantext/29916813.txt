  Colloidal silicon ( Si) nanocrystals ( NCs) with different sizes were successfully prepared by femtosecond laser ablation under different laser ablation time ( LAT). The mean size decreases from 4.23 to 1.42 nm by increasing the LAT from 30 to 120 min. In combination with structural characterization , temperature-dependent photoluminescence ( PL) , time-resolved PL and PL excitation spectra , we attribute room-temperature blue emissions peaked at 405 and 430 nm to the radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs via the oxygen-deficient centers related to Si-C-H
