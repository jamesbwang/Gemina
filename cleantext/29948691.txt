  Arsenic ( As) accumulation in agricultural soils is prone to crop uptake , posing risk to human health. Passivation shows potential to inactivate soil labile As and lower crop As uptake but often contributes little to improving the microbiota in As-contaminated soils. Here , the combined addition of ferrihydrite and Trichoderma<pathogen> asperellum SM-12F1 as a potential future application for remediation of As-contaminated soil was studied via pot experiments. The results indicated that , compared with the control treatment , the combined addition of ferrihydrite and T. asperellum SM-12F1 significantly increased water spinach shoot and root biomass by 134 and 138 % , respectively , and lowered As content in shoot and root by 37 and 34 % , respectively. Soil available As decreased by 40 % after the combined addition. The variances in soil pH and As fractionation and speciation were responsible for the changes in soil As availability. Importantly , the combined addition greatly increased the total phospholipid fatty acids ( PLFAs) and gram-positive ( G +) , gram-negative ( G-) , actinobacterial , bacterial , fungal PLFAs by 114 , 68 , 276 , 292 , 133 , and 626 % , respectively , compared with the control treatment. Correspondingly , the soil enzyme activities closely associated with carbon , nitrogen , and phosphorus mineralization and antioxidant activity were improved. The combination of ferrihydrite and T. asperellum SM-12F1 in soils did not reduce their independent effects.
