  The subject of pre-earthquake ionospheric signatures has always been contentious and debatable. Some of the previous reports have documented unforeseen and unusual variations in some of the atmospheric and ionospheric parameters well before an earthquake. Here , we analyze the ionospheric response from the Indian Subcontinent to Nepal Gorkha Earthquakes occurred between April and May 2015 , which were the most powerful and disastrous natural calamities in past ~ 80 years over the Himalayan region left ~ 9000 causalities and more than ~ 20000 people injured with the property damage of the order of several billion dollars. In view of severe earthquakes occurrences , their prior information on the shorter time scales are warranted for mitigation of associated disasters. Here , we report for the first time , a case which shows a strong link in anomalous variations between VLF sub-ionospheric signal and mesospheric ozone prior to both April 25 , 2015 ( M
