  Dendritic cells ( DCs) are key antigen-presenting cells that control the induction of both tolerance and immunity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating DCs commitment toward a regulatory- or effector-inducing profile is critical for better designing prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Initially identified in dexamethasone-treated thymocytes , the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper ( GILZ) protein has emerged as a critical factor mediating most , but not all , glucocorticoids effects in both non-immune and immune cells. This intracellular protein exerts pleiotropic effects through interactions with transcription factors and signaling proteins , thus modulating signal transduction and gene expression. GILZ has been reported to control the proliferation , survival , and differentiation of lymphocytes , while its expression confers anti-inflammatory phenotype to monocytes and macrophages. In the past twelve years , a growing set of data has also established that GILZ expression in DCs is a molecular switch controlling their T-cell-priming capacity. Here , after a brief presentation of GILZ isoforms and functions , we summarize current knowledge regarding GILZ expression and regulation in DCs , in both health and disease. We further present the functional consequences of GILZ expression on DCs capacity to prime effector or regulatory T-cell responses and highlight recent findings pointing to a broader role of GILZ in the fine tuning of antigen capture , processing , and presentation by DCs. Finally , we discuss future prospects regarding the possible roles for GILZ in the control of DCs function in the steady state and in the context of infections and chronic pathologies.
