  Lateral subluxation of the vertebra is commonly seen in degenerative lumbar scoliosis. Transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery is an emerging technique in spine surgery , but has never been described as a treatment option for lumbar radiculopathy in the setting of lateral lumbar spondylolisthesis. A technique for the endoscopic treatment of a lumbar disc herniation in the setting of a lateral spondylolisthesis is presented. We retrospectively reviewed 199 cases of patients who underwent transforaminal endoscopic surgery in a 3 year period with a minimum follow up of 1 year. A preliminary series of 4 patients with an average age of 74.8 years ( from 69-82 years old) who underwent transforaminal endoscopic discectomy procedures for disc herniations at the level of their lateral subluxation between 2014 and 2017 is presented. One patient whose lateral subluxation was above an instrumented fusion required an extension of her fusion to the operated level 5 months after her endoscopic surgery for a reherniation. For the other 3 patients , the mean visual analog scale score for radicular pain improved from an average pain score before surgery of 8.3 to 3.0 one year after surgery and the Oswestry disability index improved from 26.7 to 4.7. Transforminal endoscopic surgery for a lumbar disc herniation in the setting of lateral subluxation of the vertebral bodies is presented as a unique minimally invasive approach for the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy that might be considered as an alternative treatment to deformity correction surgery in the older patient population.
