  To set up ELISA for detection of atrazine with high precision. The reaction condition of indirect-ELISA was optimized , including atrazine-ovalbumin ( AT-OVA) concentration and primary antibody concentration , organic solvent , goat anti-rat immunoglobin G-horseradish peroxidase ( IgG-HRP) concentration. The actual samples were detected by the ELISA method established in our laboratory. Then the ELISA method was compared with the HPLC. The specification curve of indirect-ELISA was set up after optimization. The relation coefficient R The ELISA to detect atrazine has good specificity and high precision. And it can be applied in testing real atrazine samples replacing of the large-scale instrument.
