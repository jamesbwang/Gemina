  Myocardial uptake of bone tracers has emerged as useful tool for the early detection of transthyretin amyloidosis ( ATTR). The prevalence of wild-type ATTR ( ATTRwt) in individuals remains to be established. All whole body bone scans performed in individuals ≥ 75 years with no previous clinical suspicion of ATTR were revised in a population-based university hospital over a 7-year period ( 1509 studies corresponding to 1114 patients; 80.5 ± 4.1 years , 65 % males). Positive cardiac uptake was defined according to Perugini score as grade 2 or 3. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) hospitalizations during the follow-up were obtained from regional administrative databases. Thirty-one patients ≥ 75 years ( 2.78 %) showed cardiac uptake; compared with those without uptake , these patients were older ( 85 ± 5 vs. 80 ± 4 , p < 0.001) and predominantly males ( 90 % vs. 64 % , p = 0.005). The prevalence of cardiac uptake was 3.88 % in males and 0.77 % in females , and increased with age , reaching 13.9 % in males ≥ 85 years ( 2.7 % among females). The estimated prevalence for the European standard population ≥ 75 years was 4.15 % in males , 1.03 % in females and 2.59 % in the general population. HF hospitalizations rates were 14 % in patients without uptake and 29 % in those with cardiac uptake ( p = 0.034). After adjusting for age and gender , cardiac uptake was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization ( OR 2.60 , 95 % CI 1.09-5.74 , p = 0.022). Myocardial uptake in bone scan is very prevalent with ageing , mainly affects males and is associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization. These findings reinforce ATTRwt as a relevant cause of HF in the elderly.
