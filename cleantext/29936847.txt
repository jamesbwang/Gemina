  Surface functionalization of polymeric porous substrates is one of the most important requirements to enhance their applications in the biomedical field. In this study , we achieved photoinduced surface modification using a highly efficient reaction of hydrophilic polymers bearing phosphorylcholine groups. Polymers composed of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine ( MPC) units and 2- ( N-ethylanilino) ethyl methacrylate units were synthesized with attention to the polymer architectures. The surface modification of the porous polyethylene ( PE) substrates was carried out by the coating of the MPC polymers with a photochemical radical generator , followed by photoirradiation for a few minutes. Surface analysis by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the MPC polymer layer was generated on the PE surface. Cross-sectional confocal microscopy images showed that the MPC polymers were coated on the polymer surface , even inside the porous structure of the PE substrate. After modification , the porous PE substrates showed a significant increase in hydrophilicity and the water-penetration rate through the pores. Furthermore , the amount of protein adsorbed on the PE substrate was reduced significantly by the surface modification. These functionalities were dependent on the MPC polymer architectures. Thus , we concluded that the photoreactive polymer system developed furnished the porous substrates with antifouling properties.
