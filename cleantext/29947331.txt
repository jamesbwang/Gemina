  Topological states of matter are at the root of some of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics. Here we argue that skyrmions in the pseudo-spin space related to an emerging SU ( 2) symmetry enlighten many mysterious properties of the pseudogap phase in under-doped cuprates. We detail the role of the SU ( 2) symmetry in controlling the phase diagram of the cuprates , in particular how a cascade of phase transitions explains the arising of the pseudogap , superconducting and charge modulation phases seen at low temperature. We specify the structure of the charge modulations inside the vortex core below T
