  With the advent of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery , numerous image features can be utilized. Applying a reasonable feature selection approach is critical to effectively reduce feature redundancy and improve the efficiency and accuracy of classification. This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach , in which ReliefF , genetic algorithm , and support vector machine ( RFGASVM) are integrated to extract buildings. We adopt the ReliefF algorithm to preliminary filter high-dimensional features in the feature database. After eliminating the sorted features , the feature subset and the C and & gamma; parameters of support vector machine ( SVM) are encoded into the chromosome of the genetic algorithm. A fitness function is constructed considering the sample identification accuracy , the number of selected features , and the feature cost. The proposed method was applied to high-resolution images obtained from different sensors , GF-2 , BJ-2 , and unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV). The confusion<symptom> matrix , precision , recall and F1-score were applied to assess the accuracy. The results showed that the proposed method achieved feature reduction , and the overall accuracy ( OA) was more than 85 % , with Kappa coefficient values of 0.80 , 0.83 and 0.85 , respectively. The precision of each image was more than 85 %. The time efficiency of the proposed method was two-fold greater than SVM with all the features. The RFGASVM method has the advantages of large feature reduction and high extraction performance and can be applied in feature selection.
