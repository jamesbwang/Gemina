  A modified lossless nonlinear Noguchi transmission network with second-neighbor interactions is considered. In the semidiscrete limit , we apply the reductive perturbation method and show that the dynamics of modulated waves propagating through the network are governed by an NLS equation with linear external potential. Classes of exact solitonic solutions of this network equation are derived , proving possible transmission of both bright and dark solitonlike pulses through the network. The effects of both the coupling second-neighbor parameter L _ ( 3) and the strength Î» of the linear potential on the dynamics of modulated waves through the network are investigated. One of the main results of our work is that with the introduction of the second neighbors in the network , two solitary signals , either two bright solitary signals or one bright and one dark solitary signal , may simultaneously propagate at the same frequency through the network.
