  The incidence of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) infections has been escalating in tropical and subtropical countries , but there are still no effective therapeutic options. In the present study , a DENV-1-specific human monoclonal antibody ( HMAb) , 1G5 , isolated from single plasma cells obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of dengue patients was found to have potent neutralization activity against serotype 1 DENV<pathogen> ( DENV-1). Its neutralization activity against DENV-2 was not as strong , and it was almost absent for DENV-3 and DENV-4. The results showed that HMAb 1G5 only binds to the envelop protein of intact DENV-1 or the envelop protein under unheated and non-reducing conditions , and that it does not bind to recombinant envelope protein. This could mean that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope of the envelope protein. Further , the findings showed that HMAb 1G5 potently neutralizes DENV-1 in both the pre- and post-attachment phases of the virus at low concentrations.
