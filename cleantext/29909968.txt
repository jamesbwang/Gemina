  Post-ingestive signals conveying information about the nutritive properties of food are critical for regulating ingestive behavior. Here , using an auction task concomitant to fMRI scanning , we demonstrate that participants are willing to pay more for fat + carbohydrate compared with equally familiar , liked , and caloric fat or carbohydrate foods and that this potentiated reward is associated with response in areas critical for reward valuation , including the dorsal striatum<pathogen> and mediodorsal thalamus. We also show that individuals are better able to estimate the energy density of fat compared with carbohydrate and fat + carbohydrate foods , an effect associated with functional connectivity between visual ( fusiform gyrus) and valuation ( ventromedial prefrontal cortex) areas. These results provide the first demonstration that foods high in fat and carbohydrate are , calorie for calorie , valued more than foods containing only fat or carbohydrate and that this effect is associated with greater recruitment of central reward circuits.
