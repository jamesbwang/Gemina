  We study the effect of hindered aggregation on the island<disease> formation processes for a one-dimensional model of epitaxial growth with arbitrary nucleus size i. In the proposed model , the attachment of monomers to islands is hindered by an aggregation barrier , ε _ ( a) , which decreases the hopping rate of monomers to the islands. As ε _ ( a) increases , the system exhibits a crossover between two different regimes; namely , from diffusion-limited aggregation to attachment-limited aggregation. The island<disease> size distribution , P ( s) , is calculated for different values of ε _ ( a) by a self-consistent approach involving the nucleation and aggregation capture kernels. The results given by the analytical model are compared with those from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations , finding a close agreement between both sets of data for all considered values of i and ε _ ( a). As the aggregation barrier increases , the spatial effect of fluctuations on the density of monomers can be neglected and P ( s) smoothly approximates to the limit distribution P ( s) = δ _ ( s , i +1). In the crossover regime the system features a complex and rich behavior , which can be explained in terms of the characteristic timescales of different microscopic processes.
