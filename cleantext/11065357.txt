  The development of vaccines and evaluation of novel treatment strategies for invasive group A streptococcal ( iGAS) disease requires suitable models of human<disease> infection<disease> that can be monitored longitudinally and are preferably non-invasive. Bio-photonic imaging provides an opportunity to reduce use of animals in infection modelling and refine the information that can be obtained , however the range of bioluminescent GAS strains available is limited. In this study we set out to develop bioluminescent iGAS strains for use in in vivo pneumonia<disease> and soft tissue disease models. Using clinical emm1 , emm3 , and emm89 GAS strains that were transformed with constructs carrying the luxABCDE operon , growth and bioluminescence of transformed strains were characterised in vitro and in vivo. Emm3 and emm89 strains expressed detectable bioluminescence when transformed with a replicating plasmid and light production correlated with viable bacterial counts in vitro , however plasmid instability precluded use in the absence of antimicrobial pressure. Emm89 GAS transformed with an integrating construct demonstrated stable bioluminescence that was maintained in the absence of antibiotics. Bioluminescence of the emm89 strain correlated with viable bacterial counts both in vitro and immediately following infection in vivo. Although bioluminescence conferred a detectable fitness burden to the emm89 strain during soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> in vivo , it did not prevent dissemination to distant tissues. Development of stably bioluminescent GAS for use in vitro and in vivo models of infection should facilitate development of novel therapeutics and vaccines while also increasing our understanding of infection progression and transmission routes.
