  The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of imipenem plus amikacin or polymyxin B against six carbapenem-resistant P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> by time-kill assay. Synergism was observed in two isolates for combinations with amikacin. For combinations with polymyxin B , synergism and antagonism also occurred in two isolates.
