  Mobile health applications ( apps) have the potential to help individuals with chronic illnesses learn about , monitor , and manage their condition , but these apps are largely unexamined , with the state and direction of development unclear. We performed a systematic review of publicly available apps , directed toward individuals with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA); described their current features; and determined areas of unmet need. We searched the iTunes and Google Play App Stores for the term `` arthritis<disease> '' and reviewed the descriptions of these apps for specific mentions of RA. Applications that met inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed. Using a set of quality measures identified from literature review , we assessed each app for 4 features: basic characteristics , content source , functionality , and security. Frequencies for each feature were recorded , and percentages were calculated. Twenty apps intended for use by RA patients were identified in December 2016. Fifty percent of apps ( n = 10) offered only symptom tracking. Five ( 20 %) provided only information about RA , and 5 ( 20 %) engaged patients by providing both symptom tracking and educational information. Fewer than 50 % of apps provided means to contact health care providers or link to an online community , and only 6 ( 30 %) offered security protection for the user. Most current RA apps do not provide a comprehensive experience for individuals with RA. Areas for optimization include the implementation of smartphone accessibility features and secure methods of protecting individual health information.
