  More than 100 years after Grigg 's influential analysis of species ' borders , the causes of limits to species ' ranges still represent a puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become especially important recently as many scientists have become interested in the potential for species ' ranges to shift in response to climate change-and yet nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just two measurable parameters: ( i) the fitness cost of dispersal-a measure of environmental heterogeneity-and ( ii) the strength of genetic drift , which reduces genetic diversity. Together , these two parameters define an ` expansion threshold ': adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to a heterogeneous environment. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold locally , a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold throughout the species ' range , adaptation collapses everywhere , resulting in either extinction or formation of a fragmented metapopulation. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally with dimension , the second parameter-the strength of genetic drift-is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In two-dimensional habitats , genetic drift becomes effectively independent of selection. It decreases with ` neighbourhood size '- the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover , in contrast to earlier predictions , which neglected evolution of genetic variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions , dispersal into small marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides a novel , theoretically justified , and testable prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the species ' range.
