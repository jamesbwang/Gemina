  The drug pirfenidone has been shown to slow the progression and decrease mortality of idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). Its exact mechanism is unknown , but it likely inhibits pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta , a known contributor to wound healing. We evaluated whether patients taking pirfenidone until lung transplantation had increased risk of impaired wound<disease> healing post-transplant. This information could determine whether pirfenidone should be discontinued prior to listing to allow for a wash-out period. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent lung transplantation for pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> at Norton Thoracic Institute in Phoenix , Arizona , from January 2014 to December 2015. We describe 18 patients who took pirfenidone up to a month before transplant. Aside from one patient who experienced sternal dehiscence due to a surgical issue , all remaining patients did well with no evidence of airway dehiscence. Each of these 17 patients had been on pirfenidone for at least 30 days; nine patients had been on pirfenidone for over 90 days. Baseline characteristics including age , sex , body mass index , renal function , liver function , glucose level , pre-transplant corticosteroid use , and post-transplant immunosuppressant therapy were similar. In our experience , pirfenidone may be safely continued until lung transplantation. Only one patient in our series experienced impaired wound<disease> healing related to a surgical issue , even when pirfenidone was continued until lung transplantation. We found no evidence of impaired wound<disease> healing or airway complications after lung transplantation in patients who were treated with pirfenidone before lung transplantation.
