  The authors sought to examine outcomes and identify independent predictors of mortality among patients undergoing urgent/emergent transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR). Data on urgent/emergent TAVR as a rescue therapy for decompensated severe aortic stenosis ( AS) are limited. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy ( STS/ACC TVT) Registry linked with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claims was used to identify patients who underwent urgent/emergent versus elective TAVR between November 2011 and June 2016. Outcomes assessed were device success rate , in-hospital major adverse events , and 30-day and 1-year mortality. Independent predictors of mortality after urgent/emergent TAVR were examined. Of 40,042 patients who underwent TAVR , 3,952 ( 9.9 %) were urgent/emergent ( median STS PROM score 11.8 ( interquartile range: 7.6 to 17.9)). Device success rate was statistically lower , but not clinically different after urgent/emergent versus elective TAVR ( 92.6 % vs. 93.7 %; p = 0.007). Rates of major and/or life-threatening bleeding , major vascular complications , myocardial infarction , stroke , new permanent pacemaker placement , conversion to SAVR , and paravalvular regurgitation were similar between the 2 groups. Compared with elective TAVR , patients undergoing urgent/emergent TAVR had higher rates of acute kidney injury and/or new dialysis ( 8.2 % vs. 4.2 %; p < 0.001) , 30-day mortality ( 8.7 % vs. 4.3 % , adjusted hazard ratio: 1.28 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.48) , and 1-year mortality ( 29.1 % vs. 17.5 % , adjusted hazard ratio: 1.20 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.31). In patients undergoing urgent/emergent TAVR , non-femoral access and cardiopulmonary bypass were associated with increased risk , whereas use of balloon-expandable valve was associated with decreased risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality. Urgent/emergent TAVR is feasible with acceptable outcomes and may be a reasonable option in a selected group of patients with severe AS.
