  Based on the new syntrophic methanogenesis route via direct interspecies electron transfer ( DIET) , a novel bioaugmentation method by adding exoelectrogenic Geobacter species to accelerate methanogenesis was developed in this study. Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA , type exoelectrogenic strain of Geobacter species was chosen for the research. To clarify the effect of G. sulfurreducens on methanogenesis , batch tests of CH
