  Viruses<pathogen> are the most abundant component of the human microbiota. Recent evidence has uncovered a rich diversity of viruses within the female bladder , including both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of the bladder microbiome of 30 women: 10 asymptomatic ` healthy ' women and 20 women with an overactive bladder. These metagenomes include sequences representative of human , bacterial and viral DNA. This analysis , however , focused specifically on viral sequences. Using the bioinformatic tool virMine , we discovered sequence fragments , as well as complete genomes , of bacteriophages and the eukaryotic virus JC polyomavirus<pathogen>. The method employed here is a critical proof of concept: the genomes of viral populations within the low-biomass bladder microbiota can be reconstructed through whole-genome sequencing of the entire microbial community.
