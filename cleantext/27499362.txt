  BACKGROUND Using regional homogeneity ( ReHo) blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR ( BOLD-fMRI) , we investigated the structural and functional alterations of brain regions among patients with methamphetamine-associated psychosis ( MAP). MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 17 MAP patients , 16 schizophrenia ( SCZ) patients , and 18 healthy controls. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the clinical assessment , the severity of clinical symptoms was evaluated prior to the fMRI scanning , and then images were acquired and preprocessed after each participant received 6-min fRMI scanning. The participants all underwent BOLD-fMRI scanning. Voxel-based morphometry was used to measure gray matter density ( GMD). Resting-state fMRI ( rs-fMRI) was conducted to analyze functional MR , ReHo , and functional connectivity ( FC). RESULTS GMD analysis results suggest that MAP patients , SCZ patients , and healthy volunteers show different GMDs within different brain regions. Similarly , the ReHo analysis results suggest that MAP patients , SCZ patients , and healthy volunteers have different GMDs within different brain regions. Negative correlations were found between ReHo- and the PANSS-positive scores within the left orbital interior frontal gyrus ( L-orb-IFG) of MAP patients. ReHo- and PANSS-negative scores of R-SFG were negatively correlated among SCZ patients. The abnormal FC of R-MFG showed a negative correlation with the PANSS score among MAP patients. CONCLUSIONS The abnormalities in brain structure and FC were associated with the development of MAP.
