  Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several plant species. Here we identified , with a high level of confidence , 208 imprinted gene candidates from rice ( Oryza sativa). Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association to the transposable elements , which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis thaliana. Generally , imprinting in rice is conserved within a species , but intraspecific variation was also detected. The imprinted rice genes do not show signatures of selection , which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on genomic imprinting. Though conservation of imprinting in plants is limited , we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover , our results suggest that different types of epigenetic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nt small RNAs and their neighboring genes tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nt small RNAs and their neighboring genes. Together , our findings suggest that regulation of imprinting can be diverse , and genomic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.
