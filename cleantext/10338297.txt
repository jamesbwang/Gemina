  We elucidated the mechanisms underlying the kainate receptor ( KAR)- mediated facilitatory modulation of synaptic transmission in the cerebellum. In cerebellar slices , KA ( 3 Î¼M) increased the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( eEPSCs) at synapses between axon terminals of parallel fibers ( PF) and Purkinje neurons. KA-mediated facilitation was antagonized by NBQX under condition where AMPA receptors were previously antagonized. Inhibition of protein kinase A ( PKA) suppressed the effect of KA on glutamate release , which was also obviated by the prior stimulation of adenylyl cyclase ( AC). KAR-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission was prevented by blocking Ca
