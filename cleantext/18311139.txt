  World population has been continuously increasing and progressively aging. Aging is characterized by a complex and intraindividual process associated with nine major cellular and molecular hallmarks , namely , genomic instability , telomere attrition , epigenetic alterations , a loss of proteostasis , deregulated nutrient sensing , mitochondrial dysfunction , cellular senescence , stem cell exhaustion<symptom> , and altered intercellular communication. This review exposes the positive antiaging impact of physical exercise at the cellular level , highlighting its specific role in attenuating the aging effects of each hallmark. Exercise should be seen as a polypill , which improves the health-related quality of life and functional capabilities while mitigating physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> and comorbidities associated with aging. To achieve a framework of effective physical exercise interventions on aging , further research on its benefits and the most effective strategies is encouraged.
