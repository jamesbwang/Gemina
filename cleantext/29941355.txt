  Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis remains the most common type of secondary osteoporosis , mostly due to use of oral glucocorticoids rather than due to endogenous overproduction of cortisol. Partly because glucocorticoids are prescribed by a wide variety of clinicians for many different inflammatory disorders , only a minority of older individuals have adequate and timely assessment of their enhanced fracture risk , and fewer are offered treatment. Assessment should include bone density , the FRAX calculation , and , in many cases , images of the spine. Glucocorticoids decrease osteoblast function and increase apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes , leading to increased fracture risk soon after starting glucocorticoids. Guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment , but there are differences in extant guidelines , and methods to improve adherence to the guidelines have mostly failed. A strong case can be made to use anabolic drugs first in high-risk patients based on pathophysiology and head-to-head clinical trials.
