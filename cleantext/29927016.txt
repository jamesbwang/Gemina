  The core of fear of cancer recurrence ( FCR)- a top concern of couples after successful breast cancer ( BC) treatment-is fear of death. Daily relationship processes may be instrumental in regulating FCR as triggers of existential distress are encountered. We tested the hypothesis that daily capitalization , the process of sharing good news ( capitalization attempts) to a partner perceived as responsive ( responsiveness) , buffers patient and spouse FCR as they confront the first mammogram post-diagnosis. Fifty-seven early-stage BC survivors and their spouses reported daily FCR , capitalization , and positivity of the disclosed event during a 3-week diary period beginning 2 weeks before the first annual mammogram post-diagnosis. Dyadic multilevel path models estimated within-person effects of patient and spouse capitalization on same-day FCR , controlling for event positivity. Before the mammogram , capitalization attempts were unrelated to FCR , but for patients , responsiveness was predictive of greater same-day FCR. After the mammogram , for both partners , attempts were predictive of greater same-day FCR , yet responsiveness was predictive of lower FCR. Findings were largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that capitalization buffers existential distress. However , results revealed novel insights about daily dyadic processes that may characterize within-person adaptation to existential threat. Potential explanations for the differential links between capitalization and FCR based on timing ( before versus after threat) and capitalization component ( attempts versus responsiveness) are discussed.
