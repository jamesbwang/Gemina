  A major barrier to the practice of evidence-based medicine is efficiently finding scientifically sound studies on a given clinical topic. To investigate a deep learning approach to retrieve scientifically sound treatment studies from the biomedical literature. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network using a noisy dataset of 403,216 PubMed citations with title and abstract as features. The deep learning model was compared with state-of-the-art search filters , such as PubMed 's Clinical Query Broad treatment filter , McMaster 's textword search strategy ( no Medical Subject Heading , MeSH , terms) , and Clinical Query Balanced treatment filter. A previously annotated dataset ( Clinical Hedges) was used as the gold standard. The deep learning model obtained significantly lower recall than the Clinical Queries Broad treatment filter ( 96.9 % vs 98.4 %; P < .001); and equivalent recall to McMaster 's textword search ( 96.9 % vs 97.1 %; P = .57) and Clinical Queries Balanced filter ( 96.9 % vs 97.0 %; P = .63). Deep learning obtained significantly higher precision than the Clinical Queries Broad filter ( 34.6 % vs 22.4 %; P < .001) and McMaster 's textword search ( 34.6 % vs 11.8 %; P < .001) , but was significantly lower than the Clinical Queries Balanced filter ( 34.6 % vs 40.9 %; P < .001). Deep learning performed well compared to state-of-the-art search filters , especially when citations were not indexed. Unlike previous machine learning approaches , the proposed deep learning model does not require feature engineering , or time-sensitive or proprietary features , such as MeSH terms and bibliometrics. Deep learning is a promising approach to identifying reports of scientifically rigorous clinical research. Further work is needed to optimize the deep learning model and to assess generalizability to other areas , such as diagnosis , etiology , and prognosis.
