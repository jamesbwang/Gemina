  Chronic exposure to morphine can produce tolerance , dependence and addiction , but the underlying neurobiological basis is still incompletely understood. c-Jun , as an important component of the activator protein-1 transcription factor , is supposed to take part in regulating gene expression in AC/cAMP/PKA signaling. MicroRNA ( miRNA) has emerged as a critical regulator of neuronal functions. Although a number of miRNAs have been reported to regulate the μ-opioid receptor expression , there has been no report about miRNAs to regulate chronic morphine-induced , naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot. Our results showed that chronic morphine pretreatment induced naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot in concentration- and time-dependent manners in HEK 293/μ cells. Chronic morphine pretreatment alone elevated both c-Jun protein and miR-139-5p expression levels , while dramatically artificial elevation of miR-139-5p inhibited c-Jun at the translational level. Furthermore , dramatically artificial upregulation of intracellular miR-139-5p limited chronic morphine-induced , naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot. These findings suggested that miR-139-5p was involved in regulating chronic morphine-induced , naloxone-precipitated cAMP overshoot in a negative feedback manner through its target c-Jun , which extends our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying morphine dependence and addiction.
