  Although the reasons behind the stigmatization of psychosis are manifold , poor mental health literacy among the general public is likely to be a major factor. In Hong Kong , the Early Psychosis Foundation ( EPISO) was established in 2007 to tackle this issue by providing educational and mental health promotional activities , among other aims and services. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based interventional programme , the School Tour , developed by EPISO. The School Tour differentiates itself from other interventional programmes by supplementing a traditional psychoeducational talk with 2 additional elements: an engaging drama performance and exercise demonstrations. Twelve secondary schools , with a total of 4520 students , participated in the study. Knowledge and attitudes towards psychosis were evaluated before and after the school programme. The School Tour was found to improve both students ' knowledge of psychosis ( P < .001) and their attitude ( P < .001) towards the illness. Its effectiveness in reducing the stigma towards psychosis validates the use of novel strategies like drama performances to engage adolescent students , and urges the government to support increased student participation in the programme by providing funding to the relevant organizations.
