  In this letter , making use of real gait force profiles of healthy and patient groups with Parkinson disease which have different disease severity in terms of Hoehn-Yahr stage , we calculate various heuristic complexity measures of the recurrence quantification analysis ( RQA). Using this technique , we are able to evince that entropy , determinism and average diagonal line length ( divergence) measures decrease ( increases) with increasing disease severity. We also explain these tendencies using a theoretical model ( based on the sine-circle map) , so that we clearly relate them to decreasing degree of irrationality of the system as a course of gait 's nature. This enables us to interpret the dynamics of normal/pathological gait and is expected to increase further applications of this technique on gait timings , gait force profiles and combinations of them with various physiological signals.
