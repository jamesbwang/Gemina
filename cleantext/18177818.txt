  The neuronal intermediate filament alpha-internexin ( α-internexin) is a cytoskeleton protein which is involved in the tumor initiation and progression. In this study , we examined the expression and prognosis value of α-internexin in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms ( GEP-NENs). α-internexin was detected with immunohistochemical staining in 286 tumor specimens from patients with GEP-NENs. Methylation status of α-internexin was evaluated by bisulfite genomic sequencing. We assessed the prognostic value of α-internexin and its correlation with relevant clinicalpathological characteristics. The reduced/loss of expression rate of α-internexin in GEP-NEN was 73.4 % ( 210/286) , while the positive expression rate was 26.6 % ( 76/286). The difference of α-internexin deficiency was not statistically significant between gastrointestinal NENs ( GI-NENs) and pancreatic NENs ( pNENs). However , we found significant difference of reduced/loss of α-internexin expression among different sites of GI-NENs ( χ The expression of α-internexin was highly heterougeneous in different sites of GEP-NENs. The reduced/loss of expression of α-internexin was closely related to tumors with aggressiveness and patient 's adverse prognosis. The hypermethylation of the regulatory region examined may be an important epigenetic regulation mechanism of α-internexin deficiency in subtype of GI-NENs.
