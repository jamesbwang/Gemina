  The present study investigates an algorithm for the calculation of 3D joint angles based on inertial measurement units ( IMUs) , omitting magnetometer data. Validity , test-retest reliability , and long-term stability are evaluated in reference to an optical motion capture ( OMC) system. Twenty-eight healthy subjects performed a 6 min walk test. Three-dimensional joint kinematics of the lower extremity was recorded simultaneously by means of seven IMUs and an OptiTrack OMC system. To evaluate the performance , the root mean squared error ( RMSE) , mean range of motion error ( ROME) , coefficient of multiple correlations ( CMC) , Bland-Altman ( BA) analysis , and intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) were calculated. For all joints , the RMSE was lower than 2.40 & deg; , and the ROME was lower than 1.60 & deg;. The CMC revealed good to excellent waveform similarity. Reliability was moderate to excellent with ICC values of 0.52 ⁻ 0.99 for all joints. Error measures did not increase over time. When considering soft tissue artefacts , RMSE and ROME increased by an average of 2.2 & deg; ± 1.5 & deg; and 2.9 & deg; ± 1.7 & deg;. This study revealed an excellent correspondence of a magnetometer-free IMU system with an OMC system when excluding soft tissue artefacts.
