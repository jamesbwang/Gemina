  The construction sector must advance in a more sustainable way and to achieve this goal , the application of global methodologies is needed. These methodologies should take into account all life stages of a building: planning , design , construction , use and demolition. The quantity and variety of the materials used in building construction condition the buildings ' environmental and energy impacts. Life Cycle Assessment offers a standardized framework to evaluate the environmental loads of a product , process or activity. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA) to select facilities in the construction sector , which minimize environmental and energy impacts. To facilitate the understanding of the proposed methodology , a comparative LCA is performed , to determine the type of thermal insulating material in a double sheet ceramic fa√ßade and its thickness , which allows reducing the environmental impacts associated to the enclosure. The three most used enclosure types used in the city of Malaga ( Spain) have been selected for this study. The results show the adequacy of the procedure used.
