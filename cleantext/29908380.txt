  The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical impact of extubation failure ( EF) in with good grade subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) , in which a good clinical course is usually expected. We reviewed the clinical data from 141 patients with SAH and i. initial Hunt & Hess grade 1-3 ii. induction of general anesthesia for intervention and iii. the presence of data about the functional outcome. Patients were divided into three groups: 1. Primary tracheotomized patients ( PT) , 2. Patients with successful extubation ( ES) and 3. Patients with EF ( reintubation within 48 h). EF occurred with a rate of 0.12. The leading cause of EF was respiratory insufficiency ( n = 7) , followed by impaired consciousness<symptom> ( n = 5). Multivariate logistic regression did not show any neurological predictor of EF. Patients with ES showed an excellent outcome after 6 months ( favorable outcome: 95.7 %) , whereas the outcome of EF and PT patients was significantly ( p < 0.05) poorer. The case fatality rate was non-significantly higher in the EF group ( 0.15 vs 0.03). Hospitalization was significantly reduced for patients with ES , while the occurrence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasms and vasospastic cerebral infarction was similar between Patients with EF , ES or PT. We showed that EF is a frequent condition in good grade SAH , but is not predictable using common neurological parameters. Regarding the functional outcome , we were able to show that the result of an extubation trial clearly delineates the patients in two distinct groups , in which ES predicts an excellent outcome.
