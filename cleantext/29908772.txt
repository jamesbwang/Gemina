  On July 25 , 1978 , the first human was born following extracorporeal fertilization , an event that opened up a new medical science: expanding our knowledge of and developing novel treatments for infertility<symptom> , radically changing the opportunities for families with inherited monogenic disorders , generating the new discipline of clinical embryology , and paving the way for studies into stem cell biology. In vitro fertilization ( IVF) , as it became known in its simplest form , went even further: it engaged the myriad of minds in human society. Not only were books written on the moral status of the human embryo , the ethics of IVF practice , and exercising governments on appropriate-which turned out to be disparate-regulation , it redefined family life! The prediction I made in 1985 that one day we may see five `` parents '' for one child became a reality quicker than we could have imagined at the time. The new medical science marched inexorably on in almost all countries of the world-a universal human plight at last had an opportunity for remedy: more than 10 million couples seeking a resolution to their infertility<symptom> became parents , men who had no option to have their own genetic child became genetic fathers , and ever-increasing monogenic conditions were not being passed on to the next generation. The future may well bring to bear the opportunity for in vitro-developed viable gametes to generate successful pregnancies , and other `` futuristic '' opportunities for IVF science. But its story began over a century ago with seeking an understanding on how an egg matures and how to achieve successful fertilization-a fundamental scientific inquiry. It took one man to go beyond that scientific endeavor , to take head on a society unprepared and unwilling to accept human fertilization in vitro and unempathetic to the plight of the infertile; one man to see what prospects lay ahead for humanity should IVF become a reality , and for that man to battle every step of the way for nearly 2 decades to achieve that dream.
