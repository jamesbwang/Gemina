  Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is a chronic , progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which inflammation<symptom> plays a key role in the induction , development , and progression. Most of the MS patients present with relapsing-remitting ( RR) form , characterized by flare-ups followed by periods of recovery. Many inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been proposed as backers in MS pathogenesis , and the balance<symptom> between these differing cytokines can regulate MS severity. Interferon ( IFN)- β , a current disease-modifying therapy for MS , has demonstrated beneficial effects in reducing disease severity in MS patients. However , its immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory actions in MS are not wholly understood. The aim of the study was to define , in clinically stable patients with RR-MS , the serum concentration of several cytokines , canonical or not , and their modulation by IFN-β therapy. Relapsing-remitting-MS patients were enrolled and diagnosed according to revised Mc Donald Diagnostic Criteria. A set of cytokines ( including non-canonical neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ACh) and adipokines) and B-cell differentiation molecules , as potential biomarkers , were evaluated in 30 non-treated RR-MS patients compared to 30 IFN-β-treated MS patients and 30 age , gender , and body mass index-matched healthy controls ( HC). Naïve MS patients showed significantly higher levels of interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-12/ IL-23p40 , IL-18 , high-mobility group box protein-1 , and IL-18 binding protein ( IL-18BP) than MS-treated patients ( Although more experimental evidence are required , we speculate that the efficacy of treatment of MS with IFN-β is mediated , at least in part , by its ability to work on several levels to slow down the disease progression. Proposed actions include the modulation of IL-1-inflammasome axis and modulation of ACh , B-cell activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand system , and several adipokines.
