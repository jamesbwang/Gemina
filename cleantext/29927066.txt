  Epidemiological data have provided evidence that psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs) can occur in the general population , not necessarily accompanied by the impairment and suffering observed in formal psychiatric diagnoses. According to the psychosis continuum hypothesis , PLEs would be subject to the same risk factors as frank psychosis. The aim of this review was to summarize observational studies that evaluated cannabis use as a risk factor for PLEs as determined by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences in non-clinical samples. The instrument composed of 3 dimensions-positive , negative and depressive-is a scale specifically designed to assess the occurrence , frequency and impact of PLEs in non-clinical population. We searched PubMed/Medline , Web of Science and PsycInfo electronic databases for indexed peer-reviewed studies published until September 2017. We initially identified 100 articles. The PRISMA model for systematic reviews was used and 19 full-text articles were analysed. In general , the findings suggested that the higher the cannabis use and the younger the participants , the higher the reports of PLEs , although associations were more consistent for the positive dimension. More attention should be paid to the understanding of the risk factors of PLEs in the general population , since these experiences are themselves a risk for psychotic disorders.
