  Epidemiologic evidence suggests that low-fat dairy consumption may lower risk of hypertension. Dairy products may be distinctly linked to health , because of differences in nutritional composition , but little is known about specific nutrients that contribute to the dairy-blood pressure ( BP) association , nor to underlying kidney function. We examined cross-sectional associations to BP of dairy product intakes , total and by type , from the INTERnational study on MAcro/micronutrients and blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> ( INTERMAP) including 2694 participants aged 40-59 years from the UK and the USA. Eight BP , four 24-h dietary recalls and two 24-h urine samples were collected during four visits. Linear regression models adjusted for lifestyle/dietary factors to estimate BP differences per 2SD higher intakes of total-and-individual-types of dairy were calculated. Multivariable linear regression coefficients were estimated and pooled. In contrast to total and whole-fat dairy , each 195 g/1000 kcal ( 2SD) greater low-fat dairy intake was associated with a lower SBP -2.31 mmHg and DBP -2.27 mmHg. Significant associations attenuated with adjustment for dietary phosphorus , calcium , and lactose , but strengthened with urinary calcium adjustment. Stratification by median albumin-creatinine ratio ( ACR; high ACR indicates impaired kidney function) showed strong associations between low-fat dairy and BP in participants with low ACR ( SBP: -3.66; DBP: -2.15 mmHg) , with no association in participants with high ACR. Low-fat dairy consumption was associated with lower BP , especially among participants with low ACR. Dairy-rich nutrients including phosphorus and calcium may have contributed to the beneficial associations with BP.
