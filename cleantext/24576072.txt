  BACKGROUND The role of miR-181a in the development of cardiac disease and in particular , myocardial fibrosis<disease> following myocardial infarction ( MI) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the role of miR-181a in myocardial fibrosis<disease> in a rat model of MI and the expression of TGF-β receptor III ( TβRIII). MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into an MI model group ( n = 30) and a control group with ( n = 10). The rat MI model involved ligating the left anterior descending ( LAD) coronary artery in the model group; the control group was treated with a sham operation. Cardiac function was assessed using cardiac ultrasound. Myocardial fibroblasts were extracted from the rat hearts and transfected with a miR-mimic or miR-inhibitor , and cell growth was measured using an MTT assay. The level of miR-181a expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) and Western blots. RESULTS miR-181a expression was significantly increased during the progression of MI ( P < 0.05). Over-expression of miR-181a was associated with increased deposition of extracellular matrix ( ECM) components , collagen I and fibronectin. This effect was reversed with the use of a miR-181a inhibitor ( P < 0.05). Upregulation of miR-181a suppressed the expression of TGF-β receptor III ( TβRIII) by binding with 3 '- UTR. CONCLUSIONS In this rat model of MI , the findings were that miR-181a had a role in the progression of myocardial fibrosis<disease>. The findings require further studies to determine whether miR-181a might provide a novel therapeutic target to limit myocardial fibrosis<disease> following MI.
