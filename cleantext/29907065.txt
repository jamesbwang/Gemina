  Non-polarizable force fields for hydrated ions not always accurately describe short-range ion-ion interactions , frequently leading to artificial ion clustering in bulk aqueous solutions. This can be avoided by adjusting the nonbonded anion-cation or cation-water Lennard-Jones parameters. This approach has been successfully applied to different systems , but the parameterization is demanding owing to the necessity of separate investigations of each ion pair. Alternatively , polarization effects may effectively be accounted for using the electronic continuum correction ( ECC) of Leontyev et al. ( J. Chem. Phys. 119 , 8024 ( 2003)) , which involves scaling the ionic charges with the inverse square-root of the water high-frequency dielectric permittivity. ECC has proven to perform well for monovalent salts as well as for divalent salts in water. Its performance , however , for multivalent salts with higher valency remains unexplored. The present work illustrates the applicability of the ECC model to trivalent K
