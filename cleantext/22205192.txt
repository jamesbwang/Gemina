  It is estimated that the total annual financial cost for pain management in the U.S. exceeds 100 billion dollars. However , when indirect costs are included , such as functional disability and reduction in working hours , the cost can reach more than 300 billion dollars. In chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients , the role of pharmacogenetics is determined by genetic effects on various pain types , as well as the genetic effect on drug safety and efficacy. In this review article , we discuss genetic polymorphisms present in different types of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , such as fibromyalgia , low back pain , migraine , painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia. Furthermore , we discuss the role of CYP450 enzymes involved in metabolism of drugs , which have been used for treatment of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( amitriptyline , duloxetine , opioids , etc.). We also discuss how pharmacogenetics can be applied towards improving drug efficacy , shortening the time required to achieve therapeutic outcomes , reducing risks of side effects , and reducing medical costs and reliance upon polypharmacy.
