  In this work , liquid-liquid systems are studied by means of coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations ( CG-MC) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics ( DPD). A methodology is proposed to reproduce liquid-liquid equilibrium ( LLE) and to provide variation of interfacial tension ( IFT) , as a function of the solute concentration. A key step is the parametrization method based on the use of the Flory-Huggins parameter between DPD beads to calculate solute/solvent interactions. Parameters are determined using a set of experimental compositional data of LLE , following four different approaches. These approaches are evaluated , and the results obtained are compared to analyze advantages/disadvantages of each one. These methodologies have been compared through their application on six systems: water/benzene/1 ,4-dioxane , water/chloroform/acetone , water/benzene/acetic acid , water/benzene/2-propanol , water/hexane/acetone , and water/hexane/2-propanol. CG-MC simulations in the Gibbs ( NVT) ensemble have been used to check the validity of parametrization approaches for LLE reproduction. Then , CG-MC simulations in the osmotic ( Î¼
