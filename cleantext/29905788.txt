  Data on outcomes in patients using the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator ( WCD) > 90 days are limited. We aimed to analyse the clinical course of patients with WCD use ≤ 90 days vs. WCD use > 90 days. We assessed arrhythmia events during WCD use , and ejection fraction ( EF) improvement/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) implantation at the end of WCD use in patients with WCD use ≤ 90 days vs. WCD use > 90 days enrolled in the WEARIT-II registry , further assessed by disease aetiology ( ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic vs. congenital/inherited heart disease). There were 981 ( 49 %) patients with WCD use > 90 days , and 1019 patients with WCD use ≤ 90 days ( median 120 vs. 55 days). There was a lower incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation ( VT/VF) events ( 11 vs. 50 events per 100 patient-years , P < 0.001) , WCD treated VT/VF events ( 1 vs. 8 events per 100 patient-years , P < 0.001) , and non-sustained VT events ( 21 vs. 51 events per 100 patient-years , P = 0.008) with WCD use > 90 vs. WCD use ≤ 90 days. Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy patients presented with similar rates of sustained VT/VF events during WCD use > 90 vs. ≤ 90 days ( 13.4 vs. 13.7 events per 100 patient-years , P = 0.314) , while most of these events terminated spontaneously. One-third of the patients with extended WCD use further improved their EF and they were not implanted with an ICD , with similar rates among ischaemic and non-ischaemic patients. In WEARIT-II , patients with extended WCD use > 90 days remain at risk for ventricular arrhythmia events. One-third of the patients with WCD use > 90 days further improved their EF , avoiding the need to consider ICD implantation.
