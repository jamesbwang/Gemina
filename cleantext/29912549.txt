  Two-dimensional ( 2D) materials , particularly black phosphorus ( bP) , have demonstrated themselves to be excellent candidates for high-performance infrared photodetectors and transistors. However , high-quality bP can be obtained only via mechanical exfoliation from high-temperature- and high-pressure-grown bulk crystals and degrades rapidly when exposed to ambient conditions. Here , we report solution-synthesized and air-stable quasi-2D tellurium ( Te) nanoflakes for short-wave infrared ( SWIR) photodetectors. We perform comprehensive optical characterization via polarization-resolved transmission and reflection measurements and report the absorbance and complex refractive index of Te crystals. It is found that this material is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 0.31 eV. From temperature-dependent electrical measurements , we confirm this band-gap value and find that 12 nm thick Te nanoflakes show high hole mobilities of 450 and 1430 cm
