  U.S. Hispanics , now the single largest minority group in the country , face unique mental health disparities. The current study utilizes Andersen 's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use to examine ethnic disparities in receiving a schizophrenia or mood disorder diagnosis at psychiatric hospital admission. Our retrospective cohort study examined electronic health record data at an academic safety-net psychiatric hospital for adult patients ( n = 5571) admitted between 2010 and 2013. Logistic regression with block-wise entry of predisposing , enabling and need variables was used to examine ethnic disparities in receiving a schizophrenia diagnosis at admission. The block of need factors was the strongest predictor of receiving a schizophrenia diagnosis compared to predisposing and enabling factors. Compared to non-Hispanic whites , Hispanics and African Americans had a greater likelihood of receiving a schizophrenia diagnosis at admission. Additionally , patients diagnosed with schizophrenia had elevated positive and negative symptoms and were more likely to be male , single/unmarried , homeless , high inpatient service utilizers , involuntarily hospitalized , and to exhibit functional impairment at psychiatric hospital admission. To address elevated positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia , functional impairment , social withdrawal , and high inpatient service utilization , promising psychosocial interventions should be adapted for racial and ethnic minority populations and utilized as an adjuvant to antipsychotic medication.
