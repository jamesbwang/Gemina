  In the United States , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is experienced by over 39.4 million adults , many of whom are treated with opioid pain medications. This research presents an interpretation of the experience of seeking pain relief for a group of people taking opioid pain medications whose pain is not adequately controlled. A concurrent embedded mixed-methods design was used , including a Heideggerian hermeneutic qualitative approach that focuses on the participants ' perceptions as a vehicle for understanding the phenomenon of seeking pain relief with descriptive quantitative data in a supporting role. Thirteen interviews and 15 surveys were analyzed , all of which met the following criteria: ( 1) self-reported chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( persistent pain lasting a minimum of six months) , ( 2) current use of prescription opioid medications , ( 3) pain not successfully controlled. The analysis revealed a paradox , which we describe as being lost/finding myself in the health care system. This paradox became the overarching pattern of experience that subsumed several dynamic , overlapping practices described in the patterns: ( 1) seeking relief as suffering; ( 2) being classified as an addict but not an addict; ( 3) living with pain as remembering; and ( 4) experiencing treatment modalities as fickle possibilities. Explication of and interpretive commentary on these patterns shift the focus from drug seeking to pain relief seeking behaviors in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> sufferers. Such a shift could change the manner in which providers work with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> sufferers to find appropriate treatment modalities.
