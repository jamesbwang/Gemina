  Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy that occurs in the young population. After osteosarcoma cells metastasize to the lung , prognosis is very poor owing to difficulties in early diagnosis and effective treatment. Recently , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) was reported to be a critical contributor to osteosarcoma metastasis. However , the detailed mechanism associated with CTGF-directed migration in bone neoplasms is still mostly unknown. Through the in vivo and in vitro examination of osteosarcoma cells , this study suggests that VCAM-1 up-regulation and increased osteosarcoma cell migration are involved in this process. Antagonizing αvβ3 integrin inhibited cell migration. Moreover , FAK , PI3K , Akt and NF-κB activation were also shown to be involved in CTGF-mediated osteosarcoma metastasis. Taken together , CTGF promotes VCAM-1 production and further induces osteosarcoma metastasis via the αvβ3 integrin/FAK/PI3K/ Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway , which could represent a promising clinical target to improve patient outcome.
