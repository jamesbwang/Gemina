  Transverse abdominal plane block ( TAP) is a new technique of regional block described to reduce postoperative pain in laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC). Recent reports describe an easy technique to deliver local anesthetic agent under laparoscopic guidance. This randomized control trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of additional laparoscopic-guided TAP block against the standard full thickness port site infiltration. 45 patients were randomized in to each arm after excluding emergency LC , conversions , ones with coagulopathy , pregnancy and allergy to local anesthetics. All cases were four ports LC. Interventions-Both groups received standard port site infiltration with 3-5 ml of 0.25 % bupivacaine. The test group received additional laparoscopic-guided TAP block with 20 ml of 0.25 % bupivacaine subcostally , between the anterior axillary and mid clavicular lines. As outcome measures the pain score , opioid requirement , episodes of nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> and time to mobilize was measured at 6 hourly intervals. The two groups were comparable in the age , gender , body mass index , indication for cholecystectomy difficulty index and surgery duration. The pain score at 6 h ( P = 0.043) and opioid requirement at 6 h ( P = 0.026) was higher in the TAP group. These were similar in subsequent assessments. Other secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups. Laparoscopic-guided transverses abdominis plane block using plain bupivacaine does not give an additional pain relief or other favorable outcomes. It can worsen the pain scores. Pre registration: The trial was registered in Sri Lanka clinical trial registry-SLCTR/2016/011 ( http://www.slctr.lk/trials/357).
