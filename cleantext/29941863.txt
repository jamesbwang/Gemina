  BACKGROUND The pre-procurement pancreas allocation suitability score ( P-PASS) was introduced to support clinical decision-making and ultimately expand the currently insufficient pancreas donor pool. The pancreas donor risk index ( PDRI) can be used at the time of organ offering to predict one-year graft survival. Thus , this study aimed to analyze the validity of the PDRI and P-PASS in a large German transplant center. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 2002 to 2015 , we performed 327 pancreas transplantations at our center. P-PASS and PDRI were calculated for 322 patients. To evaluate the pancreas graft survival , the patient cohort was divided into 2 P-PASS ( < 17 , n = 115 and ≥ 17 , n = 207) and 3 PDRI groups ( < 1 , n = 87; 1-1.5 , n = 133; and > 1.5 , n = 102). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed. We also examined differences regarding early pancreas graft failure for both scores using the chi-square test. RESULTS The PDRI was associated with pancreas graft survival in the univariate analysis ( p = 0.023). In the multivariate analysis , a PDRI > 1.5 was associated with significantly decreased graft survival ( hazard ratio = 1.792 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.10-2.90 , p = 0.018). The P-PASS showed no significant association ( p = 0.081) with pancreas graft survival in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. There were significantly more early pancreas graft losses in the P-PASS ≥ 17 group ( p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS Our results showed an association between P-PASS ≥ 17 and early pancreas graft failure. However , this does not apply to long-term pancreas graft survival; the PDRI proved to be a better tool for this , and PDRI values > 1.5 were associated with significantly worse outcomes after pancreas transplantation.
