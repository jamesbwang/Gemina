  Cameron lesions<symptom> are erosive-ulcerative alterations of gastric mucosa occurring in patients with large hiatal hernia , potentially causing gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anaemia. Diagnosis may be challenging , and not infrequently erosions are overlooked at endoscopy , so that repeated and unnecessary diagnostic procedures are performed , particularly in those patients with chronic anaemia. We described two peculiar cases of patients with iron deficiency anaemia in whom Cameron lesions<symptom> were either overlooked or misinterpreted. By reviewing data of 22publications reporting endoscopic and clinical data of 140patients , we noted a large prevalence of females ( 75 %). The most frequent presenting symptoms were anaemia ( 62 %) and overt gastrointestinal bleeding ( 36 %). Noteworthy , as many as 69 % of patients underwent one or more previous upper endoscopy before diagnosis of Cameron lesion<symptom> was achieved. Patients were mainly treated with proton pump inhibitor ( PPI) therapy and iron supplementation. Moreover , endoscopic haemostasis was performed in 10 % of case , blood transfusion was required in one third of cases , and a similar quote of patients underwent a surgical approach for hiatal hernia repair. The observation that as many as 60 % patients were already receiving standard PPI therapy when diagnosis was performed would suggest that either long-term treatment with adequate dose PPI or surgical approach for hiatal hernia repair is required. In conclusion , Cameron lesion<symptom> is still an overlooked diagnosis in patients with iron deficiency anaemia in whom a 5-9.2 % prevalence has been reported.
