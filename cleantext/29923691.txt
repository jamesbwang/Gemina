  Herpes<disease> virus<disease> hepatitis<disease> varies in presentation , ranging from asymptomatic to acute liver failure , in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Hepatitis<disease> caused by the Herpesviridae family is uncommon and usually results in mild disease. It is also often self-limiting , although in certain populations especially immunosuppressed patients , it can cause severe infections , leading to acute to fulminant hepatic failure. In addition , some isolated cases of fulminant disease in immunocompetent individuals have been reported. As the presentation is frequently non-specific , it is important to maintain a high level of suspicion for these viral etiologies and start empiric therapy with antiviral agents as soon as possible. Liver transplantation is the last resort. Mortality remains high in fulminant hepatic failure caused by Herpesviridae without liver transplantation. Here we review the literatures on hepatitis<disease> caused by three members of the Herpesviridae family , cytomegalovirus , Epstein-Barr virus and herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus to discuss the epidemiology , diagnostic methods , clinical features and current management , and also to determine which aspects need to be investigated in further detail. Herpesviridae-mediated acute liver failure is rare but is associated with a poor prognosis , even after early treatment.
