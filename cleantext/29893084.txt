  Bone mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) have been used worldwide to treat spinal cord injury , but their therapeutic mechanism is poorly understood. In this study , BMSCs were transplanted to aneurysm<disease> clip-injured rats to demonstrate their protective effect. We observed myelin sheaths through Luxol fast blue ( LFB) staining , osmic acid staining , TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). We performed Western blotting to analyze the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) and caspase 3. BMSCs were transplanted at 1 , 7 and 14 days after spinal cord injury. Hindlimb movement ( Basso , Beattie and Bresnahan; BBB) score , CNPase ( 2 ' , 3 '- cyclic-nucleotide 3 '- phosphodiesterase) , myelin basic protein ( MBP) and caspase 3 protein levels were detected. Immunofluorescence was used to test the differentiation of BMSCs after implanted into damaged spinal cord and co-expression of CNPase-caspase 3 +. At 7 days after BMSCs transplantation , some injected BMSCs expressed neuronal and oligodendrocyte markers. And both locomotor skills and ultra-structural features of myelin sheaths were significantly improved. The expressions of BDNF were clearly increased by BMSCs transplantation , the expression of caspase 3 was the opposite. Compared with the 1 and 14 days transplantation after spinal cord injury , MBP and CNPase expressions were highest , caspase 3 expression was lowest in 7 days BMSCs transplantation. After BMSCs transplantation , CNPase-caspase 3 + cells scattered in the white matter of the spinal cord. Therefore , BMSCs had a tendency to differentiate into neurons and oligodendrocytes after transplantation , which could promote the secretion of BDNF. BMSCs protected neural myelin sheaths by inhibiting oligodendrocyte apoptosis via increased secretion of BDNF after SCI. The best therapeutic time was 7 days after spinal cord injury.
