  Outflow tract ( OFT) septation defects are a common cause of congenital heart disease. Numerous studies have focused on the septation mechanism of the OFT , but have reported inconsistent conclusions. This study , therefore , aimed to investigate the septation of the aortic sac and the OFT in the early embryonic human heart. Serial sections of 27 human embryonic hearts from Carnegie stage ( CS) 10 to CS19 were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA) and myosin heavy chain. At CS10-CS11 , the OFT wall was an exclusively myocardial structure that was continuous with the aortic sac at the margin of the pericardial cavity. From CS13 onward , the OFT was divided into nonmyocardial and myocardial portions. The cushion formed gradually , and its distal border with the OFT myocardium was consistently maintained. The aortic sac between the fourth and sixth aortic arch arteries was degenerated. At CS16 , the α-SMA-positive aortopulmonary septum formed and fused with the two OFT cushions , thus septating the nonmyocardial portion of the OFT into two arteries. At this stage , the cushions were not fused. At CS19 , the bilateral cushions were fused to septate the myocardial portion of the OFT. Data suggest that the OFT cushion is formed before the aortopulmonary septum is formed. Thus , the OFT cushion is not derived from the aortopulmonary septum. In addition , the nonmyocardial part of the OFT is septated into the aorta and pulmonary trunk by the aortopulmonary septum , while the main part of the cushion fuses and septates the myocardial portion of the OFT.
