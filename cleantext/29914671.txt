  Cement-augmentation is a well-established way to improve the stability of sacroiliac screw fixation in osteoporosis-associated fragility fractures of the posterior pelvic ring. However , to date little is known about the influence of different techniques of cement augmentation on construct stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the primary stability of cement-augmented sacroiliac screw fixation with cannulated versus perforated screws under cyclic loading. A total of eight fresh-frozen human cadaveric hemipelvis specimens with osteoporosis were used. After generating ventral osteotomies on both sides of the sacrum , each specimen was treated using a cement-augmented cannulated screw on one side and a cement-augmented perforated screw on the other side. Afterwards , axial cyclic loading was performed. No statistically significant difference was found between cannulated and perforated screws concerning maximum load ( 356.25 N versus 368.75 N , p = 0.749) , plastic deformation ( 1.95 mm versus 1.43 mm , p = 0.798) and stiffness ( 27.04 N/mm versus 40.40 N/mm , p = 0.645). Considering the at least equivalent results for perforated screws , cement augmentation via perforated screws might be an interesting option in clinical practice because of potential advantages , e.g. radiological control before cement application , reduced risk of cement displacement and time saving.
