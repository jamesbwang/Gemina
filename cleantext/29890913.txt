  To evaluate the association of interleukin 6 ( IL-6) levels with deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) and to assess the impact of IL-6 promoter polymorphisms ( -174 G > C , -572 G > C and -597 G > A) on its plasma levels and their influence in the development of DVT in India. One hundred DVT patients and 100 age and sex-matched healthy controls were study subjects. IL-6 polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. IL-6 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Significantly raised IL-6 levels were observed in patients as compared to controls. ( Patients: 13.73 ± 6.30 pg/ml , Controls: 11.83 ± 4.47 pg/ml , p = 0.014). The prevalence of C allele of -572 G > C polymorphism was significantly higher in patients than controls ( Patients: 39.5 % , Controls: 27.5 % , p = 0.011 , χ Our study emphasizes the importance of -572 G > C polymorphism in increasing IL-6 levels , thereby showing its significant role in DVT in India. IL-6 -174 G > C and -597 G > A were neither associated with raised plasma IL-6 levels nor with thrombotic risk. Thus -572 G > C polymorphism detection may be one of the connecting links between IL-6 and thrombotic risk in Indian DVT patients.
