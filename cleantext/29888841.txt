  Traits-based approaches in microbial ecology provide a valuable way to abstract organismal interaction with the environment and to generate hypotheses about community function. Using macromolecular rate theory ( MMRT) , we recently identified that temperature sensitivity can be characterized as a distinct microbial trait. As temperature is fundamental in controlling biological reactions , variation in temperature sensitivity across communities , organisms , and processes has the potential to vastly improve understanding of microbial response to climate change. These microbial temperature sensitivity traits include the heat capacity ( ΔCP ‡) , temperature optimum ( T
