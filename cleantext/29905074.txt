  Hematuria<symptom> is a common sign of many renal and urologic pathologic conditions and it may affect the proteomic analysis of urinary extracellular vesicles ( UEv) , nanovesicles released from all cells in contact with the urinary space. This condition hinders UEv based proteomic studies aiming to discover biomarkers. Therefore , we studied the effects of hematuria<symptom> on the proteome of UEv and introduced a possible solution to reduce its misleading impact. We mimicked hematuria<symptom> by adding increasing amount of blood<symptom> to nonaffected urine and investigated its effects on UEv isolation , purity , and proteomic composition. We proposed a trypsin treatment able to reduce the impact of hematuria<symptom> on UEv. The effects of the treatment were investigated by evaluating the UEv proteomic profile , the enrichment of known UEv markers , and by assessing differential protein content by MS-based label-free quantification. Results showed that as the blood contamination increased , it affected both the proteome profile and the yield of UEv isolated from urine. Our treatment with trypsin was able to counteract completely these effects for low/medium levels of hematuria<symptom> , which are most commonly encountered. This promising finding could lead to the reliable use of hematuria<symptom> samples for UEv proteomic investigation.
