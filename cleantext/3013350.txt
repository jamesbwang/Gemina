  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women , but the heterogeneity of the condition is a significant obstacle to effective treatment. Triple negative breast cancers ( TNBCs) do not express HER2 or the receptors for estrogen or progesterone , and so often have a poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating T cells have been well-characterized in TNBC , and increased numbers are associated with better outcomes; however , the potential roles of B cells and plasma cells have been large. Here , we conducted a retrospective correlative study on the expression of B cell/plasma cell-related genes , and the abundance and localization of B cells and plasma cells within TNBCs , and clinical outcome. We analyzed 269 TNBC samples and used immunohistochemistry to quantify tumor-infiltrating B cells and plasma cells , coupled with NanoString measurement of expression of immunoglobulin metagenes. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients bearing TNBCs with above-median densities of CD38
