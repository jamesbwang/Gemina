  Vascular malformations are abnormal connections between blood vessels that can have various endothelial characteristics. Although uncommon , these malformations can present challenging diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. The use of interventional radiology techniques in the management of various vascular malformations is an attractive option because of the ability to treat these malformations at the most appropriate anatomic location and in the most effective manner. Techniques such as coil embolization of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and liquid embolization of arteriovenous fistulae/malformations have shown tremendous potential as treatments for these challenging diseases.
