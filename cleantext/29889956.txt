  Military operations place injured Servicemembers at high risk for open wounds<disease> Austere environments and initial wound<disease> contamination increase the risk for infection. Wound<disease> infections<disease> continue to cause significant morbidity among injured Servicemembers. Limited evidence suggests that early antibiotic therapy for open wounds<disease> reduces infection rates. We obtained data from the Prehospital Trauma Registry ( PHTR) from January 2013 through September 2014. This database includes data from Tactical Combat Casualty Care ( TCCC) cards , Department of Defense 1380 forms , and after-action reports to provide near-real-time feedback to units on prehospital medical care. We evaluated whether patients with open wounds<disease> received antibiotics in accordance with TCCC guidelines. Low adherence was defined at less than 80 %. In this data set , overall , prefixed facility providers administered antibiotics to 54.0 % of patients with an open combat wound<disease>. Of the antibiotics given , 11.1 % were within TCCC guidelines. The relatively low administration and adherence rates persisted across subgroup analyses. Overall , relatively few patients with open combat wounds<disease> receive antibiotic administration as recommended by TCCC guidelines. In the group that received antibiotics , few received the specific antibiotics recommended by TCCC guidelines. The development of strategies to improve adherence to these TCCC recommendations is a research priority.
