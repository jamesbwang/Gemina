  Recently , perovskite solar cells ( PSCs) have emerged as an excellent photovoltaic device owing to the outstanding power conversion efficiency ( PCE). Nevertheless , device instability remains a critical issue in this field. To overcome device instability without deteriorating PCE , dopant-free hole transporting materials ( HTMs) are needed to separate the air-sensitive perovskite layer from extrinsic factors , which induce its degradation. Herein , we developed novel conjugate polymers of benzo ( 1,2- b: 4,5- b ') dithiophene ( BDT) and 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3 a ,4 a-diaza- s-indacene ( BODIPY) for use as HTMs without dopants. The pBDT-BODIPY polymer allows individual `` dialing '' of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO) levels with small modifications to the molecular structure , enabling study of the impact of the frontier molecular orbital on PSC performance. Different alkyl chains on BDT can minutely adjust the HOMO level , and meso-substituents on BODIPYs can selectively set the LUMO level of the resulting polymers. Application of BODIPY-containing polymer into the perovskite solar cell as an HTM leads to a high PCE value ( 16.02 %) and exceptional solar cell stability shown by the fact that over 80 % of its original PCE value was maintained after 10 days under ambient air conditions.
