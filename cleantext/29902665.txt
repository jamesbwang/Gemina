  Mancozeb ( Manganese ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate with zinc salt) is a dithiocarbamate fungicide used to control fungal<disease> disease<disease> in many fruit plants , flowers and the maintenance of field crops. The effect of mancozeb on cell viability of human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS , SNU-1 cells and human normal FHs 74 Int cells were investigated. This study demonstrated that mancozeb was able to inhibit cell proliferation by 56-82 % at 5-10 μM concentrations after 48 h. Mancozeb treatment for 48 h resulted in 33 % ( P < 0.05) and 61 % ( P < 0.001) increase in apoptotic cells at 5 and 10 μM concentrations in AGS cells , respectively. Treatment with mancozeb did not cause cell cycle arrest , while modulated the expression level of cleaved caspase-3 , and cleavage of poly- ( ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore , treatment with mancozeb caused a rapid stimulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The results also showed that mancozeb-induced apoptosis was accompanied by up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Overall , our data suggested that mancozeb caused ROS generation which induced significant ( P < 0.05) apoptosis in AGS cells that was attenuated with pretreatment of NAC. More importantly , same concentration of mancozeb did not show any considerable effect on cell growth , death , cell cycle arrest and ROS generation in normal FHs 74 Int cells. Overall , for the first time these results suggest that mancozeb has selective anticancer activity at lower concentrations against gastric cancer cells.
