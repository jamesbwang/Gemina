  Discrete-spin systems with maximally random nearest-neighbor interactions that can be symmetric or asymmetric , ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , including off-diagonal disorder , are studied , for the number of states q = 3,4 in d dimensions. We use renormalization-group theory that is exact for hierarchical lattices and approximate ( Migdal-Kadanoff) for hypercubic lattices. For all d > 1 and all noninfinite temperatures , the system eventually renormalizes to a random single state , thus signaling q × q degenerate ordering. Note that this is the maximally degenerate ordering. For high-temperature initial conditions , the system crosses over to this highly degenerate ordering only after spending many renormalization-group iterations near the disordered ( infinite-temperature) fixed point. Thus , a temperature range of short-range disorder in the presence of long-range order is identified , as previously seen in underfrustrated Ising spin-glass systems. The entropy is calculated for all temperatures , behaves similarly for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , and shows a derivative maximum at the short-range disordering temperature. With a sharp immediate contrast of infinitesimally higher dimension 1 + ε , the system is as expected disordered at all temperatures for d = 1.
