  To investigate the effect of lithium chloride ( LiCl) on cell cycle of HK-2 cells and explore the possible pathways involved. HK-2 cells were treated with LiCl at different concentrations ( 5 , 12.5 , 20 , and 25 mmol/L) for 12 , 24 , 48 , or 72 h , and the changes in cell cycle and viability were detected using flow cytometry and CCK-8 assay , respectively. Western blotting was used to analyze the changes in the expressions of cyclin B1 and CDK1 ( the two G2 phase-related proteins) and those of AKT/GSK -3 β signaling pathway-related proteins in the treated cells. LiCl treatment time- and concentration-dependently increased HK-2 cell percentage in G2 phase and decreased the cell vitality. The expressions of cyclin B1 , CDK1 , p-GSK-3β , and β-catenin increased and the expression of p-AKT decreased significantly in the cells as LiCl treatment time and concentration increased. LiCl may cause HK-2 cell cycle arrest in G2 phase through activation of the AKT/GSK -3 β signaling pathway.
