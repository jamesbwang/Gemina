  The study of the galvanic exchange ( GE) mechanism is beneficial for designing and developing new bimetallic nanocrystal structures with excellent bifunctional catalytic properties. Herein , we have visually demonstrated a GE process by real-time monitoring of the reaction between silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) and Au3 + at the single nanoparticle level using light scattering dark-field microscopy imaging. The localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) scattering spectral shifts of the AgNPs which reveal the Ag removal rate and Au deposition rate on the surface of the AgNPs can be observed. Furthermore , a pixel meta three color channel method has been introduced for analyzing the scattering light color<symptom> changes<symptom> of plasmonic particles to reveal the kinetics of the atomic deposition process on a single AgNP during GE , thus making the reaction kinetics of the GE process directly observable. Therefore , this study provides an efficient and promising approach for understanding the GE mechanism and exploiting its reaction kinetics.
