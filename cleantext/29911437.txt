  Chemical modification of medicines from natural product-based molecules has become of interest in recent years. In this study , a series of halogenated azo derivatives 1a-d were synthesised via coupling reaction , followed by Steglich esterification with aspirin ( a natural product derivative) to form azo derivatives 2a-d. While , halogenated azo-aspirin 3a-d were synthesised via direct coupling reaction of aspirin and diazonium salt. Bacteriostatic activity was demonstrated against E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> via turbidimetric kinetic method. Compound 3a-d showed excellent antibacterial activities against E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( MIC 75-94 ppm) and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MIC 64-89 ppm) compared to ampicillin ( MIC 93 and 124 ppm respectively) , followed by 1a-d and 2a-d. The presence of reactive groups of- OH , N = N , C =O and halogens significantly contribute excellent interaction towards E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Molecular dockings analysis of 3a against MIaC protein showed binding free energy of -7.2 kcal/mol ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) and -6.6 kcal/mol (
