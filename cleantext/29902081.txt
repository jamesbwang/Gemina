  The DSM-5 Section III alternative model for personality disorders ( AMPD) is a personality disorder ( PD) nosology based on severity of personality dysfunction and pathological traits. We examined the degree to which the personality constructs identified by McAdams and Pals ( 2006; dispositional traits , characteristic adaptations , narrative identity) and the paradigms of personality assessment described by Wiggins ( 2003; psychodynamic , interpersonal , personological , multivariate , empirical) are represented within the AMPD. Nine raters expert with the AMPD and personality evaluated elements of Criterion A and the 25 trait facets of Criterion B for presence of type and degree of personality constructs and paradigms , as well as level of inference. Criterion B showed higher rater agreement compared to Criterion A. Criteria A and B reflect different configurations of construct , paradigm , and level of inference. The characteristic adaptation construct and interpersonal paradigm were strongly reflected in both Criteria A and B. The psychodynamic and personological paradigms and the narrative identity construct were highly correlated , and the multivariate , empirical , and dispositional traits variables were highly correlated. Results illustrate differential conceptual emphases as well as areas of overlap with Criteria A and B. This characterization highlights that PD nosology rests on personality theory and suggests implications for integrative PD assessment.
