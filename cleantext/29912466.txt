  A pheromone-mediated mating disruption is a vital tool in the management of insect population dynamics that not only prevents mating but also delays mating in the target insect. Here , we examined the effect of delayed mating on the longevity and reproductive performance of the global pest , Spodoptera litura Fabricius ( Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Delayed mating was imposed on both sexes simultaneously , males only , and females only. The results showed that a 30-40 % reduction in the successful mating rate of S. litura was caused by 7-d delay in mating. Increased mating ages of both sexes of S. litura resulted in a significant decrease in 3-d-old delayed mating , followed by an increase in mean duration of copulation. Furthermore , delayed mating had a significantly negative influence on the number of S. litura eggs produced. Mating delay imposed on both sexes simultaneously had a significantly greater effect on longevity and the number of eggs than when it was applied to either sex alone , and females were more severely affected by delayed mating than males in terms of longevity. Percentage of mating , fecundity , and female longevity were all significantly correlated with the number of days delayed mating. However , the hatching rate of eggs was not significantly affected by an increased delay in mating. Overall , our results indicated that delayed mating in both females and males drastically reduced the females ' reproductive output , which itself was affected more by increasing the age at mating of females than males.
