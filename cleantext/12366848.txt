  Tolerance to antifungal drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC) is rarely quantified , and current clinical recommendations suggest it should be ignored. Here , we quantify antifungal tolerance in Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> isolates as the fraction of growth above the MIC , and find that it is distinct from susceptibility/resistance. Instead , tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population , and correlates inversely with intracellular drug accumulation. Many adjuvant drugs used in combination with fluconazole , a widely used fungistatic drug , reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. Accordingly , in an invertebrate infection model , adjuvant combination therapy is more effective than fluconazole in treating infections with highly tolerant isolates and does not affect infections with low tolerance isolates. Furthermore , isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia display higher tolerance than isolates readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus , tolerance correlates with , and may help predict , patient responses to fluconazole therapy.
