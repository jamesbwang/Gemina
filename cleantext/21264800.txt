  Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS)- guided transluminal drainage of obstructed bile duct with conventional metal and plastic stents has been in practice for several years , but this modality carries its own potential complications and obstacles. Nevertheless , the novel Hot AXIOS stent ( Boston Scientific Corp. , Marlborough , MA) has been shown to overcome some of those factors , which justifies its application in a variety of clinical indications , such as EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy ( EUS-CDS) for biliary drainage after failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We present a case of EUS-CDS with an electrocautery enhanced lumen-apposing stent for biliary drainage.
