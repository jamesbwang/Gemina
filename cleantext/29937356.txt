  There is renewed interest in linker histone ( LH)- nucleosome binding and how LHs influence eukaryotic DNA compaction. For a long time , the goal was to uncover `` the structure of the chromatosome , '' but recent studies of LH-nucleosome complexes have revealed an ensemble of structures. Notably , the reconstituted LH-nucleosome complexes used in experiments rarely correspond to the sequence combinations present in organisms. For a full understanding of the determinants of the distribution of the chromatosome structural ensemble , studies must include a complete description of the sequences and experimental conditions used , and be designed to enable systematic evaluation of sequence and environmental effects.
