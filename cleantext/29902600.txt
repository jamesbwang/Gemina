  Resection of a vestibular schwannoma may result in facial paralyiss and hearing loss on the side of tumor. Authors have encountered a young female of neurofibromatosis type 2 , who developed contralateral side sensorineural hearing loss immediately after resection of vestibular schwannoma.The patient regained partial hearing with a short course ( 2 months) of steroid therapy over 6 month. Clinical , audiological , intraoperative events and radiological parameters were evaluated in this case. The published literature was searched over the pubmed. 20 such cases were reported in the literature. Authors have evaluated the possible hypothesis , pattern , extent , recovery , and final outcome in these patients with management options. Several hypotheses have been proposed namely development of endolymphatic hydrops , vascular phenomenon , mechanical injury , barotrauma , and autoimmune cochleolabyrinthitis.Sudden release of CSF seems to be the most possible explanation in the present case. At present , there is no possible way to predict this complication beforehand. Operating in supine position , slow release of CSF , irrigation of the operating field , maintenance of normotension and judicious use of drill may help in its prevention. Short course of corticosteroids and vasodilators usually helps in spontaneous recovery in the majority of the cases.
