  To assess the accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI) , used in conjunction with the Prostrate Imaging Reporting and Data System ( PI-RADS) , version 2 , in the detection of prostate cancer ( PCa) , and to determine the extent of the efficacy of mpMRI as a screening test in biopsy-naïve patients. Retrospective analysis was conducted in 107 patients who underwent mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy ( RP) at a single institution. The mpMRI findings were reassessed using PI-RADS , version 2. A comparison was made between the histological findings for the RP specimens and the mpMRI results. Unique histologically confirmed PCa foci ( 237) were identified in 107 patients. Overall , mpMRI sensitivity of 46 % was found for PCa detection ( 110/237). The sensitivity , specificity and negative predictive value of mpMRI was 75.5 % , 77.0 % and 79.8 % , respectively , for clinically significant cancer , and 75.7 % , 77.7 % and 79.5 % , for pathological index tumors. A moderate and significant correlation was observed between a high PI-RADS score and a high pathological grade , tumor volume , index tumor status and clinically significant cancer status ( all , P < 0.001 , respectively). Pathological tumor volume was a significant predictor of PCa detection using mpMRI according to multivariate analysis. Using a cut-off value of 0.89 cc , the sensitivity and specificity of mpMRI for PCa detection were 0.87 and 0.65 , respectively. The mpMRI , used in conjunction with PI-RADS , was useful in detecting PCa and in predicting tumor aggressiveness. However , the detection of 20 % of clinically significant cancer was missed using mpMRI. Thus , its inclusion in a triage test should be limited to selected biopsy-naïve patients.
