  Respiratory-related premotor potentials from averaged electroencephalography ( EEG) over the motor areas indicate cortical activation in healthy participants to maintain ventilation in the face of moderate inspiratory or expiratory loads. These experimental conditions are associated with respiratory discomfort , i.e. , dyspnea<symptom>. Premotor potentials are also observed in resting breathing in patients with reduced automatic respiratory drive or respiratory muscle strength due to respiratory or neurological disease , presumably in an attempt to maintain ventilation. The aim of this study was to determine if small voluntary increases in ventilation or smaller load-capacity imbalances , that generate an awareness of breathing but are n't necessarily dyspneic , give rise to respiratory premotor potentials in healthy participants. In 15 healthy subjects , EEG was recorded during voluntary large breaths ( ∼ 3 × tidal volume , that were interspersed with smaller non-voluntary breaths in the same trial; in 10 subjects) and breathing with a ` low ' inspiratory threshold load ( ∼ 7 cmH
