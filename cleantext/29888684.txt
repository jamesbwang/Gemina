  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis show variable otorhinolaryngological involvement. Up to 14 per cent of granulomatosis with polyangiitis patients have subglottis involvement; little is known about the laryngeal involvement in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A literature review was conducted , together with a prospective cross-sectional analysis of 43 eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis patients. All patients underwent fibre-optic laryngoscopy with narrow-band imaging , and completed health-related questionnaires. The literature review showed only two cases of laryngeal involvement in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; in our cohort , no cases of subglottis stenosis were found , but local signs of laryngeal inflammation<symptom> were present in 72 per cent of cases. Of the patients , 16.2 per cent had a pathological Reflux Finding Score ( of 7 or higher). Laryngeal inflammation<symptom> in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is frequent. It is possibly due more to local factors than to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis itself. However , ENT evaluation is needed to rule out possible subglottis inflammation<symptom>. These findings are in line with current literature and worthy of confirmation in larger cohorts.
