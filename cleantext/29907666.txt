  Physician 's global assessment ( PGA) of disease activity is a major determinant of therapeutic decision making. This study assesses the reliability of the PGA , measured by means of 0-100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS) , and the additional use of separate VAS scales for musculoskeletal ( PhysMSK) and dermatologic ( PhysSk) manifestations in patients with psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA). Sixteen centers from 8 countries enrolled 319 consecutive patients with PsA. PGA , PhysMSK , and PhysSk evaluation forms were administered at enrollment ( W0) and after 1 week ( W1). Detailed clinical data regarding musculoskeletal ( MSK) manifestations , as well as dermatological assessment , were recorded. Comparison of W0 and W1 scores showed no significant variation ( intraclass correlation coefficients were PGA 0.87 , PhysMSK 0.86 , PhysSk 0.78) , demonstrating the reliability of the instrument. PGA scores were dependent on PhysMSK and PhysSk ( p < 0.0001) with a major effect of the MSK component ( B = 0.69) compared to skin ( B = 0.32). PhysMSK was correlated with the number of swollen joints , tender joints , and presence of dactylitis ( p < 0.0001). PhysSk scores were correlated with the extent of skin psoriasis and by face , buttocks or intergluteal , and feet involvement ( p < 0.0001). Finally , physician and patient assessments were compared showing frequent mismatch and a scattered dot plot: PGA versus patient 's global assessment ( r = 0.36) , PhysMSK versus patient MSK ( r = 0.39) , and PhysSk versus patient skin ( r = 0.49). PGA assessed by means of VAS is a reliable tool to assess MSK and dermatological disease activity. PGA may diverge from patient self-evaluation. Because MSK and skin/nail disease activity may diverge , it is suggested that both PhysMSK and PhysSk are assessed.
