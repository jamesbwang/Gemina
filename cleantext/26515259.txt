  The current study sought to design an oral delivery system of pemetrexed ( PMX) , a multitargeted antifolate antimetabolite , by enhancing its intestinal membrane permeability. PMX was ionically complexed with a permeation enhancer such as After complex formation , the partition coefficient and in vitro membrane permeability of PMX were markedly increased , but it showed similar cytotoxic and inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation/migration. Furthermore , the intestinal membrane permeability and epithelial cell uptake of PMX were synergistically improved after HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/ P188 was incorporated into a nanoemulsion with a size of 14.5 ± 0.45 nm. The in vitro permeability of HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/ P188-NE across a Caco-2 cell monolayer was 9.82-fold greater than that of free PMX , which might be attributable to the partitioning of PMX to the epithelial cells being facilitated via specific interaction of DCK with bile acid transporters , as well as the enhanced lipophilicity accompanied by surfactant-induced changes in the intestinal membrane structure and fluidity. Therefore , the oral bioavailability of HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/ P188-NE in rats was evaluated as 26.8 % ± 2.98 % which was 223 % higher than that of oral PMX. Moreover , oral HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/ P188-NE significantly suppressed tumor growth in Lewis lung carcinoma cell-bearing mice , and the tumor volume was maximally inhibited by 61 % compared with that in the control group. These results imply that HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/ P188-NE is an effective and promising delivery system for enhancing the oral absorption of PMX. Thus , there is the potential for new medical applications , including applications in metronomic cancer treatment.
