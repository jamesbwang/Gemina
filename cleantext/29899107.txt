  Emerging evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes , especially innate and adaptive immunity. However , the relationship between lncRNAs and interferon ( IFN) pathway remains largely unknown. Here , we report that lncRNA ITPRIP-1 ( lncITPRIP-1) is involved in viral<disease> infection<disease> and plays a crucial role in virus-triggered IFN signaling pathway through targeting MDA5. LncITPRIP-1 can be induced by viral<disease> infection<disease> , which is not entirely dependent on IFN signal. Besides , there is no coding potential found in lncITPRIP-1 transcript. LncITPRIP-1 binds to the C-terminal of MDA5 and it possesses the ability to boost oligomerization of both full length and 2CARD domains of MDA5 in a K63-linked-polyubiquitination-independent manner. Amazingly , we also find that MDA5 could suppress HCV replication independent of IFN signaling through its C-terminal deficient domain bound to viral RNA , in which lncITPRIP-1 plays as an assistant. In addition , the expression of lncITPRIP-1 is highly consistent with MDA5 expression , indicating that lncITPRIP-1 may function as a cofactor of MDA5. All the data suggest that lncITPRIP-1 enhances innate immune response to viral<disease> infection<disease> through promoting oligomerization and activation of MDA5. Our study discovers the first lncRNA ITPRIP-1 involved in MDA5 activation.
