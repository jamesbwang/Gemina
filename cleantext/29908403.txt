  Three polydimethylsiloxanes ( PDMS200 , PDMS1000 , and PDMS12500 with numbers showing the viscosity values dependent on the molecular weight) were used for adsorption ( 14-95 wt % PDMS) onto unmodified and PDMS-modified ( 16.7 wt % PDMS using dimethyl carbonate ( DMC) as a siloxane bond breaking reagent) nanosilica A-300. The materials were studied using microscopy , infrared spectroscopy , thermodesorption , calorimetry , ethanol and water/ethanol evaporation , nitrogen adsorption-desorption , and quantum chemical methods. The interfacial and temperature behaviors of a PDMS layer at a silica surface depend strongly on the type of bonding to silica particles , molecular weight and content of PDMS. Upon chemical bonding , shorter PDMS200 forms a denser coverage of the silica surface since S
