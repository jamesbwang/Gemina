  Cellulose/N , N '- methylene bisacrylamide/graphene oxide hydrogels were prepared by mixing cellulose with N , N '- methylene bisacrylamide ( MBA) and graphene oxide ( GO) in NaOH/urea aqueous solution. Two states of hydrogels , i.e. the freshly prepared hydrogels and the hydrogels at swelling equilibrium state in deionized water , were prepared. The gelation time , mechanical properties , transparency , texture properties and water retention ratio of the hydrogels were investigated. Results showed that the cellulose solution showed obvious MBA and GO induced gelation behaviors. Hydrogels with compressive strength ( 28.10-44.68 kPa for freshly prepared hydrogels and 40.91-58.69 kPa for swelling equilibrium state hydrogels) , good transparency ( 25 % for freshly prepared hydrogels and 35-65 % for swelling equilibrium state hydrogels) , high water retention ratio ( 3.22-3.16 Ã— 10
