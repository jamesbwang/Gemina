  Intravenous ( i.v.) glucocorticosteroids ( GCs) constitute the first-line treatment for active and moderate-to-severe Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO). In cases of persistent disease , rituximab , a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody , may be used , although studies have yielded conflicting results. In case 1 , a 50-year-old female heavy smoker presented with severe bilateral disfiguring eyelid edema<symptom> of four months , bilateral exophthalmos and a clinical activity score ( CAS) of 5/7. Laboratory investigation showed thyrotoxicosis and high thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin ( TSI) levels ( 32 IU/L ( normal < 1.75). After minor improvement by i.v. methylprednisolone and standard retrobulbar<symptom> radiotherapy ( 20 Gy) , her visual acuity progressively declined to `` hand motion ''. Rituximab was administered ( two pulses of 500 mg , two weeks apart) , with significant response. At 3Â 1/2 years of follow-up , CAS is 0/7 and CD20 + lymphocytes remain at the lower normal range. In case 2 , a 78-year-old non-smoker male was referred for management of severe active GO , one month after total thyroidectomy for Graves ' thyrotoxicosis ( TSI: 6.74 IU/L). Over the preceding two-three months , severe GO manifested with chemosis , constant diplopia<symptom> , loss of color<symptom> vision<symptom> and acuity of 1/10 bilaterally ( CAS: 7/7). Following partial response to i.v. methylprednisolone and concomitant radiotherapy , rituximab ( two pulses of 500 mg each , two weeks apart) , was administered. Vision partially recovered and GO remains in remission one year later , even after
