  In this study , we aimed to evaluate the effect of canthaxanthin ( CX) and iodine ( I) on the production of laying hens , on counteracting debilitation of the vitelline membrane , and on inhibiting Salmonella<pathogen> growth in eggs stored at 30 °C. Three hundred hens were reared in cages. Birds were divided into six feeding groups ( 10 hens × 5 repetitions) that were administered 0 , 3 or 6 ppm of CX and 1 or 10 ppm of I with their diets. Laying rate , egg weights , and feed conversion ratios were controlled. The quality of fresh eggs was assessed in wks 25-26 , 48-50 and 62-63 of hens lives. An additional batch of eggs was incubated at the temperature of 30 °C , and egg quality changes were monitored on days 3 , 6 and 9 of storage. Additionally , eggs collected from four experimental groups of hens whose diets had been iodated with 1 or 10 ppm of I and supplemented with 0 or 6 ppm of CX were infected under laboratory conditions with Salmonella<pathogen> , and incubated for 5 and 10 d. The laying rate , egg weights , and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved. Dietary inclusion of CX contributed to a higher resistance of the vitelline membrane of egg yolks , but only for fresh eggs. Vitelline membrane degradation during egg storage at 30 °C was significantly counteracted by dietary inclusion of I at a dose of 10 ppm. The same I dose resulted in the complete inhibition of Salmonella<pathogen> growth until day 10 of incubation , but exclusively for eggs collected from 40-week-old hens. Dietary supplementation with 10 ppm of I was found to impart high level of resistance to the vitelline membrane against the growth of Salmonella<pathogen> in case of eggs stored at 30 °C; therefore , I was found to be more beneficial by ensuring longer preservation than that of CX. However , dietary supplementation with CX was found to increase the resistance of vitelline membrane in fresh eggs.
