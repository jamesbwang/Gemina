  A hydrothermal microwave pretreatment was established to facilitate the enzymatic production of soluble bioactive β-1,3-glucans from the recalcitrant substrate paramylon. The efficacy of this pretreatment was monitored with a newly developed direct Congo Red dye-based assay over a range of temperatures. Microwave pretreatment at 170 °C for 2 min resulted in a significantly enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of paramylon. The action of endo-β-1,3- and exo- β-1,3-glucanases on the microwave-pretreated paramylon produced soluble β-1,3-glucans with degrees of polymerisation ( DP) ranging from 2-59 and 2-7 , respectively. In comparison , acid-mediated hydrolysis of untreated paramylon resulted in β-1,3-glucans with a DP range of 2-38. The hydrolysates were assayed on their immunostimulatory effect on murine macrophages by measuring the production of the inflammation-linked marker tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNFα) using immunofluorescence. All of the tested hydrolysis products were shown to induce TNFα production , with the most significant immunostimulatory effect observed with the hydrolysate from the exo-β-1,3-glucanase treatment.
