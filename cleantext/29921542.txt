  While the Body Mass Index ( BMI) did not change significantly for men from 2005 to 2014 in the United States , women exhibited an upward linear trend. Hispanic and Black women , in particular , showed a dramatic increase. Therefore , the objective of this study was to examine the association between BMI and mobility limitations for non-institutionalised middle-aged and older Black , Hispanic , and White women. The International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health model was applied to a sample of 2865 Black , 1846 Hispanic , and 9721 White women categorised as middle-aged and older ( i.e. , at least 50 years of age) from the 2010 and 2014 Rand Health and Retirement Study. A random effects ordered logit was employed. After accounting for personal/activity characteristics , the analyses revealed Black women with greater BMI were associated with a higher likelihood for mobility limitations with an odds ratio of 1.11 ( 1.06-1.16 , 95 % CI). A significant association was also found for Hispanic women with an odds ratio of 1.16 ( 1.11-1.23 , 95 % CI) and White women with an odds ratio of 1.16 ( 1.13-1.19 , 95 % CI). Even after accounting for the possibility of endogeneity , BMI remained robust. Higher-levels of BMI were associated with an increased probability for mobility limitations for Black , Hispanic , and White middle-aged and older women. Those with a vigorous exercise regimen were less likely to be in this category across all ranges of BMI. These results are useful for prioritising minority health policy , particularly given the limited amount of existing research in this specific area.
