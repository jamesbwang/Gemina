  The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and complications of two fixation techniques , namely dynamic hip screw ( DHS) and proximal femoral nail antirotation ( PFNA) , in the treatment of osteoporotic femoral intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients , and to detect changes in transforming growth factor β2 ( TGF-β2) expression in the two groups. A total of 100 elderly patients with femoral intertrochanteric fracture were randomly divided into two groups that were treated with either DHS or PFNA. Peri-operative complications were observed in the patients and ELISA was used to detect TGF-β2 expression levels at 1 , 7 , 15 and 30 days after surgical treatment. The clinical efficacy and the incidence rate of complications at 3 months after the operation were compared. In comparison with the DHS group , the PFNA group had a shorter operation time , a lower bleeding volume and a shorter post-operative weight-bearing time. The contents of TGF-β2 in the two groups at 7 days after the operation were higher than those at 1 day , reached a peak at 15 days and had gradually decreased again at 30 days after the operation. The contents of TGF-β2 at 1 , 7 and 15 days in the PFNA group were higher than those at the identical time-points in the DHS group ( P < 0.01). Regarding the clinical efficacy in the two groups at 3 months of post-surgery , the rate of excellent/good efficacy in the PFNA fixation group ( 90.0 %) was higher than that in the DHS fixation group ( 74.0 %). Of note , PFNA fixation had a higher clinical efficacy , a shorter operation time , less intra-operative trauma , a relatively faster fracture healing process and fewer complications in comparison with DHS fixation , and is therefore more suitable for treating osteoporotic femoral intertrochanteric fracture in the elderly. PFNA fixation is superior to DHS fixation , which may be associated with the higher level of TGF-β2 expression in comparison with that in the DHS group.
