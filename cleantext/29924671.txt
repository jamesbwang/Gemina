  This study evaluated a standardized paper triage process conducted by an advanced practice physiotherapist ( APP) at a rheumatology center. The aims were to ( 1) determine the concordance between paper triage priority assignment and the rheumatologist 's diagnosis; ( 2) determine the sensitivity and specificity of the paper triage process; and ( 3) assess reasons for incorrect priority ranking. Referrals were triaged by a formally trained APP into one of the three priorities , guided by a priority referral tool. A retrospective review of 192 charts was performed. Raw proportion of agreement between paper triage and rheumatologist 's diagnosis was supplemented by a prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa ( PABAK). Priority categories were collapsed to calculate sensitivity and specificity. For discordant cases , additional information was collected from the referral and chart to identify potential features leading to discrepancy. Overall agreement was 76 %. The PABAK was 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.70-0.90). Sensitivity ranged 0.64-0.92 and specificity ranged 0.81-0.94 , depending on the priority category. Forty-six cases were discordant , with the APP choosing a higher priority in 37 cases. An incorrect diagnosis from the family physician with no supporting information for the paper triage led to discordance in 16 cases. A standardized paper triage process conducted by an APP showed substantial concordance , sensitivity , and specificity.
