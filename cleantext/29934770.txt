  Vaginal bulging is considered the key symptom for genital organ prolapse. The aim was to investigate the age-related prevalence and frequency of symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse ( sPOP) and other pelvic floor symptoms in nonpregnant nullipara aged 25-64 years. This national postal and web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in 2014 and included four independent random samples of women aged 25-34 , 35-44 , 45-54 , and 55-64 years. The association of sPOP with demographics and with other pelvic floor conditions and with clustering to other pelvic floor conditions , was presented in women with and without sPOP. Logistic regression was used to identify and rank variables associated with symptomatic prolapse. The response rate was 52 % ( n = 10,187) and 726 nullipara confirmed sPOP. Women with sPOP were younger ( p < 0.001) , shorter ( p < 0.001) , and more often overweight and obese ( p < 0.01) compared with asymptomatic women. Previous surgery for prolapse was reported by 15 women only ( 0.16 %). Symptomatic POP decreased from 9.8 % in the youngest age group ( 25-34 years) to 6.1 % in the oldest ( 55-64 years) ( p < 0.0001). Symptomatic POP was more often experienced as bothersome ( p = 0.012) , and aggravated by straining and heavy lifting ( p = 0.003) , in older women. Vaginal/vulval chafing/rubbing feeling was most prevalent among the youngest 14.2 % , decreasing to 7.8 % among the oldest ( < 0.0001). This symptom occurred three to five times more often in those with sPOP ( p < 0.0001). Clustering of pelvic floor symptoms was four times more prevalent in women with sPOP ( 23.2 % versus 6.1 %) ( p < 0.0001). The high prevalence of sPOP in this study was contradictory to most earlier reports , which have shown that genital prolapse is rare in nullipara. The explanation of our results may be the low probability of the clinical condition , the dominance of weak and infrequent symptoms , and not least clustering of alternative conditions mimicking sPOP.
