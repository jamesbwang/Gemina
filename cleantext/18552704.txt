  Tracking physical activity and sleep patterns using wearable trackers has become a current trend. However , little information exists about the comparability of wearable trackers measuring sleep. This study examined the comparability of wearable trackers for estimating sleep measurement with a sleep diary ( SD) for three full nights<symptom>. A convenience sample of 78 adults were recruited in this research with a mean age of 27.6 ± 11.0 years. Comparisons between wearable trackers and sleep outcomes were analyzed using the mean absolute percentage errors , Pearson correlations , Bland ⁻ Altman Plots , and equivalent testing. Trackers that showed the greatest equivalence with the SD for total sleep time were the Jawbone UP3 and Fitbit Charge Heart Rate ( effect size = 0.09 and 0.23 , respectively). The greatest equivalence with the SD for time in bed was seen with the SenseWear Armband , Garmin Vivosmart , and Jawbone UP3 ( effect size = 0.09 , 0.16 , and 0.07 , respectively). Some of the wearable trackers resulted in closer approximations to self-reported sleep outcomes than a previously sleep research-grade device , these trackers offer a lower-cost alternative to tracking sleep in healthy populations.
