  To assess European patients ' preferences regarding seven aspects of doctor-patient communication. 6049 patients from 31 European countries evaluated 21 doctor and 12 patient behaviours , through a patient-generated questionnaire ( PCVq). Multilevel models explored the effects of patient characteristics , contextual and cultural dimensions on preferences. Patients attributed more responsibility to doctors , by giving greater importance to doctor than to patient factors , in particular to Treating the patient as a partner and as a person and Continuity of care. Gender , age , education , the presence of chronic illness and two of Hofstede 's cultural dimensions , Individualism and Indulgence , showed differential evaluations among patients. Women gave greater importance to all seven communication aspects , older patients to being prepared for the consultation , lower educated patients to Treating patient as a person and Thoughtful planning. Patients from countries with an indulgent background rated all seven communication aspects of greater importance. A more individualistic orientation was related to lower importance regarding the four doctor 's factors and the patient factor Open and Honest. Treating the patient as a person and providing continuity of care emerged as universal values. The findings should represent a landmark for the adaptation of patient-generated communication guidelines and programs in Europe.
