  A protein chain is arranged into regions in which the backbone is organized into regular patterns ( of conformation and hydrogen bonding) to form the most common secondary structures , α-helix and β-sheet , which are interspersed by turns and more irregular loop regions. A structural motif , topi , is discussed in which a pair of 2-residue segments , each containing hydrogen-bonded five-membered fused-ring motifs , distant in sequence are linked to each other by a hydrogen bond. Though a small motif , it appears to be important in the context of local folding patterns of proteins and occurs near protein active sites. The motif shows quite significant residue preference , and a Cys ( or Ser) occupying the second position may further stabilize the motif by forming an additional hydrogen bond across it. Remarkably , topi is found within disease causing misfolded proteins , such as the fibrilled form of Aβ42 , and also across the interface between two protein chains. This motif may be an important component of fibrillation and useful for modeling loop regions.
