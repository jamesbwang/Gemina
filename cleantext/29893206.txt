  Packaged water , particularly bagged sachet water , has become an important drinking water source in West Africa as local governments struggle to provide safe drinking water supplies. In Ghana , sachet water has become an important primary water source in urban centers , and a growing literature has explored various dimensions of this industry , including product quality. There is very little data on sachet water quality outside of large urban centers , where smaller markets often mean less producer competition and less government regulation. This study analyzes the microbiological quality of sachet water alongside samples of other common water sources at point-of-collection ( POC) and point-of-use ( POU) in 42 rural , peri-urban , and small-town Ghanaian communities using the IDEXX Colilert
