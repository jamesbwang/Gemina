  We hypothesized an association between auditory stimulus structure and activity in the brain that underlies infant auditory preference. In a within-infant design , we assessed brain activity to female and male infant directed relative to adult directed speech in 4-month-old infants using fNIRS. Results are compatible with the hypothesis that enhanced frontal brain activation , specifically in prefrontal cortex that is involved in emotion and reward , is evoked selectively by infant directed speech produced by female voices and may serve as a neuronal substrate for attention to and preference for `` motherese '' displayed by infants.
