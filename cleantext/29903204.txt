  By analyzing the mediating effect of self-determination on the relationship between family cohesion and adaptability and self-consistency and congruence , to explore the mediating mechanism of family cohesion and adaptability on self-consistency and congruence. A total of 1285 college students from 10 universities in Henan Province were surveyed with questionnaires including the family cohesion and adaptability scale , the self-determination scale and the self-consistency and congruence scale. The SPSS were used to explore the relationships among them. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation among family cohesion and adaptability , self-determination and self-consistency and congruence. Mediating effect tests showed that self-determination played a part mediating role on the relationship between family cohesion and self-consistency and congruence ( the proportion of mediating effect in total was 46. 11 %). Self-determination played a part mediating role on the relationship between family adaptability and self-consistency and congruence ( theproportion of mediating effect in total was 52. 38 %). Awareness of self and perceived choice also played a part mediating role on the relationship between family cohesion and adaptability and self-consistency and congruence ( the proportion of mediating effect in total was 26. 29 % -39. 46 %). Family cohesion and adaptability not only had a direct predictor of self-consistency and congruence , but also played an indirect role in predicting self-determination.
