  Modern aberration corrected transmission electron microscopes offer the potential for electron beam sensitive materials , such as graphene , to be examined with low energy electrons to minimize , and even avoid , damage while still affording atomic resolution , and thus providing excellent characterization. Here in this review , the exploits in which the electron beam interactions , which are often considered negative , are explored to usefully drive a wealth of chemistry in and around graphene , importantly , with no other external stimuli. After introducing the technique , this review covers carbon phase reactions between amorphous carbon , graphene , fullerenes , carbon chains , and carbon nanotubes. It then explores different studies with clusters and nanoparticles , followed by coverage of single atom and molecule interactions with graphene , and finally concludes and highlights the anticipated exciting future for electron beam driving chemistry in and around graphene.
