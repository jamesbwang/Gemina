  Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. It is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide , as it can interfere with all aspects of life. Despite the adequate treatment trials , half of patients preserve residual or impairing symptoms and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) are not free from adverse side effects. This work aims to systematically review the current evidence available concerning the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) in the treatment of OCD. Five randomized placebo-controlled trials ( RCTs) , 3 case reports and 2 case series were included. The studies developed so far are somehow contradictory. However , our pooled result from the 4 observational studies ( n = 13) showed a mean reduction in Y-BOCS score after NAC treatment of -11 points ( p = .01). Pooled mean difference from 4 of the 5 RCTs included was 3.35 , with a95 % confidence interval of -0.21-6.91 and a p-value barely below statistical significance ( p = .07). This result trends to favour the use of NAC over placebo in OCD patients. NAC has an optimal tolerability profile , even in higher doses , and the most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal. Despite the degree of evidence being D , in our opinion the potential of NAC is underestimated. Considering its exceptional tolerability profile , the use as an add-on agent should be contemplated , on an ad hoc basis.
