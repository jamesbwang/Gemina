  The purpose of this study was to evaluate drying methods for post space dentin bonding in a direct resin composite core build-up method. Experiment 1: Four root canal plastic models , having diameters of 1.0 or 1.8 mm and parallel or tapered shapes , were prepared. After drying each post space using three drying methods ( air drying , paper-point drying , or ethanol drying , which involves filling the space with 99.5 vol % ethanol followed by air drying) , the residual liquid in the models was weighed. Experiment 2: Thirty endodontically treated single-root teeth were dried using the above-described drying methods and filled with dual-cure resin composite. The bonded specimens were sectioned into square beams of approximately 1 mm Experiment 1: The results of air drying were significantly different from those of paper-point drying ( p < 0.001) and ethanol drying ( p < 0.001) , and no significant difference was observed between paper-point drying and ethanol drying. Experiment 2: The μTBS significantly decreased in the order of ethanol drying , paper-point drying , and air drying ( air drying/ethanol drying: p < 0.001 , air drying/paper-point drying: p = 0.048 , ethanol drying/paper-point drying: p = 0.032). TEM and μCT observation revealed a sufficient dentin/adhesive interface in the ethanol drying group. Ethanol drying was found to be more effective for post space dentin bonding , as compared with air drying and paper-point drying.
