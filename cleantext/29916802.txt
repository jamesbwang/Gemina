  Noroviruses are extremely diverse , with ≥ 30 genotypes infecting humans. GII genotype 4 ( GII .4) noroviruses , the most prevalent genotype , present a constant accumulation of mutations on the major capsid protein ( VP1) , resulting in the chronological emergence of new variants every 2-8 years. On the other hand , non-GII.4 noroviruses present a limited number of changes on the capsid protein over time. Despite limited diversification , non-GII.4 viruses can also be associated with large outbreaks. To gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics of non-GII.4 viruses , we performed variant-specific phylogenetic analyses on a comprehensive dataset of 13 genotypes. Although the genotypes with a single variant presented a linear ( clock-like) evolution , maximum-likelihood analyses revealed a lack of clock-like signals for the genotypes with ≥ 3 variants: GI .3 , GII .6 and GII .17. Notably , the evolutionary pattern of non-GII.4 viruses showed clock-like signals when each variant was analysed separately. A minimal impact on the long-term clock-like evolution of VP1 was detected due to the exchange ( recombination) of the polymerase types. The linear evolution , without replacement among variants , is explained by minimal changes at the protein level due to the higher ratio of synonymous compared to non-synonymous substitutions in their evolution. Taken together , these data indicate that ( i) the variants of non-GII.4 noroviruses evolve and persist in the population independently , probably due to strong evolutionary constraints on VP1 , and ( ii) variant-specific analyses with robust sequence databases that cover long periods of surveillance are needed to limit the potential for misinterpretation of the evolutionary dynamics of non-GII.4 noroviruses.
