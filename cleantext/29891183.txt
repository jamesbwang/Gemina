  To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of sarcopenia defined by different criteria in nursing home residents. A cross-sectional study. Four nursing homes in Chengdu , China. Elderly adults aged 65 years or older. We applied 4 diagnostic criteria ( European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People ( EWGSOP) , Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia ( AWGS) , International Working Group on Sarcopenia ( IWGS) , and Foundation for the National Institutes of Health ( FNIH)) to define sarcopenia. Muscle mass , strength , and function were measured based on bioimpedance analysis , handgrip strength , and walking speed , respectively. Nutrition status , activities of daily living , calf circumference ( CC) , and other covariates were evaluated. We included 277 participants. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 32.5 % , 34.3 % , 38.3 % , and 31.4 % according to the EWGSOP , AWGS , IWGS , and FNIH criteria , respectively. Fifty-eight participants ( 20.9 %) were sarcopenic by all the 4 criteria. Regardless of the diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia , malnutrition was independently associated with sarcopenia ( EWGSOP: odds ratio ( OR) 4.02 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.05-15.39; IWGS: OR 2.46 , 95 % CI 1.23-4.90; AWGS: OR 3.29 , 95 % CI 1.49-7.28; FNIH: OR 4.52 , 95 % CI 1.28-16.00) , whereas CC was negatively associated with sarcopenia ( EWGSOP: OR per standard deviation ( SD) 0.32 , 95 % CI 0.20-0.52; IWGS: OR per SD 0.26 , 95 % CI 0.15-0.43; AWGS: OR per SD 0.32 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.52; FNIH: OR per SD 0.39 , 95 % CI 0.25-0.60). Furthermore , falls â‰¥ 1 time in the past year were associated with AWGS-defined sarcopenia ( OR 2.92 , 95 % CI 1.04-8.22). Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in elderly Chinese nursing home residents regardless of the diagnostic criteria. Malnutrition and CC are associated with sarcopenia defined by different criteria. Therefore , it is important to assess sarcopenia and malnutrition in the management of nursing home residents. Prospective studies addressing the outcomes of sarcopenia in nursing home residents are warranted.
