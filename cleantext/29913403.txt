  Excessive fluoride ( F) intake decreases the development of potential oocytes by inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in female mice in our previous study. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of F-induced follicular developmental dysplasia. Pathomorphological changes in the ovary tissues were observed under light and transmission electron microscopes. DNA damage and proliferation in granulosa<pathogen> cells were analysed by TUNEL staining and BrdU measurement. The protein expression of cell proliferation related regulatory factors including JNK , STAT3 , STAT5 , CDK2 , CDK4 , PCNA and Ki67 in the ovary tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. Results indicated that the structure of granulosa<pathogen> cells in the ovary was seriously damaged by excessive F , evident by the swollen endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria with vacuoles and nucleus shrinkage. F treatment also considerably enhanced the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of granulosa<pathogen> cells. The number of granulosa<pathogen> cells around the oocyte decreased after F treatment. The expression levels of STAT3 , CDK2 , CDK4 and Ki67 in the ovary tissues were up-regulated , and STAT5 and PCNA did not change significantly after F treatment , whereas JNK expression was down-regulated with increasing F dose. In summary , changes in the expression levels of JNK , STAT3 , STAT5 , CDK2 , CDK4 , PCNA and Ki67 in the JNK/STAT signalling pathway are involved in F-induced follicular dysplasia in the ovary.
