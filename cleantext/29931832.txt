  We report on a child with a divided or kissing nevus of the penis with benign symmetric globular pattern on dermoscopic examination that evolved into a globular-reticular pattern after 1 year of follow-up. Divided nevus of the penis is exceedingly rare , with only four cases with dermoscopic findings reported to date. Dermoscopy seems to be useful when deciding on the most appropriate management of these cases.
