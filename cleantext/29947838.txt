  Overcoming recalcitrance of lignin has motivated bioprospecting of high-yielding enzymes from environmental ligninolytic microorganisms associated with lignocellulose degrading-systems. Here , we performed isolation of 21 ligninolytic strains belonging to the genus Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. , driven by the presence of lignin in the media. The fastest-growing strains ( FP10-5.23 , FP10-5.22 and P3TM1) reached the stationary phase in approximately 24 h , in the media containing lignin as the main carbon source. The strains showed biochemical evidence of ligninolytic potential in liquid- and solid media-converting dyes , which the molecular structures are similar to lignin fragments. In liquid medium , higher levels of dye decolorization was observed for P3TM .1 in the presence of methylene blue , reaching 98 % decolorization in 48 h. The highest index values ( 1.25) were found for isolates P3TM .1 and FP10-5.23 , in the presence of toluidine blue. The genomic analysis revealed the presence of more than 20 genes associated with known prokaryotic lignin-degrading systems. Identification of peroxidases ( lignin peroxidase-LiP , dye-decolorizing peroxidase-DyP , manganese peroxidase-MnP) and auxiliary activities ( AA2 , AA3 , AA6 and AA10 families) among the genetic repertoire suggest the ability to produce extracellular enzymes able to attack phenolic and non-phenolic lignin structures. Our results suggest that the Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. associated with fresh water and soil may play important role in the cycling of recalcitrant molecules in the Caatinga ( desert-like Brazilian biome) , and represent a potential source of lignin-degrading enzymes with biotechnological applications.
