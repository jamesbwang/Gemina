  Metformin is a biguanide derivative widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent evidence implicates that this anti-hyperglycemic drug exerts renal protective effects , yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. MCP-1 has been recognized as a key mediator of renal fibrosis<disease> in chronic kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on TGF-β1-induced MCP-1 expression and the underlying mechanisms in rat renal tubular epithelial cells. Rat renal tubular epithelial cell line NRK-52E cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 and/or metformin. The mRNA of MCP-1 and BAMBI was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. MCP-1 protein was measured by ELISA. Total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 was evaluated by Western blot. Down- and upregulation of BAMBI were achieved by RNA interference targeting BAMBI and lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of BAMBI gene , respectively. Cell viability was analyzed using cck-8 reagents. Stimulation with TGF-β1 resulted in increased expression of MCP-1 and decreased expression of BAMBI in NRK-52E cells. Metformin inhibited expression of MCP-1 in NRK-52E cells. Pretreatment with metformin suppressed upregulation of MCP-1 and down-regulation of BAMBI , as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by TGF-β1. U0126 , a specific inhibitor for MEK1/2 , completely blocked TGF-β1-induced MCP-1 expression. Knockdown of BAMBI gene promoted phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and TGF-β1-induced expression of MCP-1. Overexpression of BAMBI inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and TGF-β1-induced upregulation of MCP-1. In rat renal tubular epithelial cells , metformin prevents TGF-β1-induced MCP-1 expression , in which BAMBI-mediated inhibition of MEK/ERK1/2 might be involved.
