  Gastric cancer ( GC) is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. B cell-associated autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens are attractive biomarkers for the development of noninvasive serological tests for the early detection of cancer. This is due to their specificity and stability in the sera. In the present study multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Illumina high-throughput sequencing ( HTS) was used to study the composition and variation of the B cell receptor ( BCR) complimentary-determining region 3 ( CDR3) in GC. The peripheral blood , cancer tissues and peri-cancer tissues were included from 7 patients with GC. On average there was a total of 403,959 CDR3 sequences , with 72,367 unique CDR3 nt sequences and 61,709 unique CDR3 aa sequences per sample identified , which are critical for further understanding the BCR repertoire in GC. The details of GC CDR3s may accelerate the screening process for possible new autoantigens and may provide additional information necessary for generating effective B cell targeted diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
