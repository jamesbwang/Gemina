  To assess the influence of assisted reproductive technology ( ART) on the incidence of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing spontaneous<disease> abortions<disease> during the first trimester following natural conception ( NC) or assisted reproductive technology ( ART). Three hundred and fourteen chorionic villus samples of women with first trimester spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> were collected. Cell culture and G-banding karyotyping analysis were carried out , which included 125 cases by in vitro fertilization ( IVF) , 87 cases by intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI) and 102 cases by natural conception ( NC). Chromosomal aberrations were found in 167 ( 53.2 %) of the 314 cases. No significant difference was found in the spectrum of karyotypic abnormalities between NC and ART groups. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities has increased along with the maternal age. Compared with the fresh embryo-transfer ( ET) group , frozen-thawed embryo transfer ( FET) group showed a slightly lower incidence of chromosomal abnormalities , albeit with no statistical significance ( 47.3 % vs. 53.8 % , P > 0.05). Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are the main cause for spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> during the first trimester regardless the ways of conception. Their incidence is associated with maternal age. FET is relatively safe as well as fresh ET. ART is a relatively safe treatment which does not increase the rate of fetal chromosomal abnormalities.
