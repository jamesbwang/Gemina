  Obesity is a pandemic disorder that is characterized by accumulation of adipose tissue and chronic low-grade inflammation<symptom> that is driven primarily by adipose tissue macrophages ( ATMs). While ATM polarization from pro- ( M1) to anti- ( M2) inflammatory phenotype influences insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure , the mechanisms of such a switch are unclear. In the current study , we identified epigenetic pathways including microRNAs ( miR) in ATMs that regulate obesity-induced inflammation<symptom>. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed normal chow diet ( NCD) or high-fat diet ( HFD) for 16 weeks to develop lean and diet-induced obese mice , respectively. Transcriptome microarrays , microRNA microarrays , and MeDIP-Seq were performed on ATMs isolated from visceral fat. Pathway analysis and bone marrow-derived macrophage ( BMDM) transfections further allowed computational and functional analysis of miRNA-mediated ATM polarization. ATMs from HFD-fed mice were skewed toward M1 inflammatory phenotype. Concurrently , the expression of miRs 30a-5p , 30c-5p , and 30e-5p was downregulated in ATMs from HFD mice when compared to mice fed NCD. The miR-30 family was shown to target Delta-like-4 , a Notch1 ligand , whose expression was increased in HFD ATMs. Inhibition of miR-30 in conditioned BMDM triggered Notch1 signaling , pro-inflammatory cytokine production , and M1 macrophage polarization. In addition , DNA hypermethylation was observed in mir30-associated CpG islands , suggesting that HFD downregulates miR-30 through epigenetic modifications. HFD-induced obesity downregulates miR-30 by DNA methylation thereby inducing Notch1 signaling in ATMs and their polarization to M1 macrophages. These findings identify miR-30 as a regulator of pro-inflammatory ATM polarization and suggest that miR-30 manipulation could be a therapeutic target for obesity-induced
