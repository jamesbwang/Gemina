  Insulin resistance in endothelial cells contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM) is a soluble glycoprotein which plays a vital role in the development and progression of various diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However , it remains unknown if ASM regulates insulin resistance in vascular endothelial cells in type 2 diabetes. ASM down-regulation with gene silencing and selective inhibitor amitriptyline was used in the rat aortic endothelial cells ( RAECs) treated with palmitic acid ( PA) , a common saturated free fatty acid , which is thought to be the major cause of insulin resistance. It was shown that ASM down-regulation increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter-4 ( Glut4) expression and reversed the phosphorylation of pIRS-1-ser307 and AKT-ser473 via ceramide , consequently resulting in the decrease of the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) and nitric oxide in PA-induced RAECs. We further found that ASM down-regulation blocked the Nox2- and Nox4-dependent superoxide ( O
