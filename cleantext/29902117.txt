  The RNA helicase Mtr4 is a versatile protein that is a crucial component of several distinct RNA surveillance complexes. Here we describe a novel complex that contains Mtr4 , but has a role distinct from any of those previously described. We found that Mtr4 association with the human homolog of fission yeast Nrl1 , NRDE-2 , defines a novel function for Mtr4 in the DNA damage response ( DDR) pathway. We provide biochemical evidence that Mtr4 and NRDE-2 are part of the same complex and show that both proteins play a role in the DDR by maintaining low DNA double-strand break levels. Importantly , the DDR function of the Mtr4/NRDE -2 complex does not depend on the formation of R loops. We show however that NRDE-2 and Mtr4 can affect R-loop signals at a subset of distinct genes , possibly regulating their expression. Our work not only expands the wide range of Mtr4 functions , but also elucidates an important role of the less characterized human NRDE-2 protein.
