  In comparison to crude oil , biorefinery raw materials are challenging in concerns of transport and storage. The plant raw materials are more voluminous , so that shredding and compacting usually are necessary before transport. These mechanical processes can have a negative influence on the subsequent biotechnological processing and shelf life of the raw materials. Various approaches and their effects on renewable raw materials are shown. In addition , aspects of decentralized pretreatment steps are discussed. Another important aspect of pretreatment is the varying composition of the raw materials depending on the growth conditions. This problem can be solved with advanced on-site spectrometric analysis of the material. Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract.
