  INTRODUCTION Sensory innervation of the dorsomedial surface of the hand usually depends on the dorsal ulnar nerve ( DUN). Innervation in this area by the superficial radial nerve ( SRN) has been described as a normal variant. METHODS We studied 358 patients using nerve conduction of the DUN and SRN with dorsomedial recording. Each hand was classified into usual innervation ( only DUN response) , mixed variant ( response of both nerves) or complete variant ( only SRN response). RESULTS Mixed innervation was found in 14.2 % of hands and complete in 6.8 % , mostly unilaterally. No statistically significant differences were observed in age , gender or clinical suspicion between usual and variant innervation. The potential amplitude after SRN stimulation was greater in the complete variant. DISCUSSION It is important to know the characteristics of this variant in order to avoid diagnostic errors and to prevent iatrogenic lesions<symptom> in surgery performed on the dorsum of the wrist.
