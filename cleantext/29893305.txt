  Increased angiogenesis has been associated with neoplastic progression , metastasis and outcome in several studies and in a number of malignancies. Among the various host immune cells , mast cells have been implicated in tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between angiogenesis , mast cells with that of the normal oral mucosa ( NOM) and oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC). The study was conducted using routine haematoxylin and eosin staining procedure and included immunohistochemical staining for microvessels and toluidine blue staining for mast cells. The microvessel density ( MVD) and mast cell density ( MCD) of two groups ( NOM and OSCC). The MVD and MCD in OSCC ranged from 59.18 to 263.31 microvessel/mm A significant correlation is present between MCD and MVD in OSCC and also that both these entities are significantly increased in the disease process when compared to that of the NOM.
