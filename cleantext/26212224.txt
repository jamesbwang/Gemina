  This case report describes an instance of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis caused by an extreme conditioning program ( ECP) competition. A 35-year-old female presented with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and soreness<symptom> , which began one day after she completed two days of ECPcompetition composed of five workouts. Three days after competition , creatine kinase ( CK) was 77,590 U/L accompanied by myalgia<symptom> and abnormal liver function tests , while renal function was normal and this resulted in a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. A follow-up examination revealed that her serum level of CK was still elevated to 3034 U/L on day 10 and 1257 U/L on day 25 following the ECP competition. The subject reported myalgia<symptom> even up to 25 days after the ECP competition. Exertional rhabdomyolysis can be observed in ECP athletes following competition and highlights a dangerous condition , which may be increasing in recent years due to the massive expansion of ECP popularity and a growing number of competitions. Future research should investigate the causes of rhabdomyolysis that occur as a result of ECP , especially training methods and/or tasks developed specifically for these competitions.
