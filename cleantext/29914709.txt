  With the greater availability of treatments for acute ischaemic stroke , including advances in endovascular therapy , personalised assessment of patients before treatment is more important than ever. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke; therefore , reducing potential sex differences in the acute stroke setting is crucial for the provision of equitable and fast treatment. Evidence indicates sex differences in prevalence and types of non-traditional stroke symptoms or signs , prevalence of stroke mimics , and door-to-imaging times , but no substantial differences in use of emergency medical services , stroke knowledge , eligibility for or access to thrombolysis or thrombectomy , or outcomes after either therapy. Women presenting with stroke mimics or non-traditional stroke symptoms can be misdiagnosed , which can lead to inappropriate triage , and acute treatment delays. It is essential for health-care providers to recognise possible sex differences in stroke symptoms , signs , and mimics. Future studies focused on confounders that affect treatment and outcomes , such as age and pre-stroke function , are also needed.
