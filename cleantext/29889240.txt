  Low retention on combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART) has emerged as a threat to the Joint United Nations Programme on human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)/ AIDS ( UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets. We examined outcomes of patients who started cART but were subsequently lost to follow-up ( LTFU) in African treatment programs. This was a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of studies that traced patients who were LTFU. Outcomes were analyzed using cumulative incidence functions and proportional hazards models for the competing risks of ( i) death , ( ii) alive but stopped cART , ( iii) silent transfer to other clinics , and ( iv) retention on cART. Nine studies contributed data on 7377 patients who started cART and were subsequently LTFU in sub-Saharan Africa. The median CD4 count at the start of cART was 129 cells/Î¼L. At 4 years after the last clinic visit , 21.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 20.8 % -22.7 %) were known to have died , 22.6 % ( 95 % CI , 21.6 % -23.6 %) were alive but had stopped cART , 14.8 % ( 95 % CI , 14.0 % -15.6 %) had transferred to another clinic , 9.2 % ( 95 % CI , 8.5 % -9.8 %) were retained on cART , and 31.6 % ( 95 % CI , 30.6 % -32.7 %) could not been found. Mortality was associated with male sex , more advanced disease , and shorter cART duration; stopping cART with less advanced disease andlonger cART duration; and silent transfer with female sex and less advanced disease. Mortality in patients LTFU must be considered for unbiased assessments of program outcomes and UNAIDS targets in sub-Saharan Africa. Immediate start of cART and early tracing of patients LTFU should be priorities.
