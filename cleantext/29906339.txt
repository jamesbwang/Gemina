  Bimetallic lithium aluminates and neutral aluminum counterparts are compared as catalysts in hydroboration reactions with aldehydes , ketones , imines and alkynes. Possessing Li-Al cooperativity , ate catalysts are found to be generally superior. Catalytic activity is also influenced by the ligand set , alkyl and/or amido. Devoid of an Al-H bond , iBu
