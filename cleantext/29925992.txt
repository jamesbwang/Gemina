  There is growing recognition that B cell contributions to normal immune responses extend well beyond their potential to become antibody-producing cells , including roles at the innate-adaptive interface and their potential to modulate the responses of other immune cells such as T cells and myeloid cells. These B cell functions can have both pathogenic and protective effects in the context of central nervous system ( CNS) inflammation<symptom>. Here , we review recent advances in the field of multiple sclerosis ( MS) , which has traditionally been viewed as primarily a T cell-mediated disease , and we consider antibody-dependent and , particularly , emerging antibody-independent functions of B cells that may be relevant in both the peripheral and CNS disease compartments.
