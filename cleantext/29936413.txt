  Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation ( HCN) channels play a critical role in the control of pacemaking in the heart and repetitive firing in neurons. In HCN channels , the intracellular cyclic nucleotide-binding domain ( CNBD) is connected to the transmembrane portion of the channel ( TMPC) through a helical domain , the C-linker. While this domain is critical for mechanical signal transduction , the conformational dynamics in the C-linker that transmit the nucleotide-binding signal to the HCN channel pore are unknown. Here , we use linear response theory to analyze conformational changes in the C-linker of the human HCN1 protein , which couple cAMP binding in the CNBD with gating in the TMPC. By applying a force to the tip of the so-called `` elbow '' of the C-linker , the coarse grained calculations recapitulate the same conformational changes triggered by cAMP binding in experimental studies. Furthermore , in our simulations , a displacement of the C-linker parallel to the membrane plane ( i.e. horizontally) induced a rotational movement resulting in a distinct tilting of the transmembrane helices. This movement , in turn , increased the distance between the voltage-sensing S4 domain and the surrounding transmembrane domains , and led to a widening of the intracellular channel gate. In conclusion , our computational approach , combined with experimental data , thus provides a more detailed understanding of how cAMP binding is mechanically coupled over long distances to promote voltage-dependent opening of HCN channels.
