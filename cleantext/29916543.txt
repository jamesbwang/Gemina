  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) are considered to be an ideal source for the cell therapy of end‑stage liver diseases. Umbilical cord ( UC) MSCs can be obtained via a non‑invasive procedure and can be easily cultured , making them potentially superior candidates for cell transplantation when compared with MSCs from other sources. In the present study , UC‑MSCs were induced to differentiate into hepatocytes and were compared with bone<disease> marrow ( BM) MSCs for their hepatic differentiation potential. UC‑MSCs showed significantly higher proliferation than BM‑MSCs. Under hepatic induction , UC‑MSCs and BM‑MSCs could differentiate into hepatocytes. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑qPCR) analysis revealed that a higher expression of the hepatocyte‑specific genes albumin , cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4) , tyrosine‑aminotransferase , glucose‑6phosphate , α1 antitrypsin and α‑fetoprotein was detected in differentiated UC‑MSCs when compared with differentiated BM‑MSCs. The results of ELISA and western blotting were in accordance with those of RT‑qPCR. Theses results indicated that UC‑MSCs had higher hepatic differentiation potential than BM‑MSCs. Therefore , UC‑MSCs may be advantageous over BM‑MSCs for the treatment of end‑stage liver disease.
