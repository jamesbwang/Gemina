  to evaluate the primary outcome of local complications and late recurrence in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa undergoing radical resection and specific reconstruction. we conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients attended by the Plastic Surgery Service of the Clinics Hospital , Medical School , USP , between 2010 and 2016. We included patients who underwent radical resection of hidradenitis suppurativa in advanced stage and reconstruction through primary closure , grafts or flaps. we analyzed 34 lesions<symptom> in 19 patients , of which 64.5 % had local complications , though with 73.5 % efficient healing after 12 weeks postoperatively. We observed late recurrence in 47 % , but in isolation , 22.2 % of the reconstructions with locoregional flaps had recurrence after one year. extensive and radical resection of the disease associated with locoregional flap coverage ( pedicled or perforating) has been shown to be the best management in terms of late results.
