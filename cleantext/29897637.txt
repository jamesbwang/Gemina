  The introduction of mechanophores into polymers makes it possible to transduce mechanical forces into chemical reactions that can be used to impart functions such as self-healing , catalytic activity , and mechanochromic response. Here , an example of mechanically induced metal ion release from a polymer is reported. Ferrocene ( Fc) was incorporated as an iron ion releasing mechanophore into poly ( methyl acrylate) s ( PMAs) and polyurethanes ( PUs). Sonication triggered the preferential cleavage of the polymers at the Fc units over other bonds , as shown by a kinetic study of the molar mass distribution of the cleaved Fc-containing and Fc-free reference polymers. The released and oxidized iron ions can be detected with KSCN to generate the red-colored ( Fe ( SCN)
