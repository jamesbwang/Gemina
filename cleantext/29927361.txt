  Tip growth in fungi<pathogen> involves highly polarized secretion and modification of the cell wall at the growing tip. The genetic requirements for initiating polarized growth are perhaps best understood for the model budding yeast , Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> Once the cell is committed to enter the cell cycle by activation of G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK) complexes , the polarity regulator Cdc42 becomes concentrated at the presumptive bud site , actin cables are oriented towards that site , and septin filaments assemble into a ring around the polarity site. Several minutes later , the bud emerges. Here , we investigated the mechanisms that regulate the timing of these events at the single cell level. Septin recruitment was delayed relative to polarity establishment , and our findings suggest that a CDK-dependent septin `` priming '' facilitates septin recruitment by Cdc42. Bud emergence was delayed relative to the initiation of polarized secretion , and our findings suggest that the delay reflects the time needed to weaken the cell wall sufficiently to bud. Rho1 activation by Rom2 occurred at around the time of bud emergence , perhaps in response to local cell wall weakening. This report reveals regulatory mechanisms underlying the morphogenetic events in the budding yeast.
