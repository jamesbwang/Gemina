  Endothelial cells adopt unique cell fates during sprouting angiogenesis , differentiating into tip or stalk cells. The fate selection process is directed by Delta-Notch lateral inhibition pathway. Classical Delta-Notch models produce a spatial pattern of tip cells separated by a single stalk cell , or the salt-and-pepper pattern. However , classical models can not explain alternative tip-stalk patterning , such as tip cells that are separated by two or more stalk cells. We show that lateral inhibition models involving only Delta and Notch proteins can also recapitulate experimental tip-stalk patterns by invoking two mechanisms , specifically , intracellular Notch heterogeneity and tension-dependent rate of Delta-Notch binding. We introduce our computational model and analysis where we establish that our enhanced Delta-Notch lateral inhibition model can recapitulate a greater variety of tip-stalk patterning which is previously not possible using classical lateral inhibition models. In our enhanced Delta-Notch lateral inhibition model , we observe the existence of a hybrid cell type displaying intermediate tip and stalk cells ' characteristics. We validate the existence of such hybrid cells by immuno-staining of endothelial cells with tip cell markers , Delta and CD34 , which substantiates our enhanced model.
