  The use of electrolyzed oxidizing ( EO) water to inactivate microorganisms on foods has been extensively studied and shown to be effective. However , the prospect of the formation of `` viable but nonculturable '' ( VBNC) cells in pathogens after low free chlorine concentration ( FCC) treatments under high organic loads presents safety concerns. This study investigated the effect of EO water FCC on inducing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 and Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> into the VBNC state and studied possible resuscitation triggering procedures of the VBNC cells. A 5-strain cocktail of each pathogen ( 10 VBNC induction conditions for foodborne pathogens during chlorine washing treatment were determined in a broth system and the information can serve as a basis for future studies that address the prevention of VBNC formation during produce wash treatments.
