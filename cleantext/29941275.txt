  This report described the experience of active surveillance culture implemented in response to the identification of a single carbapenemase-producing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in a Japanese university hospital. It revealed a horizontal transmission event and an additional asymptomatic carrier of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> with unique drug susceptibility and resistance gene profiles. Early implementation of active surveillance culture as a part of multifaceted infection control measures appeared to be useful to control further transmission of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> even in the low endemic facility. Further investigations on the timing and usefulness of active surveillance culture in the control of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae would be warranted.
