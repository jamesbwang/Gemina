  The primary closure of the vertical posteromedial thigh ( vPMT) free flap donor site is very important to minimize donor site morbidity and maximize cosmetic appearance. However , sometimes due to the dimension of the defect , a vPMT flap is wider than the 8-10 cm requirement. The authors report their experience with the third perforator of the profunda<disease> femoris artery ( PFA) during the vPMT free flap donor-site closure. Between January 2016 and December 2017 , 5 patients underwent reconstruction of lower extremity ( 2 pts.) and head and neck ( 3 pts.) area with the free vPMT flaps. Attempts to close the vPMT free flap donor site directly failed due to the flaps ' width ( average: 11 cm) and pedicled perforator flaps based on the third perforator of the PFA at the distal thigh were harvested to close the defect primary without the use of a skin graft. The size of perforator flap based on 3rd perforator of PFA was on average 6 cm × 4 cm ( ranged: 4-8 cm × 3-6 cm). In all patients , the third perforator of the PFA was identified and the perforator diameter was on average 2.0 mm ( range , 1.8-2.2 mm). All perforators were musculocutaneous and single. The dimensions of the flaps were on average 6 cm × 4 cm ( range: 4 to 8 cm × 3 to 6 cm). All flaps healed uneventfully without complications and the patients were satisfied with cosmetic and functional results at 6 months follow-up. The third perforator of the PFA may be an option to ensure primary closure of the PMT flap donor site , when a larger flap for reconstruction is needed with subsequent impossibility to achieve primary closure of the donor site.
