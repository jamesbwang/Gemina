  Correlated mutations between residue pairs in evolutionarily related proteins arise from constraints needed to maintain a functional and stable protein. Identifying these inter-related positions narrows down the search for structurally or functionally important sites. MISTIC is a server designed to assist users to calculate covariation in protein families and provide them with an interactive tool to visualize the results. Here , we present MISTIC2 , an update to the previous server , that allows to calculate four covariation methods ( MIp , mfDCA , plmDCA and gaussianDCA). The results visualization framework has been reworked for improved performance , compatibility and user experience. It includes a circos representation of the information contained in the alignment , an interactive covariation network , a 3D structure viewer and a sequence logo. Others components provide additional information such as residue annotations , a roc curve for assessing contact prediction , data tables and different ways of filtering the data and exporting figures. Comparison of different methods is easily done and scores combination is also possible. A newly implemented web service allows users to access MISTIC2 programmatically using an API to calculate covariation and retrieve results. MISTIC2 is available at: https://mistic2.leloir.org.ar.
