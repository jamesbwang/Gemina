  Sperm motility is essential for fertilization. The asymmetry of flagellar beat in spermatozoa is finely regulated by intracellular calcium concentration ( ( Ca2 +) i). Recently , we demonstrated that the application of high concentrations ( 10-20 μM) of the Ca2 + ionophore A23187 promotes sperm immobilization after 10 minutes , and its removal thereafter allows motility recovery , hyperactivation and fertilization. In addition , the same ionophore treatment overcomes infertility<symptom> observed in sperm from Catsper1-/- , Slo3-/- and Adcy10-/- , but not PMCA4-/- , which strongly suggest that regulation of ( Ca2 +) i is mandatory for sperm motility and hyperactivation. In this study we found that prior to inducing sperm immobilization , high A23187 concentrations ( 10 μM) increase flagellar beat. While 5-10 μM A23187 substantially elevates ( Ca2 +) i and rapidly immobilizes sperm in a few minutes , smaller concentrations ( 0.5 and 1 μM) provoke smaller ( Ca2 +) i increases and sperm hyperactivation , confirming that ( Ca2 +) i increases act as a motility switch. Until now the ( Ca2 +) i thresholds that switch motility on and off were not fully understood. To study the relationship between ( Ca2 +) i and flagellar beating , we developed an automatic tool that allows the simultaneous measurement of these two parameters. Individual spermatozoa were treated with A23187 which is then washed to evaluate ( Ca2 +) i and flagellar beat recovery using the implemented method. We observe that ( Ca2 +) i must decrease below a threshold concentration range to facilitate subsequent flagellar beat recovery and sperm motility.
