  Complete uniparental isodisomy ( iUPD)- the presence of two identical chromosomes in an individual that originate from only a single parental homolog-is an underestimated cause of recessive Mendelian disease in humans. Correctly identifying iUPD in an index patient is of enormous consequence to correctly counseling the family/couple , as the recurrence risk for siblings is reduced from 25 % to usually < 1 %. In medium/large-scale NGS analyses , we found that complete iUPD can be rapidly and straightforwardly inferred from a singleton dataset ( index patient only) through a simple chromosome- and genotype-filtering step in < 1 min. We discuss the opportunities of iUPD detection in medium/large-scale NGS analyses by example of a case of CHRNG-associated multiple pterygium syndrome<disease> due to complete maternal iUPD. Using computer simulations for several detection thresholds , we validate and estimate sensitivity , specificity , positive ( PPV) , and negative predictive values ( NPV) of the proposed screening method for reliable detection of complete iUPD. When screening for complete iUPD , our models suggest that a > 85 % proportion of homozygous calls on a single chromosome with â‰¥ 30 sufficiently interspaced called variants results in a sensitivity of 97.9 % and specificity of 99.7 %. The PPV is 95.1 % , the NPV 99.9 %. When this threshold is exceeded for a chromosome on which a patient harbors an apparently homozygous disease-associated variant , it should be sufficient cause to discuss iUPD as a plausible or probable mechanism of disease in the genetic analysis report , even when parental segregation has not ( yet) been performed.
