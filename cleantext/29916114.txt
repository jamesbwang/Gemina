  When exposed to words presented under perceptually disfluent conditions ( e.g. , words written in Haettenschweiler font) , participants have difficulty initially recognizing the words. Those same words , though , may be better remembered later than words presented in standard type font. This counterintuitive finding is referred to as the disfluency effect. Evidence for this disfluency effect , however , has been mixed , suggesting possible moderating factors. Using a recognition memory task , level of disfluency was examined as a moderating factor across three experiments using a novel cursive manipulation that varied on degree of legibility ( easy-to-read cursive vs. hard-to-read cursive). In addition , list type and retention interval between study and test were manipulated. Across all three experiments , cursive words engendered better memory than type-print words. This memory effect persisted across varied list designs ( blocked vs. mixed) and a longer ( 24-hour) retention interval. A small-scale meta-analysis across the three experiments suggested that the cursive disfluency effect is moderated by level of disfluency: easy-to-read cursive words tended to be better remembered than hard-to-read cursive words. Taken together , these results challenge extant accounts of the disfluency effect. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.
