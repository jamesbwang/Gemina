  Machine learning , a collection of data-analytical techniques aimed at building predictive models from multi-dimensional datasets , is becoming integral to modern biological research. By enabling one to generate models that learn from large datasets and make predictions on likely outcomes , machine learning can be used to study complex cellular systems such as biological networks. Here , we provide a primer on machine learning for life scientists , including an introduction to deep learning. We discuss opportunities and challenges at the intersection of machine learning and network biology , which could impact disease biology , drug discovery , microbiome research , and synthetic biology.
