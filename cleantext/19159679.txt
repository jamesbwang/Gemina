  One of the major obstacles facing stem cell therapy is the limited number of functional stem cells available after transplantation due to the harsh microenvironment surrounding the damaged tissue. The aim of this study was to delineate the mechanistic involvement of lysophosphatidic acid receptors ( LPARs) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors ( S1PRs) in the regulation of anti-stress and transplantation efficacy of stem cells. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hADMSCs) were treated with chemical toxin or ethanol to induce cell stress. Lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA) and/or sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P) were co-treated to examine their protective effects and mechanisms on stem cell damage. Acute liver failure and alcoholic liver disease murine models were also established to test the transplantation efficacy of hADMSCs with or without LPA/S1P pre-incubation. Co-stimulation of LPAR Co-use of LPA and S1P represents a novel and safe strategy to enhance stem cell transplantation efficacy for future drug- and alcoholic-related liver disease therapies.
