  In Greece there is no systematic assessment of surgical wounds<disease> with the use of a validated instrument , while the ASEPSIS scoring method has been widely used internationally. To examine the frequency of wound<disease> infections<disease> and their correlations both with patient background factors , as well as surgery factors , with the use of ASEPSIS. In this prospective , observational study , participants undergoing orthopaedic surgeries in a large hospital in Greece were assessed during hospitalisation and the first month after discharge using the ASEPSIS wound<disease> assessment tool. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were applied. Non-parametric statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0. In total , 111 patients participated; nearly half ( 49.5 %) had a total ASEPSIS score of `` 0 ''. Almost 3 out of 4 patients ( 76.6 %) had an ASEPSIS score under or equal to `` 10 '' ( satisfactory healing) and only 3.6 % had a minor or severe surgical wound<disease> infection<disease> The ASEPSIS score was only positively correlated to longer surgery duration and longer postoperative stay. The frequency of surgical wound<disease> infections<disease> in orthopaedic patients in Greece is comparable to that described in the literature. ASEPSIS could be used for assessing patients and as a performance indicator in Greek orthopaedic departments.
