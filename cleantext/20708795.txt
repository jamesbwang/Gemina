  Substance P is a neurotransmitter or modulator in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this work , modifications of the lysine in SP by homocysteine and an acetyl group as well as the conformational dynamics of the native and modified SP peptides and their complexes with the NK1 receptor were studied via MD simulation. It was found that modifying SP stabilizes the peptide structure , but the modified SP peptides are less likely to bind to the NK1 receptor , so the resulting complexes are less stable. The RMSD of native SP ( ~ 0.33 nm) is about twice as large as that of the modified SP peptides ( ~ 0.18 nm) , while the RMSD for the receptor complexed with native SP is ~ 0.3 nm , and that for the receptor complexed with either of the modified peptides is ~ 0.35 nm , which demonstrates the high stability of the modified SP peptides as well as the receptor complexed with native SP.. Such behavior was also observed in other structural analyses. The binding free energies of the native and modified SP peptides with the NK1 receptor were also compared. The Î”G
