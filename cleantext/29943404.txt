  By substituting boron atoms for selected carbon atoms of a graphene quantum dot ( GQD) model , namely a coronene molecule , the substituent effect on its geometric and electronic structure , as well as nonlinear optical response has been systemically investigated in theory. Our computations reveal that the boron substitution leads to a similar noncentrosymmetric apophysis structure for the boron-substituted coronene in singlet and triplet states. Noticeably , due to the small energy difference of 2.5 kcal mol
