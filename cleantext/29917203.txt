  To investigate the specific role of microRNA-26 ( miRNA-26a) in a rat model of cerebral ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) was established to induce permanent cerebral infarction. Neuro-behavior was observed and scored after model establishment. The expression of miRNA-26a in brain tissue and brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMECs) of rats after cerebral ischemic stroke was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR). The formation of the endothelial lumen was detected by Matrigel assay after BMECs were transfected with miR-26a mimics or inhibitors. Besides , cell proliferation after miRNA-26a transfection was detected by 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay. The protein levels related to PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. miRNA-26a expression was elevated after cerebral infarction injury. Further investigation showed that miRNA-26a mimics could promote endothelial lumen formation and cell proliferation in BMECs , while miRNA-26a inhibitor inhibited the capacity of lumen formation and cell proliferation. Notably , we found that miRNA-26a might up-regulate the expression of HIF-1a via activating the AKT and ERK1/2 pathway , thus mediating the transcriptional activity of VEGF and promoting lumen formation and cell proliferation in BMECs. MiRNA-26a promotes angiogenesis in a rat model of cerebral ischemic via PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway.
