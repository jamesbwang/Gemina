  ( i) To assess the reliability of knee crepitus measures , ( ii) to investigate the association between knee crepitus and PFP; ( iii) to investigate the relationship between knee crepitus with self-reported function , physical activity and pain. Cross-sectional. Laboratory-based study. 165 women with PFP and 158 pain-free women. Knee crepitus test , anterior knee pain scale ( AKPS) and self-reported worst knee pain in the last month , knee pain after 10 squats and knee pain after 10 stairs climbing. Knee crepitus clinical test presented high reliability Kappa value for PFP group was 0.860 and for pain-free group was 0.906. There is a significantly greater proportion of those with crepitus in the PFP group than in the pain-free group ( OR = 4.19). Knee crepitus had no relationship with function ( rpb = 0.03; p = 0.727) , physical activity level ( rpb = 0.010; p = 0.193) , worst pain ( rpb = 0.11; p = 0.141) , pain climbing stairs ( rpb = 0.10; p = 0.194) and pain squatting ( rpb = 0.02; p = 0.802). Women who presents knee crepitus have 4 times greater odds to be in a group with PFP compared to those who do not. However , knee crepitus has no relationship with self-reported clinical outcomes of women with PFP.
