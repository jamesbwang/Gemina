  Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation ( FPAR) , as an important index for evaluating yields and biomass production , is key to providing the guidance for crop management. However , the shortage of good hyperspectral data can frequently result in the hindrance of accurate and reliable FPAR assessment , especially for wheat. In the present research , aiming at developing a strategy for accurate FPAR assessment , the relationships between wheat canopy FPAR and vegetation indexes derived from concurrent ground-measured hyperspectral data were explored. FPAR revealed the most strongly correlation with normalized difference index ( NDI) , and scaled difference index ( N
