  Insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) is synthesised as a prohormone ( proIGF-1) requiring enzymatic activity to yield the mature IGF-1. Three proIGF-1s are encoded by alternatively spliced IGF-1 mRNAs: proIGF-1Ea , proIGF-1Eb and proIGF-1Ec. These proIGF-1s have a common IGF-1 mature sequence but different E-domains. The structure of the E-domains has not been resolved , and their molecular functions are still unclear. Here , we show that E-domains are Intrinsically Disordered Regions that have distinct regulatory functions on proIGF-1s production. In particular , we identified a highly conserved N-glycosylation site in the Ea-domain , which regulated intracellular proIGF-1Ea level preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation. The inhibition of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin or glucose starvation markedly reduced proIGF-1Ea and mature IGF-1 production. Interestingly , 2-deoxyglucose , a glucose and mannose analogue , increased proIGF-1Ea and mature IGF-1 levels , probably leading to an accumulation of an under-glycosylated proIGF-1Ea that was still stable and efficiently secreted. The proIGF-1Eb and proIGF-1Ec were devoid of N-glycosylation sites , and hence their production was unaffected by N-glycosylation inhibitors. Moreover , we demonstrated that alternative Eb- and Ec-domains controlled the subcellular localisation of proIGF-1s , leading to the nuclear accumulation of both proIGF-1Eb and proIGF-1Ec. Our results demonstrated that E-domains are regulatory elements that control IGF-1 production and secretion.
