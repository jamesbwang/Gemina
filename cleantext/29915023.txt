  Antitumor T-cell responses have the potential to be curative in cancer patients , but the induction of potent T-cell immunity through vaccination remains a largely unmet goal of immunotherapy. We previously reported that the immunogenicity of peptide vaccines could be increased by maximizing delivery to lymph nodes ( LNs) , where T-cell responses are generated. This was achieved by conjugating the peptide to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-PEG ( DSPE-PEG) to promote albumin binding , which resulted in enhanced lymphatic drainage and improved T-cell responses. Here , we expanded upon these findings and mechanistically dissected the properties that contribute to the potency of this amphiphile-vaccine ( amph-vaccine). We found that multiple linkage chemistries could be used to link peptides with DSPE-PEG , and further , that multiple albumin-binding moieties conjugated to peptide antigens enhanced LN accumulation and subsequent T-cell priming. In addition to enhancing lymphatic trafficking , DSPE-PEG conjugation increased the stability of peptides in serum. DSPE-PEG-peptides trafficked beyond immediate draining LNs to reach distal nodes , with antigen presented for at least a week in vivo , whereas soluble peptide presentation quickly decayed. Responses to amph-vaccines were not altered in mice deficient in the albumin-binding neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn) , but required Batf3-dependent dendritic cells ( DCs). Amph-peptides were processed by human DCs equivalently to unmodified peptides. These data define design criteria for enhancing the immunogenicity of molecular vaccines to guide the design of next-generation peptide vaccines.
