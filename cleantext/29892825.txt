  Using in vivo animal model systems for chemical screening can permit evaluation of the signaling pathways implicated. Xenopus laevis is an ideal model organism to test thyroid axis disruption as thyroid hormones are highly conserved across vertebrates. Here , we describe a high-throughput assay using non-feeding embryonic stage transgenic X. laevis ( TH/bZip) to screen for thyroid disrupting chemicals using a 3 day exposure protocol. We further describe a protocol to detect endocrine disruption of thyroid axis by the analysis of gene expression using wild-type X. laevis.
