  Chronic urticaria ( CU) has an adverse effect on academic achievement and psychosocial development in children. We aimed to investigate the natural course of CU and to identify relevant factors associated with a poor CU prognosis in Korean children. We retrospectively analyzed 253 children with episodes of wheals or angioedema at least 3 times a week that persisted for at least 6 weeks. Clinical data and laboratory results were obtained from medical records and parental telephone interviews. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log rank tests were performed to assess the median time to remission of CU and prognostic factors. Median age at onset was 5.0 years ( interquartile range , 2.5-9.1) and median follow-up period was 7.6 months ( interquartile range , 3.9-19.7). Of 253 patients , 68.8 % had chronic inducible urticaria and 31.2 % had chronic spontaneous urticaria. Physical urticaria was the only cause of chronic inducible urticaria , and the most common physical urticaria was dermographism. Median duration to remission of CU was 10.2 months ( 95 % confidence intervals , 8.0-12.5 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 33.4 % , 53.0 % , and 71.2 % of children were in remission at 6 , 12 , and 24 months , respectively , after the onset of CU. The presence of allergic sensitization was significantly associated with a poor CU prognosis in univariable and multivariable analyses ( P = 0.010 and P = 0.014 , respectively). Half of children with CU were in remission 10.2 months after onset. Allergic sensitization was a risk factor associated with longer duration CU.
