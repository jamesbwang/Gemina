  Joint dislocation is one of the most frequent complications after hip arthroplasty. Multiple strategies have demonstrated ability to prevent instability when used in isolation , but the effect when more than one intervention is implemented has not been measured. The purpose of this study is to assess the rate of dislocation after implementation of a protocol of combined strategies for prevention of instability. Consecutive patients undergoing primary total hip replacement for hip osteoarthritis between February 2012 and June 2014 were included. A multimodal protocol including patient education , use of large femoral heads , posterior soft-tissue repair , and intraoperative adjustment of limb length and hip offset was applied. Dislocation episodes were documented trough medical records review and a telephonic follow-up at 3 and 12 months after surgery. During the period of study 331 patients were included , mean age was 66 years and 68.8 % were females. Only 0.91 % of patients were lost to follow-up. Eighty-nine percent of patients received all interventions. Cumulative dislocation rate at 3 months was 0.60 % and 0.90 % at 12 months. The implementation of a multimodal protocol for prevention of prosthesis instability produces a low rate of dislocation , which compares favorably with benchmarks. We recommend the use of a combination of multiple interventions to prevent this complication.
