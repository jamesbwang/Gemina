  Manifestations of ischemic stroke vary widely , and serum biomarkers may be useful for stratification of risk of severe stroke. This study evaluated the association of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A We employed a retrospective analysis on our hospital-based registry and recruited 488 first-onset ischemic stroke patients admitted within 24 h after onset and with Lp-PLA Of the overall patients , the median admission NIHSS scores was 3 and 28.1 % had severe manifestation. Admission NIHSS scores were different between patients of Lp-PLA Lp-PLA2 was independently related to admission severity in ischemic stroke patients , implying a potential predictive value of Lp-PLA2 for severe stroke in prevention.
