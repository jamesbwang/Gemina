  Prescribed fire is a common management practice in Mediterranean region to reduce the amount of fuel and to decrease the wildfire risk. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of a prescribed fire on some soil properties , hydrological response and vegetation recovery in experimental plots 5 years after. The results showed that: i) with the exception of electrical conductivity , the prescribed fire did not affect the analyzed soil properties , and ii) overland flow and sediment transport were increased during the first two years , returning to levels pre-fire , 5 years post-fire. The rainfall threshold for overland flow generation was lower during the following months after the prescribed fire owing to the depletion of the vegetation cover. Immediately after the fire , the vegetation cover was of 1.9 % , being the three main soil surface components that dominated the hydrological response: charcoal and decayed wood; blackish and greyish ash , and bare soil. However , these areas decreased very rapidly during the second year following the fire , principally , owing to the regrowth of herbaceous plants and shrubs. In addition , the vegetation cover in burned plots was 16.1 % higher than that measured in the unburned ones. Overall , the prescribed fire only had an impact on runoff and sediment transport in the two years post-fire , as consequence of vegetation removal.
