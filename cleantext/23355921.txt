  Antenatal diagnosis of a fetal hepatic cyst<symptom> is rare. Since in most cases the lesion<symptom> is treated after birth by surgery only a few reports present a complete spontaneous resolution of an antenatally diagnosed hepatic cyst<symptom>. A single hepatic cyst<symptom> ( 1.34/ 1.47 cm) was diagnosed in a fetus at 36 weeks of pregnancy while mother was in labor. After an uneventful vaginal birth , a multidisciplinary evaluation of the newborn confirmed the presence of the cyst<symptom>. Single hepatic cyst<symptom> INTERVENTIONS:: Passive approach; periodic ultrasound monitoring of the cyst<symptom> OUTCOMES:: The latest ultrasound examination performed at 18 months of age confirmed complete resolution of the cyst<symptom>. No other medical complications occurred before 18 months of age. The management of such a case depends on the cyst<symptom> dimensions , the types of involved structure and could require urgent prenatal or neonatal treatment. In our case a complete spontaneous resolution of the hepatic cyst<symptom> was achieved before 18 months of age.
