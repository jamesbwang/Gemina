  Plant isoprenoids are dependent on two independent pathways , the cytosolic mevalonate ( MVA) pathway and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate ( MEP) pathway. IspE is one of seven known enzymes in the MEP pathway. Currently , no IspE gene has been identified in rice. In addition , no virescent mutants have been reported to result from a gene mutation affecting the MEP pathway. In this study , we isolated a green-revertible yellow leaf mutant gry340 in rice. The mutant exhibited a reduced level of photosynthetic pigments , and an arrested development of chloroplasts and mitochondria in its yellow leaves. Map-based cloning revealed a missense mutation in OsIspE ( LOC_Os01g58790) in gry340 mutant plants. OsIspE is constitutively expressed in all tissues , and its encoded protein is targeted to the chloroplast. Further , the mutant phenotype of gry340 was rescued by introduction of the wild-type gene. Therefore , we have successfully identified an IspE gene in monocotyledons via map-based cloning , and confirmed that the green-revertible yellow leaf phenotype of gry340 does result from a single nucleotide mutation in the IspE gene. In addition , the ispE ispF double mutant displayed an etiolation lethal phenotype , indicating that the isoprenoid precursors from cytosol can not efficiently compensate for the deficiency of the MEP pathway in rice chloroplasts. Furthermore , real-time quantitative RT-PCR suggested that this functional defect in OsIspE not only affected the expression of other MEP-pathway genes , but that of MVA-pathway genes , photosynthetic genes , and mitochondrial genes.
