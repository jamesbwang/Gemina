  Background Research has emphasised the essential role of psychosocial risk factors in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. In practice , pain is usually verified by identifying its physical cause. In patients without any distinct pathology , pain is easily defined as imaginary pain. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the invisibility of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , from the patients ' perspective. Methods Thirty-four participants with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> were interviewed. The mean age of the participants was 48 years , and 19 of them were women. For 21 of the participants , the duration of pain was more than five years , and most of the participants had degenerative spinal pain. The transcribed interviews were analysed using Giorgi 's four-phase phenomenological method. Results The participants ' chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was not necessarily believed by health care providers because of no identified pathology. The usual statements made by health care providers and family members indicated speculation , underrating , and denial of pain. The participants reported experience of feeling that they had been rejected by the health care and social security system , and this feeling had contributed to additional unnecessary mental health problems for the participants. As a result from the interviews , subthemes such as `` Being disbelieved '' , `` Adolescents ' pain is also disbelieved '' , `` Denying pain '' , `` Underrating symptoms '' , `` The pain is in your head '' , `` Second-class citizen '' , `` Lazy pain patient '' , and `` False beliefs demand passivity '' were identified. Conclusions In health care , pain without any obvious pathology may be considered to be imaginary pain. Despite the recommendations , to see chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> as a biopsychosocial experience , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is still regarded as a symptom of an underlying disease. Although the holistic approach is well known and recommended , it is applied too sparsely in clinical practice. Implications The Cartesian legacy , keeping the mind and body apart , lives strong in treatment of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> despite recommendations. The biopsychosocial approach seems to be rhetoric.
