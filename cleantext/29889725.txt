  Continuous video electroencephalographic ( EEG) ( cvEEG) monitoring is emerging as the standard of care for diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures<symptom>. However , cvEEG is labor-intensive and the need to initiate and interpret studies on a 24-hour basis is a major limitation. This study aims at establishing consistency in monitoring of newborns admitted to 2 different neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs) managed by the same neurocritical care team. Neonatal nurses were trained to apply scalp electrodes , troubleshoot technical issues , and identify amplitude-integrated EEG abnormalities. Guidelines , checklists , and visual training modules were developed. A central network system allowed remote access to the cvEEGs by the epileptologist for timely interpretation and feedback. A cohort of 100 infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy before and after the training program was compared. During the study period , 192 cvEEGs were obtained. The time to initiate brain monitoring decreased by 31.5 hours posttraining; this , in turn , led to an increase in electrographic seizure<symptom> detection ( 20 % before vs 34 % after) , decrease in seizure<symptom> clinical misdiagnosis ( 65 % before and 36 % after) , and reduction in antiseizure medication burden. Training experienced NICU nurses to set up , start , and monitor cvEEGs can decrease the time to initiate cvEEGs , which may lead to better seizure<symptom> diagnosis and management. Further understanding of practice bundles for best supporting infants at risk and being treated for seizures<symptom> needs to be evaluated for integration into practice.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.
