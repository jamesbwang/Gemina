  We report a novel and versatile fabrication strategy for functional nanonetwork-structured carbon nitride with Au nanoparticle yolks ( FNNS-C3N4-Au) based on hairy poly ( acrylic acid)- grafted SiO2 nanospheres ( Au@SiO2-g-PAA). Benefiting from the three-dimensional nanonetwork structure and well-distributed Au nanoparticles , the as-prepared nanocomposites demonstrated excellent photocatalysis performances ( degradation rate constant: 1.8 Ã— 10-2 min-1).
