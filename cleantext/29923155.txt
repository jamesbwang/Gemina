  Xenopus laevis , otherwise known as the African clawed frog , undergoes natural dehydration<symptom> of up to 30 % of its total body water during the dry season in sub-Saharan Africa. To survive under these conditions , a variety of physiological and biochemical changes take place in X. laevis. We were interested in understanding the role that the calcineurin-NFAT pathway plays during dehydration<symptom> stress response in the skeletal muscles of X. laevis. Immunoblotting was performed to characterize the protein levels of NFATc1-4 , calcium signalling proteins , in addition to myogenic proteins ( MyoD , MyoG , myomaker). In addition , DNA-protein interaction ELISAs were used to assess the binding of NFATs to their consensus binding sequence , and to identify the effect of urea on NFAT-binding. Our results showed that NFATc1 and c4 protein levels decreased during dehydration<symptom> , and there were no changes in NFATc2 , c3 , and calcium signalling proteins. However , MyoG and myomaker both showed increases in protein levels during dehydration<symptom> , thus indicating that the late myogenic program involving myoblast differentiation , but not satellite cell activation and myoblast proliferation , could be involved in preserving the skeletal muscle of X. laevis during dehydration<symptom> In addition , we observed that urea seems to reduce NFATc3-binding to DNA during control , but not during dehydration<symptom> , possibly indicating that NFATc3 is protected from the denaturing effects of urea as it accumulates during dehydration<symptom> These findings expand upon our knowledge of adaptive responses to dehydration<symptom> , and they identify specific protein targets that could be used to protect the skeletal muscle from damage during stress.
