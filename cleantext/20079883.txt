  There is increasing interest in the use of DNA polymerases ( DNA pols) in next-generation sequencing strategies. These methodologies typically rely on members of the A and B family of DNA polymerases that are classified as high-fidelity DNA polymerases. These enzymes possess the ability to selectively incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite a templating base with an error frequency of only 1 in 10
