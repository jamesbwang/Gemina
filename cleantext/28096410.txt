  Population intelligence quotients increased throughout the 20th century-a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect-although recent years have seen a slowdown or reversal of this trend in several countries. To distinguish between the large set of proposed explanations , we categorize hypothesized causal factors by whether they accommodate the existence of within-family Flynn effects. Using administrative register data and cognitive ability scores from military conscription data covering three decades of Norwegian birth cohorts ( 1962-1991) , we show that the observed Flynn effect , its turning point , and subsequent decline can all be fully recovered from within-family variation. The analysis controls for all factors shared by siblings and finds no evidence for prominent causal hypotheses of the decline implicating genes and environmental factors that vary between , but not within , families.
