  Understanding macroevolutionary processes using phylogenetic trees is a challenging and complex process that draws on mathematics , computer science and biology. Given the development of complex mathematical models and the growing computational processing power , simulation tools are becoming increasingly popular.In order to simulate phylogenetic trees , most evolutionary biologists are forced to build their own algorithms or use existing tools built on different platforms and/or as standalone programmes. The absence of a simulation tool accommodating for user-chosen model specifications limits , amongst others , model testing and pipelining with approximate Bayesian computation methods or other subsequent statistical analysis.We introduce
