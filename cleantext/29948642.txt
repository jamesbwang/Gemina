  To understand the association between genetic mutations and radiomics of 2-deoxy-2- ( This study included 74 CRC patients who had undergone preoperative ( Genetic mutants were found in 21 KRAS tumors ( 28 %) , 31 TP53 tumors ( 42 %) , and 17 APC tumors ( 23 %). Tumors with a mutated KRAS had an increased value at the 25th percentile of maximal standardized uptake value ( SUV PET/CT-derived radiomics can provide supplemental information to determine KRAS , TP53 , and APC genetic alterations in CRC.
