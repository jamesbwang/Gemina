  In the light of the growing complexity featuring the contemporary world , a future challenge is represented by the maintenance of the humanization of healthcare , along with the necessity of a high specificity personalized treatment , in a growing emergency of lack of resources. Furthermore , the ongoing digital revolution spreading in every productive sector involves the health-care system as well , playing a crucial role for the goals of the specialized care-related prevention-treatment-rehabilitation approach of the Rehabilitation Medicine. However , the digitalization of clinical data is not to be considered as a mere tout-court necessity , but it deserves to be planned and carried out with consistent awareness: the digital transformation calls for a theoretical paradigm which , together with a shared language , will be able to embrace its multilevel complexity , taking into account the patient needs , the clinical care pathways and the administrative requests. In the present work the potentialities of the WHO ICF model ( International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health) will be described. In particular , will be discussed the role of the ICF in representing the keystone able to connect the ICD-9-CM classification , the clinical care pathways , the individualized rehabilitation project and program and their digital implementation. Hence , each step of the process that led the implementation of the biopsychosocial model in the ICF Maugeri workflows will be presented , as well as the critical issues related to the digitalisation process and the strengths in safeguarding the patients ' wellbeing.
