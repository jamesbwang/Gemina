  Wayfinding ( WF) is the ability to move around efficiently and find the way from a starting point to a destination. It is a component of spatial navigation , a coordinate and goal-directed movement of one 's self through the environment. In the present study , the relationship between WF tasks ( route tracing and shortcut finding) and individual factors were explored with the hypothesis that WF tasks would be predicted by different types of cognitive , affective , motivational variables , and personality factors. A group of 116 university students ( 88 F.) were conducted along a route in a virtual environment and then asked first to trace the same route again , and then to find a shortcut between the start and end points. Several instruments assessing visuospatial working memory , mental rotation ability , self-efficacy , spatial anxiety<symptom> , positive attitude to exploring , and personality traits were administered. The results showed that a latent spatial ability factor ( measured with the visuospatial working memory and mental rotations tests)- controlled for gender- predicted route-tracing performance , while self-report measures of anxiety<symptom> , efficacy , and pleasure in exploring , and some personality traits were more likely to predict shortcut-finding performance. We concluded that both personality and cognitive abilities affect WF performance , but differently , depending on the requirements of the task.
