  To detect potential mutations of fibrillin-1 ( FBN1) gene in a child with Marfan syndrome<disease> ( MFS) and explore its molecular pathogenesis. The 66 exons of the FBN1 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing. SIFT and PolyPhen-2 were used to predict the structural and functional changes at the protein level. A novel heterozygous mutation c. 3998 G > A ( p.Cys1333Tyr) was found in exon 32 in the child. The same mutation was not found among his unaffected family members and 683 healthy controls. Multiple sequence alignment showed that this novel mutation was located in a highly conserved region of the FBN1 protein across various species and may induce structural change to a functional domain. The novel c. 3998G > A ( p.Cys1333Tyr) mutation of the FBN1 gene probably predisposed the MFS in the child. Above finding has enriched the spectrum of FBN1 mutations.
