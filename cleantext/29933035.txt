  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) controls many biological processes including differentiation , survival , proliferation , and angiogenesis. In normal healthy cells , STAT3 is tightly regulated to maintain a momentary active state. However , aberrant or constitutively activated STAT3 has been observed in many different cancers and constitutively activated STAT3 has been shown to associate with poor prognosis and tumor progression. For this reason , STAT3 has been studied as a possible target in the treatment of many different types of cancers. However , despite decades of research , a FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitor has yet to emerge. In this review , we will analyze past studies targeting STAT3 for drug discovery , understand possible causes of failure in these studies , and provide potential insights for future efforts to overcome these roadblocks.
