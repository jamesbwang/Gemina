  This paper proposes a novel micro-electromechanical system ( MEMS) piezoresistive pressure sensor with a four-petal membrane combined with narrow beams and a center boss ( PMNBCB) for low-pressure measurements. The stresses induced in the piezoresistors and deflection of the membrane were calculated using the finite element method ( FEM). The functions of the relationship between the dimension variables and mechanical performance were determined based on the curve fitting method , which can provide an approach for geometry optimization of the sensor. In addition , the values in the equations were varied to determine the optimal dimensions for the proposed membrane. Then , to further improve the sensitivity of the sensor , a series of rectangular grooves was created at the position of the piezoresistors. The proposed diaphragm was compared to existing diaphragms , and a considerable increase in the sensitivity and a considerable decrease in nonlinearity error could be achieved by using the proposed sensor. The simulation results suggest that the sensor with the PMNBCB structure obtained a high sensitivity of 34.67 mV/kPa and a low nonlinearity error of 0.23 % full-scale span ( FSS) for the pressure range of 0 ‚Åª 5 kPa. The proposed sensor structure is a suitable selection for MEMS piezoresistive pressure sensors.
