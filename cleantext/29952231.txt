  Protein quantitation by digestion of a biological sample followed by LC-MS analysis of a signature peptide can be a challenge because of the high complexity of the digested matrix. Results/methodology: The use of LC with high-resolution ( quadrupole-TOF) MS detection allowed quantitation of the 22-kDa biopharmaceutical somatropin in 60 Î¼l of rat plasma down to 25 ng/ml with minimal further sample treatment. Reducing the mass extraction window to 0.01 Da considerably decreased the interference of tryptic peptides , enhanced sensitivity and improved accuracy and precision. Analysis with LC-MS/MS resulted in a less favorable limit of quantitation of 100 ng/ml. HRMS is an interesting option for the quantitation of proteins after digestion and has the potential to improve sensitivity with minimal method development.
