  OBJECTIVE To identify knowledge and practices related to rabies<pathogen> vaccination and serologic monitoring among animal care workers in the United States. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SAMPLE 2,334 animal care workers ( ie , veterinarians , veterinary technicians , animal control workers , and wildlife rehabilitators). PROCEDURES Participants were contacted through relevant professional organizations to participate in an anonymous web-based survey. The survey collected demographic and occupational information , animal handling and potential rabies<pathogen> exposure information , and individual rabies<pathogen> vaccination and serologic monitoring practices. Comparisons of animal bite and rabies<pathogen> exposure rates were made between occupational groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with rabies<pathogen> vaccination status and adherence to serologic monitoring recommendations. RESULTS Respondents reported 0.77 animal bites/person-year or 0.10 bites/1 ,000 animals handled. The overall rate of postexposure prophylaxis due to an occupational rabies<pathogen> exposure was 1.07/ 100 person-years. Veterinarians reported the highest rabies<pathogen> vaccination rate ( 98.7 % ( 367/372)) , followed by animal control workers ( 78.5 % ( 344/438)) , wildlife rehabilitators ( 78.2 % ( 122/156)) , and veterinary technicians ( 69.3 % ( 937/1 ,352)). Respondents working for employers requiring rabies<pathogen> vaccination and serologic monitoring were 32.16 and 6.14 times , respectively , as likely to be vaccinated or have a current serologic monitoring status as were respondents working for employers without such policies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that , given the high reported rates of animal bites and potential rabies<pathogen> exposures among animal care workers , improvements in rabies<pathogen> vaccination and serologic monitoring practices are needed.
