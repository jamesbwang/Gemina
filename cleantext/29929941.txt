  To evaluate the performance of noninvasive prenatal testing by cell-free circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood ( cfDNA) in screening for trisomies 21 in twin pregnancies. CfDNA was performed in 492 patients with twin pregnancies without ultrasound anomalies in the first trimester as a first-line screening test or after serum screening. Data were collected prospectively and a retrospective analysis was done. CfDNA was executed by massive parallel technique. The fetal fraction threshold for test evaluation was 8 %. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of different parameters on the test failure rate. Performance of the test was also considered. In 377 patients , the test was prescribed first line and in 115 after standard serum screening. Twelve tests ( 2.9 %) have initially failed on the 420 pregnancies with available outcomes and regression analysis found only maternal weight as a significant independent factor of test failure. A second test was performed on 10 patients , all of them had an available result. cfDNA identified all 3 cases of trisomy 21. The sensitivity was 100.0 % ( 95 % CI ( 29.2-100.0 %)) and specificity was 99.8 % ( 95 % CI ( 98.7-100.0 %)). There was no significant difference between spontaneous pregnancies and those induced by assisted reproductive technologies ( ART) , in terms of fetal fraction percentage , no-call results for cfDNA screening , maternal weight , or test performance between the two groups. In twin pregnancies without fetal ultrasound abnormalities , the performance and success rate of the cfDNA are excellent. Therefore , cfDNA could be offered in routine practice as a first-line screening test in this population.
