  Effectiveness of cancer therapy relies heavily on the efficient early diagnosis. Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) detection is one of the most clinically meaningful liquid biopsy approaches for the noninvasive cancer early diagnosis , which , unfortunately , can not be applied as a routine diagnostic tool till a number of obstacles , for example , unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity , and extremely high costs , are overcome. Here , the first paradigm of nanomaterial 's application in the extremely specific , ultrasensitive , and yet economical ctDNA detections is reported based on a facile nanoparticle-coupling strategy without amplification , with which polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)- introduced bias and other shortcomings are successfully circumvented. Aiming at seven Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus ( KRAS) point mutations , the present strategy exhibits high specificity and an ultrahigh sensitivity of detecting as low as 0.1 pg mL
