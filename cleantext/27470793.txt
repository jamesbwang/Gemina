  Deep waters of the South Pacific off northern Chile remain poorly studied , particularly in regard to invertebrate faunas. Some recent works include new records on deep-water species , mostly from the bycatch of benthic fisheries concentrated along the continental margin of the country. Among these , a few specimens of an unidentified bathylasmatine balanomorph were collected off Caldera , northern Chile , and they are described here as Bathylasma chilense sp. nov.. While this is the second report of a bathylasmatid in the Eastern Pacific Ocean , the first being Tetrachaelasma southwardi Newman & Ross , 1971 , it is not only the first but the deepest known ( 1800-2000 m) species of Bathylasma. Its discovery increases the number of described Bathylasma species to eight , four of which are extant. This is the third deep-water balanomorph cirriped recorded for the region where it may represent an isolate from a West<disease> Wind Drift fauna , an immigrant from the western Pacific , or a relict of a once cosmopolitan Paleocene-Eocene fauna now having an amphitropical component.
