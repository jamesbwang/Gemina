  In order to optimize the mass rearing of Telenomus podisi Ashmead ( Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) for augmentative biological control we tested the suitability of different artificial diets with respect to egg production of Euschistus heros ( F.) ( Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). For this purpose , biological parameters of E. heros and T. podisi were evaluated in experimental trial with these diets. All tested artificial diets supported the rearing of E. heros. However , female and adult life history traits including longevity , total oviposition , nymph developmental time , and fertility were altered , with poorer results than under the natural diet. However , because of the higher economic cost of the natural diet , its replacement with artificial diets could be beneficial. Since stink bug reared on artificial diet has shorter lifespan , an alternative to overcome this issue is to replace earlier the insects in the insect facility what could still be cheaper than insects reared on natural diet. It was also noted the possibility of using artificial diets without lyophilized components what can further reduce the cost of rearing.
