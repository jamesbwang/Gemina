  Antimicrobial-coated sutures have recently become well known for preventing surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSIs). However , the evidence and recommendations from some organizations remain controversial. Therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the efficacy of antimicrobial-coated sutures for preventing SSIs in digestive surgery. We performed a systematic review of literature published from 2000 to 2017 ( registered on PROSPERO , No. CRD42017076780). We included studies defined as randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) and observational studies ( OBSs) for the prevention of SSIs and the reduction in hospital stay length associated with digestive surgery. In the 10 RCTs , the incidence rates of incisional SSIs were 160/1798 ( 8.9 %) with coated sutures and 205/1690 ( 12.1 %) with non-coated sutures. Overall , antimicrobial-coated sutures were superior for reducing the incidence of incisional SSI ( risk ratio ( RR) 0.67 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) 0.48-0.94 , p = 0.02) in RCTs for digestive surgery with the mixed wound<disease> class and surgeries limited to a clean-contaminated wound<disease> ( RR 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.44-0.98 , p = 0.04). A superior effect of antimicrobial-coated sutures was found in 9 RCTs that involved only colorectal surgeries ( RR 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.49-0.98 , p = 0.04). The mean hospital stay length was similar with coated or uncoated sutures in 5 RCTs involving colorectal surgery ( mean difference ( MD)- 5.00 , 95 % CI 16.68-6.69 , p = 0.4). Antimicrobial-coated sutures are significantly more efficacious for preventing SSIs during digestive and colorectal surgery , even when restricted to clean-contaminated wounds<disease> However , the hospital stay length was not affected.
