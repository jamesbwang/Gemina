Hormonal contraceptive use does not affect strength , endurance , or body composition adaptations to combined strength and endurance training in women. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study examined the effects of a 10-week period of high-intensity combined strength and endurance training on strength , endurance , body composition , and serum hormone concentrations in physically active women using hormonal contraceptives ( HCs , n = 9) compared with those who had never used hormonal contraceptives ( NHCs , n = 9). Training consisted of 2 strength training sessions and 2 high-intensity running interval sessions per week. Maximal bilateral isometric leg press ( Isom) , maximal bilateral dynamic leg press ( one repetition maximum ( 1RM)) , countermovement jump ( CMJ) , a 3,000-m running test ( 3,000 m) , body composition , and serum hormone levels were measured before and after training between days 1-5 of each subject 's menstrual cycle. Both groups increased 1RM and CMJ: HC = 13.2 % ( p < 0.001) and 9.6 % ( p < 0.05) , and NHC = 8.3 % ( p < 0.01) and 8.5 % ( p < 0.001). Hormonal contraceptive improved 3,000 m by 3.5 % ( p < 0.05) and NHC by 1 % ( n.s.). Never used hormonal contraceptive increased lean mass by 2.1 % ( p < 0.001) , whereas body fat percentage decreased from 23.9 ± 6.7 to 22.4 ± 6.0 ( -6.0 % , p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in body composition in HC. No significant between-group differences were observed in any of the performance variables. Luteinizing hormone concentrations decreased significantly ( p < 0.05) over 10 weeks in NHC , whereas other hormone levels remained statistically unaltered in both groups. It seems that the present training is equally appropriate for improving strength , endurance , and body composition in women using HC as those not using HC without disrupting hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function.
