  To evaluate radiation exposure in standard endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR) using intra-operative guidance with pre-operative computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) fusion and strict ALARA guidelines in a modern hybrid room. Between February and November 2016 , consecutive patients with AAA undergoing EVAR with a bifurcated device in a hybrid room under fusion imaging guidance were prospectively enrolled in six aortic centres from the United States ( n = 1) , Europe ( n = 4) , and Japan ( n = 1). Demographic data including body mass index ( BMI) , indirect dose area product ( DAP) , cumulative air kerma ( CAK) , variables influencing dose delivery , and contrast media volume were collected. 85 patients ( 90.4 % males) were included. The median age was 75 ( IQR 69-81) , with a median BMI of 27.4 ( IQR 24.7-30.6). Median DAP and CAK were 14.7 ( IQR 10.0-27.7) Gy Â· cm With adherence to the ALARA principle and routine application of fusion imaging guidance for EVAR , low radiation exposure compared with the published literature can be achieved in a real world setting.
