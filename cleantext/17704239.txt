  Tracers triggering αvβ3 integrins , such as certain RGD-containing peptides , were found promising in previous pilot studies characterizing high-grade gliomas. However , only limited comparisons have been performed with current PET tracers. This study aimed at comparing the biodistribution of Nude rodents bearing human U87-MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in the flank ( 34 tumors in mice) or in the brain ( 5 tumors in rats) were analyzed. Kinetics of Both tracers showed a primary renal route of clearance , although with faster clearance for None
