  To evaluate the effects of this thymol-rich oil in the proliferation of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells. Stem cells were isolated from human adipose tissue by liposuction. After the first passage , cells were cultivated in triplicate for three days in control medium and medium supplemented with three oil samples ( 1.0 μg/mL , 5.0 μg/mL , and 25.0 μg/mL). Cells were analyzed by the MTT assay at passage 1 ( P1) , and cell proliferation of control and 1 μg/mL groups was determined with a hemocytometer at P2 and P3. Viability of the essential oil-treated cells was significantly higher than the control group at P1 ( p = 0.0008). The treatment with the oil , at a concentration of 1 µg/mL , led to increases of 24.8 % at P1 and 43.0 % at P3 in the rate of cell proliferation compared with control cells. Supplementing culture medium with essential oil of Lippia origanoides increased cell proliferation , especially at later passages.
