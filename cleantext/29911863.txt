  Metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) have gained tremendous attention in the fields of environmental restoration and sustainable energy for their potential use as photocatalyst. Herein , a new two-dimensional ( 2D) Cu ( I)- based MOF material showing a narrow forbidden-band of 2.13 eV was successfully constructed using a visible-light-harvesting anthracene-based bipyridine ligand. The as-prepared MOF demonstrates high chemical stability and could be stable in the pH range 2-13 , which is favorable for its potential application in photocatalysis. Photocatalytic experiments demonstrate that this Cu ( I)- MOF exhibits high reactivity for reduction of Cr ( VI) in water , with 95 % Cr ( VI) converting to Cr ( III) in 10 min by using MeOH as scavenger under visible-light illumination. Furthermore , this MOF could behave as a highly active photocatalyst for H
