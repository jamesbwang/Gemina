  Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) are needed. The aim of this review was to systematically assess the effects of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 LC-PUFAs) , particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid , on liver-related and metabolic outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD. The online information service ProQuest Dialog was used to search 8 literature databases. Controlled intervention studies in which the independent effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs could be isolated were eligible for inclusion. The 18 unique studies that met the criteria for inclusion were divided into 2 sets , and data transcriptions and study quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Each effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference and 95 % CI , using a random-effects model and the inverse of the variance as a weighting factor. Based on the meta-analyses , supplementation with n-3 LC-PUFAs resulted in statistically significant improvements in 6 of 13 metabolic risk factors , in levels of 2 of 3 liver enzymes , in liver fat content ( assessed via magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy) , and in steatosis score ( assessed via ultrasonography). Histological measures of disease ( which were assessed only in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH)) were unaffected by n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation. Omega-3 LC-PUFAs are useful in the dietary management of patients with NAFLD. Additional trials are needed to better understand the effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs on histological outcomes in patients with NASH. PROSPERO CRD42017055951.
