  A high coronary artery calcium score ( CACS) predicts a poor prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. We examined the relationship between the bifurcation angle and the CACS of the left main ( LM) and left anterior descending ( LAD) arteries in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease ( CKD). We analyzed the data of 121 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography between October 2014 and June 2015 and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) was < 60 ml/min/1 .73 m2. The LM-LAD bifurcation angle was measured by 3-dimensional coronary computed tomography. The CACS of the LM-LAD arteries was also calculated. We excluded stent recipients and patient who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In the overall sample , the mean ± standard deviation ( range) LM-LAD bifurcation angle was 35.9 ± 11.4 ° ( 6.8-79.4 °) and mean CACS was 227 ± 351 ( 0 to 1,695). The mean LM-LAD arteries angle was 40.3 ° ± 10.0 ° in 39 patients whose CACS was ≥ 200 , versus 33.8 ° ± 11.6 ° in 82 patients with CACS < 200 ( p = 0.003). A weak , but positive correlation ( r = 0.269 , p = 0.003) was observed between the LM-LAD arteries angle and CACS of the LM-LAD arteries. By multiple variable analysis , hemoglobin A1c , triglycerides , eGFR and the LM-LAD arteries angle were independent predictors of a high CACS of the LM-LAD arteries. In patients with CKD , a wide LM-LAD arteries angle was associated with a high CACS of the LM-LAD arteries. The prognostic value of this observation warrants further evaluation.
