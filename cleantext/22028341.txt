  Although some countries have observed a stabilization in the incidence of CNS , an increasing incidence has been reported from multiple studies. Recent observations point out to the heterogeneity of incidence trends according to histological subtypes , gender and age-groups. Using a high-quality regional CNS tumor registry , this article describes the trends of CNS tumor incidence for main histological subtypes , including benign and malignant tumors , in the French department of Gironde from 2000 to 2012. Crude and age-standardized incidence rates were calculated globally , by histological subtypes , malignant status , gender and age groups. For trends , annual percent changes ( APC) were obtained from a piecewise log-linear model. A total of 3515 CNS tumors was registered during the period. The incidence of overall CNS tumors was 19/100000 person-years ( 8.3/ 100000 for neuroepithelial tumors and 7.3/ 100000 for meningeal tumors). An increased incidence of overall CNS tumors was observed from 2000 to 2012 ( APC = + 2.7 %; 95 %- confidence interval ( CI): 1.8-3.7). This trend was mainly explained by an increase in the incidence of meningiomas over the period ( APC = + 5.4 % , 95 %- CI: 3.8-7.0). The increased incidence rate of CNS tumors was more pronounced in female and in older patients even though the incidence rate increased in all age groups. Part of the temporal variation may be attributed to improvement in registration , diagnosis and clinical practices but also to changes in potential risk factors. Thus , etiological studies on CNS tumors are needed to clarify this rising trend.
