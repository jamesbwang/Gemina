  The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of 2-dimensional ( 2D) and 3-dimensional ( 3D) transthoracic echocardiography ( 2DTTE , 3DTTE) versus multidetector computed tomography ( MDCT) in patients with ascending aortic ( AA) dilation. Fifty consecutive patients with AA dilation were evaluated by 2DTTE , X-plane ( XP) 3DTTE , and MDCT. Aorta diameters were measured at aortic annulus , aortic root ( SIN) , sinotubular junction , AA , aortic arch before the prebrachiocephalic artery ( PRE) , and before left subclavian artery ( INTRA). Leading edge-to-leading edge ( L-L) and inner-to-inner ( I-I) measurements were compared with MDCT data. Feasibility , quality of imaging , and accuracy was high with all echocardiographic methods. Specifically for MDCT maximum SIN diameter , the best correlation and agreement was obtained using XP maximum diameter at 3DTTE ( MDCT: 44.8 ± 7.4 mm vs. XP: 44.4 ± 7.4 mm; r = 0.975; bias = -0.4 mm). The same was true for AA maximum diameter at MDCT ( MDCT: 46.6 ± 8.1 mm vs. XP: 47.5 ± 8.1 mm; r = 0.991; bias = 0.1 mm). For aortic arch the best correlation and agreement with MDCT were as follows: 2DTTE L-L diameter for arch PRE ( MDCT: 37.9 ± 5.3 mm vs. TTE: 36.6 ± 4.5 mm; r = 0.927; bias = -0.9 mm) and MDCT minimum diameter with XP minimum diameter for arch INTRA ( MDCT: 28.2 ± 5.0 mm vs. TTE 28.8 ± 4.7 mm; r = 0.939; bias = -0.3 mm). In patients with aortic dilatation or aneurysm<disease> , new techniques ( mainly 2D-3D probes allowing XP views) facilitate accuracy of aortic measurements at different sites of the vessel and allow standardization of analysis to better compare with MDCT.
