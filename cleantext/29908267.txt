  Twenty three strains of Penicillium<pathogen> expansum<pathogen> , as a predominant species , were isolated from 23 ( 92 %) out of 25 grape samples of 17 different grape varieties. The results of the identification of P.<pathogen> expansum<pathogen> strains were confirmed by a PCR method. Most of the isolates of P.<pathogen> expansum<pathogen> ( 21/23 , 91 %) , when tested for toxigenicity , were bi-toxigenic: they produced citrinin ( CIT) and particularly high amounts of patulin ( PAT). A validated UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of PAT and CIT was applied. The limits of quantification ( LOQ) for PAT and CIT in grape must and toxigenicity testing samples were 100 and 2 ng/g , respectively. The results of PAT and CIT quantification in 23 grape must samples demonstrated the occurrence of PAT in 10 ( 43 %) grape must samples ( mean: 171 ng/g; median: 50 ng/g; and range: 143-644 ng/g) and the occurrence of CIT in two ( 9 %) grape must samples ( mean: 1 ng/g; median: 1 ng/g; and range: 2.5-3.5 ng/g). This is the first report on the natural occurrence of CIT in grape must. A validated HPLC-UV-VIS method for the determination of PAT in wine samples was applied , and concentrations in all 23 wine samples were below the LOQ ( < 10 ng/g).
