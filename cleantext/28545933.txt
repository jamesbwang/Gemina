  Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI , ECoG and EEG , which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state , often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here , we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First , how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods , and second , how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end , we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects ( N
