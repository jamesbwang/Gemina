  Viscoelastic polymers can be used as damping materials to control unexpected vibration and noise through energy dissipation. To investigate the effect of an inorganic filler on damping property , a series of inorganic particles , Ferriferous oxide ( Fe ₃ O ₄) , Graphene/Fe ₃ O ₄ ( GF) , and Fe ₃ O ₄ of demagnetization ( & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃) were incorporated into poly ( butyl-methacrylate) ( PBMA). The effects of the dispersion of particles , as well as the interaction between particles and the PBMA matrix on the damping property of composites , were systematically studied. Results revealed that the addition of three types of particles can effectively improve the damping properties and broaden the effective damping temperature range. Dispersion of & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃ in the PBMA matrix is better than that of Fe ₃ O ₄. As a result , the damping peak can be increased more. The interaction between GF and the PBMA matrix is stronger than that between Fe ₃ O ₄ and the PBMA. The damping peak of the composites can be suppressed by GF , which is opposite to Fe ₃ O ₄ and & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃. In addition , glass transition temperature ( T
