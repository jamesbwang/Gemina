  Phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1 ( PAG1) is a ubiquitous protein that is essential for the development and progression of various malignancies. A previous study in our laboratory confirmed that PAG1 plays an important role in modulating the inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells , but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly defined. In this study , we found that PAG1 was significantly increased in laryngeal cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues ( P < 0.05). The expression of PAG1 was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis ( P < 0.05) and TNM stage ( P < 0.05). High expression of PAG1 also predicted a poor prognosis in patients with laryngeal cancer. Moreover , gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that PAG1 overexpression was able to promote growth , increase migration and invasion , and enhance inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of STAT3 was required for PAG1-mediated inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer. Inhibition of STAT3 activity with a chemical inhibitor sensitized radioresistant cells to radiation. Importantly , PAG1-integrin Î²1 complex was involved in the regulation of STAT3 activation. In addition , downregulation of PAG1 could suppress tumor growth and reverse inherent radioresistance in the nude mouse xenograft model. Taken together , these results suggested that PAG1 conferred inherent radioresistance by activating STAT3 , which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer.
