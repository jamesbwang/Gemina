  To elucidate the Cdk5 regulatory molecular mechanism in skin , we generated Cdk5-knockdown mice and subjected their skins<disease> to lncRNA sequencing. The results showed that there were 4533 novel lncRNAs from 142 lncRNA families. In total , 693 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed. Alignment analysis of the lncRNAs in miRBase identified 45 pre-mRNAs. By KEGG PATHWAY Database analysis , we found that lncRNAs ( lnc-NONMMUT064276.2 , lnc-NONMMUT075728.1 , and lnc-NONMMUT039653.2) may regulate pigmentation by regulating target genes. To reveal potential antisense lncRNA-mRNA interactions , we searched all lncRNA-mRNA duplexes using RNAplex , and found 97 lncRNAs interacted with mRNAs. The luciferase assay confirmed that TCONS_00049140 binded to Krt80 by the co-transfection of pVAX1-TCONS_00049140 and pGL0-Krt80 expression plasmids in 293T cell , based on the bioinformatics analysis. Overexpression of TCONS_00049140 in mouse melanocytes down-regulated Krt80 and resulted in the phenotype of increased cell proliferation and increased melanin production. The results suggested that TCONS_00049140 contributed to skin thickening through Krt80. Our findings provide a direction for research of the molecular mechanism of Cdk5 function.
