  Oxaliplatin , a chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer , has been associated with pathological evidence of sinusoidal endothelial injury in the liver. However , esophagogastric varices are a poorly recognized outcome of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. We report a 78-year-old man , whose past history of colon cancer was resection and treatment with mFOLFOX6 for 20 weeks , as adjuvant chemotherapy. After 3.5-year follow-up of the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy , he was diagnosed with esophageal varices without liver dysfunction , indicating that the hepatotoxicity caused by oxaliplatin could be prolonged after its administration. Patients who have received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be followed up carefully over the long term.
