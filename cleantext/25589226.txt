  Consumption of diets high in fat and/or fructose content promotes tissue inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress , and insulin resistance , activating signals ( e.g. NF-ÎºB/JNK) that downregulate the insulin cascade. Current evidence supports the concept that select flavonoids can mitigate obesity and type 2 diabetes ( T2D). This work investigated if supplementation with the anthocyanidins ( AC) cyanidin and delphinidin could attenuate the adverse consequences of consuming a high fat diet ( HFD) in mice. Consumption of an AC-rich blend mitigated HFD-induced obesity , dyslipidemia and insulin resistance ( impaired responses to insulin and glucose). HFD-fed mice were characterized by increased liver lipid deposition and inflammation<symptom> , which were also attenuated upon AC supplementation. HFD caused liver oxidative stress showing an increased expression of NADPH oxidases , generators of superoxide and H
