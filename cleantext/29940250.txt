  To evaluate the psychosocial outcomes , psychosexual development and sexual function in adolescents operated for proximal hypospadias , which we hypothesized would be impaired compared to peers. Fifty-five young men â‰¥ 14 years operated between 1996-2005 for penoscrotal to perineal ( intraoperatively defined) hypospadias were identified. Thirty-three patients , Md 17.5 years ( 14-25) , answered a web-based questionnaire with self-constructed questions and the validated tests; PGWB ( Psychological General Well Being) , BESAA ( Body Esteem of Adults and Adolescents) and PPS ( Penile Perception Score) , in addition to a clinical evaluation. Thirty-one patients with distal hypospadias , Md 19 years ( 14-35) , and 25 age-matched healthy men , Md 17.5 years ( 14-25) , served as controls. Interest in sex , age at sexarche and satisfaction with sexual experiences were comparable to control groups. 3/30 ( 10 %) proximal hypospadias patients and 1/25 ( 4 %) controls reported occasional erectile problems. 3/28 ( 11 %) proximal , 1/31 ( 3 %) distal and 1/25 ( 4 %) controls affirmed anejaculation. There were no differences in PGWB , BESAA or PPS. Proximal hypospadias patients were more dissatisfied with penile length ( 39 %) compared to controls ( 12 %) ( p = 0.049). Concerning physical contact , 10/26 ( 38 %) expressed uncertainty. Extra support in school was more frequent among proximal hypospadias patients ( p = 0.024 vs distal , p = 0.068 vs control). Despite concerns regarding penile length , sexual experiences were comparable to those of other adolescents , but more than a third of patients with proximal hypospadias showed uncertainty in questions relating to desire of physical contact. Specialized tutoring in school was more common. Continuous follow-up throughout childhood allowing extra time for age-adequate information and support is warranted.
