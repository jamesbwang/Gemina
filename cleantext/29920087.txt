  This study assesses the effects of cyclic fatty acid monomers ( CFAM) from heated vegetable oils on oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom>. Wistar rats were fed either of these four diets for 28 days: canola oil ( CO) , canola oil and 0.5 % CFAM ( CC) , soybean oil ( SO) , and soybean oil and 0.5 % CFAM ( SC). Markers of oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> were determined by micro liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( micro-LC-MS/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) kits , respectively. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA) for a 2 × 2 factorial design was performed to determine the CFAM and oil effects and interactions between these two factors at P ≤ 0.05. For significant interactions , a post hoc multiple comparison test was performed , i.e. , Tukey HSD ( honest significant difference) test. CFAM induced higher plasma levels of 15-F
