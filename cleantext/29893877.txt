  Liver abscesses<disease> ( LA) in cattle negatively affect feedlot performance by decreasing ADG , feed intake , and G: F ratio. Abscessed livers are condemned and abdominal adhesions associated with LA can result in extensive carcass trimming during harvest , further compounding adverse economic impact. Given regulatory changes pertaining to the use of in-feed antibiotics in cattle production , there is growing interest in alternatives to antibiotics for LA control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of antioxidants , crystalline ascorbate and alpha tocopherol acetate , for mitigation of LA in feedlot cattle. Yearling crossbred heifers ( n = 392; initial BW 481 ± 9.4 kg) were blocked by previous treatment and allocated randomly to 24 dirt-surfaced feedlot pens ( 10 m x 35 m) with 14 heifers/pen. Heifers were weighed , implanted with Component ® TE-200 implants , and placed into feeding pens. Finishing diets consisted of 60 % steam-flaked corn , 30 % wet corn gluten feed , 8 % alfalfa , and 2 % supplement ( DM basis) that provided 300 mg/d monensin , and either 200 IU/d alpha tocopherol acetate ( CTL) or 2000 IU/d alpha tocopherol acetate plus 500 mg/d crystalline ascorbate ( AOX). Heifers were fed once daily ad libitum for 94 d , then weighed and transported 450 km to a commercial abattoir for harvest. Hot carcass weight and incidence/severity of LA were determined the day of harvest , and carcass traits were evaluated following 36 h of refrigeration. Compared to CTL , feeding AOX tended to decrease DMI ( 10.66 vs. 10.31 kg/d; P = 0.08) and improve G: F ( 0.1204 vs. 0.1254; P = 0.12) , but did not impact ADG , incidence of LA ( 25.6 vs 23.5 % for CTL and AOX , respectively) , HCW ( 828.4 vs 830.5 kg for CTL and AOX , respectively) , or other carcass traits ( P > 0.20). In conclusion , feeding antioxidants is not a viable alternative to decrease incidence of liver abscesses<disease> in finishing cattle.
