  Young Hispanic women have been particularly affected by HIV<pathogen>. For this reason , we analyzed the influence of cognitive factors , dispositional variables , and gender culture on the HIV<pathogen> risks of two groups of Hispanic women. Young Argentinian and Spanish women ( N = 342) completed the AIDS Prevention Questionnaire , the Spanish version of the Sexual Compulsivity Scale , and the Spanish version of the Sexual Sensation Seeking Scale in order to evaluate knowledge of HIV<pathogen> transmission , HIV<pathogen> , and condom use; self-efficacy; safe-sex intention and safe sex; as well as Sexual Sensation Seeking and Sexual Compulsivity traits. Our findings support a different pattern of HIV<pathogen> risk based on gender inequality , although self-efficacy and sexual sensation seeking seem to have been the main important predictors of unsafe sex and HIV<pathogen> risk. Social and psychological factors should be considered to design HIV<pathogen> prevention strategies aimed at young Hispanic women.
