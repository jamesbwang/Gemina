  Methods are presented for the use of the coral 8R-lipoxygenase from the Caribbean sea whip coral Plexaura homomalla as a model enzyme for structural studies of animal lipoxygenases. The 8R-lipoxygenase is remarkably stable and can be stored at 4 Â°C for 3 months with virtually no loss of activity. In addition , an engineered `` pseudo wild-type '' enzyme is soluble in the absence of detergents , which helps facilitate the preparation of enzyme: substrate complexes.
