  The phase transition of monolayer black phosphorene ( MBP , α-P) to β-P and γ-P is explored by density functional theory ( DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations using reactive force fields. It is found that MBP can convert to a mixed phase of β-P and γ-P under biaxial strain , while the Stone-Wales defect ( SW-2) in MBP can serve as an excellent ` phase transition catalyzer ' , significantly decreasing the critical strain for phase transition and increasing the homogeneity of the phase transition. The biaxial strain state ( i.e. the strain components in the armchair and zigzag direction) and loading mode ( i.e. the proportional and staged loading) have significant effects on the phase transition of MBP. In general , the phase transition of MBP is driven by the tension strain in the armchair direction , but large tension or compression strain in the zigzag direction can also promote the phase transition. Besides , MBP has a larger fracture strain under staged loading , generating a more uniform phase transition structure. The effects of curvature and SW-2 defect concentration on the phase transition of MBP are also studied , which shows an easier phase transition for a larger curvature and higher SW-2 defect concentration. The systematic results presented herein provide useful insights for designing and tuning the structure of MBP through phase transition facilitated by strain and defect engineering.
