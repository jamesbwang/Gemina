  The nonword repetition task ( NWR) has been widely used in basic cognitive and clinical research , as well as in clinical assessment , and has been proposed as a clinical marker for Specific Language Impairment ( SLI). Yet the mechanisms underlying performance on this task are not clear. This study offers insights into these mechanisms through a comprehensive examination of item-related variables identified in previous research as possibly contributing to NWR scores and through testing the predictive power of each in relation to the others. A unique feature of the study is that all factors are considered simultaneously. Fifty-seven typically developing children were tested with a NWR task containing 150 nonwords differing in length , phonotactic probability , lexical neighbourhood and phonological complexity. The results indicate that phonological processing of novel words draws on sublexical representations at all grain sizes and that these representations are phonological , unstructured and insensitive to morphemehood. We propose a novel index- mean ngram frequency of all phonemes- that best captures the extent to which a nonword draws on sublexical representations. The study demonstrates the primacy of sublexical representations in NWR performance with implications for the nature of the deficit in SLI.
