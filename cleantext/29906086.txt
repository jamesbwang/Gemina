  A new electrosynthetic approach for the fabrication of three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporous platinum-based ( 3D-BC-NP-Pt ( Au)) electrodes is described. Binary Pt-Ag alloys are first electrodeposited on gold substrates from appropriately formulated plating solutions. Following annealing and dealloying , a new family of nanoporous platinum-based electrodes emerges whose morphology , porosity , and chemical compositions depend on electrodeposition parameters and plating solution composition. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal an interesting and distinctive nanoporous gold-like microstructure with pores and ligaments in the 10-30 nm range arranged in a bicontinuous fashion throughout the thickness of the film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) confirms that the as-formed electrodeposited films are silver-rich platinum binary alloys. Interestingly , XPS also reveals that after annealing and dealloying , the electrodes are actually ternary alloys containing platinum , gold , and a small amount of residual silver that remains after dealloying. Electrochemical measurements are consistent with this result and disclose a high surface area with roughness factors of 15-24. The ability to successfully conduct electrochemical measurements in biofouling solutions via a unique biosieving-like mechanism is demonstrated by exposure of the unique 3D bicontinuous nanoporous platinum-based electrode to fibrinogen in phosphate buffer and in a solution containing red blood cells. The work described herein has the potential to enrich the fields of electrochemical sensing and biosensing via the introduction of new 3D bicontinuous nanostructured porous platinum-based electrodes that can be easily and reliably fabricated.
