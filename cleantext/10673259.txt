  Left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) is a major contributor to the development of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). Alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP)- dependent signaling pathways participate in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in LVH and HF. cAMP signals are received and integrated by a family of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA) anchor proteins ( AKAPs) , tethering PKA to discrete cellular locations. AKAPs encoded by the
