  Although the diverse biological properties of nanoparticles have been studied intensively , research into their mechanism of action is relatively rare. In this study , we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the anticancer activity of heterometallic Au@Pt-nanoseeds ( NSs) against bladder cancers. Mode of action of Au@Pt-NSs was investigated through MTT assay , flow cytometry analysis , Western immunoblots , real-time qPCR , wound-healing migration and invasion assays , zymography , and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA). Treatment with Au@Pt-NSs significantly inhibited the proliferation of EJ cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Among the regulators associated with the G1 cell cycle phase , CDK2 , CDK4 , cyclin D1 , cyclin E , and p21WAF1 were shown to participate in the inhibitory pathways of Au@Pt-NSs. In addition , treatment with Au@Pt-NSs led to upregulation of phospho-p38 MAPK and downregulation of phospho-AKT in EJ cells. Interestingly , Au@Pt-NSs inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of the cells , which was attributed to the suppression of the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9). Using MMP-9-specific oligonucleotides , we showed that transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB and Sp-1 were responsible for the MMP-9-mediated metastatic potential of EJ cells. Au@Pt-NSs significantly limited the progression , migration , and invasion of bladder cancer EJ cells. Our data represent a novel insight into developing cisplatin-like chemotherapeutic reagents with fewer side effects and provide useful information on molecular markers to monitor patients under Au@Pt-NSs-based chemotherapy.
