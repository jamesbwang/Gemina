  This manuscript introduces a novel concept for measuring coil coupling for extremely loose-coupled coils ( coupling factors k < 10-6; mutual inductance values M < 10-10 H). Such a coupling is found everywhere where the ratio of solenoid diameter to coil spacing is > 50. Measuring these quantities with a low-power technology requires a sophisticated setup that goes beyond the sensitivity of state-of-the art approaches. The methodology is validated using laboratory measurements with three sets of solenoids ( two ferrite-cored , one air-cored) and numerical simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 a , Stockholm , Sweden. The concept is then employed to investigate the channel characteristics for inductive through-the-head communication within the 3.155-3.195 MHz band. This selected part of the spectrum is in accordance with International Telecommunication Union Radio Regulation 5.116 for low-power wireless hearing aids. By applying a phantom solution , we demonstrate that human tissue layers are transparent for magnetic fields within these frequencies. However , the influence from the relative coil arrangement is evaluated in detail as it restricts the communication range significantly. The coupling results for off-the-shelf Sonion , Roskilde , Denmark , RF 02 AA 10 solenoids considering both lateral and axial displacements might be of special interest for a number of near-field applications.
