  Despite declining cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. , there is a continued need for tobacco prevention education campaigns to reach young adults. This report describes an initiative from the University of Texas System to develop a health communication effort that would strengthen tobacco control and prevention efforts at its 14 diverse institutions. The process involved enlisting expertise in evidence-based health communication , developing a brand and visual identity for tobacco control that all of the 14 system institutions could agree on , and providing all schools the tools to use the new brand effectively. This effort forged new interdisciplinary connections across academic institutions and offers a model for other systems of higher education interested in pursuing similar initiatives.
