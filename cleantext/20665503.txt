  Transoral laser microsurgery ( TLM) is a minimally invasive surgical alternative for radiotherapy ( RT) in the primary management of early glottic cancer. More recently , TLM emerged also as a possible salvage treatment for selected radiorecurrent cancers. We reviewed outcomes of primary and salvage TLM performed in a Belgian tertiary referral center. A retrospective review of records from 142 consecutive patients who underwent TLM was performed. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Variation of estimated outcomes between different subgroups was evaluated using Log-Rank analysis. Of 142 patients , 109 ( 76.8 %) underwent TLM as a primary treatment and 33 ( 23.2 %) were treated in a salvage setting for recurrent or second primary glottic cancer. cT classification in the up-front TLM group was cT1a in 72 ( 66.1 %) , cT1b in 11 ( 10.1 %) , and cT2 in 26 ( 23.9 %) patients. In the salvage group , patients were cT/rT classified as cT1a-rT1a in 17 ( 51.5 %) , cT1b-rT1b in 1 ( 3.0 %) , cT2-rT2 in 14 ( 42.4 %) , and cT3-rT3 in 1 ( 3.0 %) patients. All patients were cN0. Second-look TLM was performed in 28 patients ( 19.7 %) , and RT was associated as adjuvant therapy in 5 patients ( 3.5 %). Mean follow-up was 51.6 months ( SD = 38.4 months). Three-year overall survival ( OS) was 94.1 % ( SE = 2.2 %) , 3-year disease-specific survival ( DSS) 100 % , 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS) 80.1 % ( SE = 3.8 %) , 3-year local recurrence-free survival ( RFS) 81.0 % ( SE = 3.7 %) , and 3-year ultimate local control rate with laser alone 89.2 % ( SE = 3.0 %). Upon subgroup analysis , no differences in OS , DSS , and DFS were observed between the up-front and salvage group ( log rank; This retrospective study confirms excellent oncologic outcomes of up-front TLM for early glottic cancer. In the salvage setting , TLM allows avoidance of total laryngectomy in the majority of cases.
