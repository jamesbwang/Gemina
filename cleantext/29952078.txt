  To date , numerous studies have confirmed empirical relevance of the personality trait model defined in the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders. The supposed single-factor structure of its facets and general domains across various samples , however , has not been researched thoroughly. This study focused on evaluating the hypothesized unidimensional factor structure of the lower-order personality trait facets , as well as the validity of the higher-order domains. The Czech version of the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 ( PID-5) was used in a sample of 351 community volunteers and 143 psychiatric patients. The fit of the model for 25 facets could not be replicated with the original PID-5 , while a shortened version confirmed the single-factor structure of all facets and their relevance to the five proposed domains. The findings support unidimensional structure of the modified DSM-5 personality trait model and imply discussion of the utility of the proposed PID-5 version.
