  To report visual and refractive outcomes after implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens ( IOL) in highly myopic patients. Department of Ophthalmology , Goethe University , Frankfurt , Germany. Retrospective case series. This study included eyes with previous phacoemulsification and implantation of a trifocal IOL ( AT LISA tri 839MP or 939MP) with an IOL power between 0.0 diopter ( D) and 10.0 D. Postoperative outcomes at 3 months including uncorrected distance ( UDVA) , intermediate ( UIVA) , and near visual acuity ( UNVA) , corrected distance visual acuity , spherical equivalent , and refractive astigmatism were analyzed. Age-matched eyes after implantation of the same trifocal IOL with higher dioptric power ( > 10.0 D) served as controls. Thirty-six eyes of 19 patients were included: 18 eyes ( 10 patients) in the highly myopic group ( IOL power 0.0 to 10.0 D) and 18 eyes ( 9 patients) in the age-matched control group ( IOL power > 10.0 D). Three months postoperatively , the mean UDVA , UIVA , and UNVA in the highly myopic group were 0.06 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR) ± 0.08 ( SD) , 0.13 ± 0.09 logMAR , and 0.12 ± 0.07 logMAR , and -0.01 ± 0.10 logMAR , 0.04 ± 0.10 logMAR , and 0.04 ± 0.11 logMAR in the control group , respectively ( P = .022 , P = .033 , P = .053 , respectively). Implantation of a trifocal IOL in highly myopic eyes with low IOL power ( 0.0 to 10.0 D) provided satisfactory short-term visual and refractive outcomes; however , results were not as good as those obtained in eyes with higher dioptric IOL power.
