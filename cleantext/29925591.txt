  Volume-regulated anion channels ( VRACs) are crucial for cell volume regulation and have various roles in physiology and pathology. VRACs were recently discovered to be formed by heteromers of LRRC8 ( leucine-rich repeat-containing 8) proteins. However , the structural determinants of VRAC permeation and gating remain largely unknown. We show here that the short stretch preceding the first LRRC8 transmembrane domain determines VRAC conductance , ion permeability and inactivation gating. Substituted cysteine accessibility studies revealed that several of the first 15 LRRC8 residues are functionally important and exposed to a hydrophilic environment. Substituting glutamate 6 with cysteine decreased the amplitudes of swelling-activated ICl , vol currents , strongly increased iodide-over-chloride permeability , and markedly shifted the voltage-dependence of channel inactivation. Importantly , these effects were reversed by 2-sulfonatoethyl-methanethiosulfonate which restores the negative charge at this amino-acid position. Cd2 +- mediated blocking of ICl , vol in cysteine variants suggested that the LRRC8 N-termini come close together in the multimeric channel complex and might form part of the pore. We propose a model in which the N termini of the LRRC8 subunits line the cytoplasmic portion of the VRAC pore , possibly by folding back into the ion permeation pathway.
