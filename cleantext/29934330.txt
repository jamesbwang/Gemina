  Bifidobacteria are a major component of the intestinal microbiota in humans , particularly breast-fed infants. Therefore , elucidation of the mechanisms by which these bacteria colonize the intestine is desired. One approach is transposon mutagenesis , a technique currently attracting much attention because , in combination with next-generation sequencing , it enables exhaustive identification of genes that contribute to microbial fitness. We now describe a transposon mutagenesis system for
