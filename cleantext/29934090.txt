  A systematic review of the current literature on the efficacy of baclofen , particularly the effect of dosing , for the treatment of alcohol dependence ( AD) is missing. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available randomized placebo-controlled trials ( RCTs). A systematic literature search for RCTs in AD patients comparing baclofen to placebo was performed in September 2017. The effect of baclofen treatment , and the moderating effects of baclofen dosing ( low-dose ( LDB) 30-60 mg versus high-dose ( HDB) targeted as > 60 mg/day) , and the amount of alcohol consumption before inclusion were studied. Three treatment outcomes were assessed: time to lapse ( TTL) , percentage days abstinent ( PDA) , and percentage of patients abstinent at end point ( PAE). 13 RCTs from 39 records were included. Baclofen was superior to placebo with significant increases in TTL ( 8 RCTs , 852 patients; SMD = 0.42; 95 % CI 0.19-0.64) and PAE ( 8 RCTs , 1244 patients; OR = 1.93; 95 % CI 1.17-3.17) , and a non-significant increase in PDA ( 7 RCTs , 457 patients; SMD = 0.21; 95 % CI -0.24 to 0.66). Overall , studies with LDB showed better efficacy than studies with HDB. Furthermore , tolerability of HDB was low , but serious adverse events were rare. Meta-regression analysis showed that the effects of baclofen were stronger when daily alcohol consumption before inclusion was higher. Baclofen seems to be effective in the treatment of AD , especially among heavy drinkers. HDB is not necessarily more effective than LDB with low tolerability of HDB being an import limitation.
