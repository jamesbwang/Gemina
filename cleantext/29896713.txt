  Histological analysis of mouse embryos , fetuses , or newborns remains one the most common methods and in some cases the `` gold standard '' used in teratology studies to detect abnormal morphogenesis during development. Histochemistry methods are based on the selectivity of certain chemical compounds for certain cellular or tissue components , several of them related to specific maturation processes. In this chapter , specific histochemistry techniques that allow for the monitoring of critical stages of tissue and organ formation , such as skeleton and muscle differentiation , neuronal maturation , neuronal connectivity , and neurodevelopment after teratogenic exposure are described in detail.
