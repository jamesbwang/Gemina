  To investigate prognostic models in a cohort of dogs with acute kidney injury ( AKI) and acute on chronic kidney disease ( AKI/CKD) managed by hemodialysis. Retrospective study from July 2011 to November 2014. University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Forty dogs with historical , clinical , imaging , and laboratory findings consistent with AKI or AKI/CKD managed with intermittent hemodialysis were included. Scoring system models previously established by Segev et al for outcome prediction in dogs with AKI were applied to all dogs. Models A , B , and C correctly classified outcomes in 68 % , 83 % , and 85 % of cases , respectively. In our cohort Model A showed sensitivity of 58 % and specificity of 86 % , Model B showed sensitivity of 79 % and specificity of 87 % , Model C showed sensitivity of 86 % and specificity of 84 %. The presence of anuria ( P < 0.0002) , respiratory complications ( P < 0.0001) , disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC) ( P = 0.0004) , grade of AKI ( P = 0.0023) , pancreatitis<disease> ( P = 0.0001) , and systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> ( SIRS) ( P = 0.0001) was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. In our cohort of patients , Segev 's model C showed the best sensitivity and specificity for predicting prognosis , while model A had lower sensitivity. In our cohort of dialysis patients , the presence of respiratory complications , DIC , SIRS , and pancreatitis<disease> at hospitalization , were correlated with a poor prognosis.
