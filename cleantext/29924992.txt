  The TRPM7 chanzyme contributes to several biological and pathological processes in different tissues. However , its role in the CNS under physiological conditions remains unclear. Here , we show that TRPM7 knockdown in hippocampal neurons reduces structural synapse density. The synapse density is rescued by the Î±-kinase domain in the C terminus but not by the ion channel region of TRPM7 or by increasing extracellular concentrations of Mg
