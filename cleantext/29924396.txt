  The Polygenic Risk Scores ( PRS) approach is becoming increasingly prominent in psycho-behavioral research , however , its translational potential is still relatively underconceptualized. Indeed , PRS paradigm ( which capitalizes on the combination of multiple genetic markers into a single proxy score to predict lifetime outcomes) has the potential to unravel some of the developmental complexities leading to severe mental disorders. With respect to schizophrenia , the application of PRS approach to child-adolescent cohorts from the general population , provides a crucial vantage point for understanding how presumed genetic predisposition is manifested during developmental years. Clearly , this is essential for etiological research as well as for the timely identification of the earliest stages of those specific psychopathological trajectories leading to psychosis. Therefore , the translational import of the PRS approach could improve our etiopathogenetic understanding of schizophrenia ( e.g. , allowing the disentanglement of the respective contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors along neurodevelopment) and further refine current staging models for early detection of vulnerability to psychosis ( e.g. , providing the rationale for more developmentally oriented reformulations of clinical high-risk criteria).
