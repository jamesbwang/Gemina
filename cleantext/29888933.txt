  Discrete emotion theories emphasize the modularity of facial expressions , while functionalist theories suggest that a single facial action may have a common meaning across expressions. Smiles involving the Duchenne marker , eye constriction causing crow 's feet , are perceived as intensely positive and sincere. To test whether the Duchenne marker is a general index of intensity and sincerity , we contrasted positive and negative expressions with and without the Duchenne marker in a binocular rivalry paradigm. Both smiles and sad expressions involving the Duchenne marker were perceived longer than non-Duchenne expressions , and participants rated all Duchenne expressions as more affectively intense and more sincere than their non-Duchenne counterparts. Correlations between perceptual dominance and ratings suggested that the Duchenne marker increased the dominance of smiles and sad expressions by increasing their perceived affective intensity. The results provide evidence in favor of Darwin 's hypothesis that specific facial actions have a general function ( conveying affect intensification and sincerity) across expressions.
