  This review evaluates the use of temperature-sensitive ( ts) mutants to investigate functional molecules in mammalian cells. A series of studies were performed in which mammalian cells expressing functional molecules were isolated from ts mutants using complementation by the introduction and expression of the responsible protein tagged with the green fluorescent protein. The results showed that chromosome instability and cell-cycle arrest were caused by ts defects in the following three molecules: the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II , a protein involved in splicing , and ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The cells expressing functional protein were then isolated by introducing the responsible gene tagged with the green fluorescent protein to complement the ts phenotype. These cells proved to be useful in analyzing the dynamics of RNA polymerase II in living cells. Analyses of the functional interaction between proteins involved in splicing were also useful in the investigation of ts mutants and their derivatives. In addition , these cells demonstrated the functional localization of ubiquitin-activating enzyme in the nucleus. Mammalian ts mutants continue to show great potential to aid in understanding the functions of the essential molecules in cells. Therefore , it is highly important that studies on the identification and characterization of the genes responsible for the phenotype of a mutant are carried out.
