  The cerebral cortex undergoes rapid folding in an `` inside-outside '' manner during embryonic development resulting in the establishment of six discrete cortical layers. This unique cytoarchitecture occurs via the coordinated processes of neurogenesis and cell migration. In addition , these processes are fine-tuned by a number of extracellular cues , which exert their effects by regulating intracellular signaling pathways. Interestingly , multiple brain regions have been shown to develop in a sexually dimorphic manner. In many cases , estrogens have been demonstrated to play an integral role in mediating these sexual dimorphisms in both males and females. Indeed , 17β-estradiol , the main biologically active estrogen , plays a critical organizational role during early brain development and has been shown to be pivotal in the sexually dimorphic development and regulation of the neural circuitry underlying sex-typical and socio-aggressive behaviors in males and females. However , whether and how estrogens , and 17β-estradiol in particular , regulate the development of the cerebral cortex is less well understood. In this review , we outline the evidence that estrogens are not only present but are engaged and regulate molecular machinery required for the fine-tuning of processes central to the cortex. We discuss how estrogens are thought to regulate the function of key molecular players and signaling pathways involved in corticogenesis , and where possible , highlight if these processes are sexually dimorphic. Collectively , we hope this review highlights the need to consider how estrogens may influence the development of brain regions directly involved in the sex-typical and socio-aggressive behaviors as well as development of sexually dimorphic regions such as the cerebral cortex.
