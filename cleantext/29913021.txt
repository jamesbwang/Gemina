  To develop a simple prognostic model using postnatal weight gain , birth weight , and gestational age to identify infants at risk for developing severe retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP). Medical records from two tertiary referral centers with the diagnosis code `` Retinopathy of Prematurity '' were evaluated. Those with a birth weight of 1,500 g or less , gestational age of 30 weeks or younger , and unstable clinical courses were included. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to transform three independent variables into a growth rate algorithm. Seventeen of 191 neonates had severe ROP. Weight gain of at least 23 g/d was determined as a protective cut-off value against development of severe ROP. This value maintained 100 % sensitivity with 62 % specificity to ensure all neonates who require treatment would be captured. Overall , the Omaha ( OMA)- ROP model calculated a 58 % reduction in eye examinations within the cohort. Inclusion of postnatal growth rate in risk stratification will minimize the number of eye examinations performed without increasing adverse visual outcomes. The OMA-ROP model predicts neonates who gain less than 23 g/d are at higher risk for developing severe ROP. Although promising , larger cohort studies may be necessary to validate and implement new screening practices among preterm infants. ( J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 201X; XX ( X): XX-XX.).
