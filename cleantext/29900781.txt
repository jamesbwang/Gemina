  The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is home to the largest captive assurance population of the critically endangered Panamanian golden frog ( Atelopus zeteki). With the ongoing extinction that is occurring worldwide in amphibians , the need for amphibian captive assurance populations is growing , and few mortality reviews on amphibian species exist. Necropsy<disease> and histopathologic examination of animals that die in captivity can help identify population-level disease problems , direct research needs in amphibian medicine and husbandry , and improve the success of captive breeding programs. This study reviews postmortem findings from 406 frogs , greater than 1 yr of age , which died in this population from 2001 to 2013. Frogs were categorized by age and sex , and the cause of mortality was determined. Dermatitis<disease> associated with filamentous-type fungal organisms was the most common cause of mortality in both age and sex categories and accounted for one-third of frog deaths in this study ( 36.0 %; n = 146 out of 406 frogs). Other major causes of mortality included renal disease , gastrointestinal disease , septicemia<disease> , and a previously undescribed myopathy condition associated with a tetany syndrome<disease>. Increased mortality of frogs occurred during the breeding season , highlighting the need for further research into methods to minimize mortality during this time.
