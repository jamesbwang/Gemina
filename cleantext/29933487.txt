  Hearing loss is common among typically aging older adults and those with dementia. In recent years , there has been a renewed interest in the relationship between hearing and cognition among older adults , and in hearing loss as a modifiable risk factor for dementia. However , relatively less attention has been focused on the management of hearing loss among individuals with dementia and the key roles of speech-language pathologists and audiologists in providing such care. In this article , the authors review the literature on hearing loss and dementia , and analyze the research evidence for treatment of hearing loss in the context of major neurocognitive disorders , such as Alzheimer 's disease. This article provides an up-to-date review of research evidence for hearing interventions , as well as recommendations for speech-language pathologists and audiologists to work together to ensure access to hearing health care and increased opportunities for meaningful life engagement for people with dementia and hearing loss.
