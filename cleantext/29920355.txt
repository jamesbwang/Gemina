  The evolution of chemical complexity has been a major driver of plant diversification , with novel compounds serving as key innovations. The species-rich mint family ( Lamiaceae) produces an enormous variety of compounds that act as attractants and defense molecules in nature and are used widely by humans as flavor additives , fragrances , and anti-herbivory agents. To elucidate the mechanisms by which such diversity evolved , we combined leaf transcriptome data from 48 Lamiaceae species and four outgroups with a robust phylogeny and chemical analyses of three terpenoid classes ( monoterpenes , sesquiterpenes , and iridoids) that share and compete for precursors. Our integrated chemical-genomic-phylogenetic approach revealed that: ( 1) gene family expansion rather than increased enzyme promiscuity of terpene synthases is correlated with mono- and sesquiterpene diversity; ( 2) differential expression of core genes within the iridoid biosynthetic pathway is associated with iridoid presence/absence; ( 3) generally , production of iridoids and canonical monoterpenes appears to be inversely correlated; and ( 4) iridoid biosynthesis is significantly associated with expression of geraniol synthase , which diverts metabolic flux away from canonical monoterpenes , suggesting that competition for common precursors can be a central control point in specialized metabolism. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms contributed to the evolution of chemodiversity in this economically important family.
