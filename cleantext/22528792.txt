  Peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( PNSTs) may arise sporadically or in the presence of genetic disorders , including neurofibromatosis ( NF) types<pathogen> 1 and 2 , schwannomatosis , and in patients with large genetic deletions involving the CDKN2A gene. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic PNSTs and offers patients a potential cure; however , pre-existing conditions or tumor location may limit a patient 's surgical options. Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of selected PNSTs that are not amenable to surgical resection. Here , we present a case report of a 49-year-old patient with multiple neurofibromas who underwent RFA treatment of two symptomatic retroperitoneal neurofibromas and review previously reported cases of percutaneous treatment of PNSTs.
