  The prion hypothesis- a protein conformation capable of replicating without a nucleic acid genome- was heretical at the time of its discovery. However , the characteristics of the disease-misfolded prion protein and its ability to transmit disease , replicate , and spread are now widely accepted throughout the scientific community. In fact , in the last decade a wealth of evidence has emerged supporting similar properties observed for many of the misfolded proteins implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer disease , Parkinson disease , tauopathies , and as described in this chapter , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS). Multiple studies have now demonstrated the ability for superoxide dismutase-1 , 43-kDa transactive response ( TAR) DNA-binding protein , fused-in sarcoma<disease> , and most recently , C9orf72-encoded polypeptides to display properties similar to those of prions. The majority of these are cell-free and in vitro assays , while superoxide dismutase-1 remains the only ALS-linked protein to demonstrate several prion-like properties in vivo. In this chapter , we provide an introduction to ALS and review the recent literature linking several proteins implicated in the familial forms of the disease to properties of the prion protein.
