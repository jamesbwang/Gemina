  To assess the marginal fit of provisional polylactic acid ( PLA) crowns obtained via three-dimensional ( 3D) printing using a profile projector. A stone cast was scanned , and 15 provisional dental crowns were designed and printed in PLA using a 0.2-mm nozzle and 135-degree build angle. The marginal fit was measured at six points on each crown using a profile projector. Within the limitations of this study , the marginal fit of PLA provisional restorations was clinically acceptable , and the results were comparable to those observed with polymethyl methacrylate provisional restorations.
