  With more than 20 million patients annually , inguinal hernia repair is one of the most often performed surgical procedures worldwide. The lifetime risk to develop an inguinal hernia is 27-43 % for men and 3-6 % for women. In spite of all advances , 11 % of all patients suffer from a recurrence and 10-12 % from chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> following primary inguinal hernia repair. By developing evidence-based guidelines and recommendations , the international hernia societies aim to improve the outcome of inguinal hernia repair due to standardization of care. From a total of more than 100 different repair techniques for inguinal and femoral hernias , classified as tissue repair , open mesh repair , and laparo-endoscopic mesh repair , the new International Guidelines of the Hernia-Surge Group only recommend the totally extraperitoneal patch plasty ( TEP) , transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty ( TAPP) , and Lichtenstein techniques. Since a generally accepted technique suitable for all inguinal hernias does not exist , surgeons should provide both an anterior open ( Lichtenstein) and a posterior laparo-endoscopic ( TEP or TAPP) approach option. The guidelines strongly recommend that surgeons tailor the treatment of inguinal hernias based on expertise , local/national resources , and patient- and hernia-related factors. A tailored approach in inguinal hernia repair should pay heed to the patient- and hernia-related factors , unilateral hernia in men and women , bilateral hernia , recurrent hernia , scrotal hernia , previous pelvic and lower abdominal surgery , severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities , and incarcerated hernia.
