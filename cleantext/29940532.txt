  The delivery of nano-zerovalent iron ( nZVI) as a remediation agent to targeted areas in soil was studied using different carriers. Among water , surfactant solution , and surfactant foam , the nZVI transport and carrying abilities followed the order of surfactant foam > surfactant solution > water. The nZVI migration was also facilitated by increased soil particle size and high surfactant concentration. Batch experiments probed the remediation of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT)- contaminated sand under different conditions. Compared to surfactant solution , the use of foam as a carrier achieved much higher DDT removal efficiencies for both coarse ( foam/solution: 99/69 %) and fine ( foam/solution: 60/26 %) sands. Additionally , the DDT removal efficiency was strongly influenced by surfactant concentration: foams generated using 1 and 5 g L
