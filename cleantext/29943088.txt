  Most patients still have limited or no access to life-changing therapeutic proteins in the treatment of their cancer or autoimmune disorders. The current clinical development model of biosimilars is expensive , and in most cases , large , phase 3 trials do not provide meaningful information on the clinical equivalence of biosimilars and reference compounds. At the same time , the development of state-of-the-art orthogonal analytical methods has enabled a better understanding of the structure and structure-function relationship of biotherapeutics. Hence , we suggest here that a solid chemistry , manufacturing , and controls ( CMC) package and meaningful phase 1 studies will leave limited uncertainty on biosimilarity , which can be addressed-if needed-by post-approval , long-term follow-up studies ( post-approval studies , pharmacovigilance , real world evidence data and registries , and possibly new post-approval models to be developed). We believe that this new approach may be more appropriate than 600- to 1000-patient , phase 3 trials in assessing biosimilarity and therapeutic equivalence , under the condition that the administered biosimilar given to individual patients can be clearly identified. Obviously , there will probably never be a `` one size fits all '' development model , and an individualized , risk-based approach to biosimilar development will always have to be considered and discussed early with regulators.
