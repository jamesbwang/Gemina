  Trade-offs between advantageous but conflicting properties ( e.g. , speed vs. accuracy) are ubiquitous in cognition , but the relevant literature is conceptually fragmented , scattered across disciplines , and has not been organized in a coherent framework. This paper takes an initial step toward a general theory of cognitive trade-offs by examining four key properties of goal-directed systems: performance , efficiency , robustness , and flexibility. These properties define a number of basic functional trade-offs that can be used to map the abstract `` design space '' of natural and artificial cognitive systems. Basic functional trade-offs provide a shared vocabulary to describe a variety of specific trade-offs including speed vs. accuracy , generalist vs. specialist , exploration vs. exploitation , and many others. By linking specific features of cognitive functioning to general properties such as robustness and efficiency , it becomes possible to harness some powerful insights from systems engineering and systems biology to suggest useful generalizations , point to under-explored but potentially important trade-offs , and prompt novel hypotheses and connections between disparate areas of research.
