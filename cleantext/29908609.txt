  This paper strictly demonstrated a nonlinear Helmholtz equation , with its corresponding new expressions for the wave number of the mixture , for the propagation of sound trough a bubbly liquid. The demonstration was conducted under the assumption of periodicity of volume fluctuations , the acoustic approximation and considering only mono-harmonic pressure oscillations. The model revealed a beautiful symmetry between the average acoustic energy density and the average energy dissipation , as well as between the time average of the first and second derivatives of such fluctuations. The nonlinear model was validated with available experimental data at very low<symptom> pressure<symptom> amplitudes yielding the same results as the linear model. However , unlike the linear model , the advantage of the nonlinear model is that the wave number of the mixture is function of the pressure amplitude , which has great implications to model the sound propagation on cavitating bubbly liquids where the linear theory greatly under-predicts.
