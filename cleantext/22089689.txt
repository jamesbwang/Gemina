  Bangladesh is one of the highest tobacco consuming countries in the world , with reported 21.2 % of the population as daily smokers , 24.3 % as smokeless tobacco users , and 36.3 % as adult passive smoker. Given the high prevalence and established harmful effects of passive tobacco smoking , this study aimed to estimate of pattern of smoking policies in residential and work place , and to identify the associated socio-economic and demographic correlates in Bangladesh. Secondary data of sample size 9629 collected by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey ( GATS) 2010 has been used. Along with descriptive analysis , binary logistic regression model has been used to analyze the socio-demographic and economic correlates to tobacco smoking policy. The prevalence of male and female passive tobacco smokers was 74.3 % and 25.8 % respectively. Among the passive tobacco smokers , 22.2 % reported that smoking was allowed at their home and 29.8 % reported that there was no such smoking policy at their home. Alternatively , 26.0 % passive tobacco smokers reported that smoking was allowed and 27.5 % reported that there was no such smoking policy at their work place. Logistic regression analysis indicated that for tobacco smokers group , the odds of allowing smoking at home was 4.85 times higher than the non-smoker respondent ( OR = 4.85 , 95 % CI = 4.13 , 5.71) , 1.18 times more likely to be allowed at home in rural areas than urban areas ( OR = 1.18 , 95 % CI = 1.06,1.32) and less for college/university completed and ( or) higher educated respondent than no formal schooling ( OR = 0.35 , 95 % CI = 0.24 , 0.52). On the other hand , smoking was 1.70 times more likely to be allowed at work place for tobacco smokers than their counter part respondent ( OR = 1.70 , 95 % CI = 1.36 , 2.14) and was less likely to be allowed for college/university completed and ( or) higher educated respondent ( OR = 0.26 , 95 % CI = 0.14 , 0.45) than respondent with no formal schooling. To reduce the passive smoking , lower educated people and people in urban areas should advocate more about the adverse effect of active and passive tobacco smoking. Also , smoking policy should reform introducing smoking zone at work places and residential buildings.
