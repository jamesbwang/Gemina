  The gastrointestinal tract is the site of most drug delivery and therapeutic interventions for the management and treatment of numerous diseases. However , selective access to its mucosa , especially in the small bowel , is challenging. Here we develop an orally administered gut-coating formulation that provides a transient coating of the bowel. Through a materials screening campaign , we identified a sucrose octasulfate aluminium complex and further engineered the pH-dependent material into a complex coacervate formulation linked via pH-independent electrostatic interaction , which allowed an effective transient physical coating on the gastrointestinal mucosa , independent of gastric acid exposure. We tested the therapeutic values of this technology in two settings. Oral administration of this gut-coating formulation modulated the nutrient contact with bowel mucosa , which lowered the glucose responses in rodent models indicating a potential therapeutic utility in diabetes. Furthermore , the formulation protected biological agents from gastric acid exposure and degradation , which enabled oral delivery to the small bowel mucosa.
