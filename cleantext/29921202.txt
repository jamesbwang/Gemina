  In this study , we provide a modified mathematical model of tumor growth with two time delay effects that involves the interaction between host cells , tumor cells and effector cells in order to understand the dynamic behavior of tumor growth. In the model , biological relevance is explained and different from the existing methods. In addition , the stability of the equilibrium point is analyzed by the corresponding characteristic equation. Moreover , the existence and sufficient conditions of the Hopf bifurcation are also discussed. Finally , the numerical simulation is carried out to illustrate the theoretical results.
