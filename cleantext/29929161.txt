  Aging is often associated with changes in the musculoskeletal system , peripheral and central nervous system. These age-related changes often result in mobility problems influencing gait performance. Compensatory strategies are used as a way to adapt to these physiological<symptom> changes<symptom>. The aim of this review is to investigate the differences in spatiotemporal and gait variability measures throughout the healthy adult life. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO database ( no. CRD42017057720). Databases MEDLINE ( Pubmed) , Web of Science ( Web of Knowledge) , Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect were systematically searched until March 2018. Eighteen of the 3195 original studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The majority of studies reported spatiotemporal and gait variability measures in adults above the age of 65 , followed by the young adult population , information of middle-aged adults is lacking. Spatiotemporal parameters and gait variability measures were extracted from 2112 healthy adults between 18 and 98 years old and , in general , tend to deteriorate with increasing age. Variability measures were only reported in an elderly population and show great variety between studies. The findings of this review suggest that most spatiotemporal parameters significantly differ across different age groups. Elderly populations show a reduction of preferred walking speed , cadence , step and stride length , all related to a more cautious gait , while gait variability measures remain stable over time. A preliminary framework of normative reference data is provided , enabling insights into the influence of aging on spatiotemporal parameters , however spatiotemporal parameters of middle-aged adults should be investigated more thoroughly.
