  Pregnancy-associated breast cancer ( PABC) is rare and is generally defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within 1 year of delivery. The average ages of marriage and childbearing are increasing , and PABC is expected to also increase. This study is intended to increase understanding of the characteristics of PABC. A database of 2,810 patients with breast cancer diagnosed when they were less than 40 years of age was reviewed. The clinicopathological factors and survival of PABC ( 40 patients) were compared to those of patients with young breast cancer ( YBC , non-pregnant or over 12 months after delivery; 2,770 patients). PABC had significantly lower estrogen receptor ( ER) and progesterone receptor ( PR) expression ( ER-positive 50.0 % , PR-positive 45.0 %) and higher HER2 overexpression ( 38.5 %) than YBC. The most common subtype of PABC was triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC; 35.9 %) , and luminal A subtype represented only 7.7 % of cases. In univariate analysis , PABC had significantly worse disease-free survival ( DFS) and breast cancer-specific survival ( BCSS) compared to YBC. In multivariate analysis , PABC was associated with worse BCSS ( HR 4.0 , 95 % CI 1.2-12.9 , p = 0.019) and survival , but there was no difference in DFS between PABC and YBC. In subgroup analysis by subtype , luminal B subtype of PABC showed worse DFS ( HR 3.5; 95 % CI 1.1-11.2 , p = 0.039) and BCSS ( HR 10.2 , 95 % CI 1.2-87.1 , p = 0.035) , especially with high Ki67. However , no differences were demonstrated in other subtypes. In this study , PABC showed lower expression of ER/PR , higher overexpression of HER2 , fewer luminal A subtype , and more TNBC subtype compared to YBC. PABC had worse BCSS , especially luminal B subtype , compared to YBC.
