  There is insufficient evidence to counsel patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing altitude or air travel. We thus aimed to study hemodynamic response of patients with pulmonary arterial or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( PAH/CTEPH) during changes in inspiratory oxygen partial pressure. Consecutive patients undergoing right heart catheterization had hemodynamic assessments whilst breathing ambient air ( normoxia , FiO In patients with PAH/CTEPH , very short-term exposure to moderate hypoxia similar to 2600 m altitude or during commercial air travel did not deteriorate hemodynamics. These results encourage studying the response of PAH/CTEPH during daytrips to the mountain<disease> or air travel.
