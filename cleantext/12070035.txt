  Expression of miR-143 and miR-145 is reduced in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ( HSPCs) of myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> patients with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5. Here we show that mice lacking miR-143/ 145 have impaired HSPC activity with depletion of functional hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) , but activation of progenitor cells ( HPCs). We identify components of the transforming growth factor β ( TGFβ) pathway as key targets of miR-143/ 145. Enforced expression of the TGFβ adaptor protein and miR-145 target , Disabled-2 ( DAB2) , recapitulates the HSC defect seen in miR-143/ 145
