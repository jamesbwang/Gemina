  Anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among pediatric cancer survivors. It has been postulated that oxidative stress induction and inflammation<symptom> may play a role in the pathogenesis of this process. Accordingly , the present study performed an assessment of biomarker profiles and functional imaging parameters focused upon potential early determinants of anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy. Patients ( 10-22 years) were prospectively enrolled between January 2013 and November 2014. Thirteen subjects completed the study and underwent serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and plasma biomarker profiling performed 24-48 h after the first anthracycline dose and at set dose intervals. In addition , we collected plasma samples from 62 healthy controls to examine normal plasma biomarker profiles. Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) decreased from 64.3 ± 6.2 at the first visit to 57.5 ± 3.3 ( Asymptomatic pediatric patients exposed to anthracycline therapy develop abnormal strain parameters at lower cumulative doses when compared to changes in EF. A differential biomarker signature containing both inflammatory and matrix domains occur early in anthracycline treatment. Dynamic changes in these domains occur with increased anthracycline doses and progression to anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy. These findings provide potential prognostic and mechanistic insights into the natural history of anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy.
