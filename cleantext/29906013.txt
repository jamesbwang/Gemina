  It is relatively rare to find syringocystadenoma papilliferum ( SCAP) outside the head and neck region and extremely rare in the anogenital area. Characteristic histological features such as cystic invaginations , glandular epithelium showing decapitation secretion , and stroma with plasma cells are important for making the diagnosis. We present a rare case of SCAP on the mons pubis of a 13-year-old girl and compare cases of SCAP from other rare locations.
