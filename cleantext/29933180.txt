  To investigate the role and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) in breast cancer patients with a local recurrence and no clinically positive axillary lymph nodes. A total of 71 patients underwent SLNB for breast cancer recurrence. At first surgery , they had received SLNB ( 46.5 %) , axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND) ( 36.6 %) or no axillary surgery ( 16.9 %). Lymphatic migration was successful in 53 out of 71 patients ( 74.6 %) and was significantly higher in patients with previous SLNB or no axillary surgery than in those with previous ALND ( 87.9 % vs. 53.8 %; p = 0.009). Aberrant lymphatic migration pathways were observed in 7 patients ( 13.2 %). The surgical SLNB was successfully performed in 51 patients ( 71.8 %). In 46 patients ( 90.2 %) the SLN was histologically negative , in 3 patients ( 5.9 %) micrometastastatic and in 2 patients ( 3.9 %) macrometastatic. The 2 patients with a macrometastates in SLN underwent ALND , In 4 out of the 18 patients with failure of tracer migration ALND , performed as surgeon 's choice , did not find any metastatic node. After a median follow-up period of 39 months ( range: 2-182 months) , no axillary recurrence has been diagnosed. A SLNB in patients with locally recurrent breast cancer , no previous ALND and negative axillary lymph nodes is technically feasible and impacts on the ALND rate. In patients who at primary surgery received ALND , migration rate is significantly lower , aberrant migration is frequent and no clinically useful information has been obtained.
