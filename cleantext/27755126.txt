  The importance of myeloid cells in promoting neovascularization has been shown in a number of pathological settings in several organs. However , the specific role of macrophages in promoting systemic angiogenesis during pulmonary ischemia is not fully determined. Our past work suggested that cells of monocytic lineage contributed to systemic angiogenesis in the lung since clodronate-induced depletion of all macrophages resulted in attenuated neovascularization. Our current goals were to define the population of macrophages important for systemic vessel growth into the lung after the onset of pulmonary ischemia in mice. Interstitial macrophages ( CD64
