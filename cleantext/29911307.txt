  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) for the treatment of aortic stenosis in patients at intermediate , high , and extreme risk for mortality from SAVR. We examined recent trends in aortic valve replacement ( AVR) in Michigan. The Michigan Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative ( MSTCVS-QC) database was used to determine the number of SAVR and TAVR cases performed from January 2012 through June 2017. Patients were divided into low , intermediate , high , and extreme risk groups based on STS predicted risk of mortality ( PROM). TAVR patients in the MSTCVS-QC database were also matched with those in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry to determine their Heart Team-designated risk category. During the study period 9517 SAVR and 4470 TAVR cases were performed. Total annual AVR volume increased by 40.0 % ( from 2086 to 2920) , with a 13.3 % decrease in number of SAVR cases ( from 1892 to 1640) and a 560 % increase in number of TAVR cases ( from 194 to 1280). Greater than 90 % of SAVR patients had PROM ≤ 8 %. While > 70 % of TAVR patients had PROM ≤ 8 % , they were mostly designated as high or extreme risk by a Heart Team. During the study period , SAVR volume gradually declined and TAVR volume dramatically increased. This was mostly due to a new group of patients with lower STS PROM who were designated as higher risk by a Heart Team due to characteristics not completely captured by the STS PROM score.
