  Engineering surface loops is a sub-topic of protein engineering that is used routinely in many research fields in academia and industry alike. We provide some tools that search in the PDB for loops satisfying a wide variety of constraints. We illustrate the usefulness of these tools by applying them to a series of recently published studies that included loop engineering or loop modelling. LoopFinder finds loops that fit between two anchor stretches of typically 2 , 3 , or 4 amino acids each. ProDA find loops of a given length with predefined secondary structure , residue types , hydrophobicity , etc.. WHAT IF has gotten a series of new options to scan the whole PDB for loops combining the LoopFinder and ProDA techniques. The open nature of these tools will allow bioinformaticians in this field to easily design their own loop modelling software around our tools. LoopFinder is a stand-alone Fortran program that is likely to compile and run on every computer. The LoopFinder source code , data files , and documentation are freely available from swift.cmbi.ru.nl/ gv/loops/. ProDA is free to all users. There is no login requirement. It is available at: http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir/software/linda/. WHAT IF is shareware that is available from https://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/whatif/.
