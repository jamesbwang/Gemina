  NMR data for natural products containing the epoxy moiety have been revisited and reanalyzed with the help of a recently developed parametric/DFT hybrid computational method , DU8 +. More than 20 structures needed revision , which points to challenges in NMR solution structure assignment for molecules possessing this structural feature. Among the revised structures are achicretin 2 , acremine P , aromaticane I , artanomalide B , botryosphaerihydrofuran , chloroklotzchin , crithmifolide , crotodichogamoin A , emervaridone C , 9Î±,15-epoxyafricanane , fischambiguine B , grandilobalide B , guaianolide A , guatterfriesols A and B , juncenolide G , roscotane D , secoafricane 7 , taccalonolides AJ and AF , and related compounds.
