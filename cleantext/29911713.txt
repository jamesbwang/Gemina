  Silver ( Ag) nanowires ( NWs) are promising building blocks for flexible transparent electrodes , which are key components in fabricating soft electronic devices such as flexible organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs). Typically , Ag NWs have been synthesized using a polyol method , but it still remains a challenge to produce high-aspect-ratio Ag NWs via a simple and rapid process. In this work , we developed a modified polyol method and newly found that the addition of propylene glycol to ethylene glycol-based polyol synthesis facilitated the growth of Ag NWs , allowing the rapid production of long Ag NWs with high aspect ratios of about 2000 in a high yield ( ∼ 90 %) within 5 min. Transparent electrodes fabricated with our Ag NWs exhibited performance comparable to that of an indium tin oxide-based electrode. With these Ag NWs , we successfully demonstrated the fabrication of a large-area flexible OLED with dimensions of 30 cm × 15 cm using a roll-to-roll process.
