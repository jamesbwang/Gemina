  Early stage diagnosis of cancer by monitoring the cancer biomarkers in human biological fluids is the excellent tool and the first step toward adopting efficient therapy , hindering metastasis and reducing mortality rate. An ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for quantitation of tumor suppressor protein Carcinoma Antigen 15-3 ( CA 15-3) based on ternary signal amplification strategy was fabricated. In this work , the antibody ( horseradish peroxidase ( HRP)- Labeled anti CA 15-3) was immobilized onto a green and biocompatible nanocomposite containing gold nano-shrub ( Au NSs) electrochemically assembled onto thiolated graphene quantum dots ( GQDs/CysA ( Cysteamine)). Therefore , a novel multilayer film based on GQDs , CysA , and Au NSs was exploited to develop a highly sensitive immunosensor for detection of CA 15.3. Fully electrochemical methodology was used to prepare a new transducer on a gold surface which provided a high surface area to immobilize a high amount of the anti-CA 15.3. Under optimized condition the calibration curve for CA 15.3 concentration was linear in the range of 0.3-1 U/mL and 2-250 U/mL with detection limit of 0.011 U/mL. The method was applied to the assay of CA 15.3 in malignant cell line lysates of human breast adenocarcinoma cell line-MCF-7.
