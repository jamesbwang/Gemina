  Demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common subtype of CMT. It is caused mainly by 17p11 .2 heterozygous duplication , but also by mutations in more than 20 genes which affect development and function of Schwann cells. To investigate the profile of genes mutated and clinical features in demyelinating CMT of Chinese descent , we collected a cohort of 44 demyelinating CMT patients and screened them using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA) and targeted next-generation sequencing technology. The MLPA technology revealed that 77.3 % demyelinating CMT patients harbored 17p11 .2 heterozygous duplication and 6.8 % patients harbored heterozygous deletion of exon 6 of MPZ gene , that was further confirmed a novel c. 674_675insA mutation in MPZ gene. In the patients with 17p12 heterozygous duplication , three sets of independent families were discordant for the CMT phenotype within the same family. The targeted next-generation sequencing technology revealed that six candidate mutations including one previously reported mutation ( GDAP1: c. 571C > T) and five novel mutations ( SBF2: c. 415T > C , c. 619G > T , c. 1258A > G; GDAP1: c. 589delC; PMP22: c. 318delT) were found. In conclusion , Combined MLPA technique with target next-generation sequencing , the demyelinating CMT genetic diagnostic success rate was increased. This article is protected by copyright.
