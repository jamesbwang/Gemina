  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The binding to target messenger RNAs ( mRNAs) results in mRNA cleavage or inhibition of the translational machinery leading to decreased protein levels. Various signalling pathways , including apoptosis are modulated by miRNAs. Here , we investigated the role of miR-744-5p in apoptosis signalling in ovarian cancer cell lines. MiR-744-5p expression was reduced in the cancer cell lines independent of the host gene MAP2K4. Overexpression of miR-744-5p activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in SKOV3 , OVCAR3 and Cisplatin resistant ( A2780-cis) and non-resistant A2780 cells leading to cell death. Notably , miR-744-5p overexpression together with Carboplatin treatment led to at least additive pro-apoptotic effects. Investigation of the apoptotic signalling pathways mediated by miR-744-5p revealed that its elevated expression directly downregulated mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor I X ( NFIX) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C ( HNRNPC). HNRNPC caused diminished miR-21 expression and AKT phosphorylation , while NFIX decreased Bcl2 levels , leading to the detected pro-apoptotic effects. Finally , Kaplan-Meier-Plots showed a prolonged median disease-free survival in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma patients with high miR-744 expression.
