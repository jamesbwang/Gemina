  The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map the range of tools that measure behavioral aspects of the nurse-patient relationship ( i.e. the behaviors employed by nurses to develop and maintain a relationship with their patients) within any healthcare setting and for any patient group. Specifically , the review will map the behaviors that are measured through these tools , how the tools have been used and in what contexts. The specific review question is: what tools are available to measure the behavioral aspects of nurse-patient relationships?
