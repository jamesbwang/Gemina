  The cotton whitefly Bemisia tabaci ( Gennadius) ( Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a serious pest of several summer crops in hot and dry climates. Its field populations ( Asia II-1 biotype) were assessed for their susceptibility to diverse pesticides by using leaf-dip bioassay. There was no or a very low resistance to amitraz , hexythiazox , and pyridaben during 1992-2015. B. tabaci also exhibited no resistance to endosulfan during 1992-1997 and a very low resistance during 1998-2010 , which then rose to a low level during 2011-2015. Chlorfenapyr resistance was very low during 1997-2008 and it reached to a high level during 2009-2011 and to a very high level in 2013 and 2015. Among avermectins , abamectin showed a very low resistance up to 2013 but a high resistance in 2015. Emamectin benzoate also demonstrated a very low resistance up to 2010 , but a moderate-to-high resistance during 2011-2015. It may be concluded that the diverse chemistries , having novel modes of action and showing no , very low or low levels of resistance , can be substituted in rotation in the wake of resistance development to conventional insecticides.
