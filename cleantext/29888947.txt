  Potential externalizing tendencies have long been a focus of research in police candidates. Early studies often reported positive correlations between Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI) externalizing scales and problem behaviors in law enforcement officers. However , more recent investigations reveal mixed findings , with some showing either no significant correlations between externalizing measures and police performance problems or negative associations. In the current study , we examined associations between MMPI-2 Restructured Form ( MMPI-2-RF) externalizing scale scores and personal history information ( biodata) in a large sample ( n = 1,226) of police officer candidates and observed expected positive correlations between them. Next , we examined associations between MMPI-2-RF externalizing scale scores and biodata and posthire performance measures in a subset of officers who were judged to be psychologically qualified , were subsequently hired , and for whom posthire performance records were available. We hypothesized that recently observed negative correlations would be replicated , and that this could be attributed to overcontrolled behavior , as reflected in low externalizing scale scores. Our findings were consistent with expectations. Finally , we found that , by and large , MMPI-2-RF scores and biodata augmented one another in the prediction of poor performance outcomes due to overcontrolled behavior among hired police officer recruits. Implications for considering overcontrolled behavior as a potential risk factor when evaluating police officer candidates are discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
