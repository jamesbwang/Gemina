  Background The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between serum total cortisol ( TC) and free cortisol ( FC) levels in children with septic shock<symptom> and the relationship of these levels with baseline illness severity. Methods A sub-study of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT) of hydrocortisone vs. placebo in pediatric septic shock<symptom> conducted in seven academic pediatric intensive care units ( PICUs) in Canada on children aged newborn to 17 years. Thirty children with septic shock<symptom> had serum sent for TC and FC measurement within 6 h of meeting the study eligibility criteria. Results Baseline FC and TC levels were strongly correlated with baseline Pediatric Risk of Mortality ( PRISM) score ( R2 = 0.759 , p < 0.001; R2 = 0.717 , p < 0.001) and moderately correlated with admission Vasotropic Inotropic Score ( VIS) ( R2 = 0.489 , p < 0.001; R2 = 0.316 , p < 0.001). Serum TC levels were highly correlated with FC levels ( R2 = 0.92 , p < 0.001) and showed strong agreement ( R2 = 0.98 , p < 0.001 on a Bland-Altman plot). The ratio of FC to TC moderately correlated with TC levels ( R2 = 0.46 , p < 0.001) but did not correlate with baseline albumin levels ( R2 = 0.19 , p = 0.13). Conclusions Random TC and FC levels are strongly correlated , show strong agreement and are reflective of illness severity in children with septic shock<symptom>. As such , isolated FC measurement does not appear to provide added information relative to TC in acutely ill children with septic
