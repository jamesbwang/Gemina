  Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer mortality , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) signaling promotes the metastatic cascade. However , the molecular pathways that control ROS signaling relevant to metastasis are little studied. Here , we identify SIRT3 , a mitochondrial deacetylase , as a regulator of cell migration via its control of ROS signaling. We find that , although mitochondria are present at the leading edge of migrating cells , SIRT3 expression is down-regulated during migration , resulting in elevated ROS levels. This SIRT3-mediated control of ROS represses Src oxidation and attenuates focal adhesion kinase ( FAK) activation. SIRT3 overexpression inhibits migration and metastasis in breast cancer cells. Finally , in human breast cancers , SIRT3 expression is inversely correlated with metastatic outcome and Src/FAK signaling. Our results reveal a role for SIRT3 in cell migration , with important implications for breast cancer progression.
