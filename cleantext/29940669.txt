  WADA has banned dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) but its ergogenic effect in female athletes has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine whether short-term DHEA intake would improve performance during a supramaximal field exercise in healthy young recreationally trained women. Its impact on body composition , metabolic responses was also measured. Eleven young female volunteers completed four running-based anaerobic sprint tests: just before and after treatment with either oral placebo or DHEA ( 100 mg/day/28days) , following a double-blind and randomized protocol. Bioelectrical impedance assessed body composition. At rest and after passive recovery , blood samples were collected for lactate measurement and saliva samples for DHEA , testosterone and cortisol analysis. There was no significant difference in body composition or performance parameters after DHEA administration , despite a tendency toward increased peak power and decreased fat mass. However , DHEA treatment induced a very marked increase in saliva DHEA and testosterone concentrations ( p < 0.001) , with no change in cortisol or lactate levels. In conclusion , short-term DHEA administration did not improve performance or have an anabolic effect in young female recreationally trained athletes , despite the increase in androgenic hormones. Further studies are needed to determine whether a higher daily dose would generate an ergogenic effect during anaerobic exercise.
