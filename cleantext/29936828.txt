  Protein tyrosine sulfation ( PTS) is a post-translational modification regulating numerous biological events. PTS generally occurs at flexible regions of proteins , enhancing intermolecular interactions between proteins. Because of the high flexibility associated with the regions where PTS is generally encountered , an atomic-level understanding has been difficult to achieve by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In this study , we focused on the conformational behavior of a flexible sulfated peptide and its interaction with an antibody. Molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic analysis indicated that PTS reduced the main-chain fluctuations upon the appearance of sulfate-mediated intramolecular H-bonds. Collectively , our data suggested that one of the mechanisms by which PTS may enhance protein-protein interactions consists of the limitation of conformational dynamics in the unbound state , thus reducing the loss of entropy upon binding and boosting the affinity for its partner.
