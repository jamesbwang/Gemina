  The coping with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> of the famous French impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir ( 1841-1919) is described in former publications. The heavily handicapped painter has in his last years created sculptures in cooperation with the sculptor Richard Guino ( 1890-1973). The extraordinary genesis of the sculptures through a masterful artistic cooperation , as well as the resulting legal issues and shameful copyright infringements , is reported. Renoir 's decision to create sculptures with the help of Guido can be attributed to his remarkable artistic vision , vitality , optimistic nature , and strong will and is also a further testimonial of creative coping of an artist overcoming the physical handicap due to rheumatoid arthritis<disease> of his final years , so far not described in detail in the medical literature.
