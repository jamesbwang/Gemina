  To date , DNA cleavage , caused by cleavage agents , has been monitored mainly by gel and capillary electrophoresis. However , these techniques are time-consuming , non-quantitative and require gel stains. In this work , a novel , simple and , importantly , a quantitative method for monitoring the DNA nuclease activity of potential anti-cancer drugs , at a DNA electrochemical sensor , is presented. The DNA sensors were prepared using thiol-modified oligonucleotides that self-assembled to create a DNA monolayer at gold electrode surfaces. The quantification of DNA double-strand breaks is based on calculating the DNA surface coverage , before and after exposure to a DNA cleavage agent. The nuclease properties of a model DNA cleavage agent , copper bis-phenanthroline ( ( Cu
