  Villous adenoma is a rare pathology seen in the urinary tract; it is mostly found in the large bowel. When encountered in the urinary tract , it mainly originates from intestinal segments of urinary reconstruction. Villous adenoma is commonly seen in patients more than 50 years and has a male predominance. In the urinary tract , it has been reported in the urachus , bladder dome and trigone. A few cases of villous adenoma have been described in the literature. We report a case of primary villous adenoma in the remnant of the urachus and discuss the pathophysiology , investigation and management.
