  Peripheral nerve injuries ( PNIs) of the lower extremities have been assessed in small cohort studies; however , the actual incidence , national trends , comorbidities , and cost of care in lower extremity PNI are not defined. Lack of sufficient data limits discussion on national policies , payors , and other aspects fundamental to the delivery of care in the US. To establish estimates of lower extremity PNIs incidence , associated diagnoses , and cost in the US using a comprehensive database with a minimum of a decade of data. The National Inpatient Sample was utilized to evaluate International Classification of Disease codes for specific lower extremity PNIs ( 9560-9568) between 2001 and 2013. Lower extremity PNIs occurred with a mean incidence of 13.3 cases per million population annually , which declined minimally from 2001 to 2013. The mean ± SEM age was 41.6 ± 0.1 yr; 61.1 % of patients were males. Most were admitted via the emergency department ( 56.0 %). PNIs occurred to the sciatic ( 16.6 %) , femoral ( 10.7 %) , tibial ( 6.0 %) , peroneal ( 33.4 %) , multiple nerves ( 1.3 %) , and other ( 32.0 %). Associated diagnoses included lower extremity fracture ( 13.4 %) , complications of care ( 11.2 %) , open wounds<disease> ( 10.3 %) , crush injury ( 9.7 %) , and other ( 7.2 %). Associated procedures included tibial fixation ( 23.3 %) , closure of skin ( 20.1 %) , debridement of open fractures ( 15.4 %) , fixation of other bones ( 13.5 %) , and wound<disease> debridement ( 14.5 %). The mean annual unadjusted compounded growth rate of charges was 8.8 %. The mean ± SEM annual charge over the time period was $ 64 031.20 ± $ 421.10 , which was associated with the number of procedure codes ( β = 0.2) , length of stay ( β = 0.6) , and year ( β = 0.1) in a multivariable analysis ( P = .0001). These data describe associations in the treatment of lower extremity PNIs , which are important for considering national policies , costs , research and the delivery of care.
