  Although lots of coarse-grained models have been proposed to trace the long-term behaviors of entangled polymers , compatibility among the different models has not been frequently discussed. In this study , some dynamical and static quantities , such as diffusion , relaxation modulus , chain dimension , and entanglement density , were examined for the multi-chain slip-link model ( primitive chain network model) and the multi-chain slip-spring model , and the results were compared with those reported for the standard bead-spring model. For the diffusion , three models are compatible with scale-conversion parameters for units of length , time and bead ( segment) number ( or the molecular weight). The relaxation modulus is also compatible given that the model dependence can be accommodated by the entanglement density and the additional scale-conversion for the unit of modulus. The chain dimension is reasonably coincident with small deviations due to the weak non-Gaussianity of the models. Apart from these plausible compatibilities , significant discrepancies have been found for the inter-chain cross-correlations in the relaxation modulus.
