  Apicomplexans use the endolysosomal system for the biogenesis of their secretory organelles , namely , micronemes , rhoptries , and dense granules. In Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> , our previous in silico search identified the HOPS tethering but not the CORVET complex and demonstrated a role of Vps11 ( a common component for both complexes) in its secretory organelle biogenesis. Herein , we performed Vps11-GFP-Trap pull-down assays and identified by proteomic analysis , not only the CORVET-specific subunit Vps8 but also a BEACH domain-containing protein ( BDCP) conserved in eukaryotes. We show that knocking-down Vps8 affects targeting of dense granule proteins , transport of rhoptry proteins , and the localization of the cathepsin L protease vacuolar compartment marker. Only a subset of micronemal proteins are affected by the absence of Vps8 , shedding light on at least two trafficking pathways involved in microneme maturation. Knocking-down BDCP revealed a restricted and particular role of this protein in rhoptry and vacuolar compartment biogenesis. Moreover , depletion of BDCP or Vps8 abolishes parasite virulence in vivo. This study identified BDCP as a novel CORVET/HOPS-associated protein , playing specific roles and acting in concert during secretory organelle biogenesis , an essential process for host cell infection. Our results open the hypothesis for a role of BDCP in the vesicular trafficking towards lysosome-related organelles in mammals and yeast.
