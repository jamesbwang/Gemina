  The ryanodine receptors of insects are the main target sites of diamide insecticides , which show highly selective insecticidal activity relative to toxicity in mammals and provide a novel option for managing lepidopteran pests. The oriental armyworm , Mythimna separata ( Walker) , is a destructive pest of agricultural crops , and great efforts have been undertaken to control this pest including repeated insecticide applications. In this study , full-length cDNA of a ryanodine receptor gene from M. separata ( MsRyR) was cloned and characterized. The cDNA of MsRyR had a 15,372 bp open reading frame and encoded 5124 amino acids ( GenBank ID: MG712298). MsRyR shares 78-97 % identity with RyR isoforms of other insects , and < 50 % identities with Homo sapiens RyRs 1-3. Temporal and spatial expression analysis detected MsRyR at all developmental stages and in all tissues. The highest relative levels of MsRyR were detected in the second instar and head. Exposure to chlorantraniliprole after 24 h significantly increased the expression levels of whole body MsRyR mRNA. In addition , dietary ingestion of dsMsRyR significantly reduced the mRNA level of MsRyR and greatly decreased chlorantraniliprole-induced mortality. Our results revealed that the MsRyR could be the molecular target of chlorantraniliprole , and provided the basis for further understanding the resistance mechanism of chlorantraniliprole.
