  While carbohydrate loading is an important component of enhanced patient recovery after surgery , no study has evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading after laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC) on patient satisfaction and overall recovery. Thus , we aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative oral carbohydrates on scores from the quality of recovery 40-item ( QoR-40) questionnaire after LC. A total of 153 adults who underwent LC were randomized into three groups. Group MN-NPO was fasted from midnight until surgery. Group No-NPO received 400 mL of a carbohydrate beverage on the evening before surgery , and a morning dose of 400 mL was ingested at least 2 h before surgery. Group Placebo received the same quantity of flavored water as for group No-NPO. The quality of recovery after general anesthesia was evaluated using QoR-40 questionnaire. Intraoperative hemodynamics were also evaluated. There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of the pre- and postoperative global QoR-40 scores ( P = 0.257). Group MN-NPO had an elevated heart rate compared to patients who ingested a preoperative beverage ( groups No-NPO and Placebo; P = 0.0412). The preoperative carbohydrate beverage did not improve quality of recovery using the QoR-40 questionnaire after general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to placebo or conventional fasting. However , the preoperative fasting group had a consistently increased heart rate during changes in body position that induced hypotension<symptom> , which is likely a result of depletion of effective intravascular volume caused by traditional fasting over 8 h.
