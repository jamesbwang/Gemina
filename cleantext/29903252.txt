  To analyze the content of sugar in the sugary foods in China , in order to provide data for further assessment of the level of consumption of sugar among residents. The most common sugary foods , including drinks , biscuits , pastries , milk and dairy products , sugar , candy , and so on , were randomly collected. The content of galactose , glucose , fructose , sucrose , lactose , maltose were determined by chromatographic method. In addition , the content of the sugar was compared with the content in the US food. All measurement data was classified based on the national standard classification of sugary foods , the level of content of sugar in the foods of same class , sugar nutrition claims as well. The content of sugar varied significantly in different kinds of sugary food , the content of total sugar in the drinks ranged of 3. 00-34. 9 g/100 g ( mL) , the content of total sugar in the biscuits was in the range of 2. 39-27. 2 g/100 g , the content of total sugar in the processing pastry was in the range of 10. 5-19. 8 g/100 g , the content of total sugar in the bread was in the range of 7. 97-18. 4 g/100 g , the content of total sugar in the milk and dairy products was in the range of 6. 09-45. 1 g/100 g ( mL) , the content of total sugar in the milk and dairy products was in the range of 11. 6-42. 0 g/100 g. Among the other sugary foods , plain oatmeal contained the minimum content of total sugar ( 2. 25 ± 0. 23 g/100 g) , while the maximum content of total sugar was in jam ( 65. 9 ± 7. 06 g/100 g). When compared with the US content data , the content of total sugar in our ice cream , pastry and non-biscuit was less than that in the US food ( P < 0. 05) , while the content of total sugar in China 's whole wheat bread and soda cracker was higher than that in the US food ( P < 0. 05). The sugar composition is related to the certain category of sugary foods.
