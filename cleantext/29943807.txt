  We report on three patients exhibiting tumours with exophytic pedunculated structures with eroded surfaces. All cases showed the basic histopathological features of poroma accompanied by large , invaginated ductal structures lined by multiple layers of columnar or cuboidal cells. The columnar cells of invaginated ductal/cystic structures focally exhibited subtle features reminiscent of decapitation secretion along with dense infiltration of plasma cells in the surrounding stroma , mimicking syringocystadenoma papilliferum.
