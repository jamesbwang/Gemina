  Apoptosis induction has emerged as a treatment option for anticancer therapy. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL) , a type II transmembrane protein , is a potent and specific pro-apoptotic protein ligand , which activates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway of the cell death receptors. Here we describe the construction and characterization of a new soluble TRAIL , sfTRAIL , stabilized with the trimerization Foldon domain from the Fibritin protein of the bacteriophage T4. Supernatants of 0.22 Î¼M-filtered supernatants were produced in Vero-transduced cells with HSV1-derived viral amplicon vectors. Experiments were undertaken in two known TRAIL-sensitive ( U373 and MDA.MB .231) and two TRAIL-resistant ( MCF7 and A549) cell lines , to determine ( i) whether the sfTRAIL protein is synthetized and , ( ii) whether sfTRAIL could induce receptor-mediated apoptosis. Our results showed that sfTRAIL was able to induce apoptosis at concentrations as low as 1899.29 pg/mL ( 27.71 pM) , independently of caspase-9 activation , and reduction in cell viability at 998.73 fM.
