  To study the effect of thyroidectomy with totally preserved recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN) on the objective vocal functions. It is a prospective pilot study of 10 patients undergoing thyroid surgery on whom to study the effect of thyroidectomy with totally preserved RLN on the objective vocal functions. Patient history and demographic data were collected at the time of admission and in each period of assessment average fundamental frequency; absolute jitter , shimmer , and others were measured. Furthermore , one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) repeated measurements statistical technique was used to test the difference among the 3 time period of measurements and The mean age was 39.5 Â± 3.31 years. There were two males and eight females. Total thyroidectomy was performed on eight patients while one had left hemithyroidectomy and one completion thyroidectomy. Histopathology revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma in 50 %. 34 acoustic voice analysis parameters were measured using the multidimensional voice program , which showed no significant differences at the end of 1 All the acoustic analysis parameters for 10 patients showed no significant differences in 1
