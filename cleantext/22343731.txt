  Long intergenic non-coding RNA Linc00472 has been considered as a tumor suppressor in some cancers. However , the function and mechanism of Linc00472 in colorectal cancer has not been well elucidated. In this study , we found that Linc00472 was down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cells. Elevated Linc00472 expression suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover , Linc00472 acted as a competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) of miR-196a to release programmed cell death 4 ( PDCD4). Furthermore , miR-196a overexpression or PDCD4 knockdown reversed Linc00472-mediated proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in colorectal cancer cells. Ectopic Linc00472 expression hindered tumor growth
