  Clinical studies indicate that Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) disproportionately affects women in both disease prevalence and severity , but the mechanisms underlying this sex divergence are unknown. Though some have suggested this difference in risk is a reflection of known differences in longevity between men and women , mounting clinical and preclinical evidence supports women also having intrinsic susceptibilities towards the disease. While a number of potential risk factors have been hypothesized to affect these differences in risks , none have been definitively verified. In this review , we discuss a novel hypothesis whereby women 's susceptibility to chronic stress also mediates increased risk for AD. As stress is a risk factor for AD , and women are twice as likely to develop mood disorders where stress is a major etiology , it is possible that sex dimorphisms in stress responses contribute to the increase in women with AD. In line with this , sex divergence in biochemical responses to stress have been noted along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis and among known molecular effectors of AD , with crosstalk between these processes also being likely. In addition , activation of the cortical corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 ( CRF1) signaling pathway leads to distinct female-biased increases in molecules associated with AD pathogenesis. Therefore , the different biochemical responses to stress between women and men may represent an intrinsic , sex-dependent risk factor for AD.
