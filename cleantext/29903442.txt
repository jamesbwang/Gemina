  Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) is a noninvasive neuroimaging tool assessing the organization of white-matter tracts and brain microstructure in vivo. The technique takes into account the three-dimensional ( 3D) direction of diffusion of water in space , the brownian movements of water being constrained by the brain microstructure. The main direction of diffusion in the brain is extracted to obtain the principal direction of axonal projection within a given voxel. Overall , the diffusion tensor is a mathematic analysis of the magnitude/directionality ( anisotropy) of the movement of water molecules in 3D space. Tracts running in the white matter are subsequently reconstructed graphically with fiber tractography. Tractography can be applied to myelinated and unmyelinated fibers or axonopathy. Decreased fractional anisotropy in white-matter tracts occurs in cases of injury with disorganized or disrupted myelin sheaths. Furthermore , high angular resolution methods enable detection of fiber crossings or convergence. DTI is a modern tool which complements conventional magnetic resonance techniques and is particularly relevant to assess the organization of cerebellar tracts. Indeed , both the afferent and efferent pathways of the cerebellar circuitry passing through the inferior , middle , and superior cerebellar peduncles can be visualized in vivo , including in children. The microanatomy of the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei is also emerging as a future assessment. Applications in the field of cerebellar disorders are multiple , ranging from developmental disorders to adult-onset cerebellar
