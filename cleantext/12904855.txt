  It is generally assumed that blind insertion of nasogastric tubes for enteral nutrition in patients admitted to medical intensive care units is safe; that is , does not result in life-threatening injury. If death occurs in temporal association with insertion of a nasogastric tube , caregivers typically attribute it to underlying diseases , with little or no consideration of iatrogenic death due to tube insertion. The clinical and autopsy results in three recent cases at Baylor University Medical Center challenge the validity of these notions.
