  The recent rise in virus-like particles ( VLPs) in biomedical and materials research can be attributed to their ease of biosynthesis , discrete size , genetic programmability , and biodegradability. While they 're highly amenable to bioconjugation reactions for adding synthetic ligands onto their surface , the range in bioconjugation methodologies on these aqueous born capsids is relatively limited. To facilitate the direction of functional biomaterials research , non-traditional bioconjugation reactions must be considered. The reaction described in this protocol uses dibromomaleimides to introduce new functionality in the solvent exposed disulfide bonds of a VLP based upon Bacteriophage QÎ². Furthermore , the final product is fluorescent , which has the added benefit of generating a trackable in vitro probe using a commercially available filter set.
