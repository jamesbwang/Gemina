  While leptin deficiency or dysfunction leads to morbid obesity , obese subjects are characterized paradoxically by hyperleptinemia indicating lack of response to leptin. C-reactive protein ( CRP) has been suggested to be a key plasma protein that could bind to leptin. To examine whether CRP interferes with leptin action , mediated through its cell surface receptor , docking studies of CRP with the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor were done employing bioinformatics tools. Monomeric CRP docked with better
