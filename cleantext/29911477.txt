  Simulation-based training ( SBT) has become a standard component of modern surgical education , yet successful implementation of evidence-based training programs remains challenging. In this narrative review , we use Kern 's framework for curriculum development to describe where we are now and what lies ahead for SBT within surgery with a focus on technical skills in operative procedures. Despite principles for optimal SBT ( proficiency-based , distributed , and deliberate practice) having been identified , massed training with fixed time intervals or a fixed number of repetitions is still being extensively used , and simulators are generally underutilized. SBT should be part of surgical training curricula , including theoretical , technical , and non-technical skills , and be based on relevant needs assessments. Furthermore , training should follow evidence-based theoretical principles for optimal training , and the effect of training needs to be evaluated using relevant outcomes. There is a larger , still unrealized potential of surgical SBT , which may be realized in the near future as simulator technologies evolve , more evidence-based training programs are implemented , and cost-effectiveness and impact on patient safety is clearly demonstrated.
