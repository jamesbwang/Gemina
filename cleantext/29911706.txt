  Luminescent benzimidazolium based surface active ionic liquid ( SAIL) is found to form micelles in aqueous medium , which act as nano-interfaces for the selective recognition of ADP in the nanomolar range. A significant enhancement in fluorescence emission demonstrating the conversion and amplification of molecular information using micellar nano-interfaces is observed for the first time.
