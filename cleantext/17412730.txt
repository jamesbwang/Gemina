  Very few data have been reported for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) caused by unprotected left main coronary artery ( ULMCA) occlusion , and very little is known about the results of this subgroup of patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and outcomes of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI for acute ULMCA occlusion. From January 2000 to February 2014 , 372 patients with STEMI caused by ULMCA acute occlusion ( ULMCA-STEMI) who underwent primary PCI at one of two centers were enrolled. The 230 patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI ( NSTEMI) caused by ULMCA lesion<symptom> ( ULMCA-NSTEMI) who underwent emergency PCI were designated the control group. The main indexes were the major adverse cardiac events ( MACEs) in-hospital , at 1 month , and at 1 year. Compared to the NSTEMI patients , the patients with STEMI had significantly higher rates of Killip class ≥ III ( 21.2 % vs. 3.5 % , χ Compared to the NSTEMI patients , the patients with STEMI and ULMCA lesions<symptom> still remain at a much higher risk for adverse events at 1 year , especially on 1 month. If a successful PCI procedure is performed , the 1-year outcomes in those patients might improve.
