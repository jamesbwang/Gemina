  Regular vigorous physical activity ( PA) and high levels of physical fitness ( PF) confer health benefits. Conversely , sedentary time is a risk factor for chronic illness , independent of PA.. We evaluated associations between self-reported PA , sedentary time , and objective PF measures in military Service members. Cross-sectional study including 10,105 Air Force Millennium Cohort participants with a valid physical fitness assessment ( PFA). Linear regression assessed associations between self-report PA , screen time , and usual activity and abdominal circumference ( AC) and VO Men who self-reported high versus low levels of PA had greater AC ( 19-29 years: β = 0.23 in. , 95 % CI 0.07 , 0.39; 30-39 years: β = 0.45 in. , 95 % CI 0.17 , 0.72). High versus low self-reported PA was also associated with greater VO Self-reported PA and screen time were associated with some objective PF measures , including VO
