  In suitable patients , unicompartmental knee arthroplasty ( UKA) offers a number of advantages compared with total knee arthroplasty. However , the procedure is technically demanding , with a small tolerance for error. Assistive technology has the potential to improve the accuracy of implant positioning.This review paper describes the concept of detailed UKA planning in 3D , and the 3D printing technology that enables a plan to be delivered intraoperatively using patient-specific instrumentation ( PSI). The varying guide designs that enable accurate registration are discussed and described. The system accuracy is reported.Future studies need to ascertain whether accuracy for low-volume surgeons can be delivered in the operating theatre using PSI , and reflected in improved patient reported outcome measures , and lower revision rates.
