  Ants are a globally distributed insect family whose members have adapted to live in a wide range of different environments and ecological niches. Foraging ants everywhere face the recurring challenge of navigating to find food and to bring it back to the nest. More than a century of research has led to the identification of some key navigational strategies , such as compass navigation , path integration , and route following. Ants have been shown to rely on visual , olfactory , and idiothetic cues for navigational guidance. Here , we summarize recent behavioral work , focusing on how these cues are learned and stored as well as how different navigational cues are integrated , often between strategies and even across sensory modalities. Information can also be communicated between different navigational routines. In this way , a shared toolkit of fundamental navigational strategies can lead to substantial flexibility in behavioral outcomes. This allows individual ants to tune their behavioral repertoire to different tasks ( e.g. , foraging and homing) , lifestyles ( e.g. , diurnal and nocturnal) , or environments , depending on the availability and reliability of different guidance cues. We also review recent anatomical and physiological studies in ants and other insects that have started to reveal neural correlates for specific navigational strategies , and which may provide the beginnings of a truly mechanistic understanding of navigation behavior.
