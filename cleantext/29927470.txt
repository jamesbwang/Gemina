  Dexamethasone intravitreal implant ( DEX) ( Ozurdex; Allergan plc , Dublin , Ireland) is approved for the treatment of diabetic macular edema<symptom> ( DME). This study assessed the real-world effectiveness , safety , and reinjection interval of DEX in adult patients with DME. This was a phase 4 , prospective , multicenter ( 18 U.S. sites) , observational study. The study population comprised 177 patients ( 180 eyes; 93.8 % previously treated). Baseline mean best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) and central retinal thickness ( CRT) were 54.4 letters and 424.6 μm , respectively. DEX was administered as monotherapy or with other DME therapy ( 55 %/ 45 %). The mean reinjection interval was 5.0 months. Mean maximum BCVA change from baseline after the first three DEX injections was +9.1 letters , +7.7 letters , and +7.0 letters , respectively ( P < .001); 36.0 % of eyes achieved 15-letter or greater BCVA improvement. Mean maximum CRT change from baseline was -137.7 μm ( P < .001). DEX used alone or with other DME therapy improved visual and anatomic outcomes in DME patients in clinical practice , with no new safety concerns.
