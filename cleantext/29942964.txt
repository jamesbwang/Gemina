  Pyridin-2-ylmethyl tosylate derivatives are obtained in high yields from 2-alkylpyridine 1-oxides via a ( 3,3)- sigmatropic rearrangement of the adduct between 2-alkylpridine 1-oxides with benzenesulfonyl chlorides. Moreover , alkylnitrones also undergo ( 3,3)- sigmatropic rearrangement to give Î±-tosylated ketones after hydrolysis. Substitution reactions with nucleophiles then lead to diverse useful functionalizations for the synthesis of pincer ligands.
