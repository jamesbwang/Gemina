  This retrospective study examined the effect of voice rehabilitation training ( VRT) for patients with laryngeal cancer ( LC) after radiotherapy.Eighty-three eligible patients with LC were included. Forty-three patients were assigned to a treatment group , and underwent VRT , while the other 40 subjects were assigned to a control group , and were at waiting list. Primary outcome was measured by the Grade , Roughness , Breathiness , Asthenia<symptom> , and Strain ( GRBAS) scale. Secondary outcome was measured by Patient Perception Measures. All outcomes were measured before and 3 months after VRT intervention.Patients in the treatment group did not show better outcomes , measured by GRBAS scale ( Grade , P = .78; Roughness , P = .61; Breathiness , P = .83; Ashenia , P = .89; and Strain , P = .41) , and Patient Perception Measures ( Vocal quality , P = .17; Acceptability , P = .35; Hoarseness<symptom> , P = .23; Vocal fatigue<symptom> , P = .39; and Ashamed , P = .51) , compared with patients in the control group.The results of this study did not exert better outcomes in patients received VRT than those at waiting list.
