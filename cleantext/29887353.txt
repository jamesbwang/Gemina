  In our previous study , the isolation of ugonin J , K , and L , which are luteolin derivatives , from the roots of Helminthostachys zeylanica and their identification as potent melanogenesis inhibitors , was described. The structure activity relationship ( SAR) investigation in that study revealed that the catechol moiety in the B-ring of the flavone skeleton of ugonin K was important for its melanogenesis inhibitory activity , and the presence of the low polarity substituents at the C-7 position enhanced this activity. In order to further investigate the SAR of the C-7-substituent in the luteolin derivatives , different groups were selectively introduced at the C-7 position of luteolin after borax protection of the catechol hydroxyl group and the C-5 hydroxyl group. NMR and MS analysis of the borax protected derivatives revealed that the borax protects not only hydroxyl groups of catechol on the B ring but also the 5-hydroxyl group on the A ring. Eight luteolin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for melanogenesis inhibitory effect in B16 melanoma cells. Two bulky groups and six alkoxyl groups were introduced at the C-7 position. The resulting luteolin derivatives showed improved melanogenesis and cell proliferation inhibitory activities. From among these derivatives , 7-O-hexylluteolin ( 7) showed the highest activity and inhibited the melanogenesis to 14 % at 6.25 Î¼M. The present study also revealed that the length of the carbon chain rather than the bulky substituent was more important for the melanogenesis inhibitory activity.
