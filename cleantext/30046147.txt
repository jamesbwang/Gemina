  This is the second-largest retrospective analysis addressing the controversy of whether adult rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS) should be treated with chemotherapy regimens adopted from pediatric RMS protocols or adult soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> protocols. A comprehensive database search identified 553 adults with primary non-metastatic RMS. Increasing age , intermediate-risk disease , no chemotherapy use , anthacycline-based and poor chemotherapy response were significant predictors of poor overall and progression-free survival. In contrast , combined cyclophosphamide-based , cyclophosphamide + anthracycline-based , or cyclophosphamide + ifosfamide + anthracycline-based regimens significantly improved outcomes. Intermediate-risk disease was a significant predictor of poor chemotherapy response. Overall survival of clinical group-III patients was significantly improved if they underwent delayed complete resection. Non-parameningeal clinical group-I patients had the best local control , which was not affected by additional adjuvant radiotherapy. This study highlights the superiority of chemotherapy regimens- adapted from pediatric protocols- compared to anthracycline-based regimens. There is lack of data to support the routine use of adjuvant radiotherapy for non-parameningeal group-I patients. Nonetheless , intensive local therapy should be always considered for those at high risk for local recurrence , including intermediate-risk disease , advanced IRS stage , large tumors or narrow surgical margins. Although practically difficult ( due to tumor 's rarity) , there is a pressing need for high quality randomized controlled trials to provide further guidance.
