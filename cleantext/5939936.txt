  There is growing interest in understanding how specific neural events that occur during sleep , including characteristic spindle oscillations between 10 and 16 Hz ( Hz) , are related to learning and memory. Neural events can be recorded during sleep using the well-known method of scalp electroencephalography ( EEG). While publicly available sleep EEG datasets exist , most consist of only a few channels collected in specific patient groups being evaluated overnight for sleep disorders in clinical settings. The dataset described in this
