  Pd-catalyzed Hiyama vinylation reaction of non-activated aryl chlorides and bromides under mild conditions was developed. The use of efficient vinyl donors and electron-rich sterically hindered phosphine ligands was critical for the success of the reaction. The products of this transformation can be used for Am/Cm separation , an important challenge in nuclear fuel reprocessing. The substituent effect on Am/Cm separating selectivity was also achieved , which could contribute to the development of new chromatographic materials for the separation of Am and Cm.
