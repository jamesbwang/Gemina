  Dietary and physical activity advice have been considered to be seminal ingredients in prevention and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this regard , the impacts of a three-month self-management intervention on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes were examined in the present study. A Double-arm post-test intervention study. In the current post-test intervention study , three two-hour educational sessions on dietary habits and physical activity designed according to Health Belief Model were presented to 16 non-complicated type 2 diabetic patients and their dietary , physical activities , and biochemical outcomes were compared to a 23 patient-control arm in Iraq in 2017. The level of physical activity was measured through International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ) , dietary habits through UK Diabetes and Diet Questionnaire ( UKDDQ) , and biochemical indicators including HbA1c were measured after three months of program completion. The study showed that walking , taking vegetable , fruit , and bread were higher and taking full-fat cheese and full-fat spread was lower among experimental group significantly compared to control arm. In addition , the experimental group had a substantial higher albumin and lower urea , ALP-Phosphatase , and glucose levels in comparison with control patients. No substantial change was seen in HbA1C and no change in milk and fish products. The substantial positive changes in physical activity , dietary habits , and some biochemical indicators were seen following intervention completion in the experimental arm.
