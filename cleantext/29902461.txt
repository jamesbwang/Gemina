  Atherosclerosis remains to be one of the most common vascular disorders resulting in morbidity and mortality in the world. Recent studies suggested that endothelial cells ( ECs) injury caused by oxidative low-density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL) is an early marker for atherosclerosis. Nevertheless , the mechanisms of ox-LDL-induced ECs injury are complicated and largely unknown. Here , we found lncRNA XIST ( X-inactive specific transcript) was upregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) stimulated by ox-LDL. Knockdown of XIST boosted the cell viability and suppressed cell apoptosis under ox-LDL stimuli. Further experiments identified XIST regulated the expression of Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain 2 ( NOD2) by sponging miR-320. XIST silencing exerted a protective effect on ox-LDL-induced HUVECs injury via miR-320/ NOD2 regulatory network. Our data provide insight into the role of the lncRNA XIST in ox-LDL mediated ECs injury , which can aid in developing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
