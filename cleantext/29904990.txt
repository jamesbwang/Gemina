  This study presents a novel , student-centred , on-demand video learning modality that supports students as they transition from theory to clinical practice. Authentic , one-to-one teacher and student consultations have been video recorded and uploaded online for the peers and subsequent years of students to consume and learn from. This study describes the development and use of these communal consultation videos ( CCVs) , examines how students perceive this novel intervention and proposes supporting educational theory. A library of 28 CCVs has been archived online , to enable learning for students not present at the original staff consultation. A questionnaire was designed and administered to evaluate student perceptions of this novel learning intervention and administered to see how students used and perceived its benefit. The CCV has proven to be popular , well received and valued by students. Students reported the videos were interactive , engaged them cognitively and supported them for assessments and in preparation for the clinical care of their own patients. Students also reported that watching the videos broadened their `` clinical '' experience of others cases that were different to their own. This novel learning modality demonstrates new engaging learning opportunities for students and teachers that support students for assessments and clinical skill practice and afford observational clinical experience.
