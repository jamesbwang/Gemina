  A series of composites consisting of g-C ₃ N ₄ sheet and mesoporous Nb ₂ O ₅ ( mNb ₂ O ₅) microsphere were fabricated by in situ hydrolysis deposition of NbCl ₅ onto g-C ₃ N ₄ sheet followed by solvothermal treatment. The samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , N ₂ adsorption-desorption , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( DRS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy ( PL). The photocatalytic activity of the composites was studied by degradation of rhodamine B ( RhB) and tetracycline hydrochloride ( TC-HCl) in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (
