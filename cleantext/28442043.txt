  Comprehensive studies on spatial distribution of preantral follicles in the ovary are scarce. Considering that preantral follicles represent the main ovarian reserve , harvesting of these follicles is crucial for the development/use of assisted reproductive techniques. Therefore , knowledge on follicle spatial distribution can be helpful for targeting areas with richer number of preantral follicles through biopsy procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and localization of equine preantral follicles according to: ( i) age , ( ii) ovarian portion ( lateral and intermediary) and region ( dorsal and ventral) , ( iii) distance from the geometric center , and ( iv) follicular class. Ovaries from young and old mares ( n = 8) were harvested in a slaughterhouse and submitted to histological processing for further evaluation. For data analyses , a novel methodology was developed according to the geometric center of each histological section for a precise determination of preantral follicle distribution. Results indicated that ( i) equine preantral follicles are clustered and located near to the ovarian geometric center , and that aging induced their dispersion through the ovarian cortex; ( ii) the distance from the geometric center was shorter for developing follicles than primordial; and ( iii) secondary follicles were more distant from the geometric center but closer to the ovulation fossa. In conclusion , the spatial distribution of preantral follicles was successfully determined in the equine ovary and was affected by age , region , and portion.
