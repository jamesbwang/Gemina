  Glioblastoma ( GBM) still carries a poor prognosis due to the refractoriness against antitumor drugs. Temozolomide ( TMZ) , one of the few standard therapy drugs against GBM worldwide , has only limited effect due to acquired TMZ resistance of GBM. Therefore , development of novel therapeutic methods to overcome the TMZ resistance of GBM is urgent. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the human body , so modulation of cholesterol in tumor cells originating from the brain including GBM may be a tumor-specific therapeutic strategy including enhancement of TMZ effects. The unique lipid metabolism of glioma has recently been reported , but the involvement of intracellular cholesterol in TMZ therapy is yet to be fully elucidated. This review summarizes the effect of modulation of intracellular cholesterol level on cancer therapy including GBM treatment and the implications for TMZ therapy. Our recent findings about the involvement of intracellular cholesterol in TMZ-induced GBM cell death are described.
