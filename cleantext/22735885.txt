  Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( aRMS) is an aggressive subtype of the most common soft tissue cancer in children. A hallmark of aRMS tumors is incomplete myogenic differentiation despite expression of master myogenic regulators such as MyoD. We previously reported that histone methyltransferase KMT1A suppresses MyoD function to maintain an undifferentiated state in aRMS cells , and that loss of KMT1A is sufficient to induce differentiation and suppress malignant phenotypes in these cells. Here , we develop a chemical compound screening approach using MyoD-responsive luciferase reporter myoblast cells to identify compounds that alleviate suppression of MyoD-mediated differentiation by KMT1A. A screen of pharmacological compounds yielded the topoisomerase I ( TOP1) poison camptothecin ( CPT) as the strongest hit in our assay system. Furthermore , treatment of aRMS cells with clinically relevant CPT derivative irinotecan restores MyoD function , and myogenic differentiation
