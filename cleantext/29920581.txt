  This study reports on the logistics and feasibility of a novel multidisciplinary approach to biopsychosocial care at a tertiary adult inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) center. Consecutive patients referred for a new IBD consultation completed the following self-assessments: the Short Form-12 , the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS) Global Health Scale , the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 , and the PROMIS-29. These measures were scored at the time of appointment check-in by a trained licensed clinical social worker ( SW) , and those scoring 1.5 standard deviations below the population mean were targeted for SW assessment and intervention at the point of care; patients or providers could also request a SW evaluation even if cutoffs were not met. In this stepped-care model , the SW could refer to same-day on-site psychiatry services or outside interventions and services. In addition , we implemented a 12-month curriculum with a monthly didactic and case-based education seminar for health care providers who interact with patients with IBD. Between February 2014 and May 2015 , 110 patients ( 53 % male; mean age , 42 years) completed a self-assessment. All patients completed their self-assessment within 10 minutes. Of these , 36.4 % ( 40/110) were targeted for SW assessment and intervention. The SW interventions were grouped into 4 categories: psychological education and coping tools for symptom management and emotional wellness ( n = 30); psychotherapy referrals ( n = 30); financial/governmental programs ( n = 11); and psychiatry referrals for consultation and/or medication prescription ( n = 21). The educational seminars were highly rated by participating providers. A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach to adult IBD care is feasible. Education for providers and close coordination across specialties are critical to the success of a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial program.
