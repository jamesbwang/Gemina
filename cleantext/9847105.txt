  Lipid transfer proteins ( LTPs) , a class of small , ubiquitous proteins , play critical roles in various environmental stresses. However , their precise biological functions remain unknown. Here we isolated an extracellular matrix-localised LTP , NtLTP4 , from Nicotiana tabacum. The overexpression of NtLTP4 in N. tabacum enhanced resistance to salt and drought stresses. Upon exposure to high salinity , NtLTP4-overexpressing lines ( OE lines) accumulated low Na
