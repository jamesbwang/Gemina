  Treatment of orbital fractures involves restoration of lost bone anatomy and orbital volume. Among the materials used for this purpose , the titanium mesh is widely used due to its effectiveness and low complication rate related to distortion especially in non-traumatic events. This study shows an atypical and late complication involving the deformation of the titanium mesh used during reconstruction of the orbital floor in a patient with orbital zygomatic complex fracture 5 months after the procedure and without traumatic etiology.
