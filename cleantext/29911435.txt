  Medication administration omission errors ( MAOEs) occur frequently in hospitals and can significantly affect patient health. An interdisciplinary committee was formed in summer 2012 to analyse incident/accident reports ( AH-223-1 forms) of MAOEs for the 2011-2012 fiscal year in order to identify contributing factors and to propose preventive solutions. Special attention was paid to events with consequences for patients. An aggregate data analysis involving four major steps was conducted: sampling , categorisation , identification of contributing factors , and seeking preventive solutions. One hundred omissions were randomly selected from the 889 reported for this period. All omissions categorised as having had consequences for patients were then added , making a final total of 145 omissions. The omissions were categorised using an Ishikawa diagram developed from an exploratory literature review and process mapping. Subsequent to failure modes , effects and criticality analysis , cause-and-effect diagrams were constructed with the main prioritised categories to differentiate the proximal causes from the root causes. Brainstorming was used to develop solutions , which were then prioritised with an impact/effort matrix. This study identified 27 categories of MAOEs , of which the 7 most frequent and the most critical accounted for 79.3 % of the reports. The event categories , in decreasing order of importance , were related to intravenous ( IV) therapy ( 29.0 %) , failure in using the medication administration record ( MAR; 23.4 %) , failure in creating/updating the MAR ( 10.3 %) , medications on the patient 's bedside ( 7.6 %) , and three types of MAOEs related to transcribing prescriptions ( 9.0 %). The interdisciplinary committee formulated 10 main recommendations related to these 7 categories , including 3 for IV therapy and 4 for failure in using or creating/updating the MAR..
