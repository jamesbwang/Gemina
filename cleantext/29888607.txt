  Nickel-catalyzed asymmetric annulation of oxygenated phenols and previously challenging 3-aminophenols with β,γ-unsaturated α-ketoesters is described , leading to rapid access to a variety of oxygenated and 7-aminated chromans in excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities under mild conditions. This method was readily scaled-up to gram scale and applied for a concise synthesis of two potential anticancer agents 7-aminated 4-arylchromans.
