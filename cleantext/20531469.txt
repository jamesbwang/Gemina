  Detection of copy number variations ( CNVs) is a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for children with neurodevelopmental disorders ( NDD) , which reveals the genetic cause of the disorder in more than 20 %. These are mostly known microdeletion/microduplication syndromes<disease> , but variants of unknown clinical significance ( VOUS) and ambiguous CNVs can also be detected. An example of the last two are abnormalities in the DOCK8 gene. Conflicting interpretations of CNVs affecting DOCK8 can be found in the literature. Deletions were predicted to have a impact in carriers with variable clinical manifestations , where duplications have been proposed as benign variants. In our study , CNV screening was performed in a cohort involving 439 probands with suspected NDD. We identified known microdeletion/microduplication syndromes<disease> in 19 % and VOUS CNVs in 8 % of patients. Among these , three patients had a CNV encompassing the DOCK8 gene. Although diverse clinical presentations are noted in our three patients , comparison of their phenotypes revealed that abnormalities in cognition and communication , aggressive behaviour and mood swings are common to all of them. Therefore , a clinical relevance , in terms of influencing the psychiatric clinical picture of patients , is proposed for the CNVs disrupting the DOCK8 gene , regardless of whether it is a deletion or duplication.
