  To compare the lamina cribrosa thickness and anterior lamina cribrosa depth between patients with and without diabetes mellitus and to investigate the effect of metabolic control and duration of diabetes mellitus on lamina cribrosa thickness and anterior lamina cribrosa depth using enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and were divided into the diabetes and control groups. Intraocular pressure , circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness , anterior lamina cribrosa depth and lamina cribrosa thickness were compared between the groups. In the control group , the mean intraocular pressure was 14.6 ± 3.1 ( mean ± standard deviation) mmHg , mean circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was 105.41 ± 5.86 μm , mean anterior lamina cribrosa depth was 420.3 ± 90.2 μm and mean lamina cribrosa thickness was 248.5 ± 5.4 μm. In the diabetes group , the mean intraocular pressure was 13.9 ± 2.2 mmHg , mean circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was 101.37 ± 10.97 μm , mean anterior lamina cribrosa depth was 351.4 ± 58.6 μm and mean lamina cribrosa thickness was 271.6 ± 33.9 μm. Lamina cribrosa thickness was significantly higher ( p < 0.001) and anterior lamina cribrosa depth was significantly lower ( p = 0.003) in the diabetes group. There was no statistical difference between the groups with regard to age , spherical equivalent , axial length , circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and intraocular pressure ( p = 0.69 , 0.26 , 0.47 , 0.06 and 0.46 , respectively). Lamina cribrosa thickness and anterior lamina cribrosa depth were not significantly correlated with duration of diabetes mellitus ( lamina cribrosa thickness: r = -0.078 , p = 0.643; anterior lamina cribrosa depth: r = -0.062 , p = 0.710) or HbA1c levels ( lamina cribrosa thickness: r = -0.078 , p = 0.596; anterior lamina cribrosa depth: r = -0.228 , p = 0.169). The results of this study showed that the optical coherence tomography measurement of lamina cribrosa revealed thicker and more anteriorly positioned lamina cribrosa for patients with diabetes mellitus compared with those for healthy controls.
