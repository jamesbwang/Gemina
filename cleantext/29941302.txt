  Few studies have compared mid-term results of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB) versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) , and none have focused on lipid profile. To compare LRYGB versus LSG with respect to lipid disturbance evolution and remission at mid-term after bariatric surgery ( BS) and to assess associated factors with the remission of lipid disturbances at 5 years. Hospital del Mar , Barcelona , from January 2005 to January 2012. A retrospective analysis of a nonrandomized , prospective cohort was conducted on patients undergoing BS at Hospital del Mar , Barcelona , from January 2005 to January 2012 with â‰¥ 5 years ' follow-up. Of 259 patients , 151 ( 58.3 %) completed the 5-year follow-up. The proportion of patients who achieved normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 5 years post-LRYGB was greater than after LSG ( 30/49 ( 61.2 %) versus 6/23 ( 26.1 %); P = .005) , being male sex , absence of statins treatment , and type of BS technique ( LRYGB) the associated factors with remission. Hypertriglyceridemia remission was also higher after LRYGB ( 23/25 ( 92.0 %) versus 10/15 ( 66.7 %); P = .041) , although type of surgery was not an associated factor. No differences were found in remission rates of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol between groups. Absence of fibrates treatment and 5-year percentage of excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> were independently associated with hypertriglyceridemia remission , and only the latter was independently associated with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol remission 5 years after surgery. Five-year outcome data showed that , among patients with severe obesity undergoing BS , LRYGB was associated with a higher total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and remission in comparison to LSG , with no differences in hypertriglyceridemia and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol normalization.
