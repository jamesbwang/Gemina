  Natural resistance-associated substitutions ( RASs) are reported with highly variable prevalence across different HCV genotypes ( GTs). Frequency of natural RASs in a large Italian real-life cohort of patients infected with the 4 main HCV-GTs was investigated. NS3 , NS5A and NS5B sequences were analysed in 1445 HCV-infected DAA-naÃ¯ve patients. Sanger-sequencing was performed by home-made protocols on 464 GT1a , 585 GT1b , 92 GT2c , 199 GT3a , 16 GT4a and 99 GT4d samples. Overall , 20.7 % ( 301/1455) of patients showed natural RASs , and the prevalence of multiclass-resistance was 7.3 % ( 29/372 patients analysed). NS3-RASs were particularly common in GT1a and GT1b ( 45.2-10.8 % , respectively) , mainly due to 80K presence in GT1a ( 17 %). Almost all GTs showed high prevalence of NS5A-RASs ( range: 10.2-45.4 %) , and especially of 93H ( 5.1 %). NS5A-RASs with fold-change > 100x were detected in 6.8 % GT1a ( 30H/R- 31M-93C/ H) , 10.3 % GT1b ( 31V-93H) , 28.4 % GT2c ( 28C-31M-93H) , 8.5 % GT3a ( 30K-93H) , 45.5 % GT4a ( 28M-30R-93H) and 3.8 % GT4d ( 28V-30S-93H). Sofosbuvir RAS 282T was never detected , while the 159F and 316N RASs were found in GT1b ( 13.4-19.1 % , respectively). Natural RASs are common in Italian patients infected with HCV-GTs 1-4. High prevalence of clinically-relevant RASs ( such as Y93H) supports the appropriateness of HCV resistance-test to properly guide DAA-based therapy.
