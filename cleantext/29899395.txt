  We assessed the efficacy of adding intraperitoneal ( IP) chemotherapy to standard first-line intravenous ( IV) chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) patients. Patients with stage IIIC-IV EOC who underwent optimal debulking surgery were randomly assigned to four cycles of weekly IP chemotherapy with cisplatin ( 50 mg/m Between 4/2009 and 9/2015 , 218 patients were randomised , of whom 215 initiated treatment. In the IP/IV arm , 90.6 % of patients completed 4 cycles of IP chemotherapy. The 12-month NPRs were 81.9 % and 64.2 % in the IP/IV and IV groups , respectively ( HR 0.48 ( 95 % CI 0.27-0.82)). The median progression-free survival ( PFS) was increased in the IP/IV arm compared with that in the IV arm ( 22.4 vs. 16.8 months; HR 0.66 ( 0.48-0.91)) and in a subgroup with no gross cytoreduction ( 31.1 vs. 16.8 months; HR 0.46 ( 0.26-0.82)). Similar findings were detected with regard to time to first subsequent anticancer therapy ( TFST) ( 25.9 vs. 18.0 months; P = 0.009) and time to second subsequent anticancer therapy ( TSST) ( 40.8 vs. 30.1 months; P = 0.042). Grade 3/4 leukopenia<symptom> , anaemia and gastrointestinal events were more common in the IP/IV arm , but the treatment burden was considered acceptable. IP chemotherapy prior to IV chemotherapy was associated with an increased 12-month NPR and a longer TSST than IV alone in patients with EOC , albeit with acceptable toxic effects. Long-term follow-up is warranted to identify the effects of IP therapy on overall survival.
