  Curcumin is a phytochemical polyphenol extracted from turmeric rhizome , with multiple biological activities , intensively studied in various therapeutic areas. Its effects covers a wide range of specialties , from the neuroprotective to the antimetastatic properties , influencing pathologies from cardiovascular , neuronal and oncological fields , as a part of its broad spectrum of action. These effects are explained by antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic simultaneous roles of curcumin and its derivatives. In this review , we selected the information about morphological evidences correlated with the biological effects on the following organ systems: the central nervous system ( including neurological pathology , such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease) , the cardiovascular system ( including disorders like atherosclerosis , endothelial dysfunction and drug-induced myotoxicity) , multiple forms of cancer , and metabolic syndromes<disease> including diabetes. The central point of this review was to target a variety of morphological changes at microscopic level induced by curcumin , using different microscopy techniques.
