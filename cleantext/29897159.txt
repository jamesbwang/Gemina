  Postural sway measured using force plate technology is a known risk factor for falls in older adults , but is currently underutilized due to the high cost and lack of portability issues associated with most force plate systems. The Balance<symptom> Tracking System ( BTrackS) is a new force plate that alleviates these barriers and has potential for widespread use. The present study provides important normative data for the BTrackS Balance<symptom> Test of postural sway that improves its translational value to the field of gerontology. BTrackS Balance<symptom> Test postural sway results were accumulated from 6280 community-dwelling individuals across the adult lifespan. Data were assessed for effects of age , sex and body size. Stratified percentile rankings were then calculated. BTrackS Balance<symptom> Test results were dependent on age and sex , but not body size. Percentile rankings were , therefore , determined across various age groups for men and women separately , with no consideration of participant body size. A novel interaction was found between the age and sex factors , suggesting enhanced postural sway ability for women that becomes more pronounced with older age. The results of the present study represent one of the largest sets of normative postural sway data ever published. These data translate directly into the field of gerontology as a tool for determining abnormalities in postural sway , which have been linked to various poor outcomes in older adults , such as high fall risk.
