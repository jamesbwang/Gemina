  Spintronic and nanomagnetic devices often derive their functionality from layers of different materials and the interfaces between them. This is especially true for synthetic antiferromagnets- two or more ferromagnetic layers that are separated by metallic spacers or tunnel barriers and which have antiparallel magnetizations. Here , we discuss the new opportunities that arise from synthetic antiferromagnets , as compared to crystal antiferromagnets or ferromagnets.
