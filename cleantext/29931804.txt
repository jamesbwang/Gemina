  The aim of this study is to examine outcomes from MI Values , a motivational interviewing ( MI) intervention implemented adjunctive to obesity treatment. Adolescents ( n = 99; 73 % African American; 74 % female; mean body mass index ( BMI) percentile = 98.9 Â± 1.2) were randomized to receive two MI sessions or education control. All adolescents participated in structured behavioural weight management treatment. Baseline , 3- and 6-month assessments of anthropometrics , dietary intake and physical activity were obtained. Both groups had significant reductions in BMI z-scores and energy intake and increased physical activity at 3 and 6 months ( P < 0.05). MI participants reported greater reductions in 3-month energy intake compared with controls. Participation in MI is associated with reduction in energy intake , consistent with better adherence to dietitian visits previously reported from MI Values. MI might be an effective adjunct to adolescent obesity treatment; future research is needed to determine if motivational interviewing can enhance BMI outcomes , via greater adherence to behavioural intervention.
