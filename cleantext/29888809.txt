  The use of once-daily tacrolimus in de novo kidney transplantation is increasingly common. Therefore , we were interested in bioavailability aspects of novel once-daily tacrolimus ( LCPT , Envarsus) and once-daily tacrolimus extended-release formulation ( ER-Tac , Advagraf) compared with twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus ( IR-Tac , Prograf). Furthermore , we calculated the costs. Kidney allograft recipients on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression within 2 clinical trials were included in a single-center analysis. The tacrolimus formulations were compared with respect to daily doses , doses per body<symptom> weight , trough levels , and concentration-dose ( C/D) ratio over 12 months. Intrapatient variability in trough levels and C/D ratios after 3 months was calculated. For the calculation of tacrolimus costs , German list prices were used. Eighty patients ( 21 with LCPT , 23 with IR-Tac , and 36 with ER-Tac) were analyzed. Pharmacokinetic comparisons revealed significantly higher bioavailability of LCPT at all visits. The variability of trough levels and C/D ratios in general was high and highest in LCPT patients. Different dose requirements translated into different costs. Median treatment costs during the first year were 7.825 $ ( IQR 6.195-8.892 $) for LCPT , 9.813 $ ( IQR 7.630-16.832 $) for IR-Tac , and 9.838 $ ( IQR 7.503- 13.541 $) for ER-Tac ( Kruskal-Wallis test , P = .003). The 3 tacrolimus formulations exhibit different dose requirements , exposure , and costs in favor of LCPT.
