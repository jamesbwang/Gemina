  Suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS) proteins are crucial negative regulators in many signaling pathways and are implicated in the pathogenesis of infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. The purpose of this study was to uncover possible associations of common polymorphisms within SOCS genes with infectious outcomes after traumatic injury. A total of 1087 trauma patients ( Chongqing cohort 806 and Yunnan cohort 281) were recruited and followed up for the development of infectious outcomes , such as sepsis<disease> and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome<disease> ( MODS). Twelve selected single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were screened by Pyrosequencing to determine their genotypes and associations with infectious complications. Among the 12 selected SNPs , only the CISH promoter rs414171 polymorphism was consistently found to be statistically associated with the incidence of sepsis<disease> and MOD score in the two cohorts , despite analyzing the SNPs independently or in combination. Further , patients with a T allele had significantly lower CISH expression and lower production of TNF-α , but higher production of IL-10. Luciferase assay confirmed that the A → T variant in the rs414171 polymorphism significantly inhibited the transcriptional activities of the CISH gene. The CISH rs414171 polymorphism is significantly associated with susceptibility to sepsis<disease> and MODS in traumatic patients , which might prove to be a novel biomarker for indicating risk of infectious outcomes in critically injured patients.
