  Lithium niobate ( LN) is the workhorse for modern optoelectronics industry and nonlinear optics. High quality ( Q) factor LN microresonators are promising candidates for applications in optical communications , quantum photonics , and sensing. However , the phase-matching requirement of traditional evanescent coupling methods poses significant challenges to achieve high coupling efficiencies of the pump and signal light simultaneously , ultimately limiting the practical usefulness of these high Q factor LN resonators. Here , for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , we demonstrate deformed chaotic LN microcavities that feature directional emission patterns and high Q factors simultaneously. The chaotic LN microdisks are created using conventional semiconductor fabrication processes , with measured Q factors exceeding 10
