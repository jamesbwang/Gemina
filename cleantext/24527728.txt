  Nitration of tetraphenylporphyrin cage compound 1 , at -40 °C , leads to the regioselective formation of the chiral mononitro compound 2 ( 75 % isolated yield) and , at -30 °C , to the achiral syn-dinitro-derivative 3 and the chiral anti-dinitro derivative 4 in a diastereomeric ratio of 5:2 , which were separated by chromatography ( 46 and 20 % yields , respectively). The structures of the compounds were confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
