  The first steps in the gas-phase decomposition mechanism of N3,N6-bis ( 1 H-tetrazol-5-yl) -1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-diamine , BTATz , anions and the kinetic isotope effects in these processes were studied using combined multistage mass spectrometry ( MS/MS) and computational techniques. Two major fragmentation processes , the exergonic loss of nitrogen molecules and the endergonic loss of hydrazoic acid , were identified. The observation of a primary isotope effect supported by calculations suggests that the loss of a nitrogen molecule from the tetrazole ring involves proton migration , either to or within the terazole ring , as a rate-determining step. The fragmentation of a hydrazoic acid occurs through an asymmetrical retro-pericyclic reaction. Calculations show the relevance of these mechanisms to neutral BTATz. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of decomposition routes in these nitrogen-rich energetic materials and allow tailoring their reactivity and decomposition pathways for better control of performance.
