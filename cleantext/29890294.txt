  The amygdala plays a key role in gathering social cues to context-appropriate responses that require refined motor behavior , involving either direct or indirect connections with sensorimotor-related areas. Although , several studies investigated the structural and functional limbic connectivity of the amygdala both in animals and in humans , less is known about the limbic modulation on sensorimotor-related areas. However , recent evidences suggest the amygdala as a possible cornerstone in the limbic-motor interface. Herein , we used high-resolution diffusion data of the Massachusetts General Hospital-University of Southern California ( MGH-USC) Adult Diffusion Dataset , constrained spherical deconvolution-based signal modeling and probabilistic tractography aimed at identifying and reconstructing the connectivity patterns linking the amygdala to the limbic- and sensorimotor-related areas. As regards the limbic network , our results showed that the amygdala has high probability to be connected with the fusiform gyrus and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. On the other hand , our connectomic analysis revealed a close interplay between the amygdala and the inferior parietal lobule , followed by the postcentral gyrus , the precentral gyrus and the paracentral lobule. The findings of the present study are in line with previous literature and reinforce the idea of the existence of a limbic-motor interface , which is likely to be involved in the emotional modulation of complex functions such as spatial perception and movement computation. Considering that these pathways may play an important role , not on in physiological conditions , but also in pathological context , further studies should be fostered in order to confirm the existence of a limbic-motor interface and its precise functional meaning.
