  A regioselective green approach for the nickel ( II)- catalyzed C-N cross-coupling between arylamines and pyrazoles through a photoredox process is reported. Moderate to good yield was observed for this reaction , performed in water under air at room temperature. This strategy provides a powerful tool for the green synthesis of pyrazole-containing bioactive molecules. In addition , a single-electron-transfer mechanism is proposed in this report.
