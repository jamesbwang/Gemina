  Animal evidence has suggested that maternal emotional and nutritional stress during pregnancy is associated with behavioral outcomes in offspring. The nature of the stresses applied may differ , but it is often assumed that the mother 's hippocampus-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HHPA) axis response releases higher levels of glucocorticoid hormones. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST) is in a pivotal position to regulate the HHPA axis and the stress response , and it has been implicated in anxiety<symptom> behavior. In the current study , to search whether BNST structural changes and neurochemical alterations are associated with anxiety-related behavior in adult gestational protein-restricted offspring relative to an age-matched normal protein diet ( NP) rats , we conduct behavioral tests and , BNST dendritic tree analysis by Sholl analysis , associated to immunoblotting-protein quantification ( 11β-HSD2 , GR , MR , AT1R , 5HT1A and 5HT2A , corticotrophin-releasing factor ( CRH) and CRH1). Dams were maintained either on isocaloric standard rodent chow ( with NP content , 17 % casein or low protein content ( LP) , 6 % casein) chow throughout their entire pregnancy. Here , in rats subjected to gestational protein restriction , we found: ( a) a significant reduction in dendritic length and impoverished dendritic arborization in BNST neurons; ( b) an elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels; and ( c) associated with enhanced anxiety-like behavior when compared with age-matched NP offspring. Moreover , altered protein ( 11β-HSD2 , GR , MR and type 1 CRH receptors) expressions may underlie the increase in anxiety-like behavior in LP offspring. This work represents the first demonstration that BNST developmental plasticity by maternal protein restriction , resulting in fine structural changes and neurochemical alterations that are associated with modified behavioral states.
