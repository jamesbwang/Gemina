  Mouse models of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) exhibit marked differences in life expectancy depending on their genotype and sex. The assessment of frailty could provide a measure of healthspan to facilitate comparisons between different AD models. We used a validated mouse frailty index ( FI) assessment tool to explore genotype and sex differences in lifespan and healthspan of 3xTg-AD mice and their B6129F2 wild-type ( WT) controls. This tool is based on an approach commonly used in people and quantifies frailty by counting the accumulation of age-related health deficits. The number of deficits in an individual divided by the total number measured yields an FI score theoretically between 0 and 1 , with higher scores denoting more frailty. Male 3xTg-AD mice aged 300-600 days had higher FI scores ( Mean FI = 0.21 ± 0.03) than either male WT ( Mean FI = 0.15 ± 0.01) or female 3xTg-AD mice ( Mean FI = 0.10 ± 0.01) , and the elevated frailty scores were accompanied by parallel increases in mortality. Frailty increased exponentially with age , and higher rates of deficit accumulation elevated mortality risk in all groups of mice. When mice were stratified by FI score , frailty predicted mortality , at least in females. Therefore , the mouse clinical FI provides a valuable tool for evaluating healthspan in mouse models of AD with different lifespans.
