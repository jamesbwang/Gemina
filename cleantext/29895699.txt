  Cardiovascular events ( CV) are increased 36 fold in patients with end stage renal disease. However , randomized controlled trials to lower LDL-C and TC have not shown significant mortality improvements. An inverse association of serum total cholesterol ( TC) and LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C) with all-cause and cardiovascular ( CV) mortality has been observed in patients on chronic dialysis. Lipoproteins also may protect against infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. We used data from 37,250 patients in the international Monitoring Dialysis Outcomes ( MONDO) database to evaluate the association between lipids and infection-related or CV mortality. The study began on the first day of lipid measurement and continued for up to 4 years. We applied Cox proportional models with time-varying covariates to study associations of LDL-C , HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C) , and TGs with all-cause , CV , infectious , and other causes of death. Overall , 6,147 patients died ( 19.2 % from CV , 13.2 % from infection , 67.6 % from other causes). After multivariable adjustment , higher LDL-C , HDL-C , and TGs were independently associated with lower all-cause death risk. Neither LDL-C nor TGs were associated with CV death and HDL-C was associated with lower CV risk. Higher LDL-C and HDL-C were associated with a lower risk of death from infection or other non CV causes. LDL-C was associated with reduced all-cause and infectious , but not CV mortality , which resulted in the inverse association with all-cause mortality.
