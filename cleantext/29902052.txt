  Reports an error in `` Loneliness predicts self-reported cold symptoms after a viral challenge '' by Angie S. LeRoy , Kyle W. Murdock , Lisa M. Jaremka , Asad Loya and Christopher P. Fagundes ( As part of a larger parent study , 213 healthy participants completed the Short Loneliness Scale ( LON) and the Social Network Index ( SNI) at baseline. They were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus<pathogen> 39 ( RV39; i.e. , a common cold virus) , then quarantined for 5 days during which they reported on subjective cold symptoms in addition to being monitored for objective indicators of infection. Data from 160 of the participants ( who were infected with the virus) were used in the present analyses. A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that baseline loneliness predicted self-reported cold symptoms over time ( assessed via area under the curve) , over and above demographic variables , season of participation , and depressive affect. Interestingly , social network size and diversity did not predict cold symptoms. These findings suggest that the perception of loneliness is more closely linked to self-reported illness symptoms than objectively measured social isolation. Assessing psychosocial factors such as loneliness when treating and evaluating the common cold could contribute to health care practitioners ' understanding of their patients ' experiences with acute illness.
