  Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) is a major contributor to early and late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Despite results from a randomized controlled trial demonstrating an increased risk of chronic GVHD with use of growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC) compared with bone<disease> marrow , PBSCs are the most widely used graft source in allogeneic transplantation for hematologic neoplasms in the U.S.. This lecture will review established , recent , and novel strategies for GVHD prevention in unrelated donor PBSC transplantation and will highlight ongoing clinical research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Clinical trials aimed at defining standard-of-care GVHD prophylaxis after myeloablative and nonmyelablative conditioning will be presented. In addition , novel pharmacologic agents and graft manipulation strategies under investigation will be discussed. ( Presented at the 1962nd Meeting , May 12 , 2018).
