  In this work , we report a methodology for the quantification of Homocysteine ( HcySH) at neutral pH ( pH-7.0) using Au nanoparticles incorporated reduced graphene oxide ( AuNP/rGO/GCE) modified glassy carbon electrode. The modified electrode was characterized using SEM and XRD techniques. The electrode exhibited a typical behavior against the standard redox probe ( Fe ( CN)
