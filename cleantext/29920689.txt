  Although physicians are aware of the risks of prescribing long-term off-label antipsychotics in people with intellectual disability , attempts to discontinue often fail. This study aimed to identify potential determinants of successful and failed discontinuation. Long-term off-label antipsychotics were tapered in 14 weeks , with 12.5 % of baseline dose every 2 weeks. Participants living in facilities offered by intellectual disability service providers , â‰¥ 6 years , with an IQ < 70 were eligible to discontinue antipsychotic use , as judged by their physicians. The primary outcome was achievement of complete discontinuation at 16 weeks; changes in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC) and its 5 subscales were secondary outcomes. Potential determinants of the success or failure in discontinuing antipsychotics were psychotropic drug use and participants ' living circumstances , medical health conditions , and severity of behavioral symptoms and neurologic side effects. Of 499 eligible clients , 129 were recruited. Reasons for client non-participation were clinician concerns that discontinuation might increase challenging behaviors and changes in clients ' environment. Of the 129 participants , 61 % had completely discontinued antipsychotics at 16 weeks , 46 % at 28 weeks , and 40 % at 40 weeks. ABC total scores increased in 49 % of participants with unsuccessful discontinuation at 16 weeks. Autism , higher dose of antipsychotic drug , higher ABC and akathisia scores , and more-frequent worsening of health during discontinuation were associated with a lower incidence of complete discontinuation. Thus , in a selected sample of participants whom responsible clinicians had deemed discontinuation of antipsychotics could be attempted , 40 % had achieved and maintained discontinuation at end of follow-up. Physicians should try to address patients ' conditions that may hamper discontinuation.
