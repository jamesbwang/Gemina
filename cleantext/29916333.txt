  The treatment of injured tendon is an ever-increasing clinical and financial burden , for which tissue-engineered replacements have shown great promise. Recently , there has been growing interest in a more regenerative approach to tissue engineering , in which the cells ' ability to self-assemble and create matrix is harnessed to create tissue constructs without the use of a scaffold. Herein , utilizing our scaffold-free technique to engineer tendon at the single fiber level , we study how applied mechanical loading , namely cyclic uniaxial strain , influences the mechanical properties and nuclear alignment of developing tendon fiber constructs. Engineered fibers were subjected to 1 day , 3 days , and 7 days of intermittent uniaxial loading ( 0.0- 0.07 % sinusoidal strain) , then characterized mechanically via constant-rate elongation to failure to obtain tensile properties , histologically to examine cytoskeletal arrangement and nuclear shape , and characterized using RT-PCR to measure the expression of tendon specific makers , scleraxis and tenomodulin. Fiber peak stress , elastic modulus , toughness , and nuclear aspect ratio all increased with the presence and duration of loading , while failure strain , toe-in strain , and nuclear area were unchanged. These biomechanical results suggest that cyclic strain promotes matrix deposition in a manner that increases the fibers ' resistance to stretch , but preserves fiber extensibility over the 7-day loading period. Over 7 days of loading , the scleraxis and tenomodulin expression increased drastically. Histologically , while there was no immediate difference in nuclear area with the addition of loading , nuclear aspect ratio significantly increased with loading duration , such that nuclei became progressively more elongated to the long axis of the fiber. Together with our biomechanical findings , such nuclear deformation suggests that cyclic strain elicits a mechanotransductive response , particularly one that modulates gene expression to promote matrix deposition during fiber development.
