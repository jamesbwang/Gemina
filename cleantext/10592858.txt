  Abortion<disease> stigma is influenced by a variety of factors. Previous research has documented a range of contributors to stigma , but the influence of perceived social norms about contraception has not been significantly investigated. This study assesses the influence of perceived social norms about contraception on abortion<disease> stigma among women in Luanda , Angola. This analysis uses data from the 2012 Angolan Community Family Planning Survey. Researchers employed multi-stage random sampling to collect demographic , social , and reproductive information from a representative sample of Luandan women aged 15-49. Researchers analyzed data from 1469 respondents using chi-square and multiple logistic regression. Researchers analyzed women 's perceptions of how their partners , friends , communities , and the media perceived contraception , and examined associations between those perceptions and respondents ' abortion<disease> stigma. Stigma was approximated by likelihood to help someone get an abortion<disease> , likelihood to help someone who needed medical attention after an abortion<disease> , and likelihood to avoid disclosing abortion<disease> experience. Higher levels of partner engagement in family planning discussion were associated with increased stigma on two of the three outcome measures , while higher levels of partner support of contraception were associated with decreased stigma. Perceived community acceptance of family planning and media discussion of family planning were associated with a decrease in likelihood to help someone receive an abortion<disease> These results suggest that increasing partner support of family planning may be one strategy to help reduce abortion<disease> stigma. Results also suggest that some abortion<disease> stigma in Angola stems not from abortion<disease> itself , but rather from judgment about socially unacceptable pregnancies.
