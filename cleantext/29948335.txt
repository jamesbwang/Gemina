  Given the popularity of geosocial networking applications ( `` apps '') among gay , bisexual , and other men who have sex with men ( GBMSM) , this study sought to examine GBMSM 's willingness to use sexual health and behavior tracking features if integrated within apps they are already using to meet sexual partners. Most GBMSM ( 91 %) recruited on a popular app reported interest in one or more sexual health app features , including features to find LGBT-friendly providers ( 83 %) , receive lab results ( 68 %) , schedule appointment reminders ( 67 %) , chat with a healthcare provider ( 59 %) , and receive medication reminder alerts ( 42 %). Fewer GBMSM were interested in tracking and receiving feedback on their sexual behavior ( 35 %) and substance use ( 24 %). Our data suggest that integrating sexual health and behavior tracking features for GBMSM who use apps could be promising in engaging them in HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions. Further research is needed on GBMSM 's perspectives about potential barriers in using such features.
