  We describe our institutional experience using a simplified Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System ( PI-RADS) based on biparametric prostate MRI. We discuss two important controversies: the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents and the management of PI-RADS category 3 lesions<symptom>. Our simplified PI-RADS identifies four categories and suggests management strategies for each. The simplified PI-RADS can be an effective system to facilitate multidisciplinary cooperation and to improve the management of suspected prostate cancer.
