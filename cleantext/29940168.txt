  To evaluate the type 1 choroidal neovascularization ( CNV) incidence and associated factors in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC). Retrospective case series. Records of 363 eyes ( 324 patients) with CSC were reviewed. Age , sex , CSC type , choroidal vascular hyperpermeability ( CVH) , best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , subfoveal choroidal thickness ( SCT) , and systemic hypertension ( HT) were assessed and compared between subjects with and without neovascular CSC. We identified 219 and 144 eyes with chronic and acute CSC , respectively. The mean participant age was 55.2 ± 12.0 years , and 58 ( 15.6 %) eyes had neovascular CSC. Age ( no CNV: 54.8 ± 12.1 years , CNV: 57.3 ± 10.9 years; P = .118) and SCT ( no CNV: 388.0 ± 104.5 μm , CNV: 377.4 ± 108.9 μm; P = .487) were comparable between eyes with and without CNV. However , BCVA ( logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was significantly worse in subjects with CNV ( 0.28 ± 0.33 ( 20/38) vs 0.15 ± 0.29 ( 20/28); P = .014). Neovascular CSC occurred more often in women ( 72 ( 23.6 %) vs 20 ( 34.5 %) , P = .099) and in cases of chronic CSC ( 171 ( 56.1 %) vs 48 ( 82.8 %) , P < .001) , CVH ( 205 ( 67.2 %) vs 58 ( 100 %) , P < .001) , and HT ( 91 ( 29.8 %) vs 24 ( 41.4 %) , P = .092). Chronic CSC ( P = .001) , female sex ( P = .075) , and poor BCVA ( P = .091) were associated with neovascular CSC ( multiple regression). Chronic CSC , female sex , CVH , and poor BCVA are risk factors for CNV in eyes with CSC.
