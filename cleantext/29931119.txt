  Research information is useful only if it can be shared-with other researchers , with research organizations ( institutions , laboratories , funders and others) , and with the wider community. In our digital age , that means sharing information between data systems. Persistent identifiers ( PIDs) provide unique keys for people , places and things , which enables accurate mapping of information between these systems and supports the research process by facilitating search , discovery , recognition and collaboration. This article reviews the main PIDs used in research-digital object identifiers for publications , ORCID iDs for researchers , and a proposed new identifier for research organizations-as well as demonstrating how they are being used , and how , in combination , they can increase trust in research and the research infrastructure.
