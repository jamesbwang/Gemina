  Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue and has been used off-label for a variety of conditions. There are no specific guidelines for the use of octreotide in neonates and its safety and efficacy have not been systematically evaluated. The objective of this study is to present our experience of using octreotide therapy in neonates. This is a retrospective study of neonates who received octreotide therapy during their hospital stay over a 15 years period ( 2003-2017) in a tertiary neonatal centre. The demographic details and indications of octreotide therapy including time of initiation , route , dose , duration and adverse effects of therapy were noted. The clinical course following octreotide administration was also analysed. Eleven neonates received octreotide therapy during the study period , of which nine had chylothorax and two had chylous ascites. Resolution of the chylous effusion<symptom> with octreotide therapy was achieved in 4 out of 11 ( 36.3 %) of the cases. The median duration of octreotide therapy in cases with successful resolution was 17.5 days. With the exception of minor side effects such as hyperglycaemia , none of the patients had any significant side effects that required discontinuation of therapy. Octreotide was used safely as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of chylothorax and chylous ascites in neonates. However , larger prospective controlled trials are required to establish the optimal dose , time of initiation , duration and efficacy of octreotide therapy in neonates.
