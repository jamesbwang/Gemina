  In this study , an in situ β-Ti-Nb composites reinforced with TiC particles with an ultrafine grain size were fabricated using a powder metallurgical ( PM) method. The microstructures and mechanical properties of the composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction ( XRD) analysis , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and compression tests. TiC particles were formed in the ball-milled powders after annealing at 600 °C due to a chemical reaction between stearic acid and titanium. Using high-pressure sintering ( HPS) on an apparatus with six tungsten carbide anvils , a fully dense β-Ti-Nb composite reinforced with fine in situ TiC particles was obtained. The TiC particles exhibit particle sizes of ~ 500 nm , uniformly distributed in the composite matrix , which had grain sizes of ~ 600 nm. Thus , the TiC-β-Ti-Nb composite show very high compression yield strength and relatively high plasticity contributed by grain refinement and TiC particles strengthening. The composite with 45 vol. % TiC exhibited excellent mechanical properties , with a yield compressive strength of 1990 MPa and plastic strain of 9.12 %. More over , a modified rule-of-mixture ( ROM) was presented to describe the combined strengthening effect of grain refinement and TiC particles.
