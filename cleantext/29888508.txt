  Oxidative stress ( OS) represents a threat to the chemical integrity of biomolecules including lipids , proteins , and DNA. The associated molecular damage frequently results in serious health issues , which justifies our concern about this phenomenon. In addition to enzymatic defense mechanisms , there are compounds ( usually referred to as antioxidants) that offer chemical protection against oxidative events. Among them , melatonin and its metabolites constitute a particularly efficient chemical family. They offer protection against OS as individual chemical entities through a wide variety of mechanisms including electron transfer , hydrogen transfer , radical adduct formation , and metal chelation , and by repairing biological targets. In fact , many of them including melatonin can be classified as multipurpose antioxidants. However , what seems to be unique to the melatonin 's family is their collective effects. Because the members of this family are metabolically related , most of them are expected to be present in living organisms wherever melatonin is produced. Therefore , the protection exerted by melatonin against OS may be viewed as a result of the combined antioxidant effects of the parent molecule and its metabolites. Melatonin 's family is rather exceptional in this regard , offering versatile and collective antioxidant protection against OS. It certainly seems that melatonin is one of the best nature 's defenses against oxidative damage.
