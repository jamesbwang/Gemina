  The knee adduction moment ( KAM) is often elevated in medial knee osteoarthritis ( KOA). The aim of this study was to evaluate effects on KAM and patient-reported outcomes of a six-week gait training program. Twenty-one patients ( 61 Â± 6 years) with KOA participated in a six-week biofeedback training program to encourage increased toe-in ( all patients) and increased step-width ( five patients). Patients received real-time visual feedback while walking on an instrumented treadmill. We analysed the effect of the gait modification ( s) on peak KAM in week six and three and six months post-training. We also evaluated the effect on pain and functional ability. Of 21 patients starting the program , 16 completed it with high attendance ( 15 and 16 respectively) at the three and six month follow-ups. First peak KAM was significantly reduced by up to 14.0 % in week six with non-significant reductions of 8.2 % and 5.5 % at the follow-ups. Functional ability ( assessed using the WOMAC questionnaire) improved significantly after the training ( eight point reduction , p = 0.04 in week six and nine point reduction , p = 0.04 at six-month follow-up). There was also a trend towards reduction in WOMAC pain ( p = 0.06) at follow-up. Biofeedback training to encourage gait modifications is feasible and leads to short-term benefits. However , at follow-up , reductions in KAM were less pronounced in some participants suggesting that to influence progression of KOA in the longer term , a permanent regime to reinforce the effects of the training program is needed.
