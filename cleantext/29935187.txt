  Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha ( HIF-1α) activates the transcription of many genes that code for proteins involved in angiogenesis , glucose metabolism , cell proliferation/survival , and invasion/metastasis. However , the mechanisms between HIF-1 and its downstream target genes are still poorly understood. Our experimental results had shown that nuclear HIF-1α proteins were significantly induced after HepG2 cells treatment with 1 % O
