  A 54-year-old male sustained ocular trauma with a projectile. Examination of the right eye revealed an intraocular foreign body ( IOFB) adjacent to the optic nerve head , vitritis , vitreous hemorrhage<symptom> , and translucent perivascular sheathing of the retinal vessels in all quadrants suggesting frosted branch angiitis ( FBA). The patient underwent vitrectomy with removal of the IOFB and silicone oil tamponade under steroid cover. With continued use of systemic and topical steroids after surgery , complete resolution of FBA and improvement in vision were noted in a week. Prompt resolution of FBA after IOFB removal points toward a strong association between the presence of IOFB and FBA.
