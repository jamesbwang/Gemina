  Efficient catalytic hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines with molecular hydrogen at room temperature is still a challenge. In this study , this transformation was achieved by using a photocatalyst of SiC-supported segregated Pd and Au nanoparticles. Under visible-light irradiation , the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reached a turnover frequency as high as 1715 h
