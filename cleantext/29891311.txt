  Origin and manufacturing process are key factors affecting the biological activities of chondroitin sulfate ( CS) , which can be utilized as a nutraceutical in dietary supplements. Herein , we extracted and purified CS from the cartilage of artificially breeding Andrias davidianus ( ADCS) , i.e. , Chinese giant salamander ( CGS) , one of the prospective functional food source materials in China. Low molecular weight CS ( LMWADCS) was then prepared by free radical depolymerization of ADCS. High-performance gel permeation chromatography ( HPGPC) analysis showed that the average molecular weight ( Mw) of ADCS was 49.2 kDa , while the Mw of LMWADCS was 6.4 kDa. After the eliminative degradation of ADCS by chondroitinase ABC , strong anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography ( SAX-HPLC) analysis showed that the disaccharide composition of ADCS was 14.6 % ΔDi0S , 60.9 % ΔDi6S and 24.5 % ΔDi4S. Then , in vitro antioxidant assays were performed with ADCS , LMWADCS and CS from a commercial source. Our results showed that LMWADCS exerted the highest total antioxidant activity out of the total antioxidant capacity , including the capacity of scavenging DPPH radicals , hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals. From the results of this study , we can conclude that the Mw and composition of ADCS are different from those reported for bovine and shark CS , and LMWADCS can be utilized as a valuable and potential nutraceutical for the functional food industry.
