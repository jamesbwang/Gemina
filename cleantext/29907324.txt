  Evaluate the effects of doses of caffeine administered to pregnant rats on the articular cartilage chondrocytes of their offspring. Twenty-four adult Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups , with one control group and three groups being treated with caffeine at doses of 25 , 50 and 100 mg/kg throughout pregnancy. At birth , three offspring/females were euthanized so that the chondrocytes could be extracted. At 7 , 14 and 21 days of culture , the chondrocytes were subjected to the MTT cell viability assay and an evaluation of their alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis. Chondrocytes were also stained by Hematoxylin-eosin , PAS , Safranin-O and Alcian Blue. The Sox-9 , Runx-2 , aggrecan , collagen-II and alkaline phosphatase gene transcript levels were also evaluated. Mean comparisons were performed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Chondrocyte cultures from the 25 mg/kg group had the lowest results , as chondrocytes from this group had reduced viability , percentage of cells , alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen and chondrogenic matrix synthesis. A reduced expression of Sox-9 , alkaline phosphatase and collagen-II was also detected in the 25 mg/kg group. Chondrocyte cultures of the group treated with 50 mg/kg caffeine showed reduced collagen synthesis and Sox-9 expression. The caffeine dose of 100 mg/kg also reduced collagen and Sox-9 and alkaline phosphatase expression. Caffeine administered to pregnant rats negatively alters the articular cartilage chondrocytes of their offspring , reducing the synthesis of collagen and Sox-9 expression regardless of the dose. This study also concluded that the effects of caffeine are not linear or dose-dependent.
