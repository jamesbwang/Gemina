  This paper proposes hybrid soft computing models for daily river stage modeling. The models combine variational mode decomposition ( VMD) with different soft computing models , including artificial neural network ( ANN) , adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system ( ANFIS) , and random forest<disease> ( RF). The performances of VMD-based models ( VMD-ANN , VMD-ANFIS , and VMD-RF) are assessed by model efficiency indices and graphical comparison , and compared with those of single models ( ANN , ANFIS , and RF) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition ( EEMD)- based models ( EEMD-ANN , EEMD-ANFIS , and EEMD-RF). Results show that VMD-ANN , VMD-ANFIS , and VMD-RF models are more efficient and accurate than ANN , ANFIS , and RF models , respectively , and slightly better than EEMD-ANN , EEMD-ANFIS , and EEMD-RF models , respectively. In terms of model efficiency and accuracy , the top five models are VMD-ANFIS , EEMD-ANFIS , VMD-ANN , VMD-RF , and ANFIS and the VMD-ANFIS model is the best. It is found that VMD can enhance the performance of conventional single soft computing models; VMD is more effective than EEMD for hybrid model development; and the ANFIS model combined with VMD and EEMD can yield better efficiency and accuracy than other models. Therefore , VMD-based hybrid modeling is a more effective method for reliable daily river stage modeling.
