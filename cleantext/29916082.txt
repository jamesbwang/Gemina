  plantGlycoMS is a set of tools , implemented in R , which is used to assess and validate glycopeptide spectrum matches ( gPSMs). Validity of gPSMs is based on characteristic fragmentation patterns of glycopeptides ( gPSMvalidator) , adherence of the glycan moiety to the known N-glycan biosynthesis pathway in plants ( pGlycoFilter) , and elution of the glycopeptide within the observed retention time window of other glycopeptides sharing the same peptide backbone ( rt.Restrict). plantGlycoMS also contains a tool for relative quantitation of glycoforms based on selected ion chromatograms of glycopeptide ion precursors in the mass spectrometry level 1 data ( glycoRQ). This protocol walks the user through this workflow with example mass spectrometry data obtained for a plant glycoprotein.
