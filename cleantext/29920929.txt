  The plasma contact system contributes to thrombosis in experimental models. Even though our standard blood coagulation tests are prolonged when plasma lacks contact factors , this enzyme system appears to have a minor ( if any) role in hemostasis. In this review , we explore the clinical phenotype of C1 esterase inhibitor ( C1-INH) deficiency. C1-INH is the key plasma inhibitor of the contact system enzymes , and its deficiency causes hereditary angioedema ( HAE). This inflammatory disorder is characterized by recurrent aggressive attacks of tissue swelling that occur at unpredictable locations throughout the body. Bradykinin , which is considered to be a byproduct of the plasma contact system during in vitro coagulation , is the main disease mediator in HAE. Surprisingly , there is little evidence for thrombotic events in HAE patients , suggesting mechanistic uncoupling from the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. In addition , it is questionable whether a surface is responsible for contact system activation in HAE. In this review , we discuss the clinical phenotype , disease modifiers and diagnostic challenges of HAE. We subsequently describe the underlying biochemical mechanisms and contributing disease mediators. Furthermore , we review three types of HAE that are not caused by C1-INH inhibitor deficiency. Finally , we propose a central enzymatic axis that we hypothesize to be responsible for bradykinin production in health and disease.
