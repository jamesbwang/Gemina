  Sarcomatoid adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm that displays both carcinomatous and sarcomatous component. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital under the suspicion of an ampulla of Vater cancer. Abdominal computed tomography and endoscopy demonstrated a bulging of ampulla and the biopsy specimen revealed an adenocarcinoma , well differentiated in the background of tubulovillous adenoma. So we performed the pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. At postoperative biopsy , the tumor was composed of adenocarcinoma component and sarcomatoid component. Thus , a diagnosis of sarcomatoid adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater could be made. Here , we present a case of sarcomatoid adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater.
