  Atherosclerosis ( AS) is a multifactorial disease. Exploration of DNA methylation in regulating gene transcription in a cell type- and stage-specific manner will shed light on understanding the biological processes associated with plaque stability. We identified 174 up-regulated genes with hypo-methylation in the promoter , and 86 down-regulated genes with hyper-methylation in the promoter , in AS vs. healthy controls. Among them , high expression of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 7 ( SLAM7) was examined in carotid plaque vs. intact tissue , in advanced plaque vs. early atherosclerotic tissue , and SLAMF7 protein expressed significantly higher in the unstable plaques than that in the stable plaques , especially in the CD68-positive macrophages. Depletion of SLAMF7 in plaque-derived macrophages induced a suppressed secretion of proinflammatory cytokines , and inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. These data provide emerging evidence that SLAMF7 could be a target of potential therapeutic intervention in carotid AS.
