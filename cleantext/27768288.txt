  Engendering electrical conductivity in high-porosity metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) promises to unlock the full potential of MOFs for electrical energy storage , electrocatalysis , or integration of MOFs with conventional electronic materials. Here we report that a porous zirconium-node-containing MOF , NU-901 , can be rendered electronically conductive by physically encapsulating C
