  Predictive analytics monitoring that informs clinicians of the risk for failed extubation would help minimize both the duration of mechanical ventilation and the risk of emergency re-intubation in ICU patients. We hypothesized that dynamic monitoring of cardiorespiratory data , vital signs , and lab test results would add information to standard clinical risk factors. We report model development in a retrospective observational cohort admitted to either the medical or surgical/trauma ICU that were intubated during their ICU stay and had available physiologic monitoring data ( n = 1202). The primary outcome was removal of endotracheal intubation ( i.e. extubation) followed within 48 h by reintubation or death ( i.e. failed extubation). We developed a standard risk marker model based on demographic and clinical data. We also developed a novel risk marker model using dynamic data elements-continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring , vital signs , and lab values. Risk estimates from multivariate predictive models in the 24 h preceding extubation were significantly higher for patients that failed. Combined standard and novel risk markers demonstrated good predictive performance in leave-one-out validation: AUC of 0.64 ( 95 % CI: 0.57-0.69) and 1.6 alerts per week to identify 32 % of extubations that will fail. Novel risk factors added significantly to the standard model. Predictive analytics monitoring models can detect changes in vital signs , continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring , and laboratory measurements in both the hours preceding and following extubation for those patients destined for extubation failure.
