  Vibrio<pathogen> is a genus of ubiquitous heterotrophic bacteria found in aquatic environments. Although they are a small percentage of the bacteria in these environments , vibrios can predominate during blooms. Vibrios also play important roles in the degradation of polymeric substances , such as chitin , and in other biogeochemical processes. Vibrios can be found as free-living bacteria , attached to particles , or associated with other organisms in a mutualistic , commensal , or pathogenic relationship. This review focuses on vibrio<pathogen> ecology and genome plasticity , which confers an ability to adapt to new niches and is driven , at least in part , by horizontal gene transfer ( HGT). The extent of HGT and its role in pathogen emergence are discussed based on genomic studies of environmental and pathogenic vibrios , mobile genetically encoded virulence factors , and mechanistic studies on the different modes of HGT. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Microbiology Volume 72 is September 8 , 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
