  Immunotherapy has become a promising treatment strategy for cancer. Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA4 mAb and anti-PD-1 mAb has demonstrated clear evidence of objective responses including improved overall survival and tumor shrinkage , driving renewed enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapy in multiple cancer types including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC). There are several clinical trials using anti-PD1 mAb for ESCC in early phases and the results are currently promising. In this review , recent advances in cancer immunotherapy for ESCC are discussed with particular focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccine.
