  Peach brachytic dwarfism determined by Dwarf gene ( Dw) is an undesired trait segregating in some peach breeding programs. Recently , a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) mutation in the gibberellin insensitive dwarf 1 ( GID1) peach gene causing brachytic dwarfism was described. In this research we wanted to validate this marker in an F The observed segregation of the trait was in agreement with that of a recessive gene , the individuals homozygous for the recessive allele ( dwdw) presenting the dwarf genotype. Dw was mapped to the distal part of linkage group 6 as previously described. The SNP marker based on the causal mutation previously described did not segregate in Nv F
