  Dyslexia is a disability that causes difficulties in reading and writing despite average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography ( EEG) is one of the upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework 's ( 1) data collection , ( 2) pre-processing , ( 3) analysis and ( 4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks , and those unwanted artefacts caused by body<symptom> movements<symptom> in the EEG signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further , support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in EEG-based pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.
