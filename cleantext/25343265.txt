  Biomass burning and wind-blown dust has been well investigated during the past decade regarding their impacts on environment , but their co-existence has n't been recognized because they usually occur in different locations and episodes. In this study we reveal the unique co-existence condition that dust from the Taklamakan and Gobi Desert ( TGD) and biomass burning from Peninsular Southeast Asia ( PSEA) can reach to the west<disease> Pacific region simultaneously in boreal spring ( March and April). The upper level trough at 700hPa along east coast of China favors the large scale subsidence of TGD dust while it travels southeastwards , and drives the PSEA biomass burning plume carried by the westerlies at 3-5 km to descend rapidly to around 1.5 km and mix with dust around southeast China and Taiwan. As compared to the monthly averages in March and April , surface observations suggested that concentrations of PM
