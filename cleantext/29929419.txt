  Chaperone-mediated autophagy ( CMA) is a major pathway of lysosomal proteolysis essential for the control of intermediary metabolism. So far , the absence of any identifiable LAMP2A- a necessary and limiting protein for CMA- outside of the tetrapod clade , led to the paradigm that this cellular function was ( presumably) restricted to mammals and birds. However , after we identified expressed sequences displaying high sequence homology with the mammalian LAMP2A in several fish species , our findings challenge that view and suggest that CMA likely appeared much earlier during evolution than initially thought. Hence , our results do not only shed an entirely new light on the evolution of CMA , but also bring new perspectives on the possible use of complementary genetic models , such as zebrafish or medaka for studying CMA function from a comparative angle/view.
