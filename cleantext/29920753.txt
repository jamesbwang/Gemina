  Delayed thyrotropin ( TSH) elevation ( dTSHe) is common in low birthweight infants. We aimed to clarify the risk factors for the development of dTSHe in infants weighing < 2000 g at birth. According to Japanese guidelines , infants with birthweight < 2000 g underwent second capillary TSH screening within 30 days , either at 1 month of age; or when weight reached 2.5 kg; or at discharge. dTSHe was defined as TSH > 20 mIU/L by venous sampling following a normal result ( < 15 mIU/L) at first screening aged 4-6 days. For each infant who developed dTHSe three babies without dTSHe were selected and matched for gestational age and birth year. Small for gestational age ( SGA) was defined as a birthweight < 10th percentile for the gestational age and sex. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the development of dTSHe. Among the 911 study infants , 17 infants ( 1.9 %) had dTSHe. The median ( range) birthweight in the dTSHe group ( 796 ( 388-1912) g) was significantly smaller than the comparison group ( 961 ( 408-1981) g) ( P = 0.04). The number ( %) of SGA infants was significantly higher in the dTSHe group ( 12 ( 71 %)) than in the comparison group ( 13 ( 25 %)) ( P = 0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed that SGA was an independent risk factor for the development of dTSHe ( adjusted odds ratio , 9.0; 95 % confidence interval , 2.5-32.8; P = 0.001). Small for gestational age is an independent risk factor for the development of dTSHe in infants with a birthweight < 2000 g. The influence of prematurity , a matching criterion for this study , on dTSHe requires additional study.
