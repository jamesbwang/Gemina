  Congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> ( CNSHA) is a rare autosomal recessive condition that presents as a congenital hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom>. The absence of vital enzymes required for glycolysis such as homozygous glucose phosphate isomerase ( GPI) and red blood cell ( RBC) nucleotide metabolism predisposes the RBCs to hemolysis<symptom>. No spherocytosis is seen on peripheral smear as well as no signs of immune-mediated destruction of RBCs. We present a rare case of a previously healthy 21-year-old female patient with CNSHA from India.
