  Numerous Gram-negative bacterial pathogens utilize type III secretion systems ( T3SSs) to inject tens of effector proteins directly into the cytosol of host cells. Through interactions with cognate chaperones , type III effectors are defined and recruited to the sorting platform , a cytoplasmic component of these membrane-embedded nanomachines. However , notably , a comprehensive review of the literature reveals that the secretion of most type III effectors has not yet been linked to a chaperone , raising questions regarding the existence of unknown chaperones as well as the universality of chaperones in effector secretion. Here , we describe the development of the first high-throughput type III secretion ( T3S) assay , a semiautomated solid-plate-based assay , which enables the side-by-side comparison of secretion of over 20
