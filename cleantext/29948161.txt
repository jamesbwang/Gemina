  Dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) represents a heterogeneous group of naturally-occurring molecules in aquatic environments , and recent studies have evidenced that optically dark DOCs can exert some positive effects on ionoregulatory homeostasis of aquatic organisms in acidic waters. We investigated the effects of Luther Marsh DOC , a dark allochthonous DOC , on ion regulation and N-waste excretion of zebrafish acutely exposed to either neutral or low pH in ion-poor water. In the first experiment , simultaneous exposure to pH 4.0 and DOC greatly attenuated the stimulation of Na
