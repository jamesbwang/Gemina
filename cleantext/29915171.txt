  Ulcerative colitis<disease> patients and transplant recipients are at risk for colorectal cancer. Here , we show that immunosuppressive regimens for kidney transplants are associated with the progression of ulcerative colitis-related carcinogenesis. We describe the case of a patient diagnosed with colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis<disease> while on immunosuppressive therapy for a kidney transplant. The immunological microenvironment of the cancer and its mutational status were analyzed , and a mouse colon cancer model was created to replicate the unique clinical conditions. AOM/DSS mice were randomized into seven experimental groups that received different immunosuppressants and an untreated control group to assess the frequencies of adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia. Histopathology , immunohistochemistry , and flow cytometry were also performed on the harvested mouse colons. All mice treated with an immunosuppressive regimen developed at least an adenoma , and several of those receiving anti-CD3 , anti-CD8 , and mycophenolate mofetil also developed adenocarcinomas. In contrast , mice receiving rapamycin did not develop adenocarcinomas , and the extent of high-grade dysplasia in those mice was similar to that in control mice. Patients with pre-neoplastic conditions , such as ulcerative colitis<disease> , who are undergoing a solid organ transplant might benefit from the use of mTOR inhibitors given their intrinsic anti-tumor properties.
