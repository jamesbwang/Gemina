  Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for therapy-related sequelae and , therefore , require long-term follow-up. At 2 university hospitals in Germany collaborative multidisciplinary late effects clinics were installed to provide specialized care and to evaluate the current health status of these patients in a clinical setting. Patients andMethods: Every patient who visited the late effects clinics at the university hospital in LÃ¼beck and Erlangen over a period of 3 years and met the inclusion criteria was included in the study. Patients ' characteristics as well as cancer diagnosis , treatment related factors and the prevalence of chronic health conditions were assessed. 220 patients attended the late effects clinics during the observation period. The median follow-up period was 16 years ( range 5-45 years). In total over 64 % of the patients were affected by at least 1 chronic health condition , including endocrine disruptions in 19.1 % of the patients. Moreover , secondary neoplasms occurred in 9.1 % of the study participants. German childhood cancer survivors are affected by multiple therapy-related sequelae. A comprehensive network of late effects clinics should be established to ensure specialized and risk-adapted care for every childhood cancer survivor in Germany.
