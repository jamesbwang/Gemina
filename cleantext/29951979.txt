  Animals always seek rewards and the related neural basis has been well studied. However , what happens when animals fail to get a reward is largely unknown , although this is commonly seen in behaviors such as predation. Here , we set up a behavioral model of repeated failure in reward pursuit ( RFRP) in Drosophila larvae. In this model , the larvae were repeatedly prevented from reaching attractants such as yeast and butyl acetate , before finally abandoning further attempts. After giving up , they usually showed a decreased locomotor speed and impaired performance in light avoidance and sugar preference , which were named as phenotypes of RFRP states. In larvae that had developed RFRP phenotypes , the octopamine concentration was greatly elevated , while tβh mutants devoid of octopamine were less likely to develop RFRP phenotypes , and octopamine feeding efficiently restored such defects. By down-regulating tβh in different groups of neurons and imaging neuronal activity , neurons that regulated the development of RFRP states and the behavioral exhibition of RFRP phenotypes were mapped to a small subgroup of non-glutamatergic and glutamatergic octopaminergic neurons in the central larval brain. Our results establish a model for investigating the effect of depriving an expected reward in Drosophila and provide a simplified framework for the associated neural basis.
