  The Frasnian-Famennian boundary records one of the most catastrophic mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic Eon. Several possible causes for this extinction have been suggested , including extra-terrestrial impacts and large-scale volcanism. However , linking the extinction with these potential causes is hindered by the lack of precise dating of either the extinction or volcanic/impact events. In this study , a bentonite layer in uppermost-Frasnian sediments from Steinbruch Schmidt ( Germany) is re-analysed using CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon geochronology in order to constrain the date of the Frasnian-Famennian extinction. A new age of 372.36 Â± 0.053 Ma is determined for this bentonite , confirming a date no older than 372.4 Ma for the Frasnian-Famennian boundary , which can be further constrained to 371.93-371.78 Ma using a pre-existing Late Devonian age model. This age is consistent with previous dates , but is significantly more precise. When compared with published ages of the Siljan impact crater and basalts produced by large-scale volcanism , there is no apparent correlation between the extinction and either phenomenon , not clearly supporting them as a direct cause for the Frasnian-Famennian event. This result highlights an urgent need for further Late Devonian geochronological and chemostratigraphic work to better understand the cause ( s) of this extinction.
