  Protection of privacy of information for young adults with developmental disabilities and their families is essential to promote quality of life , well-being , empowerment , and inclusion. Despite this , the young adults ' information privacy rights are increasingly at risk. This paper provides a scoping review , applying Arksey and O'Malley 's ( 2005) approach , of all published peer-reviewed journal articles and gray literature to examine the barriers and facilitators in utilization of legislation that protects the collection , use , disclosure , and access of personal information in Canada. The scoping review process was further expanded with a rigorous reliability method and applied a socio-ecological framework to the final 47 studies. National and international policy and legislation ( macro level) , organization-based factors ( meso) , young adults and community interactions ( exo) , and individual disability related factors ( micro) are examined. The review identifies the barriers and highlights the importance of facilitators for acting on personal privacy rights.
