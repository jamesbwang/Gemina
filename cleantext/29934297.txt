  Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake , nutrient acquisition , and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin inhibitors definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin inhibitors affect all auxin signaling at the same time , which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here , we report that jasmonic acid ( JA) functions as a lateral root ( LR)- preferential auxin inhibitor in Arabidopsis thaliana in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor , CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 ( COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (-)- JA or ( +)- JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in coi1 mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (-)- JA or ( +)- JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation , diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter DR5:: GUS , and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (-)- JA and ( +)- coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of transport inhibitor response 1 and auxin signaling f-box protein 2 ( tir1 afb2) , but reduced in the afb5 single mutant. These results reveal JAs and ( +)- coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins , a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.
