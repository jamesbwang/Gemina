  Genome wide association studies ( GWAS) rely on microarrays , or more recently mapping of sequencing reads , to genotype individuals. The reliance on prior sequencing of a reference genome limits the scope of association studies , and also precludes mapping associations outside of the reference. We present an alignment free method for association studies of categorical phenotypes based on counting ( Formula: see text)- mers<pathogen> in whole-genome sequencing reads , testing for associations directly between ( Formula: see text)- mers<pathogen> and the trait of interest , and local assembly of the statistically significant ( Formula: see text)- mers<pathogen> to identify sequence differences. An analysis of the 1000 genomes data show that sequences identified by our method largely agree with results obtained using the standard approach. However , unlike standard GWAS , our method identifies associations with structural variations and sites not present in the reference genome. We also demonstrate that population stratification can be inferred from ( Formula: see text)- mers<pathogen>. Finally , application to an
