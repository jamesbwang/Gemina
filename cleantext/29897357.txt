  New and straightforward synthetic paths for the syntheses of ( RNPNR)- anions ( R = t-Bu ( 1) or CPh3 ( 6)) in the form of their tmeda- or thf-coordinated lithium salts are described. The attempts to isolate the sodium analogue ( ( Ph3CNPNCPh3) Na Â· ( thf) x) ( 8) remained unsuccessful probably due to its high reactivity although its formation in the reaction of the parent cis- ( ( Ph3CNP) 2 ( Ph3CNH) 2) ( 5) with 2 eq. of sodium naphthalenide was corroborated by NMR spectroscopy. Importantly , when an excess of sodium naphthalenide was used in the reaction with 5 , ( ( Ph3C) Na ( thf) 3) ( 9) was obtained along with a complex mixture of other by-products indicating the cleavage of the C-N bond in the starting material. Furthermore , the synthesis and the structural characterization of the ( P ( Nt-Bu) 3) 3- trianion as its trilithium salt ( P ( Nt-Bu) 3Li3) 2 ( 10) has been successfully achieved.
