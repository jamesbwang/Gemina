  Interferonopathies are a subset of autoinflammatory disorders with a prominent type I IFN gene signature. Treatment of these patients has been challenging , given the lack of response to common autoinflammatory therapeutics including IL-1 and TNF blockade. JAK inhibitors ( Jakinibs) are a family of small-molecule inhibitors that target the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and have shown clinical efficacy , with FDA and European Medicines Agency ( EMA) approval for arthritic and myeloproliferative syndromes<disease>. Sanchez and colleagues repurposed baricitinib to establish a significant role for JAK inhibition as a novel therapy for patients with interferonopathies , demonstrating the power of translational rare disease research with lifesaving effects.
