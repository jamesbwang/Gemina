  Cell migration is an essential part of many ( patho) physiological processes , including keratinocyte re-epithelialization of healing wounds<disease> Physical forces and mechanical cues from the wound<disease> bed ( in addition to biochemical signals) may also play an important role in the healing process. Previously , we explored this possibility and found that polyacrylamide ( PA) gel stiffness affected human keratinocyte behaviour and that mechanical deformations in soft ( approx. 1.2 kPa) PA gels produced by neighbouring cells appeared to influence the process of
