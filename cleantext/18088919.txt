  Sterile castes are a defining criterion of eusociality; investigating their evolutionary origins can critically advance theory. In termites , the soldier caste is regarded as the first acquired permanently sterile caste. Previous studies showed that juvenile hormone ( JH) is the primary factor inducing soldier differentiation , and treatment of workers with artificial JH can generate presoldier differentiation. It follows that a shift from a typical hemimetabolous JH response might be required for soldier formation during the course of termite evolution within the cockroach clade. To address this possibility , analysis of the role of JH and its signaling pathway was performed in the termite
