  In this long-term follow-up study of 175 women , we investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with persisting pain and sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> four years after augmentation mammoplasty. Previously the women had participated in an acute postoperative pain study , and follow-up investigations at 6 weeks and 1 year after surgery. In the present study , the women were mailed questionnaires about pain , sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> , and affection of daily life , quality of life and pain catastrophizing 4 years after surgery. One hundred and sixteen women answered the questionnaire. The fraction of women reporting evoked- and/or spontaneous<symptom> pain<symptom> during the last 24 h had declined from 20 % at 1 year to 14 % at 4 years. Hyperesthesia had declined from 46 % at 1 year to 32 % at 4 years , while the change in hypoesthesia was small , 47 % at 1 year to 51 % at 4 years. Methylprednisolone and parecoxib given pre incisionally reduced acute postoperative pain and reduced the prevalence of hyperesthesia<symptom> after 6 weeks/1 year , but after 4 years we found no significant differences between the test drug groups. Those having concomitant pain and hyperesthesia<symptom> at 6 weeks and 1 year had high odds for persisting pain at 4 years ( OR 7.8 , 95 % CI 2.1-29.8 , P = 0.003; OR 13.2 , 95 % CI 2.5-71.3 , P = 0.003). In patients without pain but with hyperesthesia<symptom> at 1 year , the hyperesthesia<symptom> increased the odds for pain at 4 years ( OR 2.6 95 % CI 1.1-6.1 , P = 0.03). Hypoesthesia at 6 weeks or at 1 year did not affect the odds for pain at 4 years. A good general health condition ( mental and physical) was associated with reduced odds for pain at 4 years ( OR = 0.56 , 95 % CI 0.35-0.88 , P = 0.01). However , using the Short Form health survey , SF-12 , the Mental Component Summary Score seemed to affect the odds for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> more than the Physical Component Summary Score. To conclude , the prevalence of pain and hyperesthesia<symptom> after breast augmentation declined from 1 to 4 years. Nevertheless , the most striking finding in the current trial was that pain coinciding with hyperesthesia<symptom> at 6 weeks and 1 year resulted in highly increased odds for persistent postoperative pain. Even hyperesthesia<symptom> alone , without pain , increased the odds for chronic postsurgical pain. Thus , the present study suggests hyperesthesia<symptom> as an independent risk factor for chronic postsurgical pain.
