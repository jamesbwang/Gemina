  Prevention and early detection is critical for reducing the population cancer burden. Two approaches have been used: Population approaches change social norms ( e.g. , smoking bans) or impose incentives ( e.g. , cigarette taxes); high-risk strategies intervene upon individuals with elevated cancer risk ( e.g. , smoking cessation). Knowledge about carcinogenesis mechanisms , extreme exposures , and inherited susceptibility provides opportunities to develop precision prevention and early-detection ( PPED) strategies. PPED aims to understand the basis of risk , identify groups that optimally benefit from interventions , characterize heterogeneity in intervention responses , optimize intervention timing , and minimize toxicities. We propose a framework around which PPED strategies can be developed. Currently available cancer prevention and early-detection approaches have the potential to reduce a large proportion of the cancer burden in the population. However , even if fully implemented , existing methods can not fully eliminate the cancer burden. New PPED approaches that exploit the growing knowledge of molecular and biological cancer mechanisms should be developed and implemented.
