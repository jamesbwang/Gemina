  To investigate the relative contribution rates of basal hyperglycemia ( BHG) and postprandial hyperglycemia ( PPHG) to overall hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) treated with insulin lispro mix 25 and 50 ( LM25 and LM50) as evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM). Eighty-one T2DM patients treated with premixed human insulin 70/30 ( PHI70/30) were randomly divided into two groups and received a crossover protocol. In the first 16-week stage , one group received LM25 twice daily , the other group received LM50 twice daily. In the second 16-week stage , the two groups exchanged therapeutic regimen. Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA BHG 's contribution rate increased with increasing HbA For T2DM patients treated with premixed insulin analogues , postprandial hyperglycemia played a major role in the subgroup of patients with HbA Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier ChiCTR-TTRCC-12002516.
