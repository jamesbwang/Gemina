  There have been numerous studies regarding atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) associated with cardiac and pulmonary surgery; however , studies looking at esophagectomy and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> are sparse. The goal of this study was to review our institution 's atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> rate following esophagectomy in order to better define the incidence and predisposing factors in this patient population. A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing esophagectomy with transcervical endoscopic mobilization of the esophagus ( TEEM) at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Affiliated Hospitals from July 2009 through December 2012. Seventy-one patients underwent TEEM esophagectomy during the study period. Of those , 23 ( 32.4 %) patients developed new atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> postoperatively. ICU ( Intensive Care Unit) length of stay was 7.1 days for those that did not receive amiodarone , compared to 5.3 days for those that did receive amiodarone ( p < 0.025). Those that went into AF spent on average 9.3 days in the ICU compared to 4.7 days for their counterparts that did not go into AF ( p < 0.006). Total length of stay was not statistically different between populations ( 15.1 +/- 11.3 days compared to 13.5 +/- 9.4 days for those who did not go into AF ( p < 0.281)). Receiving preoperative amiodarone was found to reduce the overall incidence of AF. There was a trend towards decreased risk of going into AF in those who received preoperative amiodarone with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.555 ( p = 0.057). Similar to data reported in previous literature , postoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> was found to increase ICU length of stay as well as overall length of hospital stay. Preoperative amiodarone administration displayed a trend toward decreasing the rates of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> in patients undergoing TEEM.
