  Epilepsy is common in individuals with mutations in POLG , the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. Early recognition and aggressive seizure<symptom> management are crucial for patient survival. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) is implicated in various neurological disorders including epilepsy. The aim of this study was to assess whether POLG-related disease is associated with BBB dysfunction and what clinical implications this has for patients. Our retrospective study used data from 83 patients with pathogenic POLG mutations from 4 countries-- Norway , Sweden , Finland , and the United Kingdom. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. We used the presence of raised cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) protein and a raised CSF/serum ratio of albumin ( Q-alb) to evaluate the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier. Raised CSF protein was found in 70 % of patients ( n = 58/83) and appeared to be associated with the most severe phenotypes. In those in whom it was measured , the Q-alb ratio was markedly elevated ( n = 18). The majority of those with epilepsy ( n = 50/66 , 76 %) had raised CSF protein , and this preceded seizure<symptom> debut in 75 % ( n = 15/20). The median survival time from symptom onset for those with raised CSF protein was decreased ( 13 months) compared to those with normal CSF protein ( 32 months). Our results indicate that there is disruption of the BBB in POLG-related disease , as evidenced by a raised CSF protein and Q-alb ratio. We also find that raised CSF protein is a common finding in patients with POLG disease. Our data suggest that the presence of BBB dysfunction predicts a poorer outcome , and elevated CSF protein may therefore be an additional biomarker both for early diagnosis and to identify those at high risk of developing epilepsy.
