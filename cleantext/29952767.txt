  Red blood cells ( RBCs) influence rheology , release ADP , ATP and nitric oxide suggesting a role for RBCs in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we provide evidence for a significant contribution of RBCs to thrombus formation. Anemic mice showed enhanced occlusion times upon injury of the carotid artery. A small population of RBCs was located to platelet thrombi and enhanced platelet activation by a direct cell contact via the FasL-FasR ( CD95) pathway known to induce apoptosis. Activation of platelets in the presence of RBCs led to platelet FasL exposure that activated FasR on RBCs responsible for externalization of phosphatidylserine ( PS) on the RBC membrane. Inhibition or genetic deletion of either FasL or FasR resulted in reduced PS exposure of RBCs and platelets , decreased thrombin generation and reduced thrombus formation in vitro and protection against arterial thrombosis in vivo. Direct cell contacts of platelets and RBCs via FasL-FasR were shown after ligation of the inferior vena cava ( IVC) and in surgical specimens of patients after thrombectomy. In a flow restriction model of the IVC , reduced thrombus formation was observed in FasL-/- mice. Taken together , our data reveal a significant contribution of RBCs to thrombosis by the FasL-FasR pathway.
