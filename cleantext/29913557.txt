  Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) is a multifunctional protein that contains angiogenic and neurotrophic properties. In the current study , we investigated the analgesic effects of HGF by using a plasmid DNA that was designed to express 2 isoforms of human HGF-pCK-HGF-X7 ( or VM202)- in a chronic constriction injury ( CCI)- induced mouse neuropathic pain model. Intramuscular injection of pCK-HGF-X7 into proximal thigh muscle induced the expression of HGF in the muscle , sciatic nerve , and dorsal root ganglia ( DRG). This gene transfer procedure significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after CCI. Injury-induced expression of activating transcription factor 3 , calcium channel subunit α2δ1 , and CSF1 in the ipsilateral DRG neurons was markedly down-regulated in the pCK-HGF-X7-treated group , which suggested that HGF might exert its analgesic effects by inhibiting pain-mediating genes in the sensory neurons. In addition , suppressed CSF1 expression in DRG neurons by pCK-HGF-X7 treatment was accompanied by a noticeable suppression of the nerve injury-induced glial cell activation in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Taken together , our data show that pCK-HGF-X7 attenuates nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain by inhibiting pain-related factors in DRG neurons and subsequent spinal cord glial activation , which suggests its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain.-Nho , B. , Lee , Jung. , Lee , Juns. , Ko , K.
