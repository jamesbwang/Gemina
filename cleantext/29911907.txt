  The fitting of aligners on anchorage teeth is a crucial factor in clear aligner orthodontics. The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the fitting of two aligner systems , Invisalign and CA-Clear Aligner , using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). Passive aligners ( Invisalign and CA-Clear Aligner) were adapted on resin casts obtained by stereolithography ( STL) files of a patient , and then sectioned buccolingually. Upper<symptom> and lower central incisors , upper and lower first premolars , and upper and lower first molars were the regions analyzed. Representative microphotographs of sections were taken with a scanning electron microscope ( SEM); a total of 160 micrometric measurements were obtained and analyzed with ANOVA tests. Invisalign provided an overall better fit on lower incisors ( F = 11.48 , P = .0095) and on lower molars ( F = 19.93 , P = .0012). Considering the different regions , Invisalign provided better fit at the gingival edge of the buccal aspect on lower incisors ( F = 11.33 , P = 0.0056) and at the gingival edge of the lingual aspect on upper premolars ( F = 5.34 , P = 0.0047). On the upper molars , Invisalign provided better fit at the gingival edge of the buccal aspect , while CA-Clear Aligner provided better fit at the buccal maximum convexity , on the buccal cusp , on the occlusal groove and at the palatal cusp. On lower molars , Invisalign showed a more accurate fit at the buccal aspect points. Invisalign and CA-Clear Aligner exhibited comparable fit on anchorage teeth. Invisalign provided better fit at the gingival edges of aligners , while the CA-Clear Aligner provided better fit on complex occlusal surfaces.
