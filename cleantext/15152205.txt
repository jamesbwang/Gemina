  Melittin is a short cationic peptide that exerts cytolytic effects on bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Experiments suggest that in zwitterionic membranes<symptom> , melittin forms transmembrane toroidal pores supported by four to eight peptides. A recently constructed melittin variant with a reduced cationic charge , MelP5 , is active at 10-fold lower concentrations. In previous work , we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale to examine the supramolecular pore structure of a melittin tetramer in zwitterionic and partially anionic membranes<symptom>. We now extend that study to include the effects of peptide charge , initial orientation , and number of monomers on the pore formation and stabilization processes. Our results show that parallel transmembrane orientations of melittin and MelP5 are more consistent with experimental data. Whereas a MelP5 parallel hexamer forms a large stable pore during the 5-Î¼s simulation time , a melittin hexamer and an octamer are not fully stable , with several monomers dissociating during the simulation time. Interaction-energy analysis shows that this difference in behavior between melittin and MelP5 is not due to stronger electrostatic repulsion between neighboring melittin peptides but to peptide-lipid interactions that disfavor the isolated MelP5 transmembrane monomer. The ability of melittin monomers to diffuse freely in the 1,2-dimyristoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane leads to dynamic pores with varying molecularity.
