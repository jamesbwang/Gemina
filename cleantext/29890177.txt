  Cellular reprograming paves the way for creating functional patient-specific tissues to eliminate immune rejection responses by applying the same genetic profile. However , the epigenetic memory of a cell remains a challenge facing the current reprograming methods and does not allow transcription factors to bind properly. Because somatic cells can be reprogramed by transferring their nuclear contents into oocytes , introducing specific oocyte factors into differentiated cells is considered a promising approach for mimicking the reprograming process that occurs during fertilization. Mammalian metaphase II oocyte possesses a superior capacity to epigenetically reprogram somatic cell nuclei towards an embryonic stem cell-like state than the current factor-based reprograming approaches. This may be due to the presence of specific factors that are lacking in the current factor-based reprograming approaches. In this review , we focus on studies identifying human oocyte-enriched factors aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating cellular reprograming. We describe the role of oocyte-enriched factors in metabolic switch , chromatin remodelling , and global epigenetic transformation. This is critical for improving the quality of resulting reprogramed cells , which is crucial for therapeutic applications.
