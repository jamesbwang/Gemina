  Despite its feasibility has been proven , Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) day-case surgery remains uncommon. Our objective was to describe the evolution of BPH day-case surgery in France according to the surgical technique employed. We extracted data from the Information System of Medicalization Program ( PMSI) including all of the hospital stays in France from 2010 to 2016. Patients belonging to the transurethral prostatectomy homogeneous group of patients ( GHM 12C04) and having as a main diagnosis prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( N40) or benign prostatic tumor ( D291) were included in the analysis. From March 2016 , specific codes were introduced to differentiate laser surgery and other types of surgery: JGFE023 ( resection without laser) , JGFE365 ( laser resection) and JGNE171 ( laser vaporization). We described the rates of day case surgery and the average length of stay from 2010 to 2016. From March 2016 we could study the influence of laser surgery on day-case and length of stay. Regarding the all dataset analysis we found 328,781 hospital stays ( 318,549 patients) for BPH surgery , of which 2.7 % ( 9047 hospital stays) were day-case. From 2010 to 2016 , the lengths of stay decreased from 5.78 to 4.29 days. In the meantime , the number of day-case procedures increased from 14 patients ( 0.03 %) to 3035 patients ( 5.63 %). Regarding the last 9 months of 2016 , we found 38,930 hospital stays including 5.4 % ( 2104) day-cases. In total , 92.7 % of day-case procedures had been performed with a laser technique , of which 47.9 % ( 1008) were laser vaporization and 44.8 % ( 944) were laser resection. There were only 7.1 % ( 151.8 %) of day-case procedures performed without laser. The exponential development of the day-case procedures seems to be linked with the advent of laser technology. This tendency is expected to increase in the coming years according to the spreading of laser surgery. 3.
