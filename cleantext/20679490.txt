  Prion and prion-like phenomena are involved in the pathology of numerous human neurodegenerative diseases. The budding yeast , Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , has a number of endogenous yeast prions-epigenetic elements that are transmitted as altered protein conformations and often manifested as heritable phenotypic traits. One such yeast prion , ( SWI +) , was discovered and characterized by our laboratory. The protein determinant of ( SWI +) , Swi1 was found to contain an amino-terminal , asparagine-rich prion domain. Normally , Swi1 functions as part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex , thus , acting as a global transcriptional regulator. Consequently , prionization of Swi1 leads to a variety of phenotypes including poor growth on non-glucose carbon sources and abolishment of multicellular features-with implications on characterization of ( SWI +) as being detrimental or beneficial to yeast. The study of ( SWI +) has revealed important knowledge regarding the chaperone systems supporting prion propagation as well as prion-prion interactions with ( PSI +) and ( RNQ +). Additionally , an intricate regulatory network involving ( SWI +) and other prion elements governing multicellular features in yeast has begun to be revealed. In this review , we discuss the current understanding of ( SWI +) in addition to some possibilities for future study.
