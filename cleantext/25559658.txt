  Prosocial behaviour ( i.e. , voluntary behaviour intended to benefit another) seems to be fully developed in children by the age of 6 years. However , questions about which factors modify prosocial behaviour at that age remain understudied. Here we used a resource allocation paradigm to test prosocial behaviour in 6-9-year-old school children. They could decide between a `` selfish '' ( i.e. , one sticker for themselves) and a `` prosocial '' option ( i.e. , one sticker for themselves and one for the receiver) and we tested whether friendship , social status and prenatal androgen exposure ( approximated by the 2nd to 4th digit ratio; 2D: 4D) influenced children 's prosocial choices. We found that children behaved prosocially , and that their prosocial tendencies were negatively correlated with prenatal androgen exposure; i.e. , children with high 2D: 4D ratios ( reflecting low prenatal androgen exposure) acted more prosocially than children with low 2D: 4D ratios. Further , their social status in the classroom influenced their choices: children with fewer interaction partners chose the `` prosocial '' option more often than more ` popular ' children. However , they did so irrespectively of whether they were paired with a recipient or not. Our results highlight the importance of considering social , as well as physiological factors when investigating prosocial behaviour in children.
