  Given that membrane efflux transporters can influence a drug 's pharmacokinetics , efficacy and safety , identifying potential substrates and inhibitors of these transporters is a critical element in the drug discovery and development process. Additionally , it is important to predict the inhibition potential of new drugs to avoid clinically significant drug interactions. The goal of preclinical studies is to characterize a new drug as a substrate or inhibitor of efflux transporters. Areas covered: This article reviews preclinical systems that are routinely utilized to determine whether a new drug is substrate or inhibitor of efflux transporters including in silico models , in vitro membrane and cell assays , and animal models. Also included is an examination of studies comparing in vitro inhibition data to clinical drug interaction outcomes. Expert opinion: While a number of models are employed to classify a drug as an efflux substrate or inhibitor , there are challenges in predicting clinical drug interactions. Improvements could be made in these predictions through a tier approach to classify new drugs , validation of preclinical assays , and refinement of threshold criteria for clinical interaction studies.
