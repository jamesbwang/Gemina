  To characterize the independent association between antibiotic exposure in the first week of life and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD) or death among very preterm infants without culture-confirmed sepsis<disease>. Retrospective cohort study using the Optum Neonatal Database. Infants without culture-confirmed sepsis<disease> born less than 1500 g and less than 32 weeks gestation between 1/2010 and 11/2016 were included. The independent association between antibiotic therapy during the first week of life and BPD or death prior to 36 weeks postmenstrual age ( PMA) was assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Of 4950 infants , 3946 ( 79.7 %) received antibiotics during the first week of life. Rates of BPD or death ( 41.5 % vs. 31.1 % , p < 0.001) and the two individual outcomes were significantly higher among antibiotic treated infants. After adjusting for potential confounding variables , antibiotic use in the first week of life was not associated with increased risk of BPD or death ( OR 0.96 , 95 % CI ( 0.76,1.21)) or BPD among survivors ( OR 0.86 , 95 % CI ( 0.67,1.09)). Antibiotic use was associated with increased risk of death prior to 36 weeks PMA ( OR 3.01 , 95 % CI ( 1.59,5.71)) , however , secondary analyses suggested this association may be confounded by unmeasured illness severity. Antibiotic exposure in the first week of life among preterm infants without culture-confirmed sepsis<disease> was not independently associated with increased risk of BPD or death.
