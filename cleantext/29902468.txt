  Huntington 's disease ( HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive<symptom> movement<symptom> disorders and cognitive deficits , which is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion encoding an extended polyglutamine ( polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein ( HTT). Reduction of mutant HTT levels and inhibition of neuroinflammation has been proposed as a major therapeutic strategy in treating HD. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg) therapy has been firmly established for the treatment of several autoimmune or inflammatory neurological diseases , either as adjunctive treatment or as first-line therapy. However , whether IVIg has therapeutic potential on HD remains unclear. Here we for the first time demonstrated that IVIg treatment remarkably rescued motor and cognitive deficits , prevented synaptic degeneration , attenuated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in R6/2 mouse model. Further investigation showed that the beneficial effects of IVIg resulted from the reduced levels of mutant HTT and inhibition of NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. These findings suggest that IVIg is a promising therapeutic potential for HD.
