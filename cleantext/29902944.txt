  The definition of health is not just a theoretical issue , because it has many implications for practice , policy , and health services. The current definition of health , formulated by the WHO , is no longer adequate for dealing with the new challenges in health care systems. Despite many attempts to replace it , no alternative definition has reached a wide level of consensus. Assuming an epistemological perspective , the need for a unique definition has to be rejected in favor of a plural approach in which can not exist the best definition of health but many different definitions , more or less useful depending on the scope of application. Nevertheless , it should be noted that not all potential definitions of health are fit to pursue clinical scientific goals. Based on recent scientific debate , one can maintain that each definition of health should have at least 9 features to work well within the clinical scientific field. Moving from this perspective , a new definition has been developed for pursuing health , especially in the fields of chronic patients and older people.
