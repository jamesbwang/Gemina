  Permanent neonatal diabetes caused by mutations in the KCNJ11 gene may be managed with high-dose sulfonylureas. Complete transfer to sulfonylureas is not successful in all cases and can result in insulin monotherapy. In such cases , the outcomes of combining sulfonylureas with insulin have not been fully explored. We present the case of a woman with diabetes due to a KCNJ11 mutation , in whom combination therapy led to clinically meaningful improvements. A 22-year-old woman was found to have a KCNJ11 mutation ( G334V) following diagnosis with diabetes at 3 weeks. She was treated with insulin-pump therapy , had hypoglycaemia unawareness and suboptimal glycaemic control. We assessed the in vitro response of the mutant channel to tolbutamide in Xenopus oocytes and undertook sulfonylurea dose-titration with C-peptide assessment and continuous glucose monitoring. In vitro studies predicted the G334V mutation would be sensitive to sulfonylurea therapy ( 91 Â± 2 % block ( n = 6) with 0.5 mM tolbutamide). C-peptide increased following a glibenclamide test dose ( from 5 to 410 pmol/l). Glibenclamide dose-titration was undertaken: a lower glibenclamide dose did not reduce blood glucose levels , but at 1.2 mg/kg/day insulin delivery was reduced to 0.1 units/h. However , when insulin was stopped , hyperglycaemia ensued. Glibenclamide was further increased ( 2 mg/kg/day) , but once-daily long-acting insulin was still required to maintain glycaemia. This resulted in improved HbA In people with KCNJ11 mutations causing permanent neonatal diabetes , and where complete transfer is not possible , consideration should be given to dual insulin and sulfonylurea therapy.
