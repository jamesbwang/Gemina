  Carbon nitride materials with graphitic to polymeric structures ( gCNH) were investigated as catalyst supports for the proton exchange membrane ( PEM) water electrolyzers using IrO ₂ nanoparticles as oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Here , the performance of IrO ₂ nanoparticles formed and deposited in situ onto carbon nitride support for PEM water electrolysis was explored based on previous preliminary studies conducted in related systems. The results revealed that this preparation route catalyzed the decomposition of the carbon nitride to form a material with much lower N content. This resulted in a significant enhancement of the performance of the gCNH-IrO ₂ ( or N-doped C-IrO ₂) electrocatalyst that was likely attributed to higher electrical conductivity of the N-doped carbon support.
