  To investigate the role of miR-29a in regulating the differentiation mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts. For the first step , the changes of expression of miR-29a during the process of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) differentiation into osteoblast were detected. Then , we infected the MSCs with mimics or inhibitors of miR-29a to explore the roles of miR-29a in the differentiation. Further , the prediction and verification of the possible target genes of miR-29a were achieved by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. MiR-29a was up-regulated during the process of MSCs differentiation into osteoblasts. Overexpression or inhibition of miR-29a using mimics or inhibitors had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Furthermore , the differentiation was enhanced when miR-29a was artificially overexpressed in vitro , whereas silencing of miR-29a attenuated this process. It was evidenced by alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) staining , matrix mineralization , and increased expression of osteoblast-specific genes. Furthermore , we determined that the gene HDAC4 might be a direct target of miR-29a. In the current study , miR-29a promotes osteogenesis via suppressing HDAC4 , indicating that targeting miR-29a may be feasible in the management of osteoporosis.
