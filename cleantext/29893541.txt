  We demonstrate a facile route to in situ growth of lyotropic zirconium phosphate ( ZrP) nanoplates on textiles via an interfacial crystal growing process. The as-prepared hybrid membrane shows a hierarchical architecture of textile fibers ( porous platform for fluid transport) , ZrP nanoplatelets ( layered scaffolds for chemical barriers) , and octadecylamine ( organic species for superhydrophobic functionalization). Interestingly , such a hybrid membrane is able to separate the oily wastewater with a high separation efficiency of 99.9 % , even at in harsh environments. After being chemically etched , the hybrid membrane is able to restore its hydrophobicity autonomously and repeatedly , owing to the hierarchical structure that enables facile loading of healing agent. We anticipate that the concept of implanting superhydrophobic self-healing features in anisotropic structure of lyotropic nanoparticles will open up new opportunities for developing advanced multifunctional materials for wastewater treatment , fuel purification , and oil spill mitigation.
