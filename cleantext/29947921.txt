  The absence of data on the direct association between diabetes-specific distress and all-cause mortality in individuals with diabetes prompted us to examine the temporal association between Problem Areas in Diabetes ( PAID) survey scores and the subsequent risk of all-cause mortality in a cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal data from 3305 individuals with diabetes were obtained from a large Japanese diabetes registry. Independent correlations between quintiles of PAID total scores or PAID scores of â‰¥ 40 and all-cause mortality ( median follow-up of 6.1 years) were examined using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounders. The study population included 1280 women and 2025 men with a mean age of 64.9 years , BMI of 24.6 kg/m We observed a significant positive association between high diabetes distress and all-cause mortality in men with diabetes.
