  There is a strong imperative to reduce the release of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) into the environment , and many efforts are currently being made to replace conventional hazardous VOCs in favour of safe , green and bio-renewable reaction media that are not based on crude petroleum. Recent ground-breaking studies from a few laboratories worldwide have shown that both Grignard and ( functionalised) organolithium reagents , traditionally handled under strict exclusion of air and humidity and in anhydrous VOCs , can smoothly promote both nucleophilic additions to unsaturated substrates and nucleophilic substitutions in water and other bio-based solvents ( glycerol , deep eutectic solvents) , competitively with protonolysis , at room temperature and under air. The chemistry of polar organometallics in the above protic media is a complex phenomenon influenced by several factors , and understanding its foundational character is surely stimulating in the perspective of the development of a sustainable organometallic chemistry.
