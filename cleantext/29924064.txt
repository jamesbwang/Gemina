  The aim was to explore the timing and duration of muscle activation during a landing task in children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) , and compare their responses to those of children who are developing typically ( TD). Six children ( ages 3-4.5 years) , half with ASD , hung from a vertical bar , landed , and reacted to a light cue that signaled the child to run to the right or left or to stay in place. Electromyography and kinematics were recorded and compared between groups. Children with ASD had more and longer bursts of muscle activation during preimpact. In contrast , children TD displayed more and longer burst of muscle activation during impact. The results suggest that children with ASD have a less developed landing strategy compared with their peers TD. Further investigation into the neuromuscular components in children with ASD will guide future interventions for this population.
