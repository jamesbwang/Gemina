  Basal and luminal molecular subgroups of muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma ( UC) can be recognized using immunohistochemical markers. Studies have shown that responses to chemotherapy and outcomes differ amongst these subtypes. High grade UC of the bladder is an immunogenic neoplasm which induces a significant amount of intra- and peri-tumoural immune response; the phenotype of infiltrating immune cells may yield prognostic information and predict response to therapy. In this study , we aimed to correlate immunohistochemical phenotype of high grade UC with immune microenvironment composition. 235 cases of high grade UC treated by cystectomy were reviewed. Clinicopathologic variables for each case were recorded and disease-free survival at last follow up was calculated. Invasive front inflammation<symptom> and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were scored for each case. 207 cases were used to construct a triplicate core tissue microarray ( TMA) , with sections stained for CK 5/6 and GATA3. Of the evaluable cases , 167 were designated as luminal ( CK 5/6- , GATA3 +) and 29 as basal ( CK 5/6 + , GATA3-). Additional sequential TMA sections were stained for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD20 , CD68 , CD163 , FOXP3 , PD-1 , and PD-L1 ( SP263). Basal tumours showed a trend towards worse disease-specific survival ( p = 0.078). Statistically significant associations between basal subtype and CD8 ( p = 0.008) , PD-1 ( p = 0.001) and PD-L1 expression ( p = 0.014). Lower CD4/CD8 and increased CD8/FOXP3 ratios ( p = 0.047 and 0.031 , respectively) were also identified in the basal subtype group. Basal subtype high grade UC has an abundance of CD8 + T cells with increased expression of inhibitory markers , indicative of a `` hot '' immunophenotype. This article is protected by copyright.
