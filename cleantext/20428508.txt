  Neurocognitive dysfunction and brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However , brain MRI is expensive , is restricted by payers , and requires high expertise. Neurocognitive assessment is an easily available , safe , and inexpensive clinical tool that may select patients needing brain MRI. In this cross-sectional and controlled study , 76 SLE patients ( 69 women , age 37 ± 12 years) and 26 age and gender-matched healthy subjects ( 22 women , age 34 ± 11 years) underwent assessment of attention , memory , processing speed , executive function , motor function , and global neurocognitive function. All subjects underwent brain MRI with T1-weighted , fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) , and diffusion-weighted imaging. Hemispheric and whole brain lesion<symptom> load in cm
