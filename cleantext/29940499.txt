  Pyrolyzing low-cost agro-waste into biochar is a promising means for waste biomass utilization. This study engineers corn stalk-derived biochar with abundant hydrophilic functional groups as a support material for iron nanoparticles impregnation ( nZVI-HCS). Surface chemistry and morphology of nZVI-HCS composites is characterized by SEM , TEM , TG , XRD , FTIR , XPS , and BET techniques , which helps to elucidate the mechanisms of Pb
