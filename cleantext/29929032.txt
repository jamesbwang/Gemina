  The authors report the case of a 76 year-old woman presenting with leg<symptom> pain<symptom> , numbness and weakness<symptom> mimicking a lumbosacral radiculopathy. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) demonstrated mild root compression but lumbar decompression afforded only transient symptomatic relief. Post-operative MRI of the lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerve revealed a gluteal venous varix compressing the sciatic nerve just distal to the piriformis muscle. Neurolysis and surgical resection of the offending varix resulted in resolution of her symptoms. Variceal compression is one of the rare causes of extraspinal origin of lower extremity radicular pain. It should be considered if there is lack of correlation between radiological findings and clinical picture or if there is a failure of response to treatment of assumed spinal etiology.
