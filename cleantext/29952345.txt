  A total of 201 wild geckos from the region of Mekong Delta , Vietnam were collected to determine the viable number and survival period of Salmonella<pathogen> in their feces. Of the 101 samples examined , 24 ( 23.8 %) were Salmonella<pathogen> positive. These 24 geckos excreted Salmonella<pathogen> in their feces in a range of 1 to 8.6 log CFU/g with a mean of 4.5 Â± 3.2 log CFU/g. Among the Salmonella serovars , Salmonella Weltevreden was the most predominant serovar<pathogen> ( 37.5 %). Moreover , Salmonella<pathogen> could survive for 6 weeks in gecko feces at room temperature in Vietnam. These results indicate that the wild gecko seems to play an important role as a reservoir for Salmonella<pathogen> and a source of Salmonella infection in humans in Southeast Asian countries.
