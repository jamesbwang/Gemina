  Numerous factor analytic studies of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire have supported a range of solutions , many with differing numbers of factors. Although some solutions have received more support than others , it remains unclear how clinicians and researchers may evaluate solutions with similar levels of empirical support in relation to one another , and few item-level analyses have been conducted. In the current study , we seek to explore the relationships among various factor solutions in a hierarchical manner using Goldberg 's ( 2006) Bass-Ackward approach. A final sample of 847 undergraduate students completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire with a Likert-style response format. Item-level exploratory factor analyses with between one and nine factors were extracted. Interrelationships among these solutions were examined. Each solution was evaluated in terms of its content , statistical significance , simple structure , and consistency with previous findings. Factor solutions at several levels were found to replicate findings from past factor analyses in terms of individual factor content and relative merit. Solutions with between four and six factors received the most support and solutions with up to seven factors were found to achieve support. ( PsycINFO Database Record
