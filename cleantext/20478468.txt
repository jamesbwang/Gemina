  The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism by which iatrogenic root dentin removal influences radicular stress distribution and subsequently affects the resistance to vertical root fractures ( VRF) in endodontically treated teeth. The experiments were conducted in two phases. Phase 1: freshly extracted premolar teeth maintained in phosphate-buffered saline were instrumented to simulate three different degrees of dentin removal , designated as low , medium , and extreme groups. Micro-Ct analyzes were performed to quantitatively determine: ( a) the amount of dentin removed , ( b) the remaining dentin volume , and ( c) the moment of inertia of root dentin. The specimens were then subjected to thermomechanical cycling and continuous loading to determine ( a) the mechanical load to fracture and ( b) dentin microcracking ( fractography) using scanning electron microscopy. Phase 2: Finite element analysis was used to evaluate the influence of dentin removal on the stress distribution pattern in root dentin. The data obtained were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey 's Phase 1: A significantly greater volume of dentin was removed from teeth in extreme group when compared to low group ( The combined experimental/numerical analyses highlighted the influence of remaining root dentin volume on the radicular bending resistance , stress distribution pattern , and subsequent propensity to VRF.
