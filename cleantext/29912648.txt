  Due to minimal environmental impact , compared to most conventional feed commodities , insects deserve a growing attention as candidate ingredients for aquafeeds. This study tested , for the first time during zebrafish larval rearing , the effects of an increasing replacement ( 0 % -25 % -50 %) of fish meal by black soldier fly ( BSF) full-fat prepupae meal. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isolipidic. A multidisciplinary approach , including biometrics , histology , gas chromatography-mass spectrometry , and molecular analyses , was applied to better understand the biological responses of larval zebrafish to the different partial inclusions<disease> of BSF in the feed. Generally , results are promising , but a 50 % of BSF meal inclusion in the diet affected both lipid composition and accumulation in the larvae.
