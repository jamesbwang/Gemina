  El Niño events are characterized by anomalously warm tropical Pacific surface waters and concurrent ocean heat discharge , a precursor of subsequent cold La Niña conditions. Here we show that El Niño 2015/2016 departed from this norm: despite extreme peak surface temperatures , tropical Pacific ( 30 ° N-30 ° S) upper ocean heat content increased by 9.6 ± 1.7 ZJ ( 1 ZJ = 10
