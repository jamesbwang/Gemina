  Retinoids play critical roles in development , immunity , and lipid metabolism , and their deficiency leads to various human disorders. Yet , tools for sensing retinoids in vivo are lacking , which limits the understanding of retinoid distribution , dynamics and functions in living organisms. Here , using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy , we discover a previously unknown cytoplasmic store of retinoids in Caenorahbditis elegans<pathogen>. Following the temporal dynamics of retinoids , we reveal that their levels are positively correlated with fat storage , and their supplementation slows down fat loss during starvation. We also discover that retinoids promote fat unsaturation in response to high-glucose stress , and improve organism survival. Together , our studies report a new method for tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of retinoids in living organisms , and suggest the crucial roles of retinoids in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and enhancing organism fitness upon developmental and dietary stresses.
