  The present study analyzed the appearances of optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCTA) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC) based on fluorescein angiography ( FA) and indocyanine green angiography ( ICGA). In the current case series , 54 eyes of 50 patients diagnosed as CSC were evaluated retrospectively. OCTA , FA , and ICGA were performed on each patient. Two trained observers examined the OCTA images independently to confirm and compare the choriocapillary appearance with that on FA/ICGA. Also , the leakage of vessels on FA , perfusion of choroidal blood flow on ICGA , blood flow density , and vascular morphology on OCTA , as well as , the effect of serous retinal detachment ( SRD) on imaging were observed. Furthermore , the image findings of contralateral eyes were included. 47/54 eyes ( corresponding to 43 patients in 50 patients) were finally diagnosed with CSC that presented a leakage on FA and dilated vessels on ICGA , and the corresponding areas could be recognized on OCTA. However , in some of the cases ( 15 eyes , 31.9 %) , a portion of the leakage lesion<symptom> on FA did not overlap completely with that on OCTA. On the OCTA B-scan , six eyes did not show a choriocapillary flow signal under subretinal fluid ( SRF) with a median SRD height of 485 µm , despite the dilated vessels on ICGA. Approximately , 21 contralateral eyes without SRD and leakage presented dilated vessels on ICGA; however , only 13 eyes could be recognized on OCTA. In addition , seven eyes presented CSC on FA/ICGA but manifested explicit abnormal vascularization beneath the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) on OCTA. FA/ICGA remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of CSC and can not be completely replaced by OCTA. However , in some cases displaying hot-spots CNV , OCTA can contribute toward a definite diagnosis. The SRD height may exert a shielding effect on the choriocapillary flow signals on OCTA.
