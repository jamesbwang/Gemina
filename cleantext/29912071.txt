  Encarnación-Martínez , A , Ferrer-Roca , V , and García-López , J. Influence of sex on current methods of adjusting saddle height in indoor cycling. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The popularity of indoor cycling has increased in fitness centers , and therefore , proper bike fitting is important to avoid biomechanical-related injuries. However , no previous studies have compared the biomechanical kinematics of various existing protocols of saddle-height adjustment in indoor cycling. Furthermore , it was not clear if these protocols were appropriate for both men and women , as these equations were primarily obtained in male cyclists. Therefore , lower-limb joint kinematics were compared among 4 different protocols of saddle-height adjustment ( 1-Preferred , 2-Ferrer-Roca et al. , 3-Lemond & Guimard , and 4-Static Goniometry) in 30 experienced indoor-cycling participants ( 15 men and 15 women). Only 20-33 % of the women had a knee extension while pedaling within the recommended range for each of the different protocols except for the preferred adjustment ( 73 % were within). By contrast , all the protocols were moderately suitable for men ( 47-60 % were within the recommended range). A multiple linear equation to estimate the recommended saddle height in both men and women ( R = 0.917 , p = 0.001) was obtained from the following variables: inseam length , stature , foot length , and knee angle. The differences in the findings between men and women may be partially explained by differences in anatomical structures , as well as the male-based equations , which argues the need for future investigations in female cyclists.
