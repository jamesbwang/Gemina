  To compare the amount of tissue loss using different FUE punches. The study was conducted in 5 patients undergoing hair restoration surgery by FUE. Four different kinds of punches were used , that is , sharp , blunt , serrated , and new `` A-design. '' All the punches had a total cutting edge of 0.8 mm. In each patient , 4 punches were used to make insertion at right angle with the skin. Immediately after the punch use , the diameter of the hole was measured. The same areas were also measured after 24 hours and after 1 month. The data were collected and analyzed by Multiple t test ( with Bonferroni 's correction). The average size of the wound<disease> immediately at the end of the procedure was 0.826 mm for sharp , 0.858 mm for blunt , 0.892 mm for serrated , and 0.932 mm for A-design. Similarly , the wounds<disease> decreased to 0.752 , 0.778 , 0.774 , and 0.696 mm for sharp , blunt , serrated , and A-design , respectively , after 24 hours. The final wound/scar size was 0.640 mm for punch , 0.660 mm for blunt punch , 0.668 mm for serrated punch , and 0.598 mm for A-design punch after 1 month. The new A-design resulted in the minimum scar size after 1 month.
