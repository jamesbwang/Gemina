  The analysis of PET images by textural features , also known as radiomics , shows promising results in tumor characterization. However , radiomic metrics ( RMs) analysis is currently not standardized and the impact of the whole processing chain still needs deep investigation. We characterized the impact on RM values of: i) two discretization methods , ii) acquisition statistics , and iii) reconstruction algorithm. The influence of tumor volume and standardized-uptake-value ( SUV) on RM was also investigated. The Chang-Gung-Image-Texture-Analysis ( CGITA) software was used to calculate 39 RMs using phantom data. Thirty noise realizations were acquired to measure statistical effect size indicators for each RM. The parameter η We found the discretization method based on fixed-bin-number ( FBN) to outperform the one based on fixed-bin-size in units of SUV ( FBS) , as the latter shows a higher SUV dependence , with 30 RMs showing η For RMs analysis , FBN should be preferred. A group of 21 RMs was suggested for PET radiomics analysis.
