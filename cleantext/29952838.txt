  The objectives of this survey study were to: ( 1) determine practice patterns , ( 2) assess beliefs and attitudes toward ultrasound-guided intra-articular injections ( UGIIs) , ( 3) identify barriers to the use of UGII , and ( 4) determine any differences in beliefs and attitudes based on age or specialty. A survey was developed using a focus group including physicians who perform intra-articular injections of the knee , shoulder , and/or hip. After validation by the focus group , the final survey ( 28 questions) was e-mailed to members of the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine ( N = 632). A total of 168 responses were received ( 26.6 %). Nearly half of respondents rarely/never had access to UGII equipment ( 48.5 %) , and over half did not have adequate training in UGIIs ( 56.8 % -68.8 %). About half of respondents agreed that UGII improves accuracy in knee injections ( 50.9 %); only 35.4 % agreed there was evidence to support UGII over non-ultrasound-guided intra-articular injections ( NGIIs) of the knee. Physicians younger than 50 years were significantly more likely to use UGII for the knee and hip if they had better access to equipment ( P < 0.0005 for both); they were more likely to use UGII for the knee if it was less time-consuming ( P = 0.001). The majority of respondents are not using UGII for the knee or shoulder. Physicians may overestimate their accuracy in performing NGIIs. The biggest barriers to UGII were identified as: ( 1) inadequate training; ( 2) lack of access to equipment; and ( 3) lack of time. Younger physicians seem more open to adopting UGII if barriers are addressed.
