  Background/aim: The potential inhibitory effects of Ankaferd Blood Stopper ( ABS) against biofilm formation of oral microorganisms and its capacity for collagenase , hyaluronidase , and elastase inhibitions that have important roles in wound<disease> healing have been investigated. Materials and methods: The wound<disease> healing potential was determined by its inhibition ability on collagenase , hyaluronidase , and elastase enzyme activities and was evaluated via scratch wound<disease> healing assay on murine 3T3 fibroblasts. The antibiofilm activity was tested against eight oral microorganisms using the crystal violet staining method. Results: At 10 % ABS successfully inhibited the biofilm formation of the tested microorganisms. Enzyme inhibition analysis revealed that 3 % ABS significantly inhibited all three enzymes related to wound healing. The scratch assay showed that wound<disease> closure was faster than that of the control for the 3 % ABS/plate. Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicated that ABS has effective wound<disease> healing potential with its strong antibiofilm activity against oral cavity microorganisms.
