  Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) is a systemic cytotoxic radiation therapy using a compound of β-emitting radionuclide chelated to a peptide for the treatment of tumor with overexpressed specific cell receptor such as somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ( SSTR2) of neuroendocrine tumor ( NET). Surgical resection should be performed for the curative treatment for NETs when it is feasible; however , a multi-disciplinary approach is needed when locally advanced or metastasized disease. PRRT with lutetium-177 ( Lu-177)- labeled somatostatin analogues , as a new treatment modality targeting metastatic or inoperable NETs expressing the SSTR2 , have been developed and successfully used for the past two decades. As Lu-177 emits both β- and γ-radiation , it has the ability as a theragnostic agent for NETs compared with only β-emitting yttrium-90 labeled PRRT. Several recent studies reported that Lu-177 gave an overall positive response and improved the patients ' quality of life. To fully exploit its potential , large comparative studies are needed for the assessment of distinct efficacies of Lu-177 labeled PRRT. Additionally , for extending the indications and developing new regimens of Lu-177-based PRRT , more dedicated clinical research is required.
