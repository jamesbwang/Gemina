  Acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC) , acting through muscarinic receptors , has an essential role in regulating flexible behavior and working memory ( WM). General muscarinic receptor blockade disrupts PFC WM representations , while selective stimulation of muscarinic receptor subtypes is of great interest for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer 's disease. Here , we tested selective stimulation and blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors ( M1Rs) in macaque PFC , during performance of a cognitive control task in which rules maintained in WM specified saccadic responses. We hypothesized that M1R blockade and stimulation would disrupt and enhance rule representation in WM , respectively. Unexpectedly , M1R blockade did not consistently affect PFC neuronal rule selectivity. Moreover , M1R stimulation suppressed PFC activity , and at higher doses , degraded rule representations. Our results suggest that , in primates , the deleterious effects of general muscarinic blockade on PFC WM activity are not mediated by M1Rs , while their overstimulation deteriorates PFC rule maintenance.
