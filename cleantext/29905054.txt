  To investigate the early effects of acellular xenogeneic nerve combined with adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs) and platelet rich plasma ( PRP) in repairing facial nerve injury in rabbits. The bilateral sciatic nerves of 15 3-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were harvested and decellularized as xenografts. The allogeneic ADSCs were extracted from the neck and back fat pad of healthy adult New Zealand rabbits with a method of digestion by collagenase type Ⅰ and the autologous PRP was prepared by two step centrifugation. The 3rd generation ADSCs with good growth were labelled with CM-Dil living cell stain , and the labelling and fluorescence attenuation of the cells were observed by fluorescence microscope. Another 32 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups and established the left facial nerve defect in length of 1 cm ( ADSCs labelled by CM-Dil showed that the labelling rate of cells was more than 90 % under fluorescence microscope , and the labelled cells proliferated well , and the fluorescence attenuated slightly after passage. All the animals survived after operation , the incision healed well and no infection occurred. At 1 week after operation , all the animals in each group had different degrees of dysfunction. The angle θ of the left side in groups A , B , C , and D were ( 53.4 ± 2.5) , ( 54.0 ± 2.6) , ( 53.7 ± 2.4) , and ( 53.0 ± 2.1) ° , respectively; showing significant differences when compared with the healthy sides ( ADSCs can survive as a seed cell
