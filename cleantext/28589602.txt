  The burden of mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV<pathogen> is high and risk factors are common in Ethiopia. This systematic review and meta-analysis intended to provide the pooled estimation of mother-to-child transmission rate and its risk factors in Ethiopia. We searched PubMed , Google Scholar , EMBASE and Web of Science electronic databases for all available references. We included observational studies including case-control , cohort , and cross-sectional studies. The search was further limited to studies conducted in Ethiopia and publish in English. Heterogeneity was checked using the I A total of 18 studies with 6253 individuals were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Of these , 14 studies with 4624 individuals were used to estimate the prevalence. The estimated pooled prevalence of mother-to-child transmission of HIV<pathogen> was 11.4 % ( 95 % CI = 9.1-13.7). The pooled adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) of mother-to-child transmission of HIV<pathogen> for the infants from rural area was 3.8 ( 95 % CI = 1.4 to 6.3) , infants delivered at home was 3.2 ( 95 % CI = 1.2 to 5.2) , infant did n't take antiretroviral prophylaxis was 5.8 ( 95 % CI = 1.5 to 10.3) , mother did n't take antiretroviral prophylaxis was 6.1 ( 95 % CI = 2.5 to 9.6) , mothers did n't receive PMTCT intervention was 5.1 ( 95 % CI = 1.6 , 8.6) , and on mixed feeding was 4.3 ( 95 % CI = 1.8 to 6.7). This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV<pathogen> was high in Ethiopia. Being from the rural residence , home delivery , not taking antiretroviral prophylaxis , the absence of PMTCT intervention , and mixed infant feeding practices increased the risk of HIV<pathogen> transmission. It is registered in the Prospero database: ( PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017078232).
