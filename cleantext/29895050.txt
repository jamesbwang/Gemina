  The emergence of Metallo-beta-lactamase ( MBL)- producing Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> has become a global concern in nosocomial infections. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of MBL producing genes among clinical isolates of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> from hospitalized patients. This study was performed from October 2015 to October 2016 at three teaching hospitals located in Isfahan , Iran. Totally , 100 A-baumannii isolates were collected from clinical specimens and identified as A-baumannii using standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was determined by disc diffusion method according to the CLSI. Furthermore , the determination of bla Totally , Sixty-eight percent ( 68 %) of isolates of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> were recovered from tracheal aspirate. According to the antibiotic susceptibility pattern , the highest level of resistance was against ciprofloxacin ( 99 %) , while among tested antibiotics amikacin ( 10 %) was found to be the most effective. 21 % , 4 % , 7 % and 6 % isolates carried bla The results of this study showed high rate of the MBL producing A-baumannii isolates in our region and displayed that MBLs producing A-baumannii strains are emerging threats to ICUs.
