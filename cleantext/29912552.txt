  We used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF-SIMS) imaging to investigate the effect of cisplatin , the first member of the platinum-based anticancer drugs , on the membrane lipid composition of model cells to see if lipid changes might be involved in the changes in exocytosis observed. Platinum-based anticancer drugs have been reported to affect neurotransmitter release resulting in what is called the `` chemobrain ''; however , the mechanism for the influence is not yet understood. TOF-SIMS imaging was carried out using a high energy 40 keV ( CO
