  Hammerhead ribozymes are a model system for studying molecular mechanism of RNA catalysis. Physicochemical data-driven mechanistic studies are an indispensable step towards understanding the catalysis of hammerhead ribozymes. Here we characterized a model RNA duplex with catalytically important sheared-type G12-A9 base pair and A9-G10.1 metal ion-binding motif in hammerhead ribozymes. By using high magnetic field NMR , all base proton signals , including catalytic residues , were unambiguously assigned. We further characterized structural features of this RNA molecule and found that it reflects the structural features of the A9-G10.1 motif of hammerhead ribozymes. Therefore , this RNA molecule is suitable for extracting an intrinsic physicochemical properties of catalytically important residues.
