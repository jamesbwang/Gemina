  The treatment of glioma remains a challenge because conventional chemotherapy is often ineffective by drug resistance. Combinative therapy using chemotherapeutic agents and siRNA has demonstrated potential to improve anticancer outcome through a synergistic effect in various cancers. The current study aims to achieve better glioma treatment through a combinative therapy based on a folate-targeted nanocarrier carrying both temozolomide ( TMZ) and anti-BCL-2 siRNA. A polymeric micelle ( TMZ-FaPEC@siRNA) incorporating TMZ and anti-BCL-2 siRNA was prepared based on folate-conjugated triblock copolymer ( Fa-PEG-PEI-PCL , Fa-PEC) of poly ( Îµ-caprolactone) ( PCL) , poly ( ethylenimine) ( PEI) and poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG). The physicochemical properties and drug release profile of TMZ-FaPEC@siRNA were tested. The Fa-targeted drug delivery and joint effect of siRNA and TMZ to induce glioma apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cell study demonstrated that the nanocarrier effectively facilitates codelivery of siRNA and TMZ into C6 cells , resulting in a strong apoptotic response of cancer cells by silencing the antiapoptosis BCL-2 gene and activating the proapoptotic Bax gene simultaneously. In vivo study in rat bearing orthotropic glioma showed that tumor growth was inhibited and meanwhile animal survival was prolonged remarkably through intracranial injection of TMZ-FaPEC@siRNA. Our results evidence the strong efficacy of the folate-targeted nanomedicine carrying TMZ and BCL-2 siRNA in treating glioma.
