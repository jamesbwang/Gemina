  We evaluated the relationship between preconception folic acid supplementation and the occurrence of neural tube defects ( NTDs) in offspring , using data from the Japan Environment and Children 's Study ( a nationwide prospective birth cohort study) database. Of 92269 participants with single pregnancies , 74 cases ( offspring or fetuses) had NTDs , including 32 cases of spina bifida , 24 cases of anencephaly , and 19 cases of encephalocele. A total of 7634 participants ( 8.27 %) used preconception folic acid supplementation , and of these , 621 ( 0.67 %) also took in dietary folic acid at ≥ 480 μg/day. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated no association between preconception folic acid supplementation and NTDs in offspring or fetuses ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.622; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.226-1.713). Moreover , the participants who combined preconception folic acid supplement use with dietary folic acid intake ≥ 480 μg/day demonstrated no incidence of NTDs in offspring or fetuses. Our analysis is limited by the absence of the data on the daily amount of supplementary folic acid intake , requiring careful attention to the interpretation. Additional surveys are required in Japan to resolve those limitations for further comprehensive assessment.
