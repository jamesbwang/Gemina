  Obesity is associated with a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA). Bariatric surgery is postulated to lead to OSA resolution , but there is inconclusive evidence on its efficacy. We used objective measurements to determine the rate of resolution or improvement of OSA in patients who had bariatric procedures in our unit. Data was analysed on all patients with OSA who underwent bariatric procedures ( laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG)) between June 2012 and September 2016 in our unit. 47 patients ( 26.7 %) were diagnosed with OSA. Mean age was 48.5 years. 63.8 % were female. 43 required nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) support. Procedures were LRYGB ( n = 26) and LSG ( n = 21). Mean excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was 56.1 %. Mean start apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI) on CPAP was 6.4 events/hr and end AHI was 1.4 events/h. 14 patients ( 32.6 %) had complete OSA resolution and 12 ( 27.9 %) showed improvement in pressure support requirements. We demonstrated that 55.3 % of patients had resolution or improvement in OSA following bariatric surgery. However , there was a high rate of non-attendance of follow-up appointments. Future efforts will involve analysis of the reasons for this to ensure more robust monitoring.
