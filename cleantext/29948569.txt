  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) patients are at increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers , and preventive care guidelines in IBD favor annual skin examinations. Here we estimate the cost-effectiveness of annual melanoma screening in IBD. Melanoma screening was defined as receiving annual total body<symptom> skin examinations starting at age 40 from a dermatologist. Screening was compared to US background total body<symptom> skin examination rates performed by primary care practitioners. A Markov model was used to estimate intervention costs and effectiveness. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3 % per year over a lifetime horizon. Strategies were compared using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 100,000/ quality-adjusted life year ( QALY) gained. Annual melanoma screening cost an average of $ 1961 per patient , while no screening cost $ 81 per patient. Melanoma screening was more effective , gaining 9.2 QALYs per 1000 persons , at a cost of $ 203,400/ QALY gained. Screening every other year was the preferred strategy , gaining 6.2 QALYs per 1000 persons and costing $ 143,959/ QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested the relative risk of melanoma in IBD , melanoma progression , and screening costs were most influential with clinically plausible variation , leading to scenarios costing < $ 100,000/ QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested screening every other year was cost-effective in 17.4 % of iterations. Screening for melanoma in IBD patients was effective but expensive. Screening every other year was the most cost-effective strategy. Studies to identify IBD patients at the highest risk of developing melanoma may assist in targeting a prevention program in the most cost-effective manner.
