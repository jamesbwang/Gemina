  Strong complexation between heavy metals and organic complexing agents makes the heavy metals difficult to be removed by classical chemical precipitation. In this study , a novel decomplexation method was developed using discharge plasma oxidation , which was followed by alkaline precipitation to treat water containing heavy metal-organic complex , that is , Cu-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( Cu-EDTA). The decomplexation efficiency of Cu complex reached up to nearly 100 % after 60 min 's oxidation by discharge plasma , which was accompanied by 82.1 % of total organic carbon removal and energy efficiency of 0.62 g kWh
