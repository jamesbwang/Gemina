  Fluorescent switches based on spirocyclic zwitterionic Meisenheimer ( SZMC) complexes are stimuli-responsive organic molecules with application in a variety of areas. To expand their functionality , novel switching mechanisms are herein reported for these systems: ( a) acid- and redox-triggered formation of an additional protonation state with distinct optical properties , and ( b) solvent-induced fluorescence modulation. We demonstrate that these new features , which enable both multistimuli and multistate operation of SZMC switches , can be exploited in the preparation of smart organic materials: wide-range pH optical probes , electrochromic and electrofluorochromic films , and polymer-based fluorescent detectors of organic liquids.
