  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , the leading cause of death and morbidity in the Western world , begins with lipid accumulation in the arterial wall , which is the initial step in atherogenesis. Alterations in lipid metabolism result in increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders , and treatment of lipid disorders remains the most common strategy aimed at reducing the incidence of CVD. Work done over the past decade has identified numerous classes of non-coding RNA molecules including microRNAs ( miRNAs) and long-non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) as critical regulators of gene expression involved in lipid metabolism and CVD , mostly acting at post-transcriptional level. A number of miRNAs , including miR-33 , miR-122 and miR-148a , have been demonstrated to play important role in controlling the risk of CVD through regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and lipoprotein metabolism. lncRNAs are recently emerging as important regulators of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. However , much additional work will be required to fully understand the impact of lncRNAs on CVD and lipid metabolism , due to the high abundance of lncRNAs and the poor-genetic conservation between species. This article reviews the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and their potential implications for the treatment of CVD.
