  B-type natriuretic peptide has shown promising results as a biomarker for acute kidney injury in general intensive care patients. It may also indirectly reflect fluid balance<symptom> of the circulation. Among burn patients , it has been observed to indicate excessive fluid resuscitation and organ dysfunction , although its clinical use to indicate acute kidney injury or guide fluid resuscitation has not been validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values are related to the amount of fluids given after severe burn injury and whether it can act as a novel biomarker for acute kidney injury in these patients. Nineteen consecutive burn patients were included. Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was measured daily during 1 week from admission. Other variables such as laboratory values and intravenous infusions were also recorded. The association between acute kidney injury and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values was analyzed with a multivariable panel regression model , adjusted for burned total body surface area , age , body mass index , and laboratory values. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values varied between single patients , and even more between the patients who developed acute kidney injury. Older age , lower body mass index , and cumulative infusions were independently associated with higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values , whereas acute kidney injury was not. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide values correlated with cumulative infusions given during the first week. The authors could not validate the role of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide as a biomarker for acute kidney injury in burns.
