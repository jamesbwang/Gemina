  Bacterial infections affect more than 2 million people annually. Of these , systemic<disease> infections<disease> caused by bacteria in critically ill patients may lead to life-threatening conditions like sepsis<disease>. We have developed a point-of-care ( POC) device called Septiflo â„¢ that can detect and stratify the Gram status of bloodstream bacterial infection under 10 min from a drop of human plasma. It works on the principle of identifying pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) and lipoteichoic acid ( LTA) that are released into the bloodstream at the onset of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections , respectively. The biomarkers are captured on a membrane without a receptor and the Gram status specificity is conferred by the ligands attached to gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) used as signal amplification probes. The ultrasensitive colorimetric results are read by eye down to 100 fg/mL detection limit without any instrument. No cross-interference between the PAMPs is seen during Gram stratification. Septiflo results also display better performance than commercial ELISAs. Tests performed on 60 clinical samples from patients showed a correlation accuracy of 70 % against procalcitonin ( PCT) , an accepted surrogate biomarker for sepsis<disease>. A direct comparison with eubacterial polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) yielded up to 94 % accuracy in 31 patients at a chosen cut-off level for LPS/LTA in the blood guided by the area under curve ( AUC) values of 0.927 and 0.885 , respectively though blood culture was negative for most samples. The high sensitivity , low cost and simple bedside utility of the assay may aid in better sepsis<disease> management apparently even at the pre-symptomatic stage , lowering empirical therapy , medical costs and antimicrobial resistance ultimately improving the outcome.
