  Gene order and location in chromosomes of species are non-random. Neighboring gene pairs tend to display some similarities , such as co-expression and co-modification. However , the contribution of linear proximity , spatial proximity , and evolutionary proximity to these similarities remain unclear , together with whether the presence of several types of proximity can strengthens the similarities. In this study , we investigated the properties of three kinds of colocalized gene pairs: intrachromosomal colocalized gene pairs , always-neighboring gene pairs , and evolutionary neighboring gene pairs. Our analysis showed that ( 1) Different types of colocalized genes differentially contribute to co-expression , co-modifications and conservation across species; ( 2) Intrachromosomal colocalization can strengthen co-expression and co-modification of neighboring gene pairs and their conservation across species; ( 3) The combination of the three kinds of colocalization can lead to the strongest co-modification and is most strongly conserved across species. ( 4) Colocalized gene pairs are indicative of phylogenetic relationships and whole genome duplications ( WGDs). These results provide valuable clues for future efforts to understand the characteristics of colocalized gene pairs and how the neighborhood affects their interactions.
