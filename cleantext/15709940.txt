  Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk ( known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity ( unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making , their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes , but not risk attitudes , predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individual 's ambiguity tolerance , the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors , both during decisions to cooperate ( experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust ( experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with another 's actions is sufficiently resolved , this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated ( experiment 3). Taken together , these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of one 's willingness to engage in costly social behavior , which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.
