  The simultaneous presence of undernutrition and over-nutrition represents a paradox in global public health and is of increasing concern in Ecuador , where chronic malnutrition and overweight and obesity occur in the context of demographic and epidemiologic transitions. Two overlapping trends are present in Ecuador; while levels of stunting have decreased slowly in the past three decades , increasing proportions of children < 5 years and women of reproductive age suffer from overweight and obesity. To analyze stunting and overweight and obesity in children < 5 and their mothers aged from 15 to 49 years in the context of demographic and household characteristics between 1986 and 2012. This study compares data from nationally-representative surveys conducted in Ecuador in 1986 , 2004 , and 2012 , each of which collected information on children < 5 and mothers aged 15-49 years. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children < 5 decreased at different rates among Ecuadorians who differ in terms of residence , socioeconomic status , and mothers ' level of education , while overweight and obesity increased dramatically in the same period. Chronic malnutrition in children < 5 and overweight in children < 5 and mothers 15-49 years represent a double burden of malnutrition in Ecuador. The phenomena differ in their effects , and , while the prevalence of stunting is declining in Ecuador as it is in many parts of the world , the problem of overweight and obesity has emerged in dramatic fashion , and currently represents an extraordinary challenge to public health.
