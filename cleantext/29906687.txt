  Based on the potent anticancer activity of 6 '- fluorocyclopentenyl-cytosine 2b in phase IIa clinical trials for the treatment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer , we carried out a systematic structure-activity relationship study of 6 '- fluorocyclopentenyl-pyrimidines 3a-i and- purines 3j-o to discover novel anticancer agents. We also synthesized the phosphoramidate prodrug 3p of adenine derivative 1b to determine if the anticancer activity depended on the inhibition of DNA and/or RNA polymerase in cancer cells and/or on the inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH) hydrolase. All of the synthesized pyrimidine nucleosides exhibited much less potent anticancer activity in vitro than the cytosine derivative 2b , acting as RNA and/or DNA polymerase inhibitor , indicating that they could not be efficiently converted to their triphosphates for anticancer activity. Among all the synthesized purine nucleosides , adenine derivative 1b and N
