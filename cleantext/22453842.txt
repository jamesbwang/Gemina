  Dietary broccoli is anti-inflammatory. Past studies have typically investigated raw broccoli , even though most consumers prefer cooked broccoli , where the plant myrosinase is inactivated by heat , resulting in failure of formation of the anti-inflammatory bioactive compound sulforaphane ( SF). This study compareed efficacy of lightly cooked broccoli ( CB) containing greatly diminished myrosinase activity , with raw broccoli ( RB) , in mitigating colitis<disease> in dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- treated mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed for two weeks on a 10 % RB , 10 % CB or control diet , all based on the AIN-93M diet. Half (
