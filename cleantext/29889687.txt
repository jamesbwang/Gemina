  Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter ( PM2 .5) has been linked with premature mortality , but sources of PM2 .5 have been less studied. We evaluated associations between source-specific PM2 .5 exposures and cause-specific short-term mortality in eight California locations from 2002 to 2011. Speciated PM2 .5 measurements were source-apportioned using Positive Matrix Factorization into eight sources and combined with death certificate data. We used time-stratified case-crossover analysis with conditional logistic regression by location and meta-analysis to calculate pooled estimates. Biomass burning was associated with all-cause mortality lagged 2 days after exposure ( lag2) ( % changelag2 in odds per interquartile range width increase in biomass burning PM2 .5 = 0.8 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.2 , 1.4) , cardiovascular ( % changelag2 = 1.3 , 95 % CI = 0.3 , 2.4) , and ischemic heart disease ( % changelag2 = 2.0 , 95 % CI = 0.6 , 3.5). Vehicular emissions were associated with increases in cardiovascular mortality ( % changelag0 = 1.4 , 95 % CI = 0.0 , 2.9). Several other sources exhibited positive associations as well. Many findings persisted during the cool season. Warm season biomass burning was associated with respiratory/thoracic cancer mortality ( % changelag1 = 5.9 , 95 % CI = 0.7 , 11.3) , and warm season traffic was associated with all-cause ( % changelag0 = 1.9 , 95 % CI = 0.1 , 3.6) and cardiovascular ( % changelag0 = 2.9 , 95 % CI = 0.1 , 5.7) mortality. Our results suggest that acute exposures to biomass burning and vehicular emissions are linked with cardiovascular mortality , with additional sources ( i.e. , soil , secondary nitrate , secondary sulfate , aged sea salt , and chlorine sources) showing associations with other specific mortality types.
