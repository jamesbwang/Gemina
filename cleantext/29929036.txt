  Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA) is the only pharmacological approved treatment for ischemic stroke , despite its associated increasing risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Since many of rt-PA effects in blood-brain barrier ( BBB) are not well characterized , the study of protein changes in BBB cells after rt-PA administration may help to understand its adverse effects. Our aim was to analyze protein levels of four commonly used housekeeping proteins: β-Actin , α-Tubulin , GAPDH and HPRT in bEnd .3 endothelial cell line subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation ( OGD) conditions and rt-PA treatment to determine their reliability as Western blot loading controls. bEnd .3 monolayers were subjected to 2.5 h of OGD and reperfusion with/without 20 μg/ml of rt-PA. At 3 , 6 , 24 and 72 h post-OGD , protein levels were analyzed by Western blot using Stain-Free technology. OGD significantly decreased β-Actin , α-Tubulin , GAPDH and HPRT protein levels at 3 , 6 , 24 and 72 h post-OGD without significant rt-PA treatment effects except for the GAPDH levels increase in control condition at 3 h post-OGD. The present study clearly demonstrated that β-Actin , α-Tubulin , GAPDH and HPRT proteins are not suitable as loading controls for Western Blot analysis in bEnd .3 cells after OGD. We reported altered levels of β-Actin , α-Tubulin , GAPDH and HPRT housekeeping proteins in bEnd .3 endothelial cell line after an ischemic insult. Therefore , we demonstrated that these proteins are not suitable as loading controls for Western Blot analysis in our experimental conditions and we recommended the use of Stain-Free gels as an alternative to traditional housekeeping proteins normalization.
