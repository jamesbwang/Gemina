  The assessment of multiple systematic reviews ( AMSTAR) tool is widely used for investigating the methodological quality of systematic reviews ( SR). Originally , AMSTAR was developed for SRs of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). Its applicability to SRs of other study designs remains unclear. Our objectives were to: 1) analyze how AMSTAR is applied by authors and ( 2) analyze whether the authors pay attention to the original purpose of AMSTAR and for what it has been validated. We searched MEDLINE ( via PubMed) from inception through October 2016 to identify studies that applied AMSTAR. Full-text studies were sought for all retrieved hits and screened by one reviewer. A second reviewer verified the excluded studies ( liberal acceleration). Data were extracted into structured tables by one reviewer and were checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies at any stage were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third person. We analyzed the data descriptively as frequencies or medians and interquartile ranges ( IQRs). Associations were quantified using the risk ratio ( RR) , with 95 % confidence intervals. We identified 247 studies. They included a median of 17 reviews ( interquartile range ( IQR): 8 to 47) per study. AMSTAR was modified in 23 % ( 57/247) of studies. In most studies , an AMSTAR score was calculated ( 200/247; 81 %). Methods for calculating an AMSTAR score varied , with summing up all yes answers ( yes = 1) being the most frequent option ( 102/200; 51 %). More than one third of the authors failed to report how the AMSTAR score was obtained ( 71/200; 36 %). In a subgroup analysis , we compared overviews of reviews ( n = 154) with the methodological publications ( n = 93). The overviews of reviews were much less likely to mention both limitations with respect to study designs ( if other studies other than RCTs were included in the reviews) ( RR 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.09 to 0.75) and overall score ( RR 0.08 , 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.35). Authors , peer reviewers , and editors should pay more attention to the correct use and reporting of assessment tools in evidence synthesis. Authors of overviews of reviews should ensure to have a methodological expert in their review team.
