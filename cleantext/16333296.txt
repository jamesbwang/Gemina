  The CD44 protein , as a predominant receptor for hyaluronan ( HA) , is highly expressed on the surface of multiple tumor cells. HA , as a targeting molecule for a CD44-contained delivery system , increases intracellular drug concentration in tumor tissue. However , due to the weak binding ability of hyaluronan oligosaccharide to CD44 , targeting for tumor drug delivery has been restricted. In this study , we first use a HA tetrasaccharide cluster as the target ligand to enhance the binding ability to CD44. A polyamidoamine ( PAMAM) dendrimer was modified by a HA tetrasaccharide cluster as a nonviral vector for small interfering RNA ( siRNA) delivery. The dendrimer/siRNA nanocomplexes increased the cellular uptake capacity of siRNA through the CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway , allowing the siRNA to successfully escape the endosome/lysosome. Compared with the control group , nanocomplexes effectively reduced the expression of GFP protein and mRNA in MDA-MB-231-GFP cells. This delivery system provides a foundation to increase the clinical applications of PAMAM nanomaterials.
