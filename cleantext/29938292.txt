  Aiming at a detailed understanding of the Li adsorption and insertion behavior on/into lithium titanate ( Li4Ti5O12 , LTO) , which is a promising anode material in Li-ion batteries , we have investigated the interaction of vapor deposited Li with LTO in the temperature range between 80 K and room temperature by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( ARXPS). The experiments were performed under ultrahigh vacuum ( UHV) conditions , and the presence of additional Li species was detected by the formation of Ti3 + in the Ti 2p core level signal due to charge transfer from adsorbed/inserted Li<symptom> to Ti. Even at 80 K most of the deposited Li diffuses into the bulk of LTO , reflecting the facile insertion and diffusion of Li into and in LTO. Deposition of up to 3 monolayers equivalent ( MLE) of Li at 80 K results in an increase in Li concentration in the surface region ( topmost 6 nm) , up to a stoichiometry of Li4 + xTi5O12 with x > 0.3 , and slightly lower values in the near-surface region ( topmost 1 nm). For higher Li doses , the amount of Li in the near-surface region , including adsorbed Li , increases more than the concentration in the underlying surface region. This is attributed to the blocking of diffusion channels by inserted Li at a stoichiometry of Li4 .3 Ti5O12 and above. Upon increasing the temperature , Li + starts to diffuse into the LTO bulk at temperatures between 120 K and 175 K , depending on the concentration in the surface region. It has completely disappeared at 260 K. The consequences of these results for the understanding of physical Li insertion will be discussed.
