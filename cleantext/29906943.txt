  We revisit the well-known problem of multiscaling in substances passively advected by homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows or passive scalar turbulence. To that end we propose a two-parameter continuum hydrodynamic model for an advected substance concentration θ , parametrized jointly by y and y ( over ¯) , that characterize the spatial scaling behavior of the variances of the advecting stochastic velocity and the stochastic additive driving force , respectively. We analyze it within a one-loop dynamic renormalization group method to calculate the multiscaling exponents of the equal-time structure functions of θ. We show how the interplay between the advective velocity and the additive force may lead to simple scaling or multiscaling. In one limit , our results reduce to the well-known results from the Kraichnan model for passive scalar. Our framework of analysis should be of help for analytical approaches for the still intractable problem of fluid turbulence itself.
