  DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 17 ( Dcaf17) is a member of DCAF family genes that encode substrate receptor proteins for Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases , which play critical roles in many cellular processes. To unravel the function of DCAF17 , we performed expression profiling of Dcaf17 in different tissues of wild type mouse by qRT-PCR and generated Dcaf17 knockout mice by gene targeting. Expression profiling of Dcaf17 showed highest expression in testis. Analyses of Dcaf17 transcripts during post-natal development of testis at different ages displayed gradual increase in Dcaf17 mRNA levels with the age. Although Dcaf17 disruption did not have any effect on female fertility , Dcaf17 deletion led to male infertility<symptom> due to abnormal sperm development. The Dcaf17
