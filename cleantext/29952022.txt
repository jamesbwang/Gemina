  The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC) is markedly increased in renal transplant recipients compared with that of the nontransplant population. To investigate whether there is a relationship between transplant rejection and cSCC. The Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer historical database was used to identify patients who had undergone a renal transplant at Duke University Hospital during a 20-year period. Data on patient demographics , transplant dates , first rejection episodes , first cSCC development , medication , laboratory results and survival were recorded. In total , 1684 patients were identified , of whom 126 ( 7.5 %) experienced an episode of rejection and 46 ( 4.0 %) developed a cSCC after transplant. The incidence of cSCC was significantly greater in the rejection group , with 8.7 % of patients developing cSCC compared with 2.2 % in the no-rejection group ( P < 0.001). Median lag time to cSCC was shorter in the rejection group ( 2.5 years; age 0.4-9.0 years) than the no-rejection group ( 4.2 years; range 1.3-20.4 years) ( P < 0.03). Transplant rejection is associated with both a higher incidence and an accelerated time course for development of cSCC following renal transplantation. Close dermatological surveillance should be considered following an episode of rejection in this patient population.
