  Over the past several decades , historians of science have come increasingly to focus on the role of so-called `` paper technologies , '' reorganizing and transforming information through the use of paper and pen , in the emergence of modern science. Taking as a case study an effort by administrators in the seventeenth-century German princely state of Saxe-Gotha to enlist foresters and herb-women to catalog the medicinal plants of the territory , this article analyzes the varied forms of paperwork produced in the process , including an extremely unusual table , and argues that the table represented an effort to produce a synoptic visualization , akin to but not identical to a map , of the location of the territory 's herbs. While this table may not have ultimately succeeded as a viable paper technology , due to problems of incommensurability , it demonstrates the role of administrative practices and state actors in experimenting with information about the natural world during the early modern period.
