  For 2D topological insulators with strong electron-hole hybridization , such as HgTe/CdTe quantum wells , the widely used 4 × 4 k · p Hamiltonian based on the first electron and heavy hole sub-bands yields an equal number of physical and spurious solutions , for both the bulk states and the edge states. For symmetric bands and zero wave vector parallel to the sample edge , the mid-gap bulk solutions are identical to the edge solutions. In all cases , the physical edge solution is exponentially localized to the boundary and has been shown previously to satisfy standard boundary conditions for the wave function and its derivative , even in the limit of an infinite wall potential. The same treatment is now extended to the case of narrow sample widths , where for each spin direction , a gap appears in the edge state dispersions. For widths greater than 200 nm , this gap is less than half of the value reported for open boundary conditions , which are called into question because they include a spurious wave function component. The gap in the edge state dispersions is also calculated for weakly hybridized quantum wells such as InAs/GaSb/AlSb. In contrast to the strongly hybridized case , the edge states at the zone center only have pure exponential character when the bands are symmetric and when the sample has certain characteristic width values.
