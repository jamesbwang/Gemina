  Input of biomass-derived biochar into soil is recognized as a promising method of carbon sequestration. The long-term sequestration effect of biochar depends on the stability of both its dissolvable and undissolvable fractions in soil , which could be affected by their interactions with soil minerals. Here , walnut shell-derived biochar was divided into dissolvable and undissolvable fractions and then interacted with kaolinite. Stability of kaolinite-biochar associations was evaluated by chemical oxidation and biological degradation. At low dissolvable biochar concentrations , the association was mainly attributed to `` Ca
