  It is unknown to what extent hypotension<symptom> frequently observed following administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia is caused by overdosing propofol. Unlike clinical signs , electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring allows to detect and quantify an overdose of hypnotics. Therefore , we tested whether the use of an electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring will cause less hypotension<symptom> following induction with propofol. Subjects were randomly assigned to a bispectral index ( BIS)- guided ( target range 40-60) or to a weight-related ( 2 mg.kg Of the 240 patients enrolled into this study , 235 predominantly non-geriatric ( median 48 years , 25th- 75th percentile 35-61 years) patients without severe concomitant disease ( 88 % American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1-2) undergoing ear , nose and throat<symptom> surgery , ophthalmic surgery , and dermatologic surgery were analyzed. Patients who were manually administered propofol guided by BIS ( n = 120) compared to those who were given propofol by weight ( n = 115) did not differ concerning the incidence of hypotension<symptom> ( 44 % vs. 45 %; p = 0.87). Study groups were also similar regarding the maximal drop in MAP compared to baseline ( 33 % vs. 30 %) and the proportion of hypotensive events related to all measurements ( 17 % vs. 19 %). Final propofol induction doses in BIS group and NON-BIS group were similar ( 1.93 mg/kg vs. 2 mg/kg). There was no linear correlation between BIS and the drop in MAP at all times ( r < 0.2 for all) except for a weak one at 6 min ( r = 0.221). Results of our study suggest that a BIS-guided compared to a weight-adjusted manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia in non-geriatric patients will not lower the incidence and degree of arterial hypotension<symptom>.
