  Adolescence is a peak time for uptake of both tobacco and marijuana ( dual use). This study aimed to identify clusters of lifetime tobacco and marijuana use patterns and associated risk factors , and to determine whether dual tobacco and marijuana use is uniquely associated with greater risk than use of either tobacco or marijuana alone. High school students participated in a survey during Fall 2014 ( N = 976; 68 % Hispanic; 57 % parental education < high school). Items from national youth surveys were used to measure lifetime and current use of tobacco products , marijuana , alcohol , drug use , and other risk behaviors , and literature-based surveys were used to measure psychological constructs. Latent Class Analysis identified three clusters of lifetime tobacco use patterns ( no tobacco , one or two products , and more than two products) , each with a correspondingly distinct profile of risk behaviors; risk escalated with use of more tobacco products. Multinomial modeling characterized personal , environmental , and behavioral correlates of dual lifetime tobacco and marijuana use , including lower parental monitoring , lower grades , higher guilt , higher lifetime alcohol and drug use , and more substance use by friends , in reference to single lifetime use of either tobacco or marijuana. Broader use of tobacco ( i.e. , more products) was associated with numerous risk factors. Dual lifetime use of tobacco and marijuana was associated with numerous risks compared to single use of either tobacco or marijuana. Longitudinal work is needed to understand temporal relationships between risk variables to determine optimal timing for interventions to reduce harmful behaviors.
