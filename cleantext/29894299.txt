  Background In order to effectively facilitate behavior change , it is essential to conduct health promotion programs on self-efficacy. Given the importance of the role of teachers in fostering the next generation , it appears that the promotion of self-efficacy in them can greatly contribute to the health of the community. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of a health promotion training workshop on self-efficacy for health practices and also , on general self-efficacy of teachers in schools. Methods This study was a quasi-experimental study , in which 120 teachers were selected by random sampling and randomly divided into two equal intervention and control groups ( 60 in each group). A health promotion training workshop was conducted for the intervention group. Data were collected by a three-section questionnaire ( demographic , self-rated ability for health practices scale and general self-efficacy) before and 1 month after the training intervention. Results The self-efficacy scores for health practices and general self-efficacy were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups before the intervention ( p > 0.05). However , participants in the intervention group reported higher scores on both the self-efficacy for health practices ( t = 4.05 , p = 0.001) and general self-efficacy ( t = 2.92 , p = 0.004) compared to those in the control group one month after the intervention. Conclusion The health promotion training program had improving effects on the self-efficacy for health practices and general self-efficacy. This program was potentially a valid community health nursing intervention that can be presented and evaluated in various community settings.
