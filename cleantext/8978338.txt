  Endoscopic inspection of colonic mucosa is disturbed by colonic folds and peristalsis , which may result in missed polyps. Cimetropium bromide , an antispasmodic agent , inhibits peristalsis and colonic spasms , which may improve polyp detection. The purpose of this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was to investigate whether cimetropium bromide could improve polyp and adenoma detection in the colorectum and right colon. Patients undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopy were randomized to receive intravenous cimetropium bromide ( 5 mg) or placebo after cecal intubation. The primary outcomes were the number of polyps per patient ( PPP) and adenomas per patient ( APP); secondary outcomes were the polyp detection rate ( PDR) , adenoma detection rate ( ADR) , and advanced neoplasm detection rate ( ANDR). A total of 181 patients were analyzed; 91 patients received cimetropium bromide and 90 patients received placebo. Cimetropium bromide and placebo groups did not significantly differ in the PPP and APP for the colorectum ( 1.38 ± 1.58 vs 1.69 ± 2.28 , P = .298; 0.96 ± 1.27 vs 1.11 ± 1.89 , P = .517 , respectively) and right colon ( 0.70 ± 0.95 vs 0.78 ± 1.21 , P = .645; 0.47 ± 0.81 vs 0.51 ± 0.81 , P = .757 , respectively). Two groups also did not significantly differ in the PDR , ADR , and ANDR for the colorectum and right colon. Furthermore , there were no difference between groups in the PPP , APP , PDR , ADR , and ADNR in a sub-analysis of expert and non-expert endoscopists. Cimetropium bromide did not improve polyp and adenoma detection in the colorectum and right colon during colonoscope withdrawal , regardless of the expertness of the endoscopist. However , its use may be helpful in patients with active peristalsis or for beginning endoscopists during standard colonoscopy without a transparent cap.
