  To investigate the effects of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) extracted from Porphyromonas<pathogen> endodontalis<pathogen> ( P.endodontalis) on expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1) mRNA and protein in MC3T3-E1 cells and the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) and nuclear factor-kB ( NF-kB ï¼‰ in the process. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with different concentrations of P.endodontalis LPS ( 0-50mg/ L) and 20 mg/L P.endodontalis LPS for different hours ( 0-48 h). The expression of MCP-1 mRNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR ( RT-PCR) and protein was detected by enzyme-1inked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). MC3T3-E1 cells were pretreated with SB203580 ( inhibitor of p38MAPK) and BAY11-7082 ( inhibitor of NF-kB) for 1h , and then were treated with 20 mg/L P.endodontalis LPS for 24 h , the expression of MCP-1 mRNA was also detected by RT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett t test with SPSS 13.0 software package. The level of MCP-1 mRNA and protein increased significantly after treatment with different concentrations of P.endodontalis LPS ( 0-50 mg/L) , which indicated that P.endodontalis LPS induced osteoblasts to express MCP-1 in a dose dependent manners. During the observation time ( 0-48 h) , the impact of 20 mg/L P.endodontalis LPS on induction of MCP-1 in MC3T3-E1 cells exhibited a time-dependent manner. The expression of MCP-1 mRNA decreased significantly after pretreated with 10 mol/L SB203580 and BAY11-7082 for 1 h , and the inhibitory effect of SB203580 was stronger than BAY11-7082. P.endodontalis LPS may induce the expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein in MC3T3-E1 cells through the signaling pathway of p38MAPK and NF-kB.
