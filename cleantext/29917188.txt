  To evaluate the lncRNA DUXAP8 expression in bladder cancer and its mechanism. Clinical specimens were analyzed. The expression of lncRNA in bladder cancer and adjacent tissues was detected using qRT-PCR. The Ï‡2-test analysis was used to analyze the relationship between lncRNA DUXAP8 expression and clinicopathological information in patients with bladder cancer. The tumor cell activity and cell proliferation were measured by cell counting kit-8 ( CCK8) and colony formation assay. We utilized polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) to access PTEN expression in bladder cancer and adjacent tissues. Pearson correlation analysis was utilized for evaluating the relationship between PTEN and lncRNA DUXAP8. Western blot was used for detecting protein expression. LncRNA DUXAP8 expression was higher in bladder cancer tissues; it was in a positive correlation with the TNM stage and tumor size , but negatively correlated with the total survival time. Knockdown of DUXAP8 decreased cell viability and cellular proliferation. Lower expression of PTEN gene was found in bladder cancer compared with that in adjacent tissues. Pearson correlation analysis showed that PTEN was negatively correlated with DUXAP8; knockdown of DUAP8 increased the expression of PTEN. Overexpressing DUAP8 increased protein level of PTEN , but decreased cell viability. Our results pointed out that lncRNA DUXAP8 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues , which can promote the progression of bladder cancer through inhibiting PTEN.
