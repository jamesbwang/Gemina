  In renal replacement therapy , different methods are available: hemodialysis ( HD) , peritoneal dialysis ( PD) , and kidney transplantation ( KTx). In addition , variants can be used: HD as a home HD or center HD , PD as a conventional PD or automated ( cycler) PD , KTx as a potentially short-term predictable living donation or conventional donor kidney donation. The patient and his familiar or caring environment must be informed accordingly. This means first of all: information about which procedures of kidney replacement therapy are possible and can be offered. Then the specific risks associated with each procedure should be elucidated ( e. g. HD and shunt bleeding , PD and peritonitis<disease> , KTx and infections/neoplasias). This necessarily includes a structured documentation of the educating center/doctor about the communicated information and decisions taken.
