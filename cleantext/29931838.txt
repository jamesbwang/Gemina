  Here , we present dual-dimensional microscopy that captures both two-dimensional ( 2-D) and light-field images of an in-vivo sample simultaneously , synthesizes an upsampled light-field image in real time , and visualizes it with a computational light-field display system in real time. Compared with conventional light-field microscopy , the additional 2-D image greatly enhances the lateral resolution at the native object plane up to the diffraction limit and compensates for the image degradation at the native object plane. The whole process from capturing to displaying is done in real time with the parallel computation algorithm , which enables the observation of the sample 's three-dimensional ( 3-D) movement and direct interaction with the in-vivo sample. We demonstrate a real-time 3-D interactive experiment with Caenorhabditis
