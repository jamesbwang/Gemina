  Chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) is the second most important winter crop which is consumed globally due to its high nutritional value. Chickpea as one of the leguminous crop is important in crop rotation with cereal crops like wheat and barley. The main constraints for chickpea production are abiotic stresses such as drought , salinity , and heat. Among these , drought is a major cause of the decline in chickpea production in worldwide. Studies conducted so far have provided a limited insight into different genetic pathways associated with drought tolerance/response. In this study , the leaf tissue from shoots apical meristem stage of drought tolerant ( ICC8261) and drought sensitive ( ICC283) genotypes were analysed using RNA sequencing to identify genes/pathways associated with drought tolerance/sensitivity in both genotypes. It was observed that genes related to ethylene response , MYB-related protein , xyloglucan endotransglycosylase , alkane hydroxylase MAH-like , BON-1 associated , peroxidase 3 , cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain , vignain and mitochondrial uncoupling were specifically up-regulated in the tolerant genotype whereas , same genes were down-regulated in sensitive genotype. The crosstalk between the different hormones and transcriptional factors involved in drought tolerance and sensitivity in both genotypes make them great candidates for future research.
