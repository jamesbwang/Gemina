  This study explores the relationships among anxiety<symptom> , sensitivity to sensory stimuli , and picky eating ( PE). An earlier study in 95 children ages 5-10 found that sensory sensitivity fully mediated the relationship between anxiety<symptom> and picky eating. We replicated this finding in a sample of 158 children , ages 8-17 , and in 813 young adult college students. As in the previous child sample , the relationship between anxiety<symptom> and picky eating appears to be mediated by sensory sensitivity. This relationship extends into adolescence and young adulthood and holds even in a sample of children with obsessive-compulsive-spectrum and anxiety<symptom> disorders. However , there may be developmental differences in the relationship between sensory sensitivity and PE; the magnitude of this relationship was significantly greater for children than young adults. Although there was a trend towards a stronger relationship in a subsample of young adults with high anxiety<symptom> , the effect was still smaller than that observed in children , suggesting that this difference is developmental and not completely driven by higher anxiety<symptom> in the child sample. Sensory sensitivity is a candidate mechanism of picky eating , although the cross-sectional nature of this study means that we can not address whether it is an etiological or maintaining mechanism , or both. Implications for behavioral treatment of picky eating in clinically anxious and non-clinical samples are discussed.
