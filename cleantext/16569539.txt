  Transmural acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) is associated with a high risk for ventricular arrhythmia before , during and after treatment. Consequently , it is recommended that patients diagnosed with transmural AMI be monitored in a cardiac care unit ( CCU) so life-threatening arrhythmias can be treated promptly. We examined the incidence and timing of in-hospital malignant ventricular arrhythmias , sudden cardiac or arrhythmic death ( SCD/AD) and resuscitation requirements in patients with transmural AMI recovering from percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) undertaken within 12 h of symptom onset and without antecedent thrombolysis. This was a retrospective cohort study using the Duisburg Heart Center ( Germany) cardiac patient registry. In total , 975 patients met the inclusion criteria. The composite endpoint was post-PCI ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia<symptom> , SCD/AD or requirement for resuscitation. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who met the composite endpoint with those who did not , recorded the timing of endpoint episodes , and used multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with the endpoint criteria. There was no significant difference in the length of CCU or hospital stay between the groups. In-hospital mortality was 6.5 % , and the composite endpoint was met in 7.4 % of cases. Malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred in 2.8 % of the patients , and SCD/AD occurred in 0.3 % of the cases. There was a biphasic temporal distribution of endpoint events; specifically , 76.7 % occurred < 96 h after symptom onset , and 12.6 % occurred 240-360 h after symptom onset. Multivariable regression analysis identified positive associations between an endpoint episode and the following: age ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.01-1.05) per year); left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) < 30 % ( OR 3.66 , 95 % CI 1.91-6.99); peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration ( OR 1.01 , 95 % CI 1.00-1.02 per 100 U/dl); leucocytosis ( OR 1.86 , 95 % CI 1.04-3.32) , and coronary thrombus ( OR 1.85 , 95 % CI 1.04-3.27). Most post-PCI malignant ventricular arrhythmias , SCD/AD and resuscitation episodes occurred within 96 h of transmural AMI ( 76.7 %). A substantial minority ( 12.6 %) of these events arose 240-360 h after symptom onset. Further study is needed to establish the influence of age , LVEF < 30 % , peak serum creatine phosphokinase concentration , leucocytosis and coronary thrombus on post-PCI outcomes after transmural AMI.
