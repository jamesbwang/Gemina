  In recent years , conservation biologists have raised awareness about the risk of ecological interference between massively introduced managed honeybees and the native wild bee fauna in protected natural areas. In this study , we surveyed wild bees and quantified their nectar and pollen foraging success in a rosemary Mediterranean scrubland in southern France , under different conditions of apiary size and proximity. We found that high-density beekeeping triggers foraging competition which depresses not only the occurrence ( -55 %) and nectar foraging success ( -50 %) of local wild bees but also nectar ( -44 %) and pollen ( -36 %) harvesting by the honeybees themselves. Overall , those competition effects spanned distances of 600-1.100 m around apiaries , i.e. covering 1.1-3.8 km
