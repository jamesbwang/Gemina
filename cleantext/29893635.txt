  In this article , I discuss how transnormativity can be disrupted by not exaggerating the physical aspects of medical transition and by engaging in conversations around consequential sources of tension within gender and sexual minority communities , namely linguistic understandings of trans and gendered racism within white , gay , cisgender communities toward trans communities of color. This study is based on qualitative interviews with six trans YouTubers; these interviews were complemented by analyses of these YouTubers ' videos and select comments on these videos. With this exploratory study , I aim to provide nuance to existing lesbian , gay , bisexual , and trans ( LGBT) YouTube literature through highlighting the experiences of nonbinary trans vloggers and trans vloggers of color , regardless of medical transition status , as well as contribute a transfeminist analysis to ongoing conversations around transnormativity within sociology , cultural and media studies , and queer and trans theory.
