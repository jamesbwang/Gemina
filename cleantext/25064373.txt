  The clinical comorbidity of alcohol dependence ( AD) and major depressive disorder ( MDD) is well established , whereas genetic factors influencing co-occurrence remain unclear. A recent study using polygenic risk scores ( PRS) calculated based on the first-wave Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD meta-analysis ( PGC-MDD1) suggests a modest shared genetic contribution to MDD and AD. Using a ( âˆ¼ 10 fold) larger discovery sample , we calculated PRS based on the second wave ( PGC-MDD2) of results , in a severe AD case-control target sample. We found significant associations between AD disease status and MDD-PRS derived from both PGC-MDD2 ( most informative P-threshold = 1.0 , P = 0.00063 , R = 0.533 %) and PGC-MDD1 ( P-threshold = 0.2 , P = 0.00014 , R = 0.663 %) meta-analyses; the larger discovery sample did not yield additional predictive power. In contrast , calculating PRS in a MDD target sample yielded increased power when using PGC-MDD2 ( P-threshold = 1.0 , P = 0.000038 , R = 1.34 %) versus PGC-MDD1 ( P-threshold = 1.0 , P = 0.0013 , R = 0.81 %). Furthermore , when calculating PGC-MDD2 PRS in a subsample of patients with AD recruited explicitly excluding comorbid MDD , significant associations were still found ( n = 331; P-threshold = 1.0 , P = 0.042 , R = 0.398 %). Meanwhile , in the subset of patients in which MDD was not the explicit exclusion criteria , PRS predicted more variance ( n = 999; P-threshold = 1.0 , P = 0.0003 , R = 0.693 %). Our findings replicate the reported genetic overlap between AD and MDD and also suggest the need for improved , rigorous phenotyping to identify true shared cross-disorder genetic factors. Larger target samples are needed to reduce noise and take advantage of increasing discovery sample size.
