  MicroRNAs are found throughout the genome and are processed by the microprocessor complex ( MPC) from longer precursors. Some precursor miRNAs overlap intron: exon junctions. These Splice site Overlapping microRNAs ( SO-miRNAs) are mostly located in coding genes. It has been intimated , in the rarer examples of SO-miRNAs in non-coding RNAs , that the competition between the spliceosome and the MPC modulates alternative splicing. However , the effect of this overlap on coding transcripts is unknown. Unexpectedly , we show that neither Drosha silencing nor SF3b1 silencing changed the inclusion ratio of SO-miRNA exons. Two SO-miRNAs , located in genes that code for basal membrane proteins , are known to inhibit proliferation in primary keratinocytes. These SO-miRNAs were upregulated during differentiation and the host mRNAs were downregulated , but again there was no change in inclusion ratio of the SO-miRNA exons. Interestingly , Drosha silencing increased nascent RNA density , on chromatin , downstream of SO-miRNA exons. Overall our data suggest a novel mechanism for regulating gene expression in which MPC-dependent cleavage of SO-miRNA exons could cause premature transcriptional termination of coding genes rather than affecting alternative splicing.
