  Induction of the chaperone Heat Shock<symptom> Protein 72 ( HSP72) through heat treatment , exercise , or overexpression improves glucose tolerance and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Less is known about HSP72 function in the liver where lipid accumulation can result in insulin resistance and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD). The purpose of this study was 1) to determine whether weekly in vivo heat treatment ( HT) induces hepatic HSP72 and improves glucose tolerance in rats fed a high-fat diet ( HFD) and 2) to determine the ability of HSP72 to protect against lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in primary hepatocytes. Male Wistar rats were fed a HFD for 15 weeks and were given weekly HT ( 41 ˚C , 20 min) or sham-treatments ( ST , 37 ˚C , 20 min) for the final 7 weeks. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were assessed , along with HSP72 induction and triglyceride storage in the skeletal muscle and liver. The effect of an acute<symptom> loss<symptom> of HSP72 in primary hepatocytes was examined via siRNA. Weekly in vivo HT improved glucose tolerance , elevated muscle and hepatic HSP72 protein content and reduced muscle triglyceride storage. In primary hepatocytes , mitochondrial morphology was changed and fatty acid oxidation was reduced in siHSP72-treated hepatocytes. Lipid accumulation following palmitate treatment was increased in siHSP72-treated hepatocytes. These data suggest that HT may improve systemic metabolism via induction of hepatic HSP72. Additionally , acute<symptom> loss<symptom> of HSP72 in primary hepatocytes impacts mitochondrial health as well as fat oxidation and storage. These findings suggest therapies targeting HSP72 in the liver may prevent NAFLD.
