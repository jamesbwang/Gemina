  The development of new strategies to attenuate exercise-induced muscle damage may be helpful for training regimens. The aim of this study was to determine whether a oral formulation of angiotensin Ang- ( 1-7) ( HPβCD/Ang- ( 1-7)) is effective to reduce pain , and muscle damage markers after eccentric-overload exercise. HPβCD ( Placebo) and HPβCD/Ang- ( 1-7) ( Ang- ( 1-7) group were treated for 7 days ( one capsule/day). The pain was measured by visual analogue scale , maximal strength ( MS) using force platform. Blood samples were collected for cytokines and creatine kinase ( CK) analysis. The Ang- ( 1-7)- treated group reported less pain immediately ( 3.46 ± 0.64 vs. placebo 3.80 ± 0.77 cm) and 24 h after exercise ( 3.07 ± 0.71 vs. 3.73 ± 0.58 cm placebo) and higher MS at 24 h ( 24 ± 12 N) and 48 h ( 30 ± 15 N) vs. placebo ( -8 ± 9 N and -10 ± 9 N). The CK for Ang- ( 1-7) ( 0.5 ± 0.1 and 0.9 ± 0.2 U/L) were lower at 48 and 72 h vs. placebo ( fold changes of 1.7 ± 0.5 and 1.5 ± 0.3 U/L). The TNF-α level was lower in the treated group post-exercise ( 38 ± 2.5 pg/ml) vs. placebo ( 45 ± 2.9 pg/ml) but no significant changes were observed for IL-6 and IL-10. Our data indicate that treatment with Ang- ( 1-7) may attenuate pain , some of the muscle damage markers and improves performance following eccentric exercise.
