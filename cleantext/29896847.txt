  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is associated with worse outcomes in high-surgical-risk patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR). However , it is unclear whether this relationship is apparent in lower-surgical-risk patients. We sought to analyze existing literature to assess whether or not advanced CKD is associated with increased mortality or a greater incidence of adverse events ( specifically major stroke , bleeding , and vascular complications). We searched PubMed and Embase ( 2008-2017) for relevant studies. Studies with < 1 year follow-up and those not evaluating advanced CKD or outcomes post-TAVR were excluded. Our co-primary endpoints were the incidence of short-term mortality ( defined as in-hospital or 30-day mortality) and long-term mortality ( 1 year). Our secondary endpoints included incidence of major stroke , life-threatening bleeding , and major vascular complications. Eleven observational studies with a total population of 10709 patients met the selection criteria. Among patients with CKD there was an increased risk of short- and long-term mortality in high-surgical-risk patients who underwent TAVR ( hazard ratio ( HR): 1.51 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.22-1.88 and HR: 1.56 , 95 % CI: 1.38-1.77 , respectively; P < 0.01). However , there was no association between CKD and mortality in low- to intermediate-risk patients ( HR: 1.35 , 95 % CI: 0.98-1.84 , P = 0.06 in short-term and HR: 1.08 , 95 % CI: 0.92-1.27 , P = 0.34 in long-term). In low- to intermediate-risk TAVR patients , advanced CKD is not associated with increased mortality or poorer safety outcomes. These findings should be factored into the clinical decision-making process regarding TAVR candidacy.
