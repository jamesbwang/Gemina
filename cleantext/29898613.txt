  One previously undescribed chromone ( S) -5-hydroxyl-2- ( 1-hydroxyethyl) -7-methylchromone ( 1) and one known analogue ( 2) , as well as four known sativene-type sesquiterpenoids bipolenins A C ( 3 5) , were isolated from cultures of the endophytic fungus Bipolaris eleusines. Their structure were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods and the data comparison with those reported in the literature. Compounds 1 and 2 showed weak inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> subsp. aureus<pathogen> with the inhibition rates of 56.3 ± 0.48 and 32 ± 1.27 % , respectively , at the concentration of 128 μg/mL.
