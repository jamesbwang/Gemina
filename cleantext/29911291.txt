  To evaluate the significance of perioperative changes in ankle-brachial index ( ABI) with regard to extremity-related outcome in non-diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia ( CLI) following revascularization. The study represents a subanalysis of the multicentric Registry of First-line Treatment in Patients with CLI ( CRITISCH). After exclusion of diabetic patients , conservative cases , and primary major amputation , 563 of 1200 CRITISCH patients ( mean age 74 ± 10.7 years) were analyzed. This population was divided into two groups regarding perioperative ABI changes ∆ + 0.15 ( Group 1) or ∆- 0.15 ( Group 2). Study endpoints were reintervention and major amputation during a mean follow-up of 14.6 ± 9 months. Logistic regression was performed in order to identify factors for ABI group affiliation. There were 279 patients in Group 1 ( 49.5 %) and 284 in Group 2 ( 51.5 %). ABI sensitivity and specificity regarding vessel patency were calculated to be 54 and 87 %. A preoperative ABI ≤ 0.4 ( odds ratio ( OR) 7.7) , patent vessels at discharge ( OR 12.2) , and secondary interventions ( OR 2.4) were identified as factors for Group 1 affiliation. Contrariwise , previous revascularization ( OR 0.6) , a glomerular filtration rate ≤ 15 ml/min/1 .73 m Failure of perioperative ABI improvement is associated with a higher probability for amputation and should be valued as prognostic factor in non-diabetic patients with CLI. Patients with no/marginal improvement in ABI after revascularization require close follow-up monitoring and may benefit from early reintervention.
