  Recently , the diastolic strain rate ( DSR) utilizing speckle-tracking echocardiography has been proposed as a novel parameter for left ventricular diastolic function. We aimed to present normal reference data for those in a large-sized , selected group of healthy individuals. The current study was a part of the Normal echOcardiogRaphic Measurements in KoreAn popuLation ( NORMAL) , a prospective nationwide survey from 23 centers in Korea. We analyzed 447 subjects ( age 48 Â± 15 years , 234 females) without any history of cardiovascular disease and presented the early and late DSRs ( SR Among the total subjects , the mean SR We present normal reference data of a novel parameter , DSR , in a large-sized selected group with healthy Korean subjects. Additionally , we present significant age-related changes both in SR
