  Programming cellular behavior using trigger-inducible gene switches is integral to synthetic biology. Although significant progress has been achieved in trigger-induced transgene expression , side-effect-free remote control of transgenes continues to challenge cell-based therapies. Here , utilizing a caffeine-binding single-domain antibody we establish a caffeine-inducible protein dimerization system , enabling synthetic transcription factors and cell-surface receptors that enable transgene expression in response to physiologically relevant concentrations of caffeine generated by routine intake of beverages such as tea and coffee. Coffee containing different caffeine concentrations dose-dependently and reversibly controlled transgene expression by designer cells with this caffeine-stimulated advanced regulators ( C-STAR) system. Type-2 diabetic mice implanted with microencapsulated , C-STAR-equipped cells for caffeine-sensitive expression of glucagon-like peptide 1 showed substantially improved glucose homeostasis after coffee consumption compared to untreated mice. Biopharmaceutical production control by caffeine , which is non-toxic , inexpensive and only present in specific beverages , is expected to improve patient compliance by integrating therapy with lifestyle.
