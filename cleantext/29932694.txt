  Discrete time crystals have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental studies but their potential applications have remained unexplored. A particular type of discrete time crystals , termed `` Majorana time crystals , '' is found to emerge in a periodically driven superconducting wire accommodating two different species of topological edge modes. It is further shown that one can manipulate different Majorana edge modes separated in the time lattice , giving rise to an unforeseen scenario for topologically protected gate operations mimicking braiding. The proposed protocol can also generate a magic state that is important for universal quantum computation. This study thus advances the quantum control in discrete time crystals and reveals their great potential arising from their time-domain properties.
