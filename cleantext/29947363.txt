  In light of the high affinity of Cu2 + for Alzheimer 's Aβ1-42 and its ability to subsequently catalyze the formation of radicals , we examine the effects of Cu2 + binding , Aβ oxidation , and an acidic environment on the conformational dynamics of the smallest Aβ1-42 oligomer , the Aβ1-42 dimer. Transition networks calculated from Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics ( H-REMD) simulations reveal that the decreased pH considerably increased the β-sheet content , whereas Cu2 + binding increased the exposed hydrophobic surface area , both of which can contribute to an increased oligomerization propensity and toxicity.
