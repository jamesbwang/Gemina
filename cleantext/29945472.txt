  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes after revision total hip arthroplasty ( THA) using fourth-generation ceramic-on-ceramic ( CoC) bearing surfaces. A total of 52 revision THAs ( 28 men and 19 women) using the fourth-generation CoC bearing surfaces were retrospectively evaluated. Both acetabular cup and femoral stem were revised in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 7.3 years ( range , 4.0-9.9 years). The clinical results with Harris hip score ( HHS) , Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC) , and radiologic outcomes were evaluated. At the final follow-up examination , the average HHS was 90.4 ( range , 67-100). The average WOMAC pain and physical function score were 2.8 ( range , 0-12) and 16.4 ( range , 0-42) , respectively. Complications were observed in 10 hips ( 19.2 %). However , there were no bearing surface-related complications , and no cases of dislocation and squeaking. Retroacetabular pelvic osteolysis without cup loosening was observed in one hip at the final follow-up. However , no hip showed radiographic signs of cup loosening , vertical or horizontal acetabular cup migrations , and changes of inclinations during the follow-up period. Our data showed that clinical and radiologic outcomes after revision THA using fourth-generation CoC bearing were favorable. Hence , revision THA with the use of CoC bearing surfaces can be preferentially considered. Further studies with long-term follow-up data are warranted.
