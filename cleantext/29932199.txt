  It is highly desired to design and develop highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein , we report the development of ultrafine PtCo alloy nanoparticle decorated one-dimensional Co nanowires grown on Ti mesh ( PtCo-Co/TiM). Owing to its favorable composition and structure , the PtCo-Co/TiM can deliver an ultrahigh current density of 46.5 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 70 mV in 1.0 M KOH , superior to recently reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. This catalyst also provides excellent long-term electrochemical durability with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 50 h.
