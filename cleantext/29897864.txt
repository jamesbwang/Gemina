  Neurons in the medullary reticular formation are involved in the control of postural and locomotor behaviors in all vertebrates. Reticulospinal neurons in this brain region provide one of the major descending projections to the spinal cord. Although neurons in the newt medullary reticular formation have been extensively studied using in vivo extracellular recordings , little is known of their intrinsic biophysical properties or of the underlying circuitry of this region. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices containing the rostromedial reticular formation ( rmRF) from adult male newts , we observed spontaneous miniature outward currents ( SMOCs) in approximately two-thirds of neurons. Although SMOCs superficially resembled inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( IPSCs) , they had slower rise-times and decay times than spontaneous IPSCs. SMOCs required intracellular Ca
