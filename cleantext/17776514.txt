  Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins ( HRGPs) are abundant cell wall components involved in mycorrhizal symbiosis , but little is known about their function in orchid mycorrhizal association. To gain further insight into the role of HRGPs in orchid symbiosis , the location and function of HRGPs were investigated during symbiotic germination of
