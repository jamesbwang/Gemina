  Human has greatly disturbed nitrogen ( N) cycles through the food production and consumption ( FPC) activities , which caused serious environmental consequences. A few studies address the pathways of N cycles to clarify the interrelationships between human activities and the altered N cycles , especially in terms of the spatial aspects of N flows , which are also influenced by natural factors. Here , we developed an integrated model to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of N flows within the FPC and applied it to the Chaohu Watershed from 1949 to 2012. We found that total N inputs into the FPC increased by 6-fold during 1949-2012 , while N inputs from chemical fertilizer had the largest increase , with an annual growth rate of 8.6 %. N generation in manure doubled , but the recycling rate decreased by 50 % in the study period. The total N losses increased from 17 to 130Gg-N/yr between 1949 and 2012. Annually , ~ 7 % of total N losses was discharged into surface water annually , which peaked at 9.5Gg-N/ yr during 1998-2003 , two times as that in the early 1980s when algae<pathogen> blooms first occurred in Chaohu lake. Spatially , around one-fifth of the catchment area was responsible for all of N losses to surface water. These intensive areas located in the eastern and southern-central regions , which were identified as the critical areas for priority N mitigation. This study provided a method to depict spatiotemporal patterns of regional N flows for identifying the critical sources and areas of N pollution for precision watershed management.
