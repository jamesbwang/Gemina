  The basal interstitial nucleus ( BIN) in the white matter of the vestibulocerebellum has been defined more than three decades ago , but has since been largely ignored. It is still unclear which neurotransmitters are being used by BIN neurons , how these neurons are connected to the rest of the brain and what their activity patterns look like. Here , we studied BIN neurons in a range of mammals , including macaque , human , rat , mouse , rabbit and ferret , using tracing , immunohistological and electrophysiological approaches. We show that BIN neurons are GABAergic and glycinergic , that in primates they also express the marker for cholinergic neurons choline acetyl transferase ( ChAT) , that they project with beaded fibers to the glomeruli in the granular layer of the ipsilateral floccular complex , and that they are driven by excitation from the ipsilateral and contralateral medio-dorsal medullary gigantocellular reticular formation. Systematic analysis of co-distribution of the inhibitory synapse marker VIAAT , labeled BIN axons and Golgi cell marker mGluR2 indicate that BIN axon terminals complement Golgi cell axon terminals in glomeruli , accounting for a considerable proportion ( > 20 %) of the inhibitory terminals in the granule cell layer of the floccular complex. Together , these data show that BIN neurons represent a novel and relevant inhibitory input to the part of the vestibulocerebellum that controls compensatory and smooth pursuit eye movements<symptom>.
