  Several articles have shown the inverse association between total testosterone ( TT) or sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG) and hepatic steatosis. No articles report associations of TT , SHBG , free testosterone ( FT) , and bioavailable testosterone ( BioT) with aspartate aminotransferase ( AST)/ alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) ratios. Therefore , we investigated the associations of TT , FT , BioT and SHBG with hepatic steatosis and AST/ALT ratios. A total of 218 men were enrolled. We diagnosed hepatic steatosis by ultrasound. TT and SHBG showed a reduced risk for hepatic steatosis when analyzed with or without adjusting for age , smoking , alcohol consumption and physical activity. Compared with the lowest quartile , the ORs for hepatic steatosis in the third and fourth quartiles ( 0.32 ( 95 % CI: 0.14-0.75) and 0.27 ( 95 % CI: 0.10-0.73) , respectively) of SHBG were significantly lower after adjustments. The OR for hepatic steatosis in the fourth quartile of TT ( 0.41 ( 95 % CI: 0.17-0.95)) was significantly lower than in the lowest quartile after adjustments. The mean AST/ALT ratios in men with hepatic steatosis were lower than those without hepatic steatosis ( 0.83 and 1.04 , respectively) , due to the elevated ALT levels in hepatic steatosis groups. Furthermore , TT and SHBG were positively associated with AST/ALT ratios with and without adjustments. In conclusion , higher TT and SHBG levels in men are associated with the reduced risk of hepatic steatosis and elevated AST/ALT ratios , independent of age , smoking , alcohol consumption and physical activity.
