  Camelina sativa ( false flax or gold-of-pleasure) is an Old World oilseed crop that fell out of use in the mid 20th Century but has recently gained renewed interest as a biofuel source. The crop is hexaploid , and its relationship to its diploid and polyploid congeners has remained unresolved. Using 54 accessions representing five species sampled across Camelina 's center of diversity in Turkey and the Caucasus , we performed phylogenetic and genetic diversity analyses using RADseq genotyping and ITS sequencing. Flow cytometry was performed to assess relationships between genome size and phylogenetic groupings. Accessions fell into distinct , highly-supported clades that accord with named species , indicating that morphological characters can reliably distinguish members of the genus. A phylogenetically distinct lineage from Turkey may represent a currently unrecognized diploid species. In most analyses , C. sativa accessions nest within those of C. microcarpa , suggesting that the crop is descended from this wild hexaploid species. This inference is further supported by their similar genome size , and by lower genetic diversity in C. sativa , which is consistent with a domestication bottleneck. These analyses provide the first definitive phylogeny of C. sativa and its wild relatives , and they point to C. microcarpa as the crop 's wild ancestor.
