  The aim of this randomized phase II study was to investigate the optimal timing of the administration of thrombopoietin to prevent cytarabine-induced thrombocytopenia<symptom>. Fifty-two patients who were scheduled for high-dose cytarabine treatment were randomly assigned to receive either the standard prophylactic mode ( starting thrombopoietin , 15,000 units/day on days 2-11) or the pre-chemo mode ( starting thrombopoietin , 15,000 units/day on days -4 , -2 , and 2-9) during the first cycle of chemotherapy with a switch to the other mode in the second cycle. The thrombocytopenia<symptom> rate in the standard mode and the pre-chemo mode were PLT < 50 Ã— 10 ChiCTR-OPB-15007591.
