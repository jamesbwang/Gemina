  For efficient manufacturing of fibrous collagen-based materials by electrospinning , the search on optimal rheological parameters is of the great importance. Rheological characteristics and denaturation of collagen in aqueous dispersions were studied as a function of shear rate and acetic acid concentration in the range of 3-9 % w/w at temperature from 20 to 40 °C. It was shown that an increase in temperature , acetic acid concentration of the collagen dispersion leads to a significant decrease in its viscosity. It was found that helical conformation of the collagen macromolecules is preserved up to 31 °C. An increase in acetic acid concentration leads to a reduction of denaturation temperature. The complex viscosity of collagen dispersions exhibits a sharp drop , followed by a rapid growth of damping factor in the temperature range from 22 to 35 °C. Both storage ( G ') and loss ( G '') moduli increase with frequency and collagen concentration. It was revealed that optimal parameters for electrospinning of highly concentrated collagen dispersions can be achieved by adjusting of the concentration of acetic acid , temperature and stirring speed. As a result , collagen nonwoven materials with diameter from 100 to 700 nm were obtained. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
