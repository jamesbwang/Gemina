  The relativistic Doppler effect is one of the most famous implications of the principles of special relativity and is intrinsic to moving radiation sources , relativistic optics and many astrophysical phenomena. It occurs in the case of a plasma sail accelerated to relativistic velocities by an external driver , such as an ultra-intense laser pulse. Here we show that the relativistic Doppler effect on the high energy synchrotron photon emission ( ~ 10 MeV) , strongly depends on two intrinsic properties of the plasma ( charge state and ion mass) and the transverse extent of the driver. When the moving plasma becomes relativistically transparent to the driver , we show that the γ-ray emission is Doppler-boosted and the angular emission decreases; optimal for the highest charge-to-mass ratio ion species ( i.e. a hydrogen plasma). This provides new fundamental insight into the generation of γ-rays in extreme conditions and informs related experiments using multi-petawatt laser facilities.
