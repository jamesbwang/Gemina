  Purpose To follow the evolution of intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) by using quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM). Materials and Methods Thirty-six patients with ICH confirmed at CT were enrolled to follow ICH evolution on day 2 , 7 , and 30 after symptom onset between August 2013 and April 2017. QSM was reconstructed from MRI gradient-echo phase images acquired at 1.5 T or 3.0 T. ICH regions were manually drawn on two-dimensional sections of co-registered CT and MR images independently by two raters. The ICH areas and mean values were compared between CT and MRI by using Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation. QSM time evolution of ICH was assessed by using paired t tests and was compared with conventional T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery , or T1-weighted or T2 *- weighted magnitude intensities. Results Significant reductions in ICH susceptibility were found between day 2 and day 7 ( P < .001) and between day 7 and day 30 ( P = .003) , corresponding to different disease stages. The ICH areas measured at CT and QSM were linearly correlated ( r
