  To determine the incidence and the factors associated with delirium<symptom> in intensive care unit patients. A cohort study conducted on 134 patients in the intensive care unit at a clinic in Bucaramanga , Colombia. , who were recruited in the first 24hours following admission and on whom the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale ( RASS) , PRE-DELIRIC version in Spanish , and Confusion<symptom> Assessment method for Intensive Care Unit ( CAM-ICU) were applied; the outcome was evaluated through daily monitoring with CAM-ICU. The incidence of delirium<symptom> was 20.2 % , the predominating type was hypoactive at 66.7 % , followed by the hyperactive type at 7.4 % and mixed at 25.9 %. Fifty-two percent of the patients with delirium<symptom> died. In the bivariate analysis , the use of sedatives ( Relative Risk ( RR) 2.4 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) = 1.2-4.5) , infection ( RR = 2. 8 , 95 % CI = 1.3-5.9) , metabolic acidosis ( RR = 4 3 , 95 % CI = 2.3-8.0) , mechanical ventilation ( RR = 4 6 , 95 % CI = 2.0-10.6) , aged over 60 years ( RR = 2 3 , 95 % CI = 1.09-5.3) and APACHE score greater than 14 ( RR = 3. 0) ( 95 % CI = 1.1-8.2) were identified as risk factors for delirium<symptom>. The multivariate analysis only found a relationship with infection ( RR = 3 8 , 95 % CI = 1.6-9.1) and being aged over 60 years ( RR = 3 2 , 95 % CI 1.2-8.3). delirium<symptom> is frequent in patients in the intensive care unit , especially the hypoactive type. Half of the patients with delirium<symptom> died. The main risk factors for delirium<symptom> are infection and being over 60 years age , therefore , delirium<symptom> prevention activities should focus on these critical patients.
