  A proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL) , which induces survival and migration signals and tumor growth , is commonly observed in breast cancer tissues but is not often expressed in breast cancer cells themselves. Here , we examined whether breast cancer cells induce APRIL secretion from neutrophils , which are frequently recruited into the breast tumor microenvironment. We found that breast cancer cells do stimulate neutrophils to secrete APRIL through their glycosaminoglycans. Breast cancer cells depleted of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans lose their ability to induce APRIL secretion from neutrophils , and heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate can induce secretion that is comparable to that of breast cancer cell-induced secretion. While stimulation of the RNA-activated protein kinase ( PKR) is sufficient to induce neutrophil APRIL secretion , both PKR and the toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) are required for breast cancer cell glycosaminoglycan-induced secretion as separate and specific inhibition of TLR4 or PKR completely prevents the process , suggesting that breast cancer cell glycosaminoglycans target neutrophil TLR4 and PKR to trigger APRIL secretion. Thus , apart from the putative role of cell surface heparan sulfate in binding APRIL that leads to cell growth , we demonstrate that heparan sulfate , as well as chondroitin sulfate plays a novel role in promoting neutrophil secretion of APRIL that could lead to further cell growth. We propose that breast cancer cells take advantage of the neutrophil recruitment to the tumor microenvironment through the dual role of heparan sulfate as cell surface receptor or docking molecule for APRIL and as a ligand that induces neutrophil APRIL secretion to promote their own growth.
