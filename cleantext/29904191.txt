  Prospective cohort study using the Rick Hansen SCI Registry ( RHSCIR) and retrospective medical chart review. To describe treatment patterns of in-patient anti-spasticity medication use following traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI) in acute and rehabilitation hospital settings in British Columbia , Canada. Quaternary trauma center , rehabilitation center. Individuals with traumatic SCI between 2005 and 2014 enrolled in the Vancouver RHSCIR site ( N = 917) were eligible for inclusion. Oral and injectable anti-spasticity medication use were the main outcome measures. In 769 participants , higher neurological level and injury severity were associated with in-patient anti-spasticity medication use ( p < 0.001 for both). Of individuals with cervical and thoracic injuries ( n = 589) , 37 % were prescribed anti-spasticity medication during hospital admission. Baclofen was the most commonly used first line oral therapy. Mean ( SD) and median time from injury to Baclofen initiation was 70 ( 69) and 50 days , respectively. The probability of having initiated an in-patient anti-spasticity medication was 55 % ( 95 % CI ( 49 , 60)) for individuals 6 months post-injury , and 71 % ( 95 % CI ( 62 , 79)) for individuals 12 months post-injury. At community discharge , the prevalence of oral and injectable anti-spasticity medication use was 26 and 5 %. Practice patterns of anti-spasticity medication use ( 2005-2009 vs. 2010-2014) have not changed significantly over time. This is the first large prospective cohort study of in-patient anti-spasticity medication use following traumatic SCI. Results from our study inform clinicians and individuals of `` real world '' anti-spasticity medication use among individuals with traumatic SCI and may help guide care for this population in the community.
