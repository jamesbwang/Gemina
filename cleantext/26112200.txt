  We aimed to determine the diagnostic yield and accuracy of coronary CT angiography ( CCTA) in patients referred for invasive coronary angiography ( ICA) based on clinical concern for coronary artery disease ( CAD) and an abnormal nuclear stress myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI) study. We enrolled 100 patients ( 84 male , mean age 59.6 ± 8.9 years) with an abnormal MPI study and subsequent referral for ICA. Each patient underwent CCTA prior to ICA. We analyzed the prevalence of potentially obstructive CAD ( ≥ 50 % stenosis) on CCTA and calculated the diagnostic accuracy of ≥ 50 % stenosis on CCTA for the detection of clinically significant CAD on ICA ( defined as any ≥ 70 % stenosis or ≥ 50 % left main stenosis). On CCTA , 54 patients had at least one ≥ 50 % stenosis. With ICA , 45 patients demonstrated clinically significant CAD. A positive CCTA had 100 % sensitivity and 84 % specificity with a 100 % negative predictive value and 83 % positive predictive value for clinically significant CAD on a per patient basis in MPI positive symptomatic patients. In conclusion , almost half ( 48 %) of patients with suspected CAD and an abnormal MPI study demonstrate no obstructive CAD on CCTA.
