  GCTB-related clonal aberrations occur in a background of epigenetic histone modifications ( especially , the G34 W mutation of H3F3A gene) that induce cytogenetic abnormalities. Clonal aberrations are closely linked to the aggressiveness of GCTB. The `` neoplastic '' mononuclear stromal cells in GCTB express fundamental RANKLs and various chemokines and cytokines associated with monocyte recruitment and `` reactive '' multinucleated giant cells ( osteoclastogenesis). The reciprocal and orchestrated actions between mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleated giant cells helps in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and tumor biology of GCTB. In the future , novel targets in the updated tumor biology and molecular pathogenesis of GCTB should be explored and scrutinized for the development of systemic therapy.
