  Community initiatives to promote physical activity in children are common , but evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited. The objective of this study is to examine the relationships between community programmes and policies and children 's physical activity in a large and diverse sample of US communities. Programmes and policies to promote children 's physical activity were assessed in 130 communities by key informant interviews , and physical activity behaviours were measured by self-report and parental report in samples of children in each community ( total n = 5138). Associations between composite indices of community programmes and policies and indicators of total and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were examined without and with adjustment for demographic factors. An index reflecting the 6-year history of the number of behaviour change strategies used in community programmes and policies was positively associated with children 's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. This association was attenuated with adjustment for demographic factors. Effect modification analyses found that the association was positive among non-Hispanic children but was negative for Hispanic children. Community initiatives to promote physical activity in children were positively associated with children 's physical activity in non-Hispanic children. Such initiatives were negatively associated with physical activity in Hispanic children , suggesting that future research should consider unique cultural factors when designing community initiatives to promote activity in this population sub-group.
