  Synapses are key structures in neural networks , and are involved in learning and memory in the central nervous system. Investigating synaptogenesis and synaptic aging is important in understanding neural development and neural degeneration in diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson 's disease. Our previous study found that synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation were harmonized with brain development and maturation. However , synaptic damage and loss in the aging cerebellum are not well understood. This study was designed to investigate the occurrence of synaptic aging in the cerebellum by observing the ultrastructural changes of dendritic spines and synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells of aging mice. Immunocytochemistry , DiI diolistic assays , and transmission electron microscopy were used to visualize the morphological characteristics of synaptic buttons , dendritic spines and synapses of Purkinje cells in mice at various ages. With synaptic aging in the cerebellum , dendritic spines and synaptic buttons were lost , and the synaptic ultrastructure was altered , including a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria in presynaptic termini and smaller thin specialized zones in pre- and post-synaptic membranes<symptom>. These findings confirm that synaptic morphology and function is disrupted in aging synapses , which may be an important pathological cause of neurodegenerative diseases.
