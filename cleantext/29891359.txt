  Î‘ reduction of pyrethroid efficacy has been recently recorded in Bactrocera oleae , the most destructive insect of olives. The resistance levels of field populations collected from Crete-Greece scaled up to 22-folds , compared to reference laboratory strains. Sequence analysis of the IIS4-IIS6 region of para sodium channel gene in a large number of resistant flies indicated that resistance may not be associated with target site mutations , in line with previous studies in other Tephritidae species. We analyzed the transcriptomic differences between two resistant populations versus an almost susceptible field population and two laboratory strains. A large number of genes was found to be significantly differentially transcribed across the pairwise comparisons. Interestingly , gene set analysis revealed that genes of the ` electron carrier activity ' GO group were enriched in one specific comparison , which might suggest a P450-mediated resistance mechanism. The up-regulation of several transcripts encoding detoxification enzymes was qPCR validated , focusing on transcripts coding for P450s. Of note , the expression of contig00436 and contig02103 , encoding CYP6 P450s , was significantly higher in all resistant populations , compared to susceptible ones. These results suggest that an increase in the amount of the CYP6 P450s might be an important mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in B. oleae.
