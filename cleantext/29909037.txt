  The present study was undertaken to evaluate the biosynthesis , molecular modeling and statistical optimization of xylanase production through Box-Behnken design by a mangrove associated actinobacterium Streptomyces<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> ( MAB3). Initially , the production of xylanase by the selected strain was carried through submerged fermentation using birchwood xylan as substrate. Further the xylanase production was statistically optimized through Box-Behnken design. It showed 5.30 fold increase of xylanase production by the isolate compared to ` one factor at a time approach ' in the presence of the basal medium containing birchwood xylan ( 2.0 % w/v) at pH 8.2 , temperature 46.5 Â°C , inoculum size of 2 % for 68 h. The analysis of variance ( ANOVA) revealed high coefficient of determination ( R
