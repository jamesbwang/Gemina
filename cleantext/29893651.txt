  This analytic autoethnography explores identity negotiation in on-air media personalities in West Texas by augmenting the author 's personal experience with the lived experiences of five other gay radio/television on-air personalities. Employing the communication of identity theory , results indicate conflicts between the personal and communal frames , the relational and communal frames , and the enactment frame with all other frames. Strategies used to help navigate these conflicts include employment of hegemonic masculinity norms , self-monitoring , and assimilation.
