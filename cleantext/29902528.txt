  The impact of cellular senescence during ageing is well established , however senescence is now recognised to play a role in a variety of age related and metabolic diseases , such as cancer , autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases. It is therefore crucial to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that control cellular senescence. In recent years our understanding of the intimate relationship between cell metabolism , cell signalling and cellular senescence has greatly improved. In this review we discuss the differing roles of glucose and protein metabolism in both senescent fibroblast and CD8
