  Production of doubled haploid ( DH) plants is an efficient tool in genetic and plant breeding programs; however , sweet pepper ( Capsicum annuum L.) is recalcitrant to microspore embryogenesis and DH production. Trying to break the barrier of DH production , three independent experiments were conducted on microspore embryogenesis of sweet pepper. In the first experiment , the effect of cold ( 4 °C) and heat ( 32 °C) pretreatments were investigated on microspore embryogenesis of three genotypes of sweet pepper including `` Inspiration F1 , '' `` Maratus F1 , '' and `` Magno F1 '' cultivars in a factorial design with three replications. Heat shock<symptom> ( 32 °C for 7 days) , applied to mannitol-starved anthers of `` Inspiration F1 , '' showed higher multinuclear microspore percent , number of multicellular structures , total embryos , cotyledonary embryos , and regenerants. In the second experiment , the effect of different concentrations of putrescine ( 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 5 mg l
