  Lead-free antimony-based mixed sulfide and iodide perovskite phases have recently been reported to be synthesized experimentally and to exhibit reasonable photovoltaic performance. Through a combination of experimental validation and computational analysis , we show no evidence of the formation of the mixed sulfide and iodide perovskite phase , MASbSI
