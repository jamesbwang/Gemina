  Genetic testing is the most reliable test for hereditary transthyretin related amyloidosis and should be performed in most cases of transthyretin amyloidosis ( ATTR). ATTR is a rare but fatal disease with heterogeneous phenotypes; therefore , the diagnosis is sometimes delayed. With increasing attention and broader recognition on early manifestations of ATTR as well as emerging treatments , appropriate diagnostic studies , including the transthyretin ( TTR) genetic test , to confirm the types and variants of ATTR are therefore fundamental to improve the prognosis. Genetic analyses with polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) methods confirm the presence of TTR point mutations much more quickly and safer than conventional methods such as southern blot. Herein , we demonstrate genetic confirmation of the ATTR Ala97Ser mutation , the most common endemic mutation in Taiwan. The protocol comprises four main steps: collecting whole blood specimen , DNA extraction , genetic analysis of all four TTR exons with PCR , and DNA sequencing.
