  Nerve impulses , previously proposed as manifestations of nonlinear acoustic pulses localized at the plasma membrane , can annihilate upon collision. However , whether annihilation of acoustic waves at interfaces takes place is unclear. We previously showed the propagation of nonlinear sound waves that propagate as solitary waves above a threshold ( super-threshold) excitation in a lipid monolayer near a phase transition. Here we investigate the interaction of these waves. Sound waves were excited mechanically via a piezo cantilever in a lipid monolayer at the air-water interface and their amplitude is reported before and after a collision. The compression amplitude was observed via FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer between donor and acceptor dyes , measured at fixed points along the propagation path in the lipid monolayer. We provide direct experimental evidence for the annihilation of two super-threshold interfacial pulses upon head-on collision in a lipid monolayer and conclude that sound waves propagating in a lipid interface can interact linearly , nonlinearly , or annihilate upon collision depending on the state of the system. Thus we show that the main characteristics of nerve impulses , i.e. solitary character , velocity , couplings , all-or-none behaviour , threshold and even annihilation are also demonstrated by nonlinear sound waves in a lipid monolayer , where they follow directly from the thermodynamic principles applied to an interface. As these principles are equally unavoidable in a nerve membrane , our observations strongly suggest that the underlying physical basis of action potentials and the observed nonlinear-pules is identical.
