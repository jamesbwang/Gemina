  Bacterial cellulose ( BC) is a water resistant and strong material for edible films. Previous studies have been conducted on edible films containing fruit purees , but not using BC. In this study , films with or without fruit ( mango or guava) purees were prepared using different ratios of nanofibrillated BC ( NFBC) to pectin. The addition of fruit purees increased water vapor permeability ( in about 13-18 times) , reduced tensile strength ( in more than 90 %) and modulus ( in about 99 %) , and increased elongation ( in about 13 times) , due to plasticizing effects of fruit sugars and matrix dilution by the purees. The partial or total replacement of pectin with NFBC resulted in improved physical properties , making the films stronger , stiffer , more resistant to water , and with enhanced barrier to water vapor. Fruit containing films based on pectin are suggested for sachets , whereas applications for food wrapping or coating may benefit from the use of NFBC.
