  Biofabrication processes can affect biological quality attributes of encapsulated cells within constructs. Currently , assessment of the fabricated constructs is performed offline by subjecting the constructs to destructive assays that require staining and sectioning. This drawback limits the translation of biofabrication processes to industrial practice. In this work , we investigate the dielectric response of viable cells encapsulated in bioprinted 3D hydrogel constructs to an applied alternating electric field as a label-free non-destructive monitoring approach. The relationship between β-dispersion parameters ( permittivity change-Δε , Cole-Cole slope factor-α , critical polarization frequency-f
