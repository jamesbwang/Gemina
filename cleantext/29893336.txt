  This study aimed at proving the ability of bismuth-nanoparticle ( Bi-np) in dose enhancement effect ( DEE) using the polymer gel dosimeter. Two different polymer gels , namely poly acrylamide gelatin tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium chloride ( PAGAT) and N-isopropylacrylamide ( NIPAM) gels were chosen for this study. The gels were doped with Bi-np particle with various concentrations of 0.5 mM , 1 mM , and 2.5 mM and were then irradiated with a CO-60 gamma radiation source of energy 1.25 MeV. Gel samples were analyzed by spectrophotometer. The dose enhancement factor ( DEF) was calculated for both gels for all concentrations of Bi-np particle. The higher DEF for PAGAT and NIPAM was calculated as 1.3415 and 1.1823 , respectively , for 0.5 mM concentration of Bi-np. From our results , we infer that 0.5 mM is the optimal concentration in polymer gel to obtain good DEEs in the energy range of 1.25 MeV.
