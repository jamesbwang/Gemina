  Tardiness in the operating room has been shown to decline in the day as a result of operational decisions on the day of surgery. This article studies nonoperating room anesthesia ( NORA) tardiness at the University of Vermont Medical Center in cases performed in the 2015 calendar year. Tardiness was measured by subtracting actual start times from extracted scheduled start times for each NORA services line. On average , tardiness in NORA sites increased as the day progressed , with the exception of diagnostic radiology. This is likely due to limited tactical and operational opportunities to improve workflow.
