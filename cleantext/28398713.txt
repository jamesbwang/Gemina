  Cancer theragnosis agents with both cancer diagnosis and therapy abilities would be the next generation of cancer treatment. Recently , nanomaterials with strong absorption in near-infrared ( NIR) region have been explored as promising cancer theragnosis agents for bio-imaging and photothermal therapy ( PTT). Herein , we reported the synthesis and application of a novel multifunctional theranostic nanoagent based on hyaluronan ( HA)- coated FeOOH@polypyrrole ( FeOOH@PPy) nanorods ( HA-FeOOH@PPy NRs) for photoacoustic imaging ( PAI)- guided PTT. The nanoparticles were intentionally designed with rod-like shape and conjugated with tumor-targeting ligands to enhance the accumulation and achieve the entire tumor distribution of nanoparticles. The prepared HA-FeOOH@PPy NRs showed excellent biocompatible and physiological stabilities in different media. Importantly , HA-FeOOH@PPy NRs exhibited strong NIR absorbance , remarkable photothermal conversion capability , and conversion stability. Furthermore , HA-FeOOH@PPy NRs could act as strong contrast agents to enhance PAI , conducting accurate locating of cancerous tissue , as well as precise guidance for PTT. The in vitro and in vivo photothermal anticancer activity results of the designed nanoparticles evidenced their promising potential in cancer treatment. The tumor-bearing mice completely recovered after 17 days of PTT treatment without obvious side effects. Thus , our work highlights the great potential of using HA-FeOOH@PPy NRs as a theranostic nanoplatform for cancer imaging-guided therapy.
