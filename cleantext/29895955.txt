  Clonal evolution drives tumor progression , chemoresistance and relapse in cancer. Little is known about clonal selection induced by therapeutic pressure in multiple myeloma. To address this issue , we performed large targeted sequencing of bone<disease> marrow plasma cells in 43 multiple myeloma patients at diagnosis and at relapse from exactly the same intensive treatment. The most frequently mutated genes at diagnosis were KRAS ( 35 %) , NRAS ( 28 %) , DIS3 ( 16 %) , BRAF , and LRP1B ( 12 % each). At relapse , the mutational burden was unchanged. Many of the mutations were present at the subclonal level at both time points , including driver ones. According to patients and mutations , we observed different scenarios: selection of a very rare subclone present at diagnosis , appearance , or disappearance of mutations , but also stability. Our data highlight that chemoresistance and relapse could be induced by newly acquired mutations in myeloma drivers but also by ( sub) clonal mutations preexisting to the treatment. Importantly , no specific mutation or rearrangement was observed at relapse , demonstrating that intensive treatment has a nonspecific effect on clonal selection in multiple myeloma. Finally , we identified 22 cases of biallelic event , including a double event deletion 17p/TP53mut.
