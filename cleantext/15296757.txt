  The human APOBEC3G protein is a cytidine deaminase that generates cytidine to deoxy-uridine mutations in single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) , and capable of restricting replication of HIV-1 by generating mutations in viral genome. The mechanism by which APOBEC3G specifically deaminates 5 '- CC motifs has remained elusive since structural studies have been hampered due to apparently weak ssDNA<pathogen> binding of the catalytic domain of APOBEC3G. We overcame the problem by generating a highly active variant with higher ssDNA<pathogen> affinity. Here , we present the crystal structure of this variant complexed with a ssDNA<pathogen> substrate at 1.86 Ã… resolution. This structure reveals atomic-level interactions by which APOBEC3G recognizes a functionally-relevant 5 '- TCCCA sequence. This complex also reveals a key role of W211 in substrate recognition , implicating a similar recognition in activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID) with a conserved tryptophan.
