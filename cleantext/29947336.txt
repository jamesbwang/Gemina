  Biomedical applications based on the magnetic properties of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( SPIONs) may be altered by the mechanical attachment or cellular uptake of these nanoparticles. When nanoparticles interact with living cells , they are captured and internalized into intracellular compartments. Consequently , the magnetic behavior of the nanoparticles is modified. In this paper , we investigated the change in the magnetic response of 14 nm magnetic nanoparticles ( Fe
