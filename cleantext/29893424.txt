  To investigate the biological functions and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA TNRC6C-AS1 in thyroid cancer ( TC). TNRC6C-AS1 , miR-129-5p , and UNC5B expression levels were investigated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. CCK-8 assay was conducted to determine cell proliferation , while transwell assay was for inspection of cell migration and invasion. Through bioinformatic analysis , the interactions among TNRC6C-AS1 , miR-129-5p , and UNC5B were predicted. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay confirmed the predicted target relationships. Tumor xenograft assay was applied to inspect the effect of TNRC6C-AS1 downregulation on TC development in vivo. TNRC6C-AS1 and UNC5B were overexpressed , while miR-129-5p was underexpressed in TC tissues and cells. TNRC6C-AS1/ UNC5B downregulation and miR-129-5p overexpression could suppress proliferation , migration , and invasion of TC cells as well as inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo. MiR-129-5p targeted TNRC6C-AS1 and UNC5B in TC cells; and UNC5B expression was downregulated by knocking down TNRC6C-AS1 , which competitively bound with miR-129-5p. Downregulation of TNRC6C-AS1 restrained TC development by knocking down UNC5B through upregulating the expression of miR-129-5p.
