  Thermal infrared imagery provides temperature information on target objects , and has been widely applied in non-destructive testing. However , thermal infrared imagery is not always able to display detailed textures of inspected objects , which hampers the understanding of geometric entities consisting of temperature information. Although some commercial software has been developed for 3D thermal model displays , the software requires the use of expensive specific thermal infrared sensors. This study proposes a cost-effective method for 3D thermal model reconstruction based on image-based modeling. Two smart phones and a low-cost thermal infrared camera are employed to acquire visible images and thermal images , respectively , that are fused for 3D thermal model reconstruction. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively reconstruct a 3D thermal model which extremely approximates its corresponding entity. The total computational time for the 3D thermal model reconstruction is intensive while generating dense points required for the creation of a geometric entity. Future work will improve the efficiency of the proposed method in order to expand its potential applications to in-time monitoring.
