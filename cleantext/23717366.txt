  The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between participation in youth sport and adolescent ⁻ parent attachment. A mixed-method explanatory sequential study design was applied. In the first phase , 648 adolescent athletes and non-athletes completed the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment ⁻ Revised ( IPPA ⁻ R). In the second phase , 15 adolescent athletes took part in semi-structured interviews. In the first , quantitative phase , three factors were predictors of adolescents & rsquo; attachment to parents and peers: trust , communication , and alienation. In the qualitative follow-up , three themes emerged: adolescents & rsquo; attachment to the sport; adolescent ⁻ parent attachment; adolescents & rsquo; thoughts about parents. The analysis of the adolescent ⁻ parent interpersonal relationship revealed that athlete adolescents & rsquo; relations and attachment to parents compared to non-athlete adolescents are more intensively expressed in all scales: trust , communication and alienation. Interviews with adolescent athletes revealed that parent ⁻ adolescent interpersonal relationship and attachment to parents is more important at the early period of sporting life , and becomes less appreciable or unwelcome when children gain sporting experience. The study indicated that the form and degree of parental involvement in children & rsquo; s sporting activities impacts the effectiveness of parent ⁻ athlete interpersonal relationships. The degree and the form of parental involvement in children & rsquo; s sports chosen by the parents are not always appropriate and encouraging , and they are not always supportive of adolescents & rsquo; opinions.
