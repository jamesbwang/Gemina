  Hydrogen-sulfide gas is a toxic , colorless gas with a pungent odor that occurs naturally as a decomposition by-product. It is critical to monitor the concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Multivariate optical computing ( MOC) is a method that can monitor analytes while minimizing responses to interferences. MOC is a technique by which an analogue calculation is performed entirely in the optical domain , which simplifies instrument design , prevents the drift of a calibration , and increases the strength and durability of spectroscopic instrumentation against physical perturbation when used for chemical detection and identification. This paper discusses the detection of hydrogen-sulfide gas in the ultraviolet ( UV) spectral region in the presence of interfering gaseous species. A laboratory spectroscopic measurement system was set up to acquire the UV spectra of H ₂ S and interference gas mixtures in high-pressure/high-temperature ( HPHT) conditions. These spectra were used to guide the design and fabrication of a multivariate optical element ( MOE) , which has an expected measurement relative accuracy of 3.3 % for H ₂ S , with a concentration in the range of 0 ⁻ 150 nmol/mL. An MOC validation system with the MOE was used to test three samples of H ₂ S and mercaptans mixtures under various pressures , and the relative accuracy of H ₂ S measurement was determined to be 8.05 %.
