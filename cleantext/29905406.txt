  2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid ( FDCA) has become an increasingly desirable platform chemical to replace terephthalic acid in the production of a variety of polymeric materials , including polyethylene terephthalate. FDCA can be produced by the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural ( HMF) , which can be derived from cellulosic biomass. Oxidation of HMF to FDCA is typically performed under basic conditions. Separation of FDCA is most easily accomplished by lowering the pH until FDCA is insoluble and filtering it from solution. In a large-scale process , this would lead to a high operating cost to purchase the required acid and base and to dispose of the resulting salt waste. In this study , electrochemical oxidation of HMF was carried out in acidic media by using a manganese oxide ( MnO
