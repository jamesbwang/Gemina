  Heavy parent digital technology use has been associated with suboptimal parent-child interactions and internalizing/externalizing child behavior , but directionality of associations is unclear. This study aims to investigate longitudinal bidirectional associations between parent technology use and child behavior , and understand whether this is mediated by parenting stress. Participants included 183 couples with a young child ( age 0-5 years , mean = 3.0 years) who completed surveys at baseline , 1 , 3 and 6 months. Cross-lagged structural equation models of parent technology interference during parent-child activities , parenting stress , and child externalizing and internalizing behavior were tested. Controlling for potential confounders , we found that across all time points ( 1) greater child externalizing behavior predicted greater technology interference , via greater parenting stress; and ( 2) technology interference often predicted greater externalizing behavior. Although associations between child internalizing behavior and technology interference were relatively weaker , bidirectional associations were more consistent for child withdrawal behaviors. Our results suggest bidirectional dynamics in which ( a) parents , stressed by their child 's difficult behavior , may then withdraw from parent-child interactions with technology and ( b) this higher technology use during parent-child interactions may influence externalizing and withdrawal behaviors over time.
