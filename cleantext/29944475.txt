  Slow participant recruitment impedes Alzheimer disease research progress. Although research suggests that direct involvement with potential participants supports enrollment , strategies for how best to engage potential participants are still unclear. This study explores whether community health fair ( HF) attendees who engage in a brief cognitive screen ( BCS) are more likely to enroll in research than attendees who do not complete a BCS. A total of 483 HF attendees. Attendees were tracked for a 1-year period to ascertain research involvement. In total , 364 attendees expressed interest in research and 126 completed a BCS. Over the follow-up period , 21 individuals prescreened as eligible and 19 enrolled in an investigational study. Among all HF attendees , BCS completers had a 2.5-fold increase in subsequently prescreening as eligible as compared with non-BCS completers. However , when limited only to participants who stated an interest in research , this difference was no longer significant. Completing a BCS at a community event may be an indicator of future research engagement , but for those already interested in participation , the BCS may be a poor indicator of future involvement. The BCS may also reduce anxiety<symptom> and stigma around memory evaluation , which may translate into research engagement in the future.
