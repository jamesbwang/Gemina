  The SNF1-related protein kinase 1 ( SnRK1) is a heterotrimeric eukaryotic kinase that interacts with diverse proteins and regulates their activity in response to starvation and stress signals. Recently , the FCS-like zinc finger ( FLZ) proteins were identified as a potential scaffold for SnRK1 in plants. However , the evolutionary and mechanistic aspect of this complex formation is currently unknown. Here , in silico analyses predicted that FLZ proteins possess conserved intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs) with a propensity for protein binding in the N and C termini across the plant lineage. We observed that the Arabidopsis FLZ proteins promiscuously interact with SnRK1 subunits , which formed different isoenzyme complexes. The FLZ domain was essential for mediating the interaction with SnRK1α subunits , whereas the IDRs in the N termini facilitated interactions with the β and βγ subunits of SnRK1. Furthermore , the IDRs in the N termini were important for mediating dimerization of different FLZ proteins. Of note , the interaction of FLZ with SnRK1 was confined to cytoplasmic foci which colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. An evolutionary analysis revealed that in general , the IDR-rich regions are under more relaxed selection than the FLZ domain. In summary , the findings in our study reveal the structural details , origin , and evolution of a land plant-specific scaffold of SnRK1 formed by the coordinated actions of IDRs and structured regions in the FLZ proteins. We propose that the FLZ protein complex might be involved in providing flexibility and hence enhance the binding repertoire of the SnRK1 hub in land plants.
