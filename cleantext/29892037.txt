  The partitioning of glucose toward glycolytic end products rather than glucose oxidation and glycogen storage is evident in skeletal muscle with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the present study was to determine the possible mechanism by which severe obesity alters insulin-mediated glucose partitioning in human skeletal muscle. Primary human skeletal muscle cells ( HSkMC) were isolated from lean ( BMI = 23.6 Â± 2.6 kg/m Myotubes derived from severely obese subjects exhibited attenuated response of glycogen synthesis ( 20.3 %; 95 % CI ( 4.7 , 28.8); P = 0.017) and glucose oxidation ( 5.6 %; 95 % CI ( 0.3 , 8.6); P = 0.046) with a concomitant greater increase ( 23.8 %; 95 % CI ( 5.7 , 47.8); P = 0.004) in non-oxidized glycolytic end products with insulin stimulation in comparison to the lean group ( 34.2 % ( 24.9 , 45.1); 13.1 % ( 8.6 , 16.4) , and 2.9 % ( -4.1 , 12.2) , respectively). These obesity-related alterations in glucose partitioning appeared to be linked with reduced TCA cycle flux , as 2- ( These data suggest that with severe obesity the partitioning of glucose toward anaerobic glycolysis in response to insulin is a resilient characteristic of human skeletal muscle. This altered glucose partitioning appeared to be due , at least in part , to a reduction in TCA cycle flux.
