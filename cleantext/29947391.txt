  A new aryl-imido polyoxometalate non-linear optical chromophore ( POMophore) with a diphenylamino donor group attains the highest βzzz , 0 value ( 196 × 10-30 esu by Hyper-Rayleigh Scattering , HRS) , and best transparency/non-linearity trade off yet for such materials. Stark spectroscopic and DFT investigation of this compound , plus NMe2 and carbazole analogues , show that its high performance results from a combination of strongly dipolar electronic transitions , and strong electronic communication across the π-system.
