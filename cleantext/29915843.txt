  Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the orientation and temperature dependence of tensile response in single crystal W. It is found that W single crystal exhibits distinct temperature-dependent deformation behaviors along different orientations. With increasing temperature , the yield strain in the ( 001) orientation increases , while those in ( 110) and ( 111) orientations first increase and then decrease. The tensile deformations along orientations close to ( 001) are found to be dominated by twinning; the nucleation and growth of twins are accomplished through the nucleation and glide of ⅙ 111 partial dislocations on ( 112) planes. In contrast , the deformations along orientations close to ( 110) and ( 111) are found to be dominated by the slip of 1/2 111 full dislocations , which move in a stay-and-go fashion. Moreover , intermediate deformation behaviors , which may become unstable at high temperatures , are observed for some intervening orientations. The distinct deformation behaviors of W along different orientations are rationalized based on the twinning-antitwinning asymmetry of ⅙ 111 partial dislocations on ( 112) planes.
