  Molecular bases of blood group systems , including Rh blood group , have been poorly studied in the Indian population so far , while specificities of Europeans , East Asians and Africans have been well known for years. In order to gain insights into the molecular bases of this population , we sought to characterize the None None Overall we report for the first time the molecular bases of D antigen negativity in the D- , C/E + Indian population , which appears to be qualitatively similar to other populations , but with a population-specific , quantitative distribution of
