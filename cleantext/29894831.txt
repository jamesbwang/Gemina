  Chitosan-stabilized selenium nanoparticles ( CTS-SeNPs) were prepared through the reduction of selenite acid with ascorbic acid. The optimal synthesis conditions of CTS-SeNPs were obtained by orthogonal experiments. Besides , the size , morphology and stability of CTS-SeNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM) and dynamic light scattering ( DLS). The results showed that , the CTS-SeNPs with diameter of about 54 nm could be obtained under the optimal conditions ( temperature of 25 °C , reaction time of 2 h , Vc concentration of 0.04 M and the CTS concentration of 1.0 mg/mL). CTS-SeNPs were uniform spherical and could be stable for approximately 60 days at 4 °C. Further , the antidiabetic activities of CTS-SeNPs in streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic mice were investigated as well. The results revealed that CTS-SeNPs at a dose of 2.0 mg Se/kg bw exhibited higher antidiabetic activity than other doses of CTS-SeNPs and other selenium compounds with the same selenium content.
