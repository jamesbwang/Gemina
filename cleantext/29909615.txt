  Biophysical parameters can accelerate drug development; e.g. , rigid ligands may reduce entropic penalty and improve binding affinity. We studied systematically the impact of ligand rigidification on thermodynamics using a series of fasudil derivatives inhibiting protein kinase A by crystallography , isothermal titration calorimetry , nuclear magnetic resonance , and molecular dynamics simulations. The ligands varied in their internal degrees of freedom but conserve the number of heteroatoms. Counterintuitively , the most flexible ligand displays the entropically most favored binding. As experiment shows , this can not be explained by higher residual flexibility of ligand , protein , or formed complex nor by a deviating or increased release of water molecules upon complex formation. NMR and crystal structures show no differences in flexibility and water release , although strong ligand-induced adaptations are observed. Instead , the flexible ligand entraps more efficiently water molecules in solution prior to protein binding , and by release of these waters , the favored entropic binding is observed.
