  Three-dimensional printing is being steadily deployed as manufacturing technology for the development of personalized pharmaceutical dosage forms. In the present study , we developed a hollow pH-responsive 3D printed tablet encapsulating drug loaded non-coated and chitosan-coated alginate beads for the targeted colonic delivery of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU). A mixture of Eudragit ® L100-55 and Eudragit ® S100 was fabricated by means of hot-melt extrusion ( HME) and the produced filaments were printed utilizing a fused deposition modeling ( FDM) 3D printer to form the pH-responsive layer of the tablet with the rest comprising of a water-insoluble poly-lactic acid ( PLA) layer. The filaments and alginate particles were characterized for their physicochemical properties ( thermogravimetric analysis , differential scanning calorimetry , X-ray diffraction) , their surface topography was visualized by scanning electron microscopy and the filaments ' mechanical properties were assessed by instrumented indentation testing and tensile testing. The optimized filament formulation was 3D printed and the structural integrity of the hollow tablet in increasing pH media ( pH 1.2 to pH 7.4) was assessed by means of time-lapsed microfocus computed tomography ( μCT). In vitro release studies demonstrated controlled release of 5-FU from the alginate beads encapsulated within the hollow pH-sensitive tablet matrix at pH values corresponding to the colonic environment ( pH 7.4). The present study highlights the potential of additive manufacturing in fabricating controlled-release dosage forms rendering them pertinent formulations for further in vivo evaluation.
