  Recently , noncoding RNAs have been thought to play important roles in the sporadic occurrence of spinal deformity of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS). As a prognostic factor for curve progression , low bone mass has been hypothesized to crosstalk with AIS pathogenesis. Abnormal osteoblasts activities are reported in AIS without a clear mechanism. In this study , bone biopsies from patients with AIS and control subjects and the primary osteoblasts derived from those samples were used to identify the potential microRNA ( miRNA) candidates that interfere with osteoblasts and osteocytes function. Microarray analysis identified miRNA-145-5p ( miR-145) as a potential upstream regulator. miR-145 and β-catenin mRNA ( CTNNB1) were overexpressed in AIS bone tissues and primary osteoblasts , and their expression correlated positively in AIS. Knockdown of miR-145 restored impaired osteocyte activity through the down-regulation of active β-catenin expression and its transcriptional activity. Significant negative correlations between circulating miR-145 and serum sclerostin , osteopontin , and osteoprotegerin were noted in patients with AIS , which was in line with our cellular findings. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of aberrant miRNA expression and its effect on osteocyte function in AIS , which may contribute to the low bone mass. Our findings also provide insight into the development of circulating microRNAs as a bone quality biomarker or even a prognostic biomarker for AIS.-Zhang , J. , Chen , H. , Leung , R.
