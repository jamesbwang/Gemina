  DNA metabarcoding has been introduced as a revolutionary way to identify organisms and monitor ecosystems. However , the potential of this approach for biomonitoring remains partially unfulfilled because a significant part of the sampled DNA can not be affiliated to species due to incomplete reference libraries. Thus , biotic indices , which are based on the estimated abundances of species in a community and their ecological profiles , can be inaccurate. We propose to compute biotic indices using phylogenetic imputation of operational taxonomic units ( OTUs ') ecological profiles ( OTU-PITI approach). First , OTUs sequences are inserted within a reference phylogeny. Second , OTUs ' ecological profiles are estimated on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships with reference species whose ecology is known. Based on these ecological profiles , biotic indices can be computed using all available OTUs. Using freshwater diatoms as a case study , we show that short DNA barcodes can be placed accurately within a phylogeny and their ecological preferences estimated with a satisfactory level of precision. In the light of these results , we tested the approach with a data set of 139 environmental samples of benthic river diatoms for which the same biotic index ( specific sensitivity index) was calculated using ( a) traditional microscopy , ( b) OTUs with taxonomic assignment approach , ( c) OTUs with phylogenetic estimation of ecological profiles ( OTU-PITI) and ( d) OTU with taxonomic assignment completed by the phylogenetic approach ( OTU-PITI) for unclassified OTUs. Using traditional microscopy as a reference , we found that the combination of the OTUs ' taxonomic assignment completed by the phylogenetic method performed satisfactorily and substantially better than the other methods tested.
