  Background X-ray tube voltage ( kVp) reduction increases intravenous contrast medium ( CM) attenuation at computed tomography ( CT) , but tube output limits its use in large patients. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and image quality of reducing CM dose by low kVp and using dual X-ray source at liver CT.. Material and Methods Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 45 mL/min ( n = 43) aged 60-91 years ( 75 ± 7.7) , weighing 42-114 kg ( 75 ± 15) were prospectively scanned using a reduced CM dose of 0.25 or 0.3 g iodine ( I)/ kg with 70 or 80 kVp respectively , using either single-source or dual-source CT depending on patient size. Liver contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR) , liver noise , and muscle noise were quantitatively compared with those of 43 consecutive patients aged > 65 years with eGFR > 45 mL/min scanned using a standard abdominal protocol at 120 kVp after receiving 0.5 gI/kg. Results There was no statistically significant difference in CNR , liver noise , or muscle noise at reduced CM protocols compared to the standard protocol: CNR was 4.6 ( 95 % CI = 4.2-5.0) vs. 5.0 ( 95 % CI = 4.5-5.5) , liver noise was 11.1 ( 95 % CI = 10.7-11.6) vs. 11.0 ( 95 % CI = 10.5-11.6) , muscle noise was 11.7 ( 95 % CI = 11.2-12.1) vs. 10.8 ( 95 % CI = 10.1-11.4). The mean SSDE was 70 % higher with the reduced CM protocol. Conclusion CM dosage can be reduced by 40-50 % with maintained measured noise and CNR in patients with BMIs of 15-36 kg/m
