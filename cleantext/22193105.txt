  The ever-increasing demand for flexible electronics calls for the development of low-voltage and high-mobility organic thin-film transistors ( OTFTs) that can be integrated into emerging display and labeling technologies. Polymer dielectrics with comprehensive and balanced dielectric properties ( i.e. , a good balance<symptom> between their insulating characteristics and compatibility with organic semiconductors) are considered particularly important for this end. Here , we introduce a simple but highly efficient strategy to realize this target by using a new type of copolymer as dielectrics. Benefiting from both high chain packing density guaranteeing dielectric properties and surface polarity optimizing molecular packing of organic semiconductors , this rationally designed copolymer dielectric endows flexible OTFTs with high mobility ( 5.6 cm
