  To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs) and its mechanism in osteoblast mineralization. Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , Northern Blot , and Western Blot were used to identify the expression mode of regulators. Overexpression and down-regulation experiments were carried out to study the role of miR-98 and interactions between regulators. Bioinformatics calculation and luciferase reporter assay were used to prove the target gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( CHIP) , and promoter luciferase reporter assay confirmed the relationship between the regulator and the promoter of miR-98. MiR-98 was up-regulated during osteoblast mineralization. Overexpression of miR-98 promoted osteoblast mineralization. Factor inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 ( ATF4)- mediated transcription ( FIAT) , a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation , was confirmed to be a target of miR-98. As a motivator in osteoblast mineralization , Sp7 transcription factor 7 ( Sp7) promoted miR-98 transcription by a combination on the promoter region. Our study showed that miR-98 was an important regulator in osteoblast mineralization and miR-98 carried out its function through a novel miR-98-FIAT/ Sp7 regulatory loop. It provides new insights into the roles of miRNAs in osteoblast mineralization.
