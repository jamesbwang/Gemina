  Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is a major cause of neonatal morbidity. It generates primary neuronal damage of the neonatal brain and later secondary damage when reperfusion of the ischemic brain tissue causes a surge of oxygen free radicals and inflammation<symptom>. This post-hypoxic-ischemic brain damage is a leading cause of motor and intellectual disabilities in survivors. Research worldwide has focused on mitigating this injury. Mild or moderate hypothermia<symptom> is the standard treatment in many centers. However , its benefit is modest and the search for combinatorial effective neuroprotectants continues. This review focuses on xenon as one such agent. The use of mild to moderate hypothermia<symptom> is reviewed first. Then promising results on the use of xenon to potentiate the effect of hypothermia<symptom> in in vitro and in vivo animal experiments are discussed. In the first feasibility study on human neonates , researchers found a significant benefit of using 50 % xenon for 18 hours in addition to 72 hours of hypothermia<symptom>. Yet , this additional benefit of xenon was lacking in a larger cohort study , potentially because xenon was used beyond six hours of birth. The future of using xenon is promising , but further clinical studies are awaited to confirm the feasibility of its routine use and its optimal timing , concentration , and duration , for human neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.
