  Compare haptic exploratory procedures ( EPs) and exploratory movements ( EMs) of children. This study also tested the interrater reliability of a novel digital recording method. Participants were 31 children with typical development ( TD) ( aged 6 years 1 month to 15 years 9 months; 14 male) and 23 children with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy ( CP) ( aged 6 years to 15 years 5 months; 13 males; right hemiplegia , n = 12). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for expected EP ( p = .15) , additional EPs ( p = .78) , or EMs ( p = .69) but there was for mean duration of exploration ( p < .001) and accuracy ( p < .001). This suggests that although children with CP performed similar haptic EPs for each object as children with TD , they took more time and were less accurate in their identification. There was substantial agreement between the two raters ' observations of expected EP , Îº = .64 , p < .0005. Children with CP performed similar haptic EPs as their TD peers. However , despite similarities , the results indicate that for children with CP manual ability was not the primary determinant of accuracy or speed of identification. This study provides evidence for a reliable method of recording haptic EPs.
