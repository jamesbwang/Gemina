  The above article , published by the British Journal of Pharmacology in October 2015 ( https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13259) , has been retracted by agreement between the authors , the journal Editor in Chief and John Wiley & Sons Limited. The retraction has been agreed owing to the discovery of errors in the chemical structure of the synthetic compounds generated. The corrected structure is now available in the article PF-06526290 can both enhance and inhibit conduction through voltage gated sodium channels by L Wang , SG Zellmer , DM Printzenhoff and NA Castle , 2018 , https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.14338.
