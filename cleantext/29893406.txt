  Methotrexate may be an alternative to ciclosporin in the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis<disease> ( cAD) as suggested by recent data. The aim of the study was to investigate both the tolerance and the pharmacokinetic behavior of methotrexate ( MTX) in plasma , following intravenous ( i.v.) , subcutaneous ( s.c.) or oral ( OR) administration over several weeks. Six healthy dogs were given oral MTX once a week , respectively , per dog at 2.5 mg/1 week , 5 mg/4 weeks , 7.5 mg/3 weeks , 10 mg/6 weeks and 12.5 mg/5 weeks. No clinically relevant abnormalities of laboratory parameters were noticed. A high inter-individual variation of MTX plasma concentration was observed with a suspicion of saturation phenomenon in absorption. To compare with other routes of administration , six healthy beagle dogs followed a crossover design study at 7.5 mg per dog MTX. The absolute bioavailability was 93 % for SC injection and 30 % for the oral route. The inter-individual variability was quite low following SC administration compared to oral route. Just as in human , given the substantial variability of oral absorption , clinicians can not assume consistent oral bioavailability of MTX. Therefore , they may consider switching dogs to the SC route in case of absence of clinical response with a weekly oral dose.
