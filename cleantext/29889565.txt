  Food addiction has become a popular notion in the media and scientific community , with many proposing that an addiction to food causes obesity. An article published in this journal in December 2017 by Tompkins et al. asserted that food addiction poses a barrier to the treatment of adolescent obesity. This review questions some of the methods , results , and perspectives offered by Tompkins et al.. It also considers the extant evidence overall about this construct. The data about food addiction provide minimal support for the discriminant validity of this conceptualization relative to depressed binge eating. We believe that the evidence suggests that the potential harm outweighs the benefits of encouraging researchers , clinicians , and especially obese people to view food addiction as a cause of obesity or a barrier to effective weight management. Ultimately , this review concludes that the construct of food addiction does not serve the interests of those striving to lose weight permanently ( i.e. , weight controllers) nearly as well as an alternative perspective: weight controllers are athletes , not food addicts.
