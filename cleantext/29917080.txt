  Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials ( LDAEP) is a widely used electroencephalography ( EEG) based biomarker for central serotonergic activity. Serotonin has been shown to be associated with different psychiatric disorders such as depression<symptom> and schizophrenia. Despite its clinical significance , the underlying neurochemical mechanism of this promising marker is not fully understood and further research is needed to improve its validity. Other neurotransmitters might have a significant impact on this measure. Thus , we assessed the inhibitory action through individual GABA/H20 concentrations and GABA/Glutamate ratios by means of MRS at 3T in healthy subjects. The measurements were assessed in the primary auditory cortex in order to investigate the association with the LDAEP , whose generators are mainly in the primary auditory cortex. For the first time , this study examines the link between GABAergic neurotransmission and LDAEP , and the data preliminary show that GABA may not contribute to the generation of EEG-based LDAEP.
