  The study aimed to assess the effect of fur-bearing pets , including cats and dogs , on the health of individuals with allergic conditions. The study group comprised 18,617 individuals ( 16,562 from urban and 2,055 from rural areas). The tool used in the study was the European Community Respiratory Health Survey ( ECRHS) and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC) study questionnaire , adapted to European conditions ( Middle and Eastern Europe) and used as part of the study Implementation of a System for the Prevention and Early Detection of Allergic Diseases in Poland. The factors determining the keeping of fur-bearing pets in a household included a larger living space and the number of cigarettes smoked , which were observed especially in urban settings. The keeping of fur-bearing animals in rural areas acts preventively against allergic conditions , while in urban areas , these animals were a factor clearly aggravating symptoms of bronchial asthma- the risk of cough<symptom> ( OR 1.921; CI 10-3.36; P = 0.02) and wheezing ( OR 2.60; CI 1.22-5.54; P = 0.01). Fur-bearing animals kept in rural settings exhibit preventive effects on the development of allergies; whereas in urban areas they exacerbate allergic symptoms , especially the symptoms of bronchial asthma.
