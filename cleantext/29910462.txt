  A dramatic increase in eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE) and atopic disease and a dramatic decline in Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection has been observed in the last few decades. Previously , it was speculated that the immune response to H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> may protect against allergic diseases including EoE , but this study by Molina-Infante et al. shows no clear relationship , and suggests that any correlation is not causal. In truth it is likely that a combination of many factors , including a changing microbiome with increasing hygiene and alterations in early life such as antibiotic exposure , changing diet and other lifestyle factors drive increasing atopic diseases including food allergies and EoE.
