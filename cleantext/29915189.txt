  The mechanical properties of cells influence their cellular and subcellular functions , including cell adhesion , migration , polarization , and differentiation , as well as organelle organization and trafficking inside the cytoplasm. Yet reported values of cell stiffness and viscosity vary substantially , which suggests differences in how the results of different methods are obtained or analyzed by different groups. To address this issue and illustrate the complementarity of certain approaches , here we present , analyze , and critically compare measurements obtained by means of some of the most widely used methods for cell mechanics: atomic force microscopy , magnetic twisting cytometry , particle-tracking microrheology , parallel-plate rheometry , cell monolayer rheology , and optical stretching. These measurements highlight how elastic and viscous moduli of MCF-7 breast cancer cells can vary 1,000-fold and 100-fold , respectively. We discuss the sources of these variations , including the level of applied mechanical stress , the rate of deformation , the geometry of the probe , the location probed in the cell , and the extracellular microenvironment.
