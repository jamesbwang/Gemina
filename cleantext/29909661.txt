  A 79-year-old woman presented with a large fresh rectal bleed. Computed tomography revealed that she had a large type IV hiatus hernia , which contained the stomach and pancreas. Compression of the inferior mesenteric vein and splenic vein had led to thrombosis within these vessels and retrograde flow within the inferior mesenteric vein. This had led to the formation of portosystemic rectal varices. Ectopic varices occasionally form in the rectum , often in the context of liver cirrhosis. At the time of writing , ours is the first reported case of portosystemic rectal varices formulated in response to obstruction of vessels within a hiatus hernia.
