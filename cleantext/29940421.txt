  Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection is associated with relapse and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) , especially in immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for CMV colitis<disease> and to develop a predictive risk score to estimate the probability of CMV colitis<disease> in UC patients supporting clinical decision making. A cohort of 239 UC-patients was retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis identified several independent risk factors for CMV colitis<disease> and a predictive risk score was established using ROC analysis. CMV colitis<disease> is common in patients with severe ulcerative colitis<disease>. Clinical UC activity , disease duration and extent as well as the use of steroids and anti-TNF-Î± agents were identified as risk factors ( p < 0.05 each). Based on five predictive parameters , a web-based risk score was developed. A strong correlation between the predicted and actual rates of CMV colitis<disease> was found ( AUC: 0.855; 95 % CI 0.79-0.92; p < 0.0001). Our study supports the pathogenic relevance of CMV in UC. The predictive risk score estimates the risk of CMV colitis<disease> and might aid in clinical decision making , especially when timely modifications of therapeutic regimens are needed and reliable diagnostic tools are not readily available.
