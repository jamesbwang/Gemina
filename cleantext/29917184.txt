  Growing evidence has demonstrated that the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) may act as an important role in human tumorigenesis. Our present study aimed to explore the expression pattern and prognostic value of a newly discovered lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 ( SNHG5) in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). The expression of SNHG5 was determined using Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) in bone<disease> marrow and plasma obtained from AML patients and healthy controls. The correlation between SNHG5 expression and clinical features were statistically analyzed. The association between SNHG5 expression and overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the prognostic significance of SNHG5 expression. SNHG5 expression levels were consistently higher in the bone<disease> marrow and plasma of AML patients than those in the healthy controls ( p < 0.01). Furthermore , SNHG5 upregulation more frequently occurred in AML patients with advanced FAB classification ( p < 0.005) and unfavorable cytogenetics ( p = 0.001). In addition , the data of Kaplan-Meier method revealed that overall patient survival for those with high plasma SNHG5 expression was significantly shorter than those patients with low SNHG5 expression ( p < 0.0070). Importantly , univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis identified increased SNHG5 expression as an independent factor predicting poor prognosis for AML patients. Our findings provide evidence that plasma SNHG5 is an independent biomarker for patients with AML , suggesting the potential role of SNHG5 as a highly specific and sensitive biomarker.
