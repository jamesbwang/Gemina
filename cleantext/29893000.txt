  The paper presents a mathematical model and steady-state characteristics of a continuous-flow two-phase fluidized-bed bioreactor with external aeration. The quantitative description includes biofilm growth on inert carriers , distributions of density and diffusion coefficients in biofilm , decay of microorganisms , gas-liquid and liquid-biofilm mass transfer , biofilm detachment , biomass thickening and recirculation. The method for the determination of steady-states and the assessment of stability based on the orthogonal collocation method was presented. The effect of key parameters on steady-state properties of the bioreactor was analyzed. These parameters are: carbonaceous substrate concentration in the feed stream , mean residence time of the liquid and the liquid recirculation ratio. It was shown , that stream recirculation improves aeration of the liquid phase and the degree of conversion of a carbonaceous substrate. The effect of a growth kinetic model on the steady-state multiplicity was proved and discussed. The applicability of the bioreactor was assessed for aerobic processes characterized by a varied oxygen requirement , expressed by the growth yield coefficient w
