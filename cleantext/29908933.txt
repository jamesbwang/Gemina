  Low back pain ( LBP) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal problem among adults. It has been observed that patients with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> have maladaptive neuroplastic changes and difficulty in imagination processes. To assess the ability of patients with chronic LBP ( CLBP) to generate kinesthetic and visual motor images and the time they spent on this mental task compared with asymptomatic participants. Prospective , A cross-sectional study. Primary health care center in Madrid , Spain. A total of 200 participants were classified into two groups: asymptomatic participants ( n = 100) and patients with CLBP ( n = 100). After consenting to participate , all recruited participants received a sociodemographic questionnaire , a set of self-report measures and completed the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire ( MIQ-R). Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability using the Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire ( MIQ-R). A mental chronometry using a stopwatch and psychosocial variables using self-reported questionnaires. Our results indicated that patients with CLBP had difficulty generating kinesthetic and visual motor images and also took a longer time to imagine them. A regression analysis indicated that in the CLBP group , the predictor variable for fear of activity and coping symptom self-efficacy was visual motor imagery ( explaining 16.2 % of the variance); however , the predictor variable for LBP disability and pain management self-efficacy was kinesthetic motor imagery ( explaining 17.8 % of the variance). It appears that patients with CLBP have greater difficulty generating visual and kinesthetic motor images compared with asymptomatic participants , and they also need more time to perform these mental tasks.
