  Gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system of mammals. A range of bacterial species can synthesize GABA , including Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> of which L-monosodium glutamate ( L-MSG) is an inducer of its production. In order to synthesize GABA in high concentrations , L-MSG was utilized as the single inducing factor , a chemically defined medium ( CDM) was used as the fermentation substrate , with L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> CGMCC 1.2437 T cultured in medium supplemented with or without L-MSG. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to explore the differential genes expression of bacterial cells at 36 h of fermentation , where the GABA concentration of CDM with L-MSG reached the peak value and was 7.7 times higher than that of medium without L-MSG at the same timepoint. A total of 87 genes showed significant differential expression induced by L-MSG: of these , 69 were up-regulated genes and 18 were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes were assigned to biological processes and molecular function , while the down-regulated genes covered biological process , cellular process and molecular function. Interrogation of results using Gene Ontology ( GO) and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) analyses , indicated carbohydrate metabolism , fatty acid synthesis and amino acid metabolism were closely associated with GABA synthesis induced by L-MSG. This study provides insights into L. plantarum-mediated GABA fermentation at the molecular level and will provide a new approach for further studies related to GABA production by the other Lactic acid bacteria.
