  Biomineralization is a highly dynamic , yet controlled , process that many living creatures employ to develop functional tissues such as tooth enamel , bone , and others. A major goal in materials science is to create bioinspired functional structures based on the precise organization of building blocks across multiple length scales. Therefore , learning how nature has evolved to use biomineralization could inspire new ways to design and develop synthetic hierarchical materials with enhanced functionality. Toward this goal , this review dissects the current understanding of structure-function relationships of dental enamel and bone using a materials science perspective and discusses a wide range of synthetic technologies that aim to recreate their hierarchical organization and functionality. Insights into how these strategies could be applied for regenerative medicine and dentistry are also provided.
