  The increasing emergence of multi-resistant bacteria in healthcare settings , in the community and in the environment represents a major health threat worldwide. In 2016 , we started a pilot project to investigate antimicrobial resistance in surface water. Bacteria were enriched , cultivated on selective chromogenic media and species identification was carried out by MALDI-TOF analysis. From a river in southern Austria a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) was isolated. Whole genome sequence analysis identified the isolate as ST8 , spa type t008 , SCCmecIV , PVL and ACME positive , which are main features of CA-MRSA USA300. Whole genome based cgMLST of the water isolate and comparison to 18 clinical MRSA USA300 isolates from the Austrian national reference laboratory for coagulase positive staphylococci originating from 2004 , 2005 and 2016 and sequences of 146 USA300 isolates arbitrarily retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive revealed a close relatedness to a clinical isolate from Austria. The presence of a CA-MRSA USA300 isolate in an aquatic environment might pose a public health risk by serving as a potential source of infection or a source for emergence of new pathogenic MRSA clones.
