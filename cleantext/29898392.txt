  mTORC1 is a central signaling hub that integrates intra- and extracellular signals to regulate a variety of cellular metabolic processes. Mutations in regulators of mTORC1 lead to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism , which is characterized by repetitive , inflexible behaviors. These behaviors may result from alterations in striatal circuits that control motor learning and habit formation. However , the consequences of mTORC1 dysregulation on striatal neuron function are largely unknown. To investigate this , we deleted the mTORC1 negative regulator Tsc1 from identified striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons and examined how cell-autonomous upregulation of mTORC1 activity affects their morphology and physiology. We find that loss of Tsc1 increases the excitability of striatonigral , but not striatopallidal , neurons and selectively enhances corticostriatal synaptic transmission. These findings highlight the critical role of mTORC1 in regulating striatal activity in a cell type- and input-specific manner , with implications for striatonigral pathway dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease.
