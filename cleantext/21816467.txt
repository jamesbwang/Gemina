  Slow and controlled release systems for drugs have attracted increasing interest recently. A highly efficient metal-organic gel ( MOGs) drug delivery carrier , i.e. , MIL-100 ( Al) gel , has been fabricated by a facile , low cost , and environmentally friendly one-pot process. The unique structure of MIL-100 ( Al) gels has led to a high loading efficiency ( 620 mg/g) towards doxorubicin hydrochloride ( DOX) as a kind of anticancer drug. DOX-loaded MOGs exhibited high stability under physiological conditions and sustained release capacity of DOX for up to three days ( under acidic environments). They further showed sustained drug release behavior and excellent antitumor effects in in vitro experiments on HeLa cells , in contrast with the extremely low biotoxicity of MOGs. Our work provides a promising way for anticancer therapy by utilizing this MOGs-based drug delivery system as an efficient and safe vehicle.
