  A composite was prepared from PtSn nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes ( PtSnNP/CNTs) and applied to the electrochemical determination of myoglobin ( Mb). An Mb-aptamer was immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode ( GCE) , and hexcyanoferrate was used as an electrochemical probe. The PtSnNP/CNTs were synthesized by a microwave-aided ethylene glycol reduction method. Detection is based on electron transfer inhibition that is caused by the folding and conformational change of the Mb-aptamer in the presence of Mb. The amperometric signal for hexacyanoferrate , best measured at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl depends on the concentration of Mb that interacts with the aptamer on the GCE. This approach is selective and sensitive for Mb due to ( a) the highly specific recognition ability of the aptamer for Mb , ( b) the powerful electronic properties of carbon nanotubes , ( c) the arranged decoration of CNTs with PtSnNPs , and ( d) , the superior electron transfer to hexacyanoferrate. The assay is highly selective , with linear relationships from 0.01-1 nM and 10 nM-200 nM , and a limit of detection as low as 2.2 Â± 0.1 pM. The modified GCE was applied to the quantitation of Mb in spiked human serum samples. Graphical abstract Schematic illustration of the method for Mb detection.
