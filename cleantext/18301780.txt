  Some polyploid species show enhanced physiological tolerance to drought compared with their progenitors. However , very few studies have examined the consistency of physiological drought response between genetically differentiated natural polyploid populations , which is key to evaluation of the importance of adaptive evolution after polyploidization in those systems where drought exerts a selective pressure. A comparative functional approach was used to investigate differentiation of drought-tolerance-related traits in the Brachypodium species complex , a model system for grass polyploid adaptive speciation and functional genomics that comprises three closely related annual species: the two diploid parents , B. distachyon and B. stacei , and the allotetraploid derived from them , B. hybridum. Differentiation of drought-tolerance-related traits between ten genetically distinct B. hybridum populations and its ecological correlates was further analysed. The functional drought response is overall well differentiated between Brachypodium species. Brachypodium hybridum allotetraploids showed a transgressive expression pattern in leaf phytohormone content in response to drought. In contrast , other B. hybridum physiological traits correlated to B. stacei ones. Particularly , proline and water content were the traits that best discriminated these species from B. distachyon under drought. After polyploid formation and/or colonization , B. hybridum populations have adaptively diverged physiologically and genetically in response to variations in aridity.
