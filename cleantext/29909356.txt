  Surface ElectroMyography ( sEMG) is widely used as a non-invasive tool for the assessment of motor control strategies. However , the standardization of the methods used for the estimation of sEMG amplitude is a problem yet to be solved; in most cases , sEMG amplitude is estimated through the extraction of the envelope of the signal via different low-pass filtering procedures with fixed cut-off frequencies chosen by the experimenter. In this work , we have shown how it is not possible to find the optimal choice of the cut-off frequency without any a priori knowledge on the signal; considering this , we have proposed an updated version of an iterative adaptive algorithm already present in literature , aiming to completely automatize the sEMG amplitude estimation. We have compared our algorithm to most of the typical solutions ( fixed window filters and the previous version of the adaptive algorithm) for the extraction of the sEMG envelope , showing how the proposed adaptive procedure significantly improves the quality of the estimation , with a lower fraction of variance unexplained by the extracted envelope for different simulated modulating waveforms ( p < 0.005). The definition of an entropy-based convergence criterion has allowed for a complete automatization of the process. We infer that this algorithm can ensure repeatability of the estimation of the sEMG amplitude , due to its independence from the experimental choices , so allowing for a quantitative interpretation in a clinical environment.
