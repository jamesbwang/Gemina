  Coexisting plant congeners often experience strong competition for resources. Competition for pollinators can result in direct fitness costs via reduced seed set or indirect costs via heterospecific pollen transfer ( HPT) , causing subsequent gamete loss and unfit hybrid offspring production. Autonomous selfing may alleviate these costs , but to preempt HPT , selfing should occur early , before opportunities for HPT occur ( i.e. , `` preemptive selfing hypothesis ''). We evaluated conditions for this hypothesis in Collinsia sister species , C. linearis and C. rattanii. In field studies , we found virtually identical flowering times and pollinator sharing between congeners in sympatric populations. Compared to allopatric populations , sympatric C. linearis populations enjoyed higher pollinator visitation rates , whereas visitation to C. rattanii did not differ in sympatry. Importantly , the risk of HPT to each species in sympatry was strongly asymmetrical; interspecies visits comprised 40 % of all flower-to-flower visits involving C. rattanii compared to just 4 % involving C. linearis. Additionally , our greenhouse experiment demonstrated a strong cost of hybridization when C. rattanii was the pollen donor. Together , these results suggest that C. rattanii pays the greatest cost of pollinator sharing. Matching predictions of the preemptive selfing hypothesis , C. rattanii exhibit significantly earlier selfing in sympatric relative to allopatric populations.
