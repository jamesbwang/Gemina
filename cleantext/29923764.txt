  Changes in the expression of Na transport proteins were measured in the kidneys of mice with increased dietary K intake for 1 week. The epithelial Na channel ( ENaC) was upregulated , with enhanced expression of full-length and cleaved forms of αENaC and cleaved γENaC. At the same time , the amount of the NaCl cotransporter ( NCC) and its phosphorylated form decreased by ~ 50 % and ~ 80 % respectively. The expression of the phosphorylated form of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2 also decreased , despite an increase in overall protein content. The effect was stronger in males ( 80 %) than in females ( 40 %). This implies that less Na + is reabsorbed in the TALH and DCT along with Cl- , while more is reabsorbed in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron in exchange for secreted K +. The abundance of the proximal tubule Na/H exchanger NHE3 decreased by ~ 40 % , with similar effects in males and females. Time-course studies indicated that NCC and NHE3 protein decreased progressively over 7 days on a high-K diet. Expression of mRNA encoding these proteins increased , implying that the decreased protein levels resulted from decreased rates of synthesis or increased rates of degradation. The potential importance of changes in NHE3 , NKCC2 and NCC in promoting K + excretion was assessed with a mathematical model. Simulations indicated that decreased NHE3 produced the largest effect. Regulation of proximal tubule Na + transport may play a significant role in achieving K homeostasis.
