  Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is a serious health problem with high rates of health care utilization ( HCU). Many patients become stymied in a perpetual cycle of unsuccessful attempts to find relief from suffering through frequent health care visits. Especially within low-income populations , the burdens of health care services are especially unpleasant due to significant financial costs , barriers to transportation , and high levels of stress. This study aimed to examine factors associated with HCU for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in low-income settings. As part of the Learning About My Pain ( LAMP) trial , a randomized comparative effectiveness study of group-based psychosocial interventions ( PCORI Contract # 941 , Beverly Thorn , PI; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01967342) for patients receiving care for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> at low-income clinics in Alabama , medical records one-year prior to randomization were retrospectively collected for data analysis. HCU was defined as the sum of health care visits for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> over this one-year period. Sociodemographic traits ( age , sex , race , poverty status , primary literacy , education level) , pain related variables ( pain severity , pain interference , disability , number of pain sites , number of pain types , opioid prescriptions) , and psychological variables ( depressive symptoms , pain catastrophizing) were entered into a hierarchical multiple regression model to predict HCU. Results suggested that race/ethnicity , having received an opioid prescription in the year prior to treatment onset , and higher depressive symptoms were associated with increased HCU for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions. Depressive symptoms are an essential aspect of increased health care use. Study findings support the need for a biopsychosocial approach to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> management.
