  Renal cryoablation is becoming an established treatment option for small renal masses. It allows preservation of renal function without compromising cancer control. The technique has evolved considerably since it was first reported using liquid nitrogen over 20 years ago. We describe the modern technique for both laparoscopic and image guided renal cryoablation. Renal cryoablation is performed either laparoscopically or percutaneously depending on tumour characteristics. Common features include biopsy of the mass , protection of adjacent organs , and the use of compressed argon gas for freezing and helium for thawing. Dynamic monitoring is used to ensure adequate treatment. The shape of the iceball can be modified by adding extra needles or changing their positions. A double freeze/thaw is necessary for confident ablation of all cancer cells. The laparoscopic approach includes exposure of the tumour and may involve extensive mobilisation of the kidney. Laparoscopic ultrasound is essential for correct localisation of the tumour , needle placement , and monitoring the treatment. A Temperature probe is placed at the edge of the tumour to record treatment temperature. The percutaneous approach is typically performed with CT guidance. Adjacent organs can be protected by injecting saline or carbon dioxide. Early imaging is helpful to detect or rule out incomplete treatment. Post-operative follow-up is structured at specific intervals ( e.g. 3 , 6 , 12 months then annually) and perhaps tailored or modified based on the degree of suspicion of inadequate treatment.
