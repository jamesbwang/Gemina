  Predicting the uncertainties of the ever-changing environment provides a competitive advantage for animals. The need to anticipate food sources has provided a strong evolutionary drive for synchronizing behavioural and internal processes with daily circadian cycles. When food is restricted to a few hours per day , rodents exhibit increased wakefulness and foraging behaviour preceding the arrival of food. Interestingly , while the master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus entrains daily rhythms to the light cycle , it is not necessary for this food anticipatory activity. This suggests the existence of a food-entrained oscillator located elsewhere. Based on the role of nigrostriatal dopamine in reward processing , motor function , working memory and internal timekeeping , we propose a working model by which food-entrained dopamine oscillations in the dorsal striatum<pathogen> can enable animals maintained on a restricted feeding schedule to anticipate food arrival. Finally , we summarize how metabolic signals in the gut are conveyed to the nigrostriatal pathway to suggest possible insight into potential input mechanisms for food anticipatory activity.
