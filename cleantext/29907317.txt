  The review was carried out to inform the evaluation of the clinical pharmacists in general practice pilot scheme , a world leading initiative to improve health care delivery in England. Around 500 pharmacists are already working in general practice as part of the pilot , launched in July 2015. The review attempts to explain the how pharmacists working in general practice is being implemented in the UK and beyond , what works well , what does not work so well and everything in-between. This realist review was conducted to the RAMESES standards. Studies were identified by searching three databases , Medline , Embase and Scopus. Additional papers were gathered from reference lists , Google searches and via the find similar citations feature. A total of 83 papers and articles were initially identified from Medline ( 19) , Embase ( 31) and Scopus ( 32). With close reading , the final review consisted of 43 papers relating to 38 studies. Most of the research was undertaken in the field of pharmacy practice and over half of the studies investigated the perspectives of different stakeholders using questionnaires or qualitative methods. The pharmacist working in general practice is still a relatively new concept and further more in-depth research is still required. However , from this small number of studies , the common barriers and facilitators to the implementation can be identified. The review also lists mechanisms that will be needed to ensure the effective implementation of this initiative.
