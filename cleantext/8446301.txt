  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a prevalent , complex and debilitating disease which imposes a formidable burden on patients and the healthcare system. The recognition that COPD is a multifaceted disease is not new , and increasing evidence have outlined the importance of its extra-pulmonary manifestations and its relation to other comorbid conditions in the clinical course of the disease and its societal cost. The relationship between aging , COPD and its comorbidities on skeletal muscle function and nutritional status is complex , multidirectional and incompletely understood. Despite this , the current body of knowledge allows the identification of various , seemingly partially independent factors related both to the normal aging process and to the independent deleterious effects of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> on muscle function and body composition. There is a dire need of studies evaluating the relative contribution of each of these factors , and their potential synergistic effects in patients with COPD and advanced age/comorbid conditions , in order to delineate the best course of therapeutic action in this increasingly prevalent population.
