  BACKGROUND Over the decades , postoperative recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH) has not been resolved. OBJECT The objective of our study was to investigate whether the recurrence rate of CSDH is decreased when artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACF) is used as irrigation solution for CSDH surgery. METHODS The present study was a multi-center , prospective , randomized , open parallel group comparison test of patients enrolled from 10 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients with CSDH were randomly assigned to undergo burr hole drainage with either normal saline ( NS) or ACF irrigation. The primary endpoint was postoperative recurrence of ipsilateral CSDH. RESULTS A total of 402 patients with newly diagnosed CSDH were enrolled during the study period. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria , considering lost cases , our final study cohorts consisted of 177 ACF patients and 165 NS patients , representing 85.7 % of the initial cohort. The overall recurrence rate was 11.4 % , occurring in 39 of the 342 analyzed patients during 90 days of follow-up. Recurrence rates in the ACF and NS groups were 11.9 % ( 21 of 177) and 10.9 % ( 18 of 165) , respectively. No significant difference was evident between groups ( p = 0.87). In addition , no significant difference in time to recurrence was seen between groups ( p = 0.74). No serious adverse effects related to irrigation fluid were seen in either group. CONCLUSIONS Regarding the irrigation fluid for CSDH surgery , no differences in recurrence rate or time to recurrence were seen between ACF and NS. However , ACF offers sufficient safety as irrigation fluid for CSDH.
