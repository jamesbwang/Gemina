  Bisalbuminemias consist in rare qualitative modifications of several aspects in the albumin pattern. Bisalbuminemias , most of which are not pathological , can be observed using capillary electrophoresis. We report a case of hereditary bisalbuminemia diagnosed by chance while exploring chronic unexplained hypereosinophilia in a 42-year-old patient. The patient 's normal lipid profile , the lack of an antibiotic treatment or pancreatic pathology , and the persistence of the bisalbuminemia after one month , suggested a diagnosis of genetic bisalbuminemia. In light of other such cases , we review the main causes of bisalbuminemia , both genetic and acquired. The diagnosis of genetic bisalbuminemia is made by first eliminating the usual acquired etiologies: analytical or drug interference , acute pancreatitis<disease> and binding of immunoglobulins. Then , after having checked the lipemic index , reviewed the patient 's medical history , comorbidities , and treatments , repeating the electrophoresis will help identify the cause of the bisalbuminemia.
