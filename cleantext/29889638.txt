  OBJECTIVE To describe and evaluate outcomes of a multidisciplinary , minimally invasive approach combining lacrimoscopy and fluoroscopically guided stenting for management of nasolacrimal apparatus ( NLA) obstruction in dogs. DESIGN Prospective , nonrandomized clinical trial. ANIMALS 16 client-owned dogs with confirmed NLA obstruction. PROCEDURES Dogs underwent CT contrast dacryocystorhinography , rhinoscopy , and lacrimoscopy. Whenever possible , the NLA was stented , typically with fluoroscopic guidance. RESULTS Median duration of clinical signs prior to treatment was 3.2 months ( range , 0.2 to 14 months). Causes of NLA obstruction were a foreign body ( n = 5) , dacryocystitis ( 4) , stenosis secondary to fibrosis<disease> ( 3) , granulation tissue ( 1) , or granulation tissue in association with a small foreign body ( 1); a cause was not identified in 2 dogs. Stents were placed in 14 of 16 ( 88 %) dogs for a median duration of 5.6 weeks ( range , 1.3 to 9.4 weeks). Stenting was not possible in 2 dogs with stenosis of the NLA secondary to granulation tissue or fibrosis<disease>. Owners of all 16 dogs reported at least 60 % clinical improvement with median improvement rated as 95 % , and owners of 8 dogs reporting complete resolution of signs. Two dogs required antimicrobial administration because of dacryocystitis that persisted after stent removal; a foreign body was not found in either dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Overall clinical response and owner-rated improvement for dogs with NLA obstruction that underwent lacrimoscopy and fluoroscopically guided stenting were high , especially given that these dogs had failed to respond to conventional treatment.
