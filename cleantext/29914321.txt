  This study predicted Burnout from the self-care practices , compassion satisfaction , secondary traumatic stress , and organizational factors among chaplains who participated from all 50 states ( N = 534). A hierarchical regression model indicated that the combined effect of compassion satisfaction , secondary traumatic stress , mindful self-care , demographic , and organizational factors explained 83.2 % of the variance in Burnout. Chaplains serving in a hospital were slightly more at risk for Burnout than those in hospice or other settings. Organizational factors that most predicted Burnout were feeling bogged down by the `` system '' ( 25.7 %) and an overwhelming caseload ( 19.9 %). Each self-care category was a statistically significant protective factor against Burnout risk. The strongest protective factors against Burnout in order of strength were self-compassion and purpose , supportive structure , mindful self-awareness , mindful relaxation , supportive relationships , and physical care. For secondary traumatic stress , supportive structure , mindful self-awareness , and self-compassion and purpose were the strongest protective factors. Chaplains who engaged in multiple and frequent self-care strategies experienced higher professional quality of life and low Burnout risk. In the chaplain 's journey toward wellness , a reflective practice of feeling good about doing good and mindful self-care are vital. The significance , implications , and limitations of the study were discussed.
