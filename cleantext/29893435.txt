  To explore patients ' experiences of acute<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> , physical functioning , and perspectives on course of illness prior to admission to the emergency department. Many emergency admissions are considered unnecessary and avoidable. In this perspective , it seems relevant to gain insight into the patients ' perspective on acute<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> and the need for emergency admission. However , only few studies have investigated reasons for emergency admission from a patient perspective. A qualitative study was conducted with semi-structured interviews among six patients previously admitted to the emergency department due to dyspnea<symptom>. Data collection and analysis were done according to Kvale & Brinkmann using meaning condensation. Dyspnea<symptom> was experienced as an unpleasant breathlessness in the form of pain or suffocation , which limited usual physical activities , negatively impacting on quality of life. Self-management strategies such as medication , breathing exercises , distraction from breathing , and mental and physical relaxation in general were used to avoid hospital admission. The chronically ill patients saw the following ways to alternate course of disease to avoid admissions to the emergency department: Easier access to specialised emergency medical care , medical supplies in the patient 's home , and making existing physical exercise programmes more accessible and interesting. It would be relevant to further investigate if pre-hospital interventions may remedy acute<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> among chronically ill patients , and whether such interventions are cost-effective.
