  Adherence to recommendations and medication is deemed to be important for effectiveness of case management interventions. Thus , reasons for non-adherence and effects on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) should be fully understood. The objective of this research was to identify determinants of non-adherence to medication and recommendations , and to test whether increased adherence improved HRQoL in patients after myocardial infarction ( MI) in a case management intervention. Data were obtained from the intervention group of the KORINNA study , a randomized controlled trail of a nurse-led case management intervention with targeted recommendations in the elderly after MI in Germany. Reasons for non-adherence were described. Logistic mixed effects models and OLS ( ordinary least squares) were used to analyze the effect of recommendations on the probability of adherence and the association between adherence and HRQoL. One hundred and twenty-seven patients with 965 contacts were included. Frequent reasons for non-adherence to medication and recommendations were `` forgotten '' ( 22 %; 11 %) , `` reluctant '' ( 18 %; 18 %) , `` side effects '' ( 38 %; 7 %) , `` the problem disappeared '' ( 6 %; 13 %) , and `` barriers '' ( 0 %; 13 %). The probability of adherence was lowest for disease and self-management ( 38 %) and highest for visits to the doctor ( 61 %). Only if patients diverging from prescribed medication because of side effects were also considered as adherent , 3-year medication adherence was associated with a significant gain of 0.34 quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs). Most important determinants of non-adherence to medication were side effects , and to recommendations reluctance. Recommended improvements in disease and self-management were least likely adhered. Medication adherence was associated with HRQoL. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN02893746 , retrospectively registered , date assigned 27/03/2009.
