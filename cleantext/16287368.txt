  The aim of this study was to analyze the association between sprint ability and endurance capacity in soccer referees. Twenty-three Spanish officials participated in this study. Each referee undertook , in this order , a 40 m linear straight sprinting test ( 40 m Sprint) and the Yo ⁻ Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test ( YYIR1) interspersed with a 8 min of self-administered rest. The results in the 40 m Sprint test showed that the time spent by referees was 5.56 ± 0.27 s and achieved a maximum velocity of 31.46 ± 2.85 km · h
