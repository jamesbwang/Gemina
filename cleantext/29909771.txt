  Studies including patients with well-established multiple sclerosis ( MS) have shown a significant and disability-related reduction in the cervical spinal cord ( SC) magnetisation transfer ratio ( MTR). The objectives are to ( 1) assess whether MTR reduction is already measurable in the SC of patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS) and ( 2) describe its spatial distribution. We included 60 patients with RRMS < 12 months and 34 age-matched controls at five centres. Axial T2 * w , sagittal T2w , sagittal phase-sensitive inversion recovery ( PSIR) , 3DT1w , and axial magnetisation transfer ( MT) images were acquired from C1 to C7. Lesions<symptom> were manually labelled and mean MTR values computed both for the whole SC and for normal-appearing SC in different regions of interest. Mean whole SC MTR was significantly lower in patients than controls ( 33.7 vs 34.9 pu , p = 0.00005) , even after excluding lesions<symptom> ( 33.9 pu , p = 0.0003). We observed a greater mean reduction in MTR for vertebral levels displaying the highest lesion<symptom> loads ( C2-C4). In the axial plane , we observed a greater mean MTR reduction at the SC periphery and barycentre. Cervical SC tissue damage measured using MTR is not restricted to macroscopic lesions<symptom> in patients with early RRMS and is not homogeneously distributed.
