  The aim of this study was to identify the maternal feeding practices with children who have some kind of disability and its influence in their social inclusion process. Three focus groups were carried out with the participation of twelve mothers/caregivers of children with disabilities. The mothers/caregivers are in charge of their children 's progress with respect to their physical health and disability. Their feeding practices contribute to their health condition , to the acquisition of nourishing learning , social behavior at the table , domestic collaboration , as well as to the development of language by means of the communicative interactions , and also the tightening of the affective bond between mother and child. Nourishing practices make possible the cultural transmission of food preferences and aversions and , additionally , generate a context that fosters the development of very diverse learning which , in the case of children with some type of disability , could contribute to the improvement of their pro-social skills and repertoires mediated by their mothers or caregivers.
