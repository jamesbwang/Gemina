  Dysfunctional affectivity is common in schizophrenia spectrum disorders ( SSD) , and may influence quality of life , illness progression and treatment effects. This study describes Positive ( PA) and Negative ( NA) affect and their relationship to demographic and clinical variables in 135 individuals with SSD. Affect dimensions were assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS). Stepwise regression analyses with affects as dependent variables and demographic and clinical factors as independent variables were performed. Relative to healthy norms , the participants exhibited lower PA and a similar NA level. The PA score was not influenced by demographic or clinical variables. The NA score was predicted by a combination of male gender , single status , and items of general psychopathology from the Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale ( PANSS). There was no relation between affects and classical schizophrenia symptoms. In conclusion , the SSD patients exhibited abnormally low PA.. The affect level was not influenced by psychosis symptom severity , indicating that the PANAS is a relatively unbiased rating tool of affective responding in SSD. Finally , male gender , single status and general distress were modestly related to NA.
