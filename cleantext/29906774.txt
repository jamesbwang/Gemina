  Brown patch , caused by Rhizoctonia solani , is a serious disease in Agrostis stolonifera. 2 , 3-butanediol ( 2 , 3-BD) is the major component of volatile organic compounds and was found to initiate induced systemic resistance ( ISR). To investigate the induced resistance mechanism of 2 , 3-BD , we examined the effects of resistance by area affected , along with changes in the content of phytohormones ( Zeatin ( ZT) , Abscisic Acid ( ABA) and Indole-3-Acetic Acid ( IAA)) , the activities of three phenylpropanoid metabolic enzymes ( Phenylalaninammo-Nialyase ( PAL) , Chalcone Isomerase ( CHI) and 4-Coumarate: Coenzyme A Ligase ( 4CL)) and the level of secondary metabolites ( total phenols , flavonoid and lignin). The result showed that 2 , 3-BD treatment at 250 μmoL/L had the best induction effect with the area affected decreased from 95 % of the control to 55 %. Compared to the controls , treatment with 250 μmoL/L 2 , 3-BD induced higher levels of PAL , CHI and 4CL activity and increased total phenols , flavonoid and lignin levels. While 2 , 3-BD treatment decreased the content of ZT and ABA but increased the content of IAA compared to controls. This study provides a basis for elucidating the mechanism of 2 , 3-BD as a new plant disease control agent.
