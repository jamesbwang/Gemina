  Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is a recognized risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment ( CI) and/or dementia , although the exact nature of the molecular pathology of T2D-associated CI remains obscure. One link between T2D and CI might involve decreased insulin signaling in brain and/or neurons in either animal or postmortem human brains as has been reported as a feature of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Here we asked if neuronal insulin resistance is a cell autonomous phenomenon in a familial form of AD. We have applied a newly developed protocol for deriving human basal forebrain cholinergic neurons ( BFCN) from skin fibroblasts via induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC) technology. We generated wildtype and familial AD mutant PSEN2 We report herein that wildtype , PSEN2 Our studies indicate that the familial AD mutation PSEN2
