  Continuous activation of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling has been reported to play important roles in multiple process of tumor progression , leading to uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation , growth , and survival. However , the mechanism underlying the regulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway remains largely unknown. Determining the molecular mechanism of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway 's aberrant activation in glioma carcinogenesis might improve therapeutic strategies for patients with glioma. In this study , we showed that the expression of microRNA miR-1249 was markedly upregulated in glioma cell lines and tissues. Upregulation of miR-1249 enhanced , whereas downregulation inhibited , the proliferation of glioma cells both
