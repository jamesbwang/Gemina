  Germ cells undergo epigenome reprogramming for proper development of the next generation. The realization of germ cell derivation from human and mouse pluripotent stem cells offers unprecedented opportunity for investigation of germline development. Primordial germ cells reconstituted in vitro ( PGC-like cells ( PGCLCs)) show progressive dilution of genomic DNA methylation , tightly linked with chromatin remodeling , during their specification. PGCLCs can be further expanded by plane culture , allowing maintenance of the gene-expression profiles of early PGCs and continuance of the DNA methylation erasure , thereby establishing an epigenetic ` blank slate '. PGCLCs undergo further epigenome regulation to acquire the male or female fates. These findings will provide a foundation for basic germ cell biology and for in-depth evaluations of in vitro gametogenesis.
