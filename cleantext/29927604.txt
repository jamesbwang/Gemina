  Increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K) signaling is among the most common alterations in cancer , spurring intensive efforts to develop new cancer therapeutics that target this pathway. In this work , we discovered a series of novel 2-amino-4-methylquinazoline derivatives through a hybridization and subsequent scaffold hopping approach that were highly potent class I PI3K inhibitors. Lead optimization resulted in several promising compounds ( e.g. , 19 , 20 , 37 , and 43) with nanomolar PI3K potencies , prominent antiproliferative activities , favorable PK profiles , and robust in vivo antitumor efficacies. More interestingly , compared with 19 and 20 , 37 and 43 demonstrated improved brain penetration and in vivo efficacy in an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft model. Furthermore , preliminary safety assessments including hERG channel inhibition , AMES , CYP450 inhibition , and single-dose toxicity were performed to characterize their toxicological properties.
