  Diagnosis of von Willebrand disease ( VWD) is difficult due to the heterogenic phenotype of patients and to the complex tests that are required for an adequate investigation. The collagen binding assay ( VWF: CB) reveals the adhesion capacity of von Willebrand factor ( VWF) to collagen and can be useful to reduce the misleading diagnosis of VWD. This study aimed the standardization of 2 nonautomated VWF: CB assays based on ELISA and flow cytometry. Plasma samples from 87 patients previously diagnosed with VWD and 22 healthy controls were analyzed. Measurement of the VWF-collagen binding activity was performed using a commercial assay and the 2 tests proposed. VWF: CB/VWF: Ag ratio was calculated for samples and the differentiation between types 1 , 2A , and 2M was analyzed. ELISA and flow cytometry tests presented strong correlation with the gold standard test ( r The ELISA test demonstrated better performance to detect VWF-collagen binding activity in healthy individuals and VWD patients. This test could differentiate 2A and 2M subtypes using a feasible protocol that can be easily implemented.
