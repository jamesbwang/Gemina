  Determination of natural preservatives using electrophoretic or chromatographic techniques in fermented milk products is a complex task due to the following reasons: ( i) the concentrations of the analytes can be below the detection limits , ( ii) complex<pathogen> matrix and comigrating/coeluting compounds in the sample can interfere with the analytes of the interest , ( iii) low recovery of the analytes , and ( iv) the necessity of complex sample preparation. The aim of this study was to apply capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with contactless conductivity detection for the separation and determination of nisin in fermented milk products. In this work , separation and determination of natural preservative-nisin in fermented milk products is described. Optimized conditions using capillary zone electrophoresis coupled with capacitance-to-digital technology based contactless conductivity detector and data conditioning , which filter the noise of the electropherogram adaptively to the peak migration time , allowed precise , accurate , sensitive ( limit of quantification: 0.02 μg/mL) , and most importantly requiring very minute sample preparation , determination of nisin. Sample preparation includes following steps: ( i) extraction/dilution and ( ii) centrifugation. This method was applied for the determination of nisin in real samples , i.e. fermented milk products. The values of different nisin forms were ranging from 0.056 ± 0.003 μg/mL to 9.307 ± 0.437 μg/g.
