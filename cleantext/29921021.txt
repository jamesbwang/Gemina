  HSTCL is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Case series and accounts have reported the use of different chemotherapy regimens with diverse patient outcomes. Most long-term survivors had undergone high-dose chemotherapy with autologous or allogeneic HCT. We describe two pediatric patients with HSTCL who were treated with chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT. Both patients are alive and in complete remission 2 and 8 years after therapy. Multiagent chemotherapy followed with allogeneic HCT seems to provide patients who have chemotherapy-sensitive disease a long-term disease-free survival.
