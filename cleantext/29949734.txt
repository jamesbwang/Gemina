  In utero and early neonatal exposure to maternal stress is linked with psychiatric disorders , and the underlying mechanisms are currently being elucidated. We used a prenatal stressor in pregnant mice to examine novel relationships between prenatal stress exposure , changes in the gut microbiome , and social behavior. Here , we show that males exposed to prenatal stress had a significant reduction in social behavior in adulthood , with increased corticosterone release following social interaction. Male offspring exposed to prenatal stress also had neuroinflammation , decreased oxytocin receptor , and decreased serotonin metabolism in their cortex in adulthood , which are linked to decreased social behavior. Finally , we found a significant difference in commensal microbes , including decreases in Bacteroides and Parabacteroides<pathogen> , in adult male offspring exposed to prenatal stress when compared to non-stressed controls. Our findings indicate that gestation is a critical window where maternal stress contributes to the development of aberrant social behaviors and alterations in cortical neurobiology , and that prenatal stress is sufficient to disrupt the male gut-brain axis into adulthood.
