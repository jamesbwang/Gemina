  Enhanced removal of trace toxic metals ( ppm level) from high-salinity wastewater is crucial to ensure water safety but still a challenging task. In this study , we fabricated a new hybrid ultrafiltration membrane ( PAA/ZIF -8/ PVDF) by immobilizing zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8) particles onto the surface of trimesoyl chloride ( TMC)- modified polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF) membrane under protection of polyacrylic acid ( PAA) layer. The resultant PAA/ZIF -8/ PVDF membrane exhibited relatively high water flux of 460 L Â· m
