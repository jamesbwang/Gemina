  To assess the usefulness of photoactivated chromophore for infectious keratitis-corneal collagen cross-linking in reducing the time to heal in suppurative corneal ulcers<disease> in a South Indian tertiary care center. This was an observational cohort study with 2 arms. In the prospective arm , 13 patients with suppurative corneal ulcers<disease> who presented to the outpatient department were recruited. Their ulcers<disease> were exposed to ultraviolet-A with riboflavin ( B2) ( photoactivated chromophore for infectious keratitis-corneal collagen cross-linking) up to a maximum of 4 sittings at 3-day intervals. Topical antimicrobial therapy was continued as per the standard department protocol. This cohort was compared with a retrospective cohort of 32 consecutive patients who had been admitted and treated at our department for a similar profile of ulcers<disease> in the previous 1 year. The ulcers<disease> in the prospective arm had an average healing time of 21.6 days , whereas the retrospective arm had an average healing time of 48.8 days. This reduction in the time to heal trends not only toward being statistically significant ( P = 0.06) but also highly clinically significant. CXL reduced the time to heal in suppurative corneal ulcers<disease> less than 6 mm in diameter and can be used as an adjuvant to antimicrobial therapy.
