  The goals of this study were to identify geographic and racial/ethnic variation in breast cancer mortality , and evaluate whether observed geographic differences are explained by county-level characteristics. We analyzed data on breast cancer deaths among women in 3,108 contiguous United States ( US) counties from years 2000 through 2015. We applied novel geospatial methods and identified hot spot counties based on breast cancer mortality rates. We assessed differences in county-level characteristics between hot spot and other counties using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Spearman correlation , and stratified all analysis by race/ethnicity. Among all women , 80 of 3,108 ( 2.57 %) contiguous US counties were deemed hot spots for breast cancer mortality with the majority located in the southern region of the US ( 72.50 % , p value < 0.001). In race/ethnicity-specific analyses , 119 ( 3.83 %) hot spot counties were identified for NH-Black women , with the majority being located in southern states ( 98.32 % , p value < 0.001). Among Hispanic women , there were 83 ( 2.67 %) hot spot counties and the majority was located in the southwest region of the US ( southern = 61.45 % , western = 33.73 % , p value < 0.001). We did not observe definitive geographic patterns in breast cancer mortality for NH-White women. Hot spot counties were more likely to have residents with lower education , lower household income , higher unemployment rates , higher uninsured population , and higher proportion indicating cost as a barrier to medical care. We observed geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer mortality: NH-Black and Hispanic breast cancer deaths were more concentrated in southern , lower SES counties.
