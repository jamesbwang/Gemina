  In the present study , we investigated whether schisantherin A ( StA) had anti-inflammatory effects under neuroinflammatory conditions. The effects of StA and its underlying mechanisms were examined in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- activated BV-2 microglial cells by ELISA , qPCR , EMSA , Western blot , and IHC. Firstly , we found that StA inhibited the inflammatory response in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia. Secondly , we found that StA suppressed LPS-induced activation of NF-κB via interfering with degradation of IκB and phosphorylation of IκB , IKK , PI3K/Akt , JNK , and p38 MAPK. Thirdly , StA conferred indirect antioxidative effects via quenching ROS and promoted expression of antioxidant enzymes , including HO-1 and NQO-1 , via stimulating activation of Nrf2 pathways. Finally , we demonstrated that anti-neuroinflammatory actions of StA were dependent on ERK phosphorylation-mediated Nrf2 activation. StA induced ERK phosphorylation-mediated Nrf2 activation , which contributed to its anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. The anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of StA may show preventive therapeutic potential for various neuroinflammatory disorders.
