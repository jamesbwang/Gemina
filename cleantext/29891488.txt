  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers , and overall survival rates have barely improved over the past five decades. The antimetabolite gemcitabine remains part of the standard of care but shows very limited antitumor efficacy. Ataxia<symptom> telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein ( ATR) , the apical kinase of the intra-S-phase DNA damage response , plays a central role in safeguarding cells from replication stress and can therefore limit the efficacy of antimetabolite drug therapies. We investigated the ability of the ATR inhibitor , AZD6738 , to prevent the gemcitabine-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint activation and evaluated the antitumor potential of this combination
