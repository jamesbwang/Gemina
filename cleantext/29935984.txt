  Toluene , a commonly used organic solvent , produces a variety of behavioral disturbances in both humans and animals comparable to noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDARs) antagonists , such as phencyclidine ( PCP). N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) is capable of reversing the psychotomimetic effects of PCP via activation of cystine-glutamate antiporters ( xCT). The present study examined whether NAC is capable of attenuating the toluene-induced brain stimulation reward enhancement and behavioral manifestations. Male mice received various doses of NAC prior to toluene exposure for assessment of intracranial self-stimulation ( ICSS) thresholds , rotarod test , novel object recognition task and social interaction test. NAC ameliorated the lowering of ICSS thresholds , motor incoordination<symptom> , object recognition memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> and social withdrawal induced by toluene. Furthermore , the capacity of NAC to ameliorate acute toluene-induced deficits in object recognition and social interaction was blocked by the xCT inhibitor ( S) -4-carboxyphenylglycine and the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495. These results indicate that NAC could prevent toluene-induced reward facilitation and behavioral disturbances and its beneficial effects , at least for cognitive function and social interaction , are associated with activation of the xCT and mGluR2/3. These findings show the potential promise for NAC to treat toluene dependence and to prevent toluene intoxication caused by unintentional or deliberate inhalation.
