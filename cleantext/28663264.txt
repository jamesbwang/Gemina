  This study aims to present the reference range of corpus callosum by ultrasound imaging in neonates and to develop a clinically feasible screening method for congenital abnormalities of corpus callosum.An observational study was conducted between January 2015 and July 2016; 2D and 3D ultrasound evaluations were conducted and virtural organ computer-aided analysis was applied in the volume calculation of corpus callosum. The following parameters were measured: thickness of the rostum , thickness of the genu , thickness of the body , thickness of the splenium , anterior-posterior distance , true length of the corpus callosum and the volume of the corpus callosum. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was also evaluated. The corrected gestational age was between 38 +0 and 47 +2 weeks. The least-mean-square method was used to create the growth curve for each parameter.Complete data sets were available in 317 neonates , ranging from 0 to 28 days of age. Reference values from the 1st to 99th percentiles were provided. All parameters showed a nonlinear growth trend with age. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was excellent for 2D and 3D parameters.Our results suggested that computer techniques can assist in the volume assessment of corpus callosum. The 2D and 3D ultrasound data of 7 morphologic parameters may facilitate the identification of corpus callosum anomalies based on a large population.
