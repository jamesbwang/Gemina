  Maternal mental health problems during pregnancy and the postnatal period are a major public health issue. Despite evidence that symptoms of both depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> are common during pregnancy and the postpartum , the impact of maternal anxiety<symptom> on the child has received relatively less attention than the impact of maternal depression<symptom> Furthermore , the evidence base for the direct impact of maternal anxiety<symptom> during pregnancy and the postpartum on children 's emotional outcomes lacks cohesion. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the empirical evidence regarding the impact of maternal prenatal and postnatal anxiety<symptom> on children 's emotional outcomes. Overall , both maternal prenatal and postnatal anxiety<symptom> have a small adverse effect on child emotional outcomes. However , the evidence appears stronger for the negative impact of prenatal anxiety<symptom>. Several methodological weaknesses<symptom> make conclusions problematic and replication of findings is required to improve the identification of at-risk parents and children with appropriate opportunities for intervention and prevention.
