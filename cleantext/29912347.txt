  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) is increasing worldwide for reasons largely unknown and environmental chemicals with neurotoxic properties , such as persistent organic pollutants ( POPs) , have been proposed to play a role. We investigated the association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl-153 ( PCB-153) , p-p '- dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p-p '- DDE) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB) and ADHD in childhood. We pooled seven European birth cohort studies encompassing 4437 mother-child pairs from the general population with concentrations of PCB-153 , p-p '- DDE and HCB measured in cord blood , maternal blood or milk. We then calculated prenatal ( birth) and postnatal ( 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 months) POP concentrations using a pharmacokinetic model. The operational definition of ADHD varied across cohorts and ranged from doctor diagnosis obtained from patient registries to maternal or teachers reports. We used multilevel ( mixed) logistic regression models to estimate the associations between exposure to POPs at birth , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 months and ADHD. The global prevalence of ADHD in our study was 6 %. The mean age at assessment of ADHD was 5.8 years ( range: 3.8-9.5 years). We found no association between exposure to PCB-153 , p-p '- DDE and HCB at any age point between birth and 24 months and ADHD , in the pooled analyses ( pooled odds ratios ranging from 1.00 to 1.01). A number of sensitivity analyses gave basically the same results. In the largest study to date of 4437 children in seven European birth cohorts , we did not observe any association between either pre- or postnatal exposure ( up to 24 months) to PCB-153 , p-p '- DDE and HCB and the risk of ADHD before the age of 10 years.
