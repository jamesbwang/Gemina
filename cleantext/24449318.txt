  It is reported that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in patients with pancreatic cancer. However , the diagnostic value of miRNAs in pancreatic cancer remains controversial. The meta-analysis was to access diagnostic accuracy of miRNAs in pancreatic cancer. PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI) , WANFANG Data , China Biomedical Literature Database ( CBM) , and VIP databases were retrieved up to June 30 , 2016 , to collect articles concerning the diagnosis of miRNAs in pancreatic cancer. The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS-2). This meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan5 .0 , MetaDiSc 1.4 , and Stata 12.0 software. There are 40 articles including 109 studies. The pooled SEN was 0.81 ( 95 % CI , 0.80-0.82) , the pooled SPE was 0.78 ( 95 % CI , 0.77-0.79) , the pooled + LR was 3.32 ( 95 % CI , 2.92-3.80) , the pooled- LR was 0.27 ( 95 % CI , 0.24-0.31) , the pooled DOR was 14.56 ( 95 % CI , 11.55-18.34) , and pooled AUC was 0.86 ( 95 % CI , 0.84-0.88). This meta-analysis demonstrated that miRNA makes a significant impact in the pancreatic cancer diagnosis with a high SEN and SPE , particularly using multiple miRNAs.
