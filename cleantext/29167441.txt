  The cellular replicative DNA polymerases can not initiate DNA synthesis without a priming 3 ' OH. During DNA replication , this is supplied in the context of a short RNA primer molecule synthesized by DNA primase. The primase of archaea and eukaryotes , despite having varying subunit compositions , share sequence and structural homology. Intriguingly , archaeal primase has been demonstrated to possess the ability to synthesize DNA de novo , a property shared with the eukaryotic PrimPol enzymes. The dual RNA and DNA synthetic capabilities of the archaeal DNA primase have led to the proposal that there may be a sequential hand-off between these synthetic modes of primase. In the current work , we dissect the functional interplay between DNA and RNA synthetic modes of primase. In addition , we determine the key determinants that govern primer length definition by the archaeal primase. Our results indicate a primer measuring system that functions akin to a caliper.
