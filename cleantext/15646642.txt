  The elimination half-lives of in Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 ( CINC-1) in rats after inflammatory stimulation were investigated. Five male Sprague-Dawley rats were used ( age , 9 weeks; body<symptom> weight , 235-375 g). Turpentine oil was intramuscularly injected at a dose of 2 mL/kg body<symptom> weight<symptom> to induce acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. Blood was collected pre-injection and 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 , and 96 h after the turpentine oil injection. Serum concentrations of IL-6 , CINC-1 , and Î±
