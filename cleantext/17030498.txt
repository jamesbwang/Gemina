  Recombination between different HIV-1 group M ( HIV-1M) subtypes is a major contributor to the ongoing genetic diversification of HIV-1M. However , it remains unclear whether the different genome regions of recombinants are randomly inherited from the different subtypes. To elucidate this , we analysed the distribution within 82 circulating and 201 unique recombinant forms ( CRFs/URFs) , of genome fragments derived from HIV-1M Subtypes A , B , C , D , F , and G and CRF01_AE. We found that viruses belonging to the analysed HIV-1M subtypes and CRF01_AE contributed certain genome fragments more frequently during recombination than other fragments. Furthermore , we identified statistically significant hot-spots of Subtype A sequence inheritance in genomic regions encoding portions of Gag and Nef , Subtype B in Pol , Tat and Env , Subtype C in Vif , Subtype D in Pol and Env , Subtype F in Gag , Subtype G in Vpu-Env and Nef , and CRF01_AE inheritance in Vpu and Env. The apparent non-randomness in the frequencies with which different subtypes have contributed specific genome regions to known HIV-1M recombinants is consistent with selection strongly impacting the survival of inter-subtype recombinants. We propose that hotspots of genomic region inheritance are likely to demarcate the locations of subtype-specific adaptive genetic variations.
