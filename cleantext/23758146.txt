  Controllable synthesis of graphene derivatives with defined composition and properties represents the holy grail of graphene chemistry , especially in view of the low reactivity of graphene. Recent progress in fluorographene ( FG) chemistry has opened up new routes for synthesizing a plethora of graphene derivatives with widely applicable properties , but they are often difficult to control. We explored nucleophilic substitution on FG combining density functional theory calculations with experiments to achieve accurate control over the functionalization process. In-depth analysis revealed the complexity of the reaction and identified basic rules for controlling the 2D chemistry. Their application , that is , choice of solvent and reaction time , enabled facile control over the reaction of FG with N-octylamine to form graphene derivatives with tailored content of the alkylamine functional group ( 2.5-7.5 % N atomic content) and F atoms ( 31.5-3.5 % F atomic content). This work substantially extends prospects for the controlled covalent functionalization of graphene.
