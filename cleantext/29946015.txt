  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Despite advancement in the management of HF , outcomes remain suboptimal , particularly among the uninsured. In 2014 , the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility , and millions of low-income adults gained insurance. Little is known about Medicaid expansion 's effect on inpatient HF care. We used the American Heart Association 's Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry to assess changes in inpatient care quality and outcomes among low-income patients ( < 65 years old) hospitalized for HF after Medicaid expansion , in expansion , and nonexpansion states. Patients were classified as low-income if covered by Medicaid , uninsured , or missing insurance. Expansion states were those that implemented expansion in 2014. Piecewise logistic multivariable regression models were constructed to track quarterly trends of quality and outcome measures in the pre ( January 1 , 2010-December 31 , 2013) and postexpansion ( January 1 , 2014-June 30 , 2017) periods. These measures were compared between expansion versus nonexpansion states during the postexpansion period. The cohort included 58804 patients hospitalized across 391 sites. In states that expanded Medicaid , uninsured HF hospitalizations declined from 7.9 % to 4.4 % , and Medicaid HF hospitalizations increased from 18.3 % to 34.6 %. Defect-free HF care was increasing during the preexpansion period ( adjusted odds ratio/quarter , 1.06; 95 % confidence interval , 1.03-1.08) but did not change after expansion ( adjusted odds ratio , 0.99; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97-1.02). Patterns were similar for other quality measures. There were no quality measures for which the rate of improvement sped up after expansion. In-hospital mortality rates remained similar during the preexpansion ( adjusted odds ratio , 0.99; 95 % confidence interval , 0.96-1.02) and postexpansion periods ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.00; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97-1.03). Among nonexpansion states , uninsured HF hospitalizations increased ( 11.6 % to 16.7 %) as did Medicaid HF hospitalizations ( 17.9 % to 26.6 %) , and no quarterly improvement was observed for most quality measures in the post compared with preexpansion period. During the postexpansion period , defect-free care and mortality did not differ between expansion and nonexpansion states. Medicaid expansion was associated with a significant decline in uninsured HF hospitalizations but not improvements in quality of care or in-hospital mortality among sites participating in a national quality improvement initiative. Efforts beyond insurance expansion are needed to improve in-hospital outcomes for low-income patients with HF.
