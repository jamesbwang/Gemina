  Bile acids , the products of concerted host and gut bacterial metabolism , have important signaling functions within the mammalian metabolic system and a key role in digestion. Given the complexity of the mega-variate bacterial community residing in the gastrointestinal tract , studying associations between individual bacterial genera and bile acid processing remains a challenge. Here , we present a novel
