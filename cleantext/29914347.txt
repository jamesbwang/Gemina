  β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate ( HMB) is a nutritional supplement purported to enhance skeletal muscle mass and strength , as well as cognitive function in older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential for long-term HMB supplementation to preserve muscle function and cognition in aged mice , as well as provide evidence of a link between vessel-associated pericyte function and outcomes. Four- ( Adult/Ad) and 17 month-old ( Aged/Ag) C57BL/6J mice consumed chow containing 600 mg/kg BW/day of either Ca-HMB ( Ad , n = 16; Ag , n = 17) or Ca-Lactate ( Ad , n = 16; Ag , n = 17) for 6 months. HMB did not prevent age-related reductions in muscle mass , strength and coordination ( Age main effect , P < 0.05). The rate of muscle protein synthesis decreased within the mitochondrial fraction ( age main effect , P < 0.05) , and this decline was not prevented with HMB. Despite no change in muscle mass or function , an age-dependent reduction in active avoidance learning was attenuated with HMB ( Age and HMB main effects , P < 0.05). Age detrimentally impacted muscle-resident pericyte gene expression with no recovery observed with HMB , whereas no changes in brain-resident pericyte quantity or function were observed with age or HMB. The findings from this study suggest that prolonged HMB supplementation starting in adulthood may preserve cognition with age.
