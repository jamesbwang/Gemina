  We describe the design , implementation , and use of the META-pipe Authorization service. META-pipe is a complete workflow for the analysis of marine metagenomics data. We will provide META-pipe as a web based data analysis service for ELIXIR users. We have integrated our Authorization service with the ELIXIR Authorization and Authentication Infrastructure ( AAI) that allows single sign-on to services across the ELIXIR infrastructure. We use the Authorization service to authorize access to data on the META-pipe storage system and jobs in the META-pipe job queue. Our Authorization server was among the first services that integrated with ELIXIR AAI. The code is open source at: https://gitlab.com/uit-sfb/AuthService2.
