  Lomitapide is an oral inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein used to treat homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH); patients require a low-fat diet to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects and dietary supplements to prevent nutrient deficiencies. We investigated the diet and nutritional status during lomitapide treatment. Japanese patients with HoFH , who were in a phase 3 trial of lomitapide , were instructed to start low-fat diets with supplements of vitamin E and essential fatty acids 6 weeks before starting lomitapide treatment. Dietary education was conducted by registered dietitians 16 times during the study period , which included a pre-treatment run-in phase ( Weeks Ôºç 6-0) , a lomitapide treatment efficacy phase ( Weeks 0-26) and a safety phase ( Weeks 26-56). Two-day dietary records were collected at each dietary counseling session. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at Weeks 0 , 26 and 56. Eight patients completed the 56 weeks of lomitapide treatment. Their median energy intakes derived from lipids were 19.2 % and 17.9 % during the efficacy and safety phases , respectively. `` Fats and oils '' intakes , and `` Fatty meat and poultry '' intakes in two patients , were successfully reduced to achieve low-fat diets. Although intakes of energy , fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins did not differ significantly among phases , body<symptom> weight , serum fatty acid levels and vitamin E concentrations were decreased at Week 26 as compared with Week 0. HoFH patients can adhere to low-fat diets with ongoing dietary counseling. Instructions about intakes of energy , fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins , as well as periodic evaluations of nutritional status , are necessary.
