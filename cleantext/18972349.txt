  In patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot ( TOF) , a better understanding of the impact of surgical pulmonary valve replacement ( PVR) on ventricular mechanics may lead to improved indications and outcomes. Therefore , we used cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR) feature tracking analysis to quantify ventricular strain and synchrony in repaired TOF patients before and after PVR. Thirty-six repaired TOF patients ( median age 22.4 years) prospectively underwent CMR a mean of 4.5 ± 3.8 months before PVR surgery and 7.3 ± 2.1 months after PVR surgery. Feature tracking analysis on cine steady-state free precession images was used to measure right ventricular ( RV) and left ventricular ( LV) circumferential strain from short-axis views at basal , mid-ventricular , and apical levels; and longitudinal strain from 4-chamber views. Intraventricular synchrony was quantified using the maximum difference in time-to-peak strain , the standard deviation of the time-to-peak , and cross correlation delay ( CCD) metrics; interventricular synchrony was assessed using the CCD metric. Following PVR , RV end-diastolic volume , end-systolic volume , and ejection fraction declined , and LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume both increased with no significant change in the LV ejection fraction. LV global basal and apical circumferential strains , and basal synchrony improved. RV global circumferential and longitudinal strains were unchanged , and there was a varied impact on synchrony across the locations. Interventricular synchrony worsened at the midventricular level but was unchanged at the base and apex , and on 4-chamber views. Surgical PVR in repaired TOF patients led to improved LV global strain and no change in RV global strain. LV and RV synchrony parameters improved or were unchanged , and interventricular synchrony worsened at the midventricular level.
