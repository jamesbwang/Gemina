  At present , the experimental technique to produce human red blood cells in vitro is complicated , and in order to optimize the induction steps , human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into red blood cells through two induction steps. First , human pluripotent stem cells ( including Rh negative A type umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( hUCMSCRh-A) and human iPS cells ( hiPS)) were differentiated into CD31 + and CD34 + cells in BVF medium. PCR and flow cytometry were used to exam the expression of CD31 and CD34. We found that hUCMSCRh-A derived CD31 + and CD34 + cells were 5.3 % and 22.7 % , respectively; hiPS derived CD31 + and CD34 + cells were 31.2 % and 8.2 % , respectively. For the second induction step , the obtained CD31 + and CD34 + cells were differentiated into mature erythrocytes for 36 days under the addition of various growth factors. Through Giemsa staining , we found that the obtained mature erythrocytes were similar in morphology and size to normal human erythrocytes , and some obtained erythrocytes were enucleated. Globin expression was detected by real time RT-PCR , and the expression of Î²-globin was more than 20 %. The obtained erythrocytes are collected into the centrifuge tube , and then erythrocytes were naturally settled and showed the red color. Our findings provide a novel and effective method for the quantity generation of human red blood cells in vitro.
