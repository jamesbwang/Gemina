  Dry eye has become the most common ocular surface disease in China 's clinical ophthalmology. However , dry eye in children has not achieved enough attention. It lacks related information of basic data and diagnostic criteria , and there is no standard for the clinical diagnosis and treatment. As dry eye in children has its own characteristics , its diagnosis and treatment are not exactly the same as adults.

To this end , it is urgent to improve the level of clinical diagnosis and treatment of dry eye in children in China , to establish the relevant basic data , to strengthen the basic research , and to promote the prevention and treatment of dry eye in children.
