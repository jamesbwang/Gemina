  This article describes early stages in the acquisition of a first vocabulary by infants and young children. It distinguishes two major stages , the first of which operates by a stand-alone word-to-world pairing procedure and the second of which , using the evidence so acquired , builds a domain-specific syntax-sensitive structure-to-world pairing procedure. As we show , the first stage of learning is slow , restricted in character , and to some extent errorful , whereas the second procedure is determinative , rapid , and essentially errorless. Our central claim here is that the early , referentially based learning procedure succeeds at all because it is reined in by attention-focusing properties of word-to-world timing and related indicants of referential intent.
