  Sakuranetin ( SKN) , found in cherry trees and rice , is a flavanone with various pharmacological activities. It is biosynthesized from naringenin in rice or cherry trees , and the metabolism of SKN has been studied in non-human species. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic pathways of SKN in human liver microsomes and identify the phase I and phase II metabolites , as well as evaluate the potential for drug ‚Åª herb interactions through the modulation of drug metabolizing enzymes ( DMEs). HPLC-DAD and HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry were used to study the metabolic stability and identify the metabolites from human liver microsomes incubated with SKN. The potential of SKN to inhibit the DMEs was evaluated by monitoring the formation of a DME-specific product. The cytochrome P450 2B6 and 3A4-inductive effects were studied using promoter reporter assays in human hepatocarcinoma cells. The major pathways for SKN metabolism include B-ring hydroxylation , 5-
