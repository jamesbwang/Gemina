  T cells are a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in their differentiation stages. Functional states are reflected in the epigenome that confers stability in cellular identity and is therefore important for na√Øve as well as memory T cell function. In many cellular systems , changes in chromatin structure due to alterations in histone expression , histone modifications and DNA methylation are characteristic of the aging process and cause or at least contribute to cellular dysfunction in senescence. Here , we review the epigenetic changes in T cells that occur with age and discuss them in the context of canonical epigenetic marks in aging model systems as well as recent findings of chromatin accessibility changes in T cell differentiation. Remarkably , transcription factor networks driving T cell differentiation account for many of the age-associated modifications in chromatin structures suggesting that loss of quiescence and activation of differentiation pathways are major components of T cell aging.
