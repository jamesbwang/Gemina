  There are many emerging and re-emerging globally prevalent viruses for which there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral medicines. Arbidol ( ARB , umifenovir) , used clinically for decades in several countries as an anti-influenza virus drug , inhibits many other viruses. In the current study , we show that ARB inhibits six different isolates of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) , including African and Asian lineage viruses in multiple cell lines and primary human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells. ARB protects against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects. Time of addition studies indicate that ARB is most effective at suppressing ZIKV when added to cells prior to infection. Moreover , ARB inhibits pseudoviruses expressing the ZIKV Envelope glycoprotein. Thus , ARB , a broadly acting anti-viral agent with a well-established safety profile , inhibits ZIKV , likely by blocking viral entry.
