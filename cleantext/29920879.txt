  For many adolescent and young adult solid organ transplant recipients , medication non-adherence is a mortal issue. This study investigated the feasibility , acceptability , and potential efficacy of a 12-week cell phone support intervention to improve immunosuppressant medication adherence. A small sample ( N = 8) of non-adherent adolescent and young adult transplant recipients , aged 15-20.5 years , was enrolled. Cell phone support consisted of short calls each weekday including medication reminders , discussion of needs , problem-solving support , and promotion of clinic and community resources. Changes in adherence were measured by self-report and laboratory values , and intervention acceptability , adherence barriers , social support , depression<symptom> , and substance use were assessed by self-report. Pre-post effect sizes showed medium-to-large improvements in adherence , lasting through a 12-week follow-up assessment. There were also small-to-medium changes in adherence barriers , social support , and depression<symptom> However , acceptability and feasibility were limited , due to a low rate of enrollment by eligible male participants. Cell phone support interventions may promote medication adherence among adolescents and young adults. Cell phone support warrants further investigation , including a randomized controlled trial to evaluate efficacy.
