  We sought to evaluate the effect of night shift working on increasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease ( CVD) using three different predictors. One hundred and forty adult Jordanian employees were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Demographic data , anthropometric parameters , and working patterns information were documented. Metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) was diagnosed , and atherogenic index of the plasma ( AIP) and Framingham risk score were calculated. Night shift workers had a significantly higher AIP ratio compared to daytime workers ( This is the first study to assess the association between night shift work and AIP as well as the 30-year Framingham risk score as predictors of CVDs. Night shift work was associated with an increase in AIP score compared to daytime work. Also , the duration of night shifts and the number of night shifts per month significantly increased the 30-year Framingham risk among night shift workers. These findings suggest an association between night shift work and the risk of CVD and atherosclerosis. Our results highlight the need for interventional strategies to diminish the risk of CVD in night shift workers.
