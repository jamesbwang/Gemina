  Citrus greening disease , or huanglongbing ( HLB) , is currently one of the most devastating diseases of citrus. The bacteria thought to be responsible for the disease , Candidatus<pathogen> Liberibacter asiaticus impact the majority of commercial citrus species worldwide. These bacteria are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid ( ACP) , Diaphorina citri Kuwayama , which is now found in most citrus growing regions. With no known cure , ACP-vectored HLB is responsible for significant economic losses to the global citrus industry. A better understanding of the global genetic diversity of D. citri would improve current and future pest management and mitigation programs. To assess the genetic diversity of D. citri in worldwide collections , a total of 1,108 sequences belonging to ACP gathered from 27 countries in the Americas , the Caribbean , Southeast and Southwest Asia were examined for the study. 883 D. citri came from 98 locations in 18 different countries , and were sequenced using a 678bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I ( COI) gene. Additionally , 225 previously-reported D. citri COI sequences , were also included in our analysis. Analyses revealed 28 haplotypes and a low genetic diversity. This is in accordance with previous reports on the little diversity of D. citri in worldwide populations. Our analyses reveal population structure with 21 haplotypes showing geographic association , increasing the resolution for the source estimation of ACP. This study reveals the distribution of haplotypes observed in different geographic regions and likely geographic sources for D. citri introductions.
