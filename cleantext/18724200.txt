  Biapical femoral deformities are challenging to treat. In order to correct concomitant metaphyseal and diaphyseal deformities of the femur , the authors propose a double femoral controlled osteotomy with combined internal fixation , consisting of a Puddu plate and an intramedullary nail. The method was described in two patients. Results were analyzed using a visual analog scale ( VAS) , the Lysholm score , and SF-36. No complications were found. Complete consolidation of the osteotomies and radiographic alignment correction were achieved. Results were obtained with a minimum follow-up of 66 months. Both patients had improved for pain ( VAS from 60 to 40 and from 50 to 20 at reassessment) , function ( Lysholm score from 78 to 93 and from 55 to 73) and quality of life ( SF-36 , both mental- from 40.7 to 57.1 in case one and from 24.7 to 59.7 in case two- and physical- from 27.7 to 45.6 and from 28.2 to 46.8). The authors have found that this technique is a reliable , accurate , and reproducible solution for biapical deformities of the femur.
