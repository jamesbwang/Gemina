  Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS ( regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric ( αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions , explore their functions , and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies ( R4 , R7 , RZ , and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G
