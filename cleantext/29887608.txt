  To test if diastolic dysfunction measured on day one of age is associated with the need for invasive ventilation in preterm infants. We conducted a retrospective observational tissue Doppler echocardiographic study over the first 12 h of age for infants born < 32 weeks who were invasively ventilated , and infants on continuous positive pressure ventilation ( CPAP). One hundred and eighty-three infants were included ( 27 ± 2 weeks and 999 ± 296 g). Invasively ventilated infants ( ( n = 96 ( 53 %)) had lower left ventricular ( LV) e ' ( 3.4 ± 1.0 vs. 4.1 ± 1.5 cm/s , p < 0.01) and lower LV ea ' ratio ( 0.8 ± 0.2 vs. 1.0 ± 0.4 , p < 0.01) , even after adjusting for common neonatal confounders ( LV e ' adjusted OR 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.45- 0.87 , p < 0.01; LV ea ' adjusted OR 0.14 , 95 % CI 0.03-0.68 , p = 0.01). LV diastolic dysfunction is independently associated with a higher risk for invasive ventilation on day one of age.
