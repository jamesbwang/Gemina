  Common performance metrics for outpatient clinics define the time between patient arrival and entry into an examination room as `` waiting time. '' Time spent in the room is considered processing time. This characterization systematically ignores time spent in the examination room waiting for service. If these definitions are used , performance will consistently understate total waiting times and overstate processing times. Correcting such errors will provide a better understanding of system behavior. In a radiation oncology service in an urban academic clinic , we collected data from a patient management system for 84 patients with 4 distinct types of visits: consultations , follow-ups , on-treatment visits , and nurse visits. Examination room entry and exit times were collected with a real-time location system for relevant care team members. Novel metrics of clinic performance were created , including the ratio of face time ( ie , time during which the patient is with a practitioner) to total cycle time , which we label face-time efficiency. Attending physician interruptions occurred when the attending is called out of the room during a patient visit , and coordination-related delays are defined as waits for another team member. Face-time efficiency levels for consults , follow-ups , on-treatment visits , and nurse visits were 30.1 % , 22.9 % , 33.0 % , and 25.6 % , respectively. Attending physician interruptions averaged 6.7 minutes per patient. If these interruptions were eliminated , face-time efficiencies would rise to 33.2 % , 29.2 % , 34.4 % , and 25.6 % , respectively. Eliminating all coordination-related delays would increase these values to 41.3 % , 38.9 % , 54.7 % , and 38.7 % , respectively. A real-time location system can be used to augment a patient management system and automate data collection to provide improved descriptions of clinic performance.
