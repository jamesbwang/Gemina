  In this study , a novel plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria ( PGPR) , the bacterial strain Paenibacillus<pathogen> pabuli P7S ( PP7S) , showed promising plant growth-promoting effects. Furthermore , it induced anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis. When co-cultivated with PP7S , there was a significant increase in anthocyanin content and biomass of Arabidopsis seedlings compared with those of the control. The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed higher expression of many key genes regulating anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in PP7S-treated seedlings when compared with that of the control. Furthermore , higher expression of pathogen-related genes and microbe-associated molecular pattern genes was also observed in response to PP7S , indicating that the PGPR triggered the induced systemic response ( ISR) in A. thaliana. These results suggest that PP7S promotes plant growth in A. thaliana and increases anthocyanin biosynthesis by triggering specific ISRs in plant.
