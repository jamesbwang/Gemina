  To assess effectiveness of the video-based m-health system providing videos dictated by physicians for health education and symptom self-management for patients with IC/BPS. An m-health system was designed to provide videos for weekly health education and symptom flare self-management. O'Leary-Sant index and VAS scale as well as SF-36 health survey were administrated to evaluate the disease severity and quality of life ( QoL) , respectively. A total of 60 IC/BPS patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either control group ( 30 patients) or study group ( 30 patients) in sequence depending on their orders to visit our urological clinic. Patients in both control and study groups received regular treatments , while those in the study group received additional video-based intervention. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the outcomes between baseline and post-intervention for both groups. The outcomes of video-based intervention were also compared with the text-based intervention conducted in our previous study. After video-based intervention , patients in the study group exhibited significant effect manifested in all disease severity and QoL assessments except the VAS pain scale , while no significance was found in the control group. Moreover , the study group exhibited more significant net improvements than the control group in 7 SF-36 constructs , except the mental health. The limitations include short intervention duration ( 8 weeks) and different study periods between text-based and video-based interventions. Video-based intervention is effective in improving the QoL of IC/BPS patients and outperforms the text-based intervention even in a short period of intervention.
