  Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea , however , is primarily based on lesion<symptom> studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging , without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency , including overlapping and different regions , in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency , primarily in frontal regions , and category fluency , in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency , with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts , respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion<symptom> studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency , each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes , can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.
