  Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg vs placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) and moderate renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) , 45-59 mL/min/1 .73 m In this double-blind , parallel group , Phase 3 study ( NCT02413398 , clinicaltrials.gov) patients with inadequately controlled T2D ( HbA1c 7.0 % -11.0 %) were randomized ( 1:1) to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily ( N = 160) or matching placebo ( N = 161) for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by pre-enrolment glucose-lowering therapy. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24. At Week 24 , compared with placebo , dapagliflozin significantly decreased HbA1c ( difference ( 95 % CI) , -0.34 % ( -0.53 , -0.15); P < 0.001) , body<symptom> weight ( difference ( 95 % CI) , -1.25 kg ( -1.90 , -0.59); P < 0.001) , fasting plasma glucose ( difference ( 95 % CI) , -0.9 mmol/L ( -1.5 , -0.4); P = 0.001) and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( difference ( 95 % CI) , -3.1 mm Hg ( -6.3 , 0.0); P < 0.05). Decreases from baseline in eGFR were greater with dapagliflozin than placebo at Week 24 ( -2.49 mL/min/1 .73 m The findings of this study ( NCT02413398 , clinicaltrials.gov) support the positive benefit/risk profile of dapagliflozin for the treatment of patients with T2D and CKD 3A.
