  Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( MSCs) have gained considerable popularity owing to the vast possibilities and lack of ethical constraints and risks normally associated with other stem cells , such as embryonic stem cells. However , they are morphologically indistinguishable from fibroblasts. This review aims to assess the similarities and differences between the two cell types , and the possible relationship between them. We found that the two cells seem almost identical with respect to their surface immunophenotype , proliferation , and differentiation capacities and even , to an extent , their gene expression profiles and immunomodulatory capacities. There are some differences in capability between the two cells , with MSCs being more efficient than fibroblasts. Even so , the similarities are so striking , that , if we were to follow the current criteria provided by the International Society for Cellular Therapy , fibroblasts ought to be named as MSCs. One promising marker is their DNA methylation profiles. Nonetheless , without any other marker to differentiate between the cells in the first place , it would be difficult to find a definitive marker. Interestingly , the differences observed between the two cells have also been observed between young and old MSCs. This also seems to be true of certain cell surface markers. Therefore , it is possible that fibroblasts are in fact aged MSCs and that the two cells are the same.
