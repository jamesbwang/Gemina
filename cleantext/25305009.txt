  Open Bankart surgery is the main treatment procedure in patients with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation , especially in cases with glenoid bone defect. The goal of this study was to determine the outcomes after open Bankart surgery in cases of recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation with glenoid bone defects and concomitant Hill-Sachs lesions<symptom>. Between 2006 and 2010 , 89 patients with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation and concomitant glenoid bone defects ( 10-30 %) and Hill-Sachs lesions<symptom> undergoing open Bankart surgery were reviewed. The mean follow-up after surgery was 7 years ( 5.5-9.5 years). The recurrence rate as well as the degree of shoulder pain and daily activity level was determined subjectively based on the visual analogue scale ( VAS) and activity daily living scale ( ADLs). Shoulder range of motion ( ROM) in abduction and external rotation was compared with contralateral side; and finally , the American shoulder and elbow score ( ASES) and constant-Murley score ( CMS) were calculated. Over 7 years of follow-up , a total of 15 patients ( 16.8 %) undergoing surgery were found to have instability ( 3 patients ( 3.3 %) with dislocation and 12 patients with ( 13.4 %) subluxation). Patients with postsurgical instability had significantly larger glenoid bone defects ( Open Bankart surgery with anteroinferior capsular shift for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation with up to 30 % glenoid bone defect and Hill-Sachs lesion<symptom> provided desirable results in terms of shoulder function and recurrence rate. Bankart surgery is a successful and practical option in these patients and can be considered as an alternative to other procedures.
