  Patients undergoing thoracotomy frequently experience acute<symptom> pain<symptom> and chronic post-thoracotomy pain ( CPTP). There are few articles relating to the investigations on the effects of preoperative single-dose thoracic paravertebral block ( PSTPVB) on acute<symptom> pain<symptom> and CPTP. We tested the hypothesis that adding PSTPVB to intravenous ( IV) patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) would reduce acute<symptom> pain<symptom> scores and decrease the incidence and intensity of CPTP. Fifty-six patients undergoing elective thoracotomy were randomized to receive PSTPVB in addition to IV PCA ( group T) or IV PCA alone ( group C). A single 20-mL injection of 0.50 % ropivacaine plus 10 mg dexamethasone in saline was administered preoperatively under ultrasound guidance; sufentanil was used for IV PCA. The acute<symptom> pain<symptom> intensity at rest and at coughing based on verbal rating scale , postoperative sufentanil consumption , and complications were evaluated at 6 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after surgery. The incidence and intensity of CPTP were evaluated at 3 months after surgery. Group T had significantly less acute<symptom> pain<symptom> compared with group C at all measurement times both at rest and at coughing ( P < .05). The PCA cumulative sufentanil consumption , complications , and the incidence of CPTP between the 2 groups was not statistically significant ( P > .05). The intensity of CPTP was significantly higher in group C than in group T ( P < .05). This study indicated that adding PSTPVB to IV PCA improved acute postoperative pain and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in patients undergoing thoracotomy , but did not reduce the incidence of CPTP.
