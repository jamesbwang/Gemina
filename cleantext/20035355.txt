  The aim of this study was to analyze the experience of two surgeons who have different laparoscopic skills and case volume , with single-site robotic cholecystectomy ( SSRC) and evaluate their learning curves. All SSRCs performed between March 2013 and April 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided among two surgeons based on the surgeon 's level of laparoscopic skills and case volume. Surgeon 1 had experience in advanced laparoscopy while surgeon 2 had basic laparoscopic skills. Patients ' demographic data , intraoperative and short-term postoperative results were assessed. The analysis included 102 patients for surgeon 1 and 15 patients for surgeon 2. There were no major or minor complications in either cohort. Operative time was significantly longer for surgeon 2 , conversion to laparoscopy rate was 4 % for surgeon 1 compared to 20 % for surgeon 2 , P = 0.044 , which is statistically significant. SSRC is an easy and safe procedure that can be quickly learned and performed in a reproducible manner by surgeons with experienced laparoscopic skills and greater case volume.
