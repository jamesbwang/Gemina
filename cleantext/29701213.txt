  Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hBM-MSCs) are considered a great promise in the repair and regeneration of bone. Considerable efforts have been oriented towards uncovering the best strategy to promote stem cells osteogenic differentiation. In previous studies , hBM-MSCs exposed to physical stimuli such as pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMFs) or directly seeded on nanostructured titanium surfaces ( TiO2) were shown to improve their differentiation to osteoblasts in osteogenic condition. In the present study , the effect of a daily PEMF-exposure on osteogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs seeded onto nanostructured TiO2 ( with clusters under 100 nm of dimension) was investigated. TiO2-seeded cells were exposed to PEMF ( magnetic field intensity: 2 mT; intensity of induced electric field: 5 mV; frequency: 75 Hz) and examined in terms of cell physiology modifications and osteogenic differentiation. Results showed that PEMF exposure affected TiO2-seeded cells osteogenesis by interfering with selective calcium-related osteogenic pathways , and greatly enhanced hBM-MSCs osteogenic features such as the expression of early/late osteogenic genes and protein production ( e.g. , ALP , COL-I , osteocalcin and osteopontin) and ALP activity. Finally , PEMF-treated cells resulted to secrete into conditioned media higher amounts of BMP-2 , DCN and COL-I than untreated cell cultures. These findings confirm once more the osteoinductive potential of PEMF , suggesting that its combination with TiO2 nanostructured surface might be a great option in bone tissue engineering applications.
