  In order to provide best control of the regeneration process for each individual patient , the release of protein drugs administered during surgery may need to be timely adapted and/or delayed according to the progress of healing/regeneration. This study aims to establish a multifunctional implant system for a local on-demand release , which is applicable for various types of proteins. It was hypothesized that a tubular multimaterial container kit , which hosts the protein of interest as a solution or gel formulation , would enable on-demand release if equipped with the capacity of diameter reduction upon external stimulation. Using devices from poly ( ɛ-caprolactone) networks , it could be demonstrated that a shape-memory effect activated by heat or NIR light enabled on-demand tube shrinkage. The decrease of diameter of these shape-memory tubes ( SMT) allowed expelling the payload as demonstrated for several proteins including SDF-1α , a therapeutically relevant chemotactic protein , to achieve e.g. continuous release with a triggered add-on dosing ( open tube) or an on-demand onset of bolus or sustained release ( sealed tube). Considering the clinical relevance of protein factors in ( stem) cell attraction to lesions<symptom> and the progress in monitoring biomarkers in body fluids , such on-demand release systems may be further explored e.g. in heart , nerve , or bone regeneration in the future.
