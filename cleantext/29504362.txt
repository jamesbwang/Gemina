  The purpose of this article is to study the involvement of inflammatory mast cells ( MCs) in depression<symptom> which may be inhibited by IL-37. We evaluate mast cells in depression<symptom> on the basis of our previous experimental data , and using the most relevant studies reported in the literature. Dysfunction of mood , feelings , and thoughts is a major risk factor for several metabolic diseases and may influence the physiology of the body leading to depression<symptom>. Depression<symptom> , present in mastocytosis , is an important endogenous process that promotes the activation of meningeal cell receptors through a low-grade neurogenic chronic inflammation<symptom> , and MCs. Mast cells are localized along meningeal blood vessels and connective tissues , as well as between the ganglion cells and nerve fibers. They are present in the hypothalamus of mammalian brains capable of communication with nerves. MCs are classically activated by binding to IgE cross-link FcÎµRI high-affinity receptor leading to release a plethora of mediators responsible for the generation of inflammatory cytokines. Corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH) , produced by MCs , has been found in microglial cells where it regulates immune cells and contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including depression<symptom> Inflammatory cytokines released by MCs aggravate depression<symptom> and could be partially inhibited by IL-37. A detailed understanding of the interaction between the immune system , including MCs and depression<symptom> , is necessary in order to address an effective therapy which could include IL-37. As a consequence , the concepts reviewed here have treatment implications.
