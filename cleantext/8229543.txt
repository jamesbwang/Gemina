  Breast milk cholesterol content may imply to affect short- and long-term cholesterol homeostasis in the offspring. However , mechanisms of regulating milk cholesterol concentration are only partly understood. We used different mouse models to assess the impact of high cholesterol diet ( HC)- or genetically-induced hypercholesterolaemia on milk cholesterol content. At day 14 postpartum we determined milk , plasma and tissue lipids in wild type ( WT) , LDL receptor knockout ( Ldlr-/-) , and ATP-binding cassette transporter G8 knockout ( Abcg8-/-) mice fed either low- or 0.5 % HC diet. In chow-fed mice , plasma cholesterol was higher in Ldlr-/- dams compared to WT. HC-feeding increased plasma cholesterol in all three models compared to chow diet. Despite the up to 5-fold change in plasma cholesterol concentration , the genetic and dietary conditions did not affect milk cholesterol levels. To detect possible compensatory changes , we quantified de novo cholesterol synthesis in mammary gland and liver , which was strongly reduced in the various hypercholesterolaemic conditions. Together , these data suggest that milk cholesterol concentration in mice is not affected by conditions of maternal hypercholesterolaemia and is maintained at stable levels via ABCG8- and LDLR-independent mechanisms. The robustness of milk cholesterol levels might indicate an important physiological function of cholesterol supply to the offspring.
