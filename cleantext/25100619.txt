  Frailty in elderly is very much familiar with a decline in the musculoskeletal system. Muscle degeneration in the lower organism was observed due to loss of anti-oxidant protein Sestrin. The aim of the study is to determine the level of Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 in the serum of frail and non-frail elderly to associate their impact in frailty syndrome<disease>. Subjects with age â‰¥ 65 years were enrolled from Geriatric Medicine OPD of All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi ( N = 92). Among them , 51 subjects were identified as frail and rest 41 were regarded as non-frail according to `` deficit accumulation model of Rockwood. '' The study was performed by surface plasmon resonance and validated by western blot. Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 were found to be significantly reduced in frail compare to non-frail elderly. Furthermore , even after the adjustment for age , gender and education , the level of Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 remain significantly lower across the groups. The Sestrin1 level was significantly lower in various categories like age , gender , BMI , education , ADL , number of co-morbidity along with other clinico-pathological features. ROC analysis also revealed the distinction of frail and non-frail in respect to serum Sestrin1 and Sestrin2. This study highlighted the new and promising role of serum Sestrin in frail and non-frail elderly. In future , it can be utilized as molecular marker to assess the potential diagnostic value for clinical purpose.
