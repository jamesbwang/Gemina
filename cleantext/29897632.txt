  We prospectively examined the effect of antiepileptic ( AED) cotherapy on steady state plasma concentrations of perampanel ( PMP) in epileptic patients. We classified AEDs as strong enzyme inducers ( carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , oxcarbazepine) , not strong enzyme inducers/not inhibitors ( levetiracetam , lamotrigine , topiramate , rufinamide , lacosamide , zonisamide , clobazam) , and enzyme inhibitors ( valproic acid ( VPA)). The main outcome was the comparison of PMP plasma concentration to weight-adjusted dose ratio ( C/D; ( Î¼g/mL)/ mg kg
