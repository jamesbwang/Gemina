  Healthcare expenditure ( HCE) spent during an individual 's last year of life accounts for a high share of lifetime HCE. This finding is puzzling because an investment in health is unlikely to have a sufficiently long payback period. However , Becker et al. ( 2007) and Philipson et al. ( 2010) have advanced a theory designed to explain high willingness to pay ( WTP) for an extension of life close to its end. Their testable implications are complemented by the concept of ` pain of risk bearing ' introduced by Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger ( 2006). They are tested using a discrete choice experiment performed in 2014 , involving 1,529 Swiss adults. An individual setting where the price attribute is substantial out-of-pocket payment for a novel drug for treatment of terminal cancer is distinguished from a societal one , where it is an increase in contributions to social health insurance. Most of the economic predictions receive empirical support.
