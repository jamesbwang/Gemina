  To detect possible pathogenic virus ( es) in woad ( Isatis tinctoria) cultivated at Institute of Medicinal Plant Development in Beijing , reverse transcription ( RT)- PCR was performed using total RNA of symptomatic woad leaves with primers for poty- , polero- , tobamovirus , broad bean wilt virus 2 ( BBWV2) and cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV). A 657 bp fragment was amplified from symptomatic woad using CMV primers. Sequencing and BLAST analysis indicated that this fragment shared 99 % nucleotide identity and 100 % amino acid identity with CMV-Vi isolate. The isolate was named CMV-Isatis tinctorial ( CMV-It). Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of CP genes showed that CMV-It clustered with CMV-K and belonged to subgroup I. To our knowledge , this is first identification of CMV in woad by RT-PCR and the CP gene was analyzed. This work provided data for research and control of woad mosaic disease.
