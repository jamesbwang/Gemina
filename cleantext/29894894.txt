  It is established that the ovary and estrogen are essential to bovine mammary development with the onset of puberty. Recent studies have shown that ovariectomy in the very early prepubertal period , well before onset of puberty , also dramatically impairs mammary growth. Similarly , prepubertal heifers treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen ( TAM) also exhibit markedly impaired mammary growth in correspondence with reduced estrogen receptor Î± ( ESR1) expression. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of TAM on the mammary stroma and specifically to determine if the reported decrease in mammary development was related to changes in TAM-induced alterations in the stroma surrounding the mammary parenchyma. Briefly , 16 Holstein heifers calves were randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups: TAM-injected or control. Calves were administered TAM ( 0.3 mg kg
