  The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However , despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods , which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for `` traditional '' orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling , we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication , according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery , which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the `` reverse perturbation '' hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins , then , on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that , in addition to known allosteric sites , the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions , which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication , and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site 's structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.
