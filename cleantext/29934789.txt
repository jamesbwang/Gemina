  The in vivo analysis of corneal biomechanics in patients with keratoconus is especially of interest with respect to diagnosis , follow-up and monitoring of the disease. For a better understanding it is necessary to describe the potential of dynamic Scheimpflug measurements for the detection and interpretation of biomechanical changes in keratoconus. The current state of analyzing biomechanical changes in keratoconus with the Corvis ST ( Oculus Optikger√§te GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany) is described. This technique represents a new approach for understanding corneal biomechanics. Furthermore , it was investigated whether the device can biomechanically quantify a rigidity increasing effect of therapeutic UV-crosslinking and whether early stages of keratoconus can be detected using dynamic Scheimpflug analysis. In patients with keratoconus , the in vivo analysis of corneal biomechanics using dynamic Scheimpflug measurements as a supplementary procedure can be of advantage with respect to disease management. By optimization of screening of subclinical keratoconus stages , this method widens the analytic spectrum regarding diagnosis and follow-up of the disease; however , further studies are required to evaluate whether visual outcome of affected patients can be improved by earlier diagnosis.
