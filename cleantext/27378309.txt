  Hemoglobin ( Hb) is a critical molecule necessary for all vertebrates to maintain aerobic metabolism. Hb-oxygen ( O ODA allows for the quantitation of oxygenated Hb at given time points during Hb deoxygenation on a 96-well plate. This assay was validated by comparing the ability of 500 Hb modifiers to alter the Hb-O A correlation ( With a cost-effective , simple , rapid , and highly adaptable assay , the ODA will allow researchers to rapidly characterize Hb-O
