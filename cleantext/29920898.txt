  Diagnosis codes are inadequate for accurately identifying herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( HZ) ophthalmicus ( HZO). There is significant lack of population-based studies on HZO due to the high expense of manual review of medical records. To assess whether HZO can be identified from the clinical notes using natural language processing ( NLP). To investigate the epidemiology of HZO among HZ population based on the developed approach. A retrospective cohort analysis. A total of 49914 southern California residents aged over 18 years , who had a new diagnosis of HZ. An NLP-based algorithm was developed and validated with the manually curated validation data set ( n = 461). The algorithm was applied on over 1 million clinical notes associated with the study population. HZO versus non-HZO cases were compared by age , sex , race and co-morbidities. We measured the accuracy of NLP algorithm. NLP algorithm achieved 95.6 % sensitivity and 99.3 % specificity. Compared to the diagnosis codes , NLP identified significant more HZO cases among HZ population ( 13.9 % vs. 1.7 %). Compared to the non-HZO group , the HZO group was older , had more males , had more Whites and had more outpatient visits. We developed and validated an automatic method to identify HZO cases with high accuracy. As one of the largest studies on HZO , our finding emphasizes the importance of preventing HZ in the elderly population. This method can be a valuable tool to support population-based studies and clinical care of HZO in the era of big data.
