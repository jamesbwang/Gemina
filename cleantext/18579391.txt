  Orbital floor fractures alone or in conjunction with other facial skeletal fractures are the most commonly encountered midfacial fractures. The technological advances in 3-dimensional ( 3D) printing allow the physical prototyping of 3D models , so creates an accurate representation of the patient 's specific anatomy. A 56-year-old Caucasian man with severe hypoglobus and enophthalmos with an extensive blowout fracture was scheduled for reconstruction. First , 3D physical models were created based on the computed tomography scan datasets from patient. Then , this model was used as templates for preoperative trimming the implant. Surgical reconstruction with the aid of pre-shaped , customized prosthesis based on 3D anatomical model resulted in significant esthetic and clinical improvement. It is possible to build anatomical models on the basis of computed tomography scan datasets. It is relatively inexpensive and can be used in the repair of complex orbital floor fractures.
