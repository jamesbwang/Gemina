  For the risk , progression , and response to treatment of many complex<disease> diseases<disease> , it has been increasingly recognized that genetic interactions ( including gene-gene and gene-environment interactions) play important roles beyond the main genetic and environmental effects. In practical genetic interaction analyses , model mis-specification and outliers/contaminations in response variables and covariates are not uncommon , and demand robust analysis methods. Compared with their nonrobust counterparts , robust genetic interaction analysis methods are significantly less popular but are gaining attention fast. In this article , we provide a comprehensive review of robust genetic interaction analysis methods , on their methodologies and applications , for both marginal and joint analysis , and for addressing model mis-specification as well as outliers/contaminations in response variables and covariates.
