  This review argues for a central role of the lateral hypothalamus in those deviant forms of aggression , which result from chronic glucocorticoid deficiency. Currently , this nucleus is considered a key region of the mechanisms that control predatory aggression. However , recent findings demonstrate that it is strongly activated by aggression in subjects with a chronically downregulated hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA) axis; moreover , this activation is causally involved in the emergence of violent aggression. The review has two parts. In the first part , we review human findings demonstrating that under certain conditions , strong stressors downregulate the HPA-axis on the long run , and that the resulting glucocorticoid deficiency is associated with violent aggression including aggressive delinquency and aggression-related psychopathologies. The second part addresses neural mechanisms in animals. We show that the experimental downregulation of HPA-axis function elicits violent aggression in rodents , and the activation of the brain circuitry that originally subserves predatory aggression accompanies this change. The lateral hypothalamus is not only an integral part of this circuitry , but can elicit deviant and violent forms of aggression. Finally , we formulate a hypothesis on the pathway that connects unfavorable social conditions to violent aggression via the neural circuitry that includes the lateral hypothalamus.
