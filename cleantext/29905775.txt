  Fixed pulmonary hypertension ( fPH) is a contraindication for heart transplantation ( HTX). Left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) implantation as a bridge to candidacy can reverse fPH in patients with terminal heart<symptom> failure<symptom> by chronic left ventricular unloading. We report our institutional experience with terminal heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients and fPH that were successfully bridged to candidacy and underwent subsequent HTX. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 79 patients with terminal heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and fPH who were successfully bridged to candidacy for HTX with 6 different LVAD devices at our centre from October 1998 to September 2016 ( Novacor n = 4 , MicroMed DeBakey n = 29 , DuraHeart n = 2 , HeartMate II n = 14 , HVAD n = 29 and MVAD n = 1). Median duration of LVAD support was 288 days ( range 45-2279 days). Within the same timeframe , a control group of 48 patients underwent HTX after bridge-to-transplant LVAD therapy for reasons other than PH. Study end points were ( i) development of fPH after LVAD implantation , ( ii) post-transplant outcomes and ( iii) incidence of severe adverse events. Pulmonary vascular resistance , assessed by vasodynamic catheterization , was 4.3 ± 1.8 WU before LVAD implantation. After a median support period of 89 days ( interquartile range 4-156 days) , pulmonary vascular resistance decreased to 2.0 ± 0.9 WU ( P ≤ 0.001) , and patients were listed for HTX. Median duration of LVAD support in the study group was 288 days ( 45-2279 days). We observed 2 patients ( 2.5 %) with acute right heart<symptom> failure<symptom> who required extracorporeal mechanical support after HTX in the study group. Long-term post-transplant survival between the study group ( 3 years: 83.5 % , 5 years: 81.0 %) and the control group ( 3 years: 87.5 % , 5 years: 85.4 %) was comparable ( log-rank: P = 0.585). LVAD implantation as a bridge to candidacy reverses fPH in patients with terminal heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Post-HTX survival is excellent and comparable to results obtained in patients without fPH at the time of HTX listing.
