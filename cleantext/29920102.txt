  This work reports gold-catalyzed ( 4 + 1)- annulation reactions between 1,4-diyn-3-ols and isoxazoles or benzisoxazoles to yield pyrrole derivatives. The reaction chemoselectivity is controlled by an initial attack of an isoxazole at a less hindered alkyne to form gold carbenes , further inducing a 1,2-migration of a second alkyne group. A broad substrate scope of 1,4-diyn-3-ols , isoxazoles and even benzisoxazoles highlighted the reaction utility.
