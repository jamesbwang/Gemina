  A case of 25- years-old female with NET deriving from Meckel 's diverticulum is described. The patient had one year history of dermatological skin problems. Ultrasound examination of abdomen performed because of arterial hypertension , revealed multiple hepatic lesions<symptom> , which was confirmed in contrast enhanced CT.. The typical contrast enhanced metastatic lesions<symptom> in CT and elevated levels of chromogranin A suggested NET of unknown origin. SRS with 99mTc-HYNICTOC was perform for primary tumor localization , and revealed liver and paraaortic lymph nodes metastases , but no sign of primary tumor location. As a next step for primary tumor localization 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was done , which revealed focus of increased uptake in small intestine considered to be the primary tumor site. The imaging and clinical history of patient was discussed on ENETS Tumor Board. Due to location of primary tumor in the small intestine with no anatomical changes in CT , laparotomy guided with gamma probe after 68Ga-DOTATATE injection was performed. During surgery procedure , the primary tumor was hardly palpable in the tip of Meckel 's diverticulum , confirmed by gamma probe. After surgery , tandem peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) was started. Patient received 4 doses of 90Y/177Lu-DOTATATE with total activity of 360 mCi ( 13.32 GBq). The three months follow up 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT had shown stable disease of patient. The presented case showed importance role of multidisciplinary team cooperation in patient management. Use of RGS is essential in cases like presented , when the tumor can not be localized only by surgical palpation.
