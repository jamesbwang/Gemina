  The goal of this paper is to establish the truth of the following conditional: if a global workspace theory of phenomenal consciousness<symptom> is correct , and is fully reductive in nature , then we should stop asking questions about consciousness<symptom> in nonhuman animals-not because those questions are too hard to answer , but because there are no substantive facts to discover. The argument in support of this conditional turns on the idea that while global broadcasting is all-or-nothing in the human mind , it is framed in terms that imply gradations across species. Yet our concept of phenomenal consciousness<symptom> does n't permit mental states to be to some degree conscious. Before getting to that argument , however , and in order to motivate the subsequent discussion , some of the virtues of global workspace theory are displayed.
