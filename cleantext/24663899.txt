  We amend the general belief that waves with extended spherical wavefront focus at their center of curvature. Instead , when the spherical symmetry of waves is broken by propagating them through a finite aperture along an average direction , the forward/backward symmetry is broken and the focal volume shifts its center backward along that direction. The extent of this focal shift increases as smaller apertures are used , up to the point that the nominal focal plane is out of focus. Furthermore , the loss of axial symmetry with noncircular apertures causes distinct focal shifts in distinct axial planes , and the resulting astigmatism possibly degrades the axial focusing resolution. Using experiments and simulations , focal shift with noncircular apertures is described for classical and temporal focusing. The usefulness of these conclusions to improve imaging resolution is demonstrated in a high-resolution optical microscopy application , namely line-temporal focusing microscopy. These conclusions follow from fundamental symmetries of the wave geometry and matter for an increasing number of emerging optical techniques. This work offers a general framework and strategy to understand and improve virtually any wave-based application whose efficacy depends on optimal focusing and may be helpful when information is transmitted by waves in applications from electromagnetic communications , to biological and astronomical imaging , to lithography and even warfare.
