  Depending on the strength of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion , successful colonizers of plant communities show varying degrees of similarity to resident species with respect to functional traits. For the present study , colonizer 's performance was assessed in relation to the degree of fit with the resident community , and in addition , in relation to the community 's trait profile and the environmental factors at the study locations. The two-year field experiment investigated the relative growth rates of 130 species that had been transplanted into German grassland communities varying in intensities of land-use. The transplanted species were selected in accordance with the following scenarios: species with highly similar or dissimilar traits to residents , species with highest degree of co-occurrence with resident species and species chosen randomly from the local species pool. The performance of transplanted phytometers depended on the scenario according to which the species were selected , on community trait diversity , and in addition , often on the interaction of both and on land use intensity. The total amount of explained variance in performance was low , but increased considerably when species identity was taken into account. In general , individuals in the co-occurrence scenario performed better than those selected based on trait information or those selected randomly. Different predictors were important in different seasons , demonstrating a limited temporal validity of performance models.
