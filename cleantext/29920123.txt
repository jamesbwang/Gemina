  The objective of this article is to evaluate the potential effects of beta-glucan and vitamin D supplementation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. We evaluated the levels of several parameters of inflammatory reactions ( C-reactive protein ( CRP) , serum amyloid A ( SAA) , and interleukin- ( IL-) 6) , leptin , and vitamin D. Using a 3-month interval , we divided the patients into three groups: ( 1) supplemented with beta-glucan and vitamin D , ( 2) supplemented with vitamin D and placebo , and ( 3) supplemented with vitamin D alone. By this division , we aim not only to observe whether beta-glucan can increase the effects of vitamin D , but also to eliminate the potential effects of placebo. The doses of vitamin D corresponded to phototype , weight , age , and sex of the individual. Fifty-two diabetic retinopathy patients were selected for our study. We found significant vitamin D deficits in all cases , even after three months of supplementation with vitamin D. Significant changes in levels of CRP were observed in the beta-glucan-supplemented group; levels of SAA and IL-6 were not changed. Leptin levels were significantly lowered in the beta-glucan-supplemented group and increased in the other groups. More detailed studies and/or longer supplementation is necessary.
