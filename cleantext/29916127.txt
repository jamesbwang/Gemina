  Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein that actively contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Here , we hypothesized that it could be a marker of bone metastasis formation. To address this question , we used two polyclonal antibodies directed against the whole molecule or its C-terminal domain to explore the expression of intact and truncated forms of periostin in the serum and tissues ( lung , heart , bone) of wild-type and periostin-deficient mice. In normal bones , periostin was expressed in the periosteum and specific periostin proteolytic fragments were found in bones , but not in soft tissues. In animals bearing osteolytic lesions<symptom> caused by 4T1 cells , C-terminal intact periostin ( iPTN) expression disappeared at the invasive front of skeletal tumors where bone-resorbing osteoclasts were present. In vitro , we found that periostin was a substrate for osteoclast-derived cathepsin K , generating proteolytic fragments that were not recognized by anti-periostin antibodies directed against iPTN. In vivo , using an in-house sandwich immunoassay aimed at detecting iPTN only , we observed a noticeable reduction of serum periostin levels (- 26 %; P < 0.002) in animals bearing osteolytic lesions<symptom> caused by 4T1 cells. On the contrary , this decrease was not observed in women with breast cancer and bone metastases when periostin was measured with a human assay detecting total periostin. Collectively , these data showed that mouse periostin was degraded at the bone metastatic sites , potentially by cathepsin K , and that the specific measurement of iPTN in serum should assist in detecting bone metastasis formation in breast cancer.
