  The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements ( ICRU) volumes are standardized volume definitions used in radiation oncology practice that have evolved over time to account for advancements in technology and radiation planning. The current definitions have strengths but also practical limitations. The main limitation is related to the process of accounting for tumor motion during treatment. As radiotherapeutic techniques become more precise , motion interplay effects and anatomical changes during treatment must be taken into account to ensure accurate and safe delivery of treatment. Adaptive replanning can help to mitigate the effect of these uncertainties and widen the therapeutic ratio by maximizing dose to the tumor and protecting critical normal structures. As adaptive replanning becomes more common , standardization of how adaptive therapy is implemented and reported will become necessary.
