  Malnutrition of pregnant women can slow down dental tissue development in offspring , cause growth of tooth decay and other disruptions , associated with changes amount of biogenic elements ( BE) , which are received into child in the womb body. The aim of this study-determination of the BE in the enamel and blood serum of mother rats , who had unbalanced nutrition with excess or lack of nutrients during the pregnancy. The content of Ca , Mg , Cu , Fe , P and Zn was studied in 129 species 1- and 2-month offspring. Reduction of BE in the enamel and blood serum mote often exist and more raised in pups , whose prenatal development took place under a shortage of nutrients. The direction of content changes of BE in pups and their degree of intensity are not identical in the enamel and blood serum. Certain pattern was identified between the content in the enamel and blood serum only two elements- Ca ( direct correlation) and Fe ( negative correlation). Irregularities of BE imbalance in the enamel during mothers ' unbalanced nutrition at the time of pregnancy threaten by negative effects in terms of growth various pathological conditions and diseases of dentition apparatus their offspring in later life.
