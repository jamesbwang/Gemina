  Chronic lymphoedema ( CLE) is a burdensome disease of multiple causes leading to significant reductions in health-related quality of life ( HRQoL). A specific method to assess HRQoL is the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for lymphedema ( FLQA-L) , which consists of 92 items. To develop and validate a short form of the FLQA-L with improved psychometric properties and feasibility. The FLQA-L validation data were re-analysed by patients and experts. The application of factor analysis enabled the exclusion of lower load items. An optimized short version of the questionnaire ( FLQA-LS) with 33 items was generated and tested in a validation study on patients with different forms of CLE. n = 348 patients with CLE of the upper or lower extremities were included ( mean age 57.3 years , range: 24-89 , 90.8 % female) and data from n = 301 could be analysed. 42.8 % of the patients suffered from secondary lymphedema , 23.6 % from primary lymphoedema , 9.5 % from lipoedema and 24.1 % were diagnosed with lipo-lymphoedema. Lower extremities were mostly affected ( 64.4 % of the patients presented with leg involvement and 17.5 % with both arm and leg impairment). The FLQA-LS showed good internal consistence with high Cronbach 's alpha in the subscales and in the global scale , between 0.79 and 0.94. Regarding convergent validity , a good correlation was found with the general HRQoL questionnaire EQ-5D ( r = 0.72 , p < 0.001). FLQA-LS is an improved version of the FLQA-L questionnaire for chronic lymphedema. It demonstrated validity and feasibility and can be easily used in clinical practice and research studies.
