  Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment in medically intractable dystonia , with the globus pallidus internus ( GPi) being most frequently targeted. Non-motor symptoms , including pain and psychiatric , cognitive and sleep disturbances , are increasingly recognized as important determinants of disease burden in dystonia patients. We reviewed non-motor outcomes of DBS in dystonia , focusing on GPi-DBS. A systematic literature search of Pubmed and Embase was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-two studies were included. GPi-DBS reduced pain related to dystonia. No major effects on anxiety<symptom> , mood , and cognition were found. In contrast to motor outcome , non-motor outcome seems more independent of the etiology of dystonia. However , the impact of potential confounders ( e.g. patient factors , changes in pharmacological treatment) is unclear. Despite the growing interest in non-motor symptoms in dystonia , DBS studies still focus primarily on motor outcome. We recommend systematic evaluation of both non-motor and motor features before and after DBS interventions to improve quality of life and management of patients with dystonia.
