  Infection , as a common postoperative complication of orthopedic surgery , is the main reason leading to implant failure. Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) are considered as a promising antibacterial agent and always used to modify orthopedic implants to prevent infection. To optimize the implants in a reasonable manner , it is critical for us to know the specific antibacterial mechanism , which is still unclear. In this review , we analyzed the potential antibacterial mechanisms of AgNPs , and the influences of AgNPs on osteogenic-related cells , including cellular adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation , were also discussed. In addition , methods to enhance biocompatibility of AgNPs as well as advanced implants modifications technologies were also summarized.
