  Culicoides<pathogen> biting midges can transmit viruses such as bluetongue virus and Schmallenberg virus to ruminants and African horse sickness virus to equines. The control of Culicoides<pathogen> population can be based on physical and/or chemical methods. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of larvicides and adulticides combined treatments to control the vector Culicoides<pathogen> populations. Field trials have been conducted during 2014 on seven farms in northern Sardinia ( Italy). Three insecticide treatments ( larvicides and adulticides) have been carried out on three farms , whereas four farms remained unsprayed as untreated controls. For the larval control two commercial formulations , based on diflubenzuron and Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> var. israelensis<pathogen> ( H-14) , have been used. Against adults a deltamethrin based product has been sprayed on the walls and roofs of animal shelters. Adult Culicoides<pathogen> have been collected on each farm twice a week with an Onderstepoort blacklight suction trap. After each treatment a significant reduction in the abundance of total Culicoides<pathogen> , C. imicola and C. newsteadi s.l. , has been observed. The Obsoletus complex density has been affected by the first two treatments. Our results suggest the possibility to control the Culicoides<pathogen> populations with a combination of adulticide and larvicide treatments.
