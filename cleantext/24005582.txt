  Post-traumatic and post-operative stiffness of the elbow joint is relatively common and may in pronounced cases markedly interfere with normal upper extremity function.Soft-tissue contractures and heterotopic bone formation are two major causes of limited movement.Extensive recent research has elucidated many of the pathways contributing to these conditions , but the exact mechanisms are still unknown.In the early phase of soft-tissue contractures conservative treatment may be valuable , but in longstanding cases operative treatment is often necessary.Several different options are available depending on the severity of the condition and the underlying offending structures. Surgical treatment may allow significant gains in movement but rarely complete restoration , and complications are not uncommon.The following presentation reviews the recent literature on pathomechanisms and treatment alternatives.
