  Identification of microorganisms by Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy is known as a promising alternative to conventional identification techniques in clinical , food , and environmental microbiology. In this study we demonstrate the application of FT-IR hyperspectral imaging for rapid , objective , and cost-effective diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria. The proposed method involves a relatively short cultivation step under standardized conditions , transfer of the microbial material onto suitable IR windows by a replica method , FT-IR hyperspectral imaging measurements , and image segmentation by machine learning classifiers , a hierarchy of specifically optimized artificial neural networks ( ANN). For cultivation , aliquots of the initial microbial cell suspension were diluted to guarantee single-colony growth on solid agar plates. After a short incubation period when microbial microcolonies achieved diameters between 50 and 300 Î¼m , microcolony imprints were produced by using a specifically developed stamping device which allowed spatially accurate transfer of the microcolonies ' upper cell layers onto IR-transparent CaF
