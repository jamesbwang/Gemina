  New graduate nurses are expected to function autonomously and be practice-ready upon graduation. However , transitioning from the role of student to one of leadership in the professional nurse 's role is a complex experience. Concerns for safety and liability in an increasingly complex health care environment may limit the availability of relevant clinical experiences for nursing students to develop leadership skills. The Mock Hospital , a comprehensive capstone simulation , was designed to immerse senior nursing students into the leadership role of the professional nurse. Positive feedback obtained from students through reflection and discussion supports the implementation of a capstone simulation. Supporting new graduate nurses ' transition into practice , while preparing the next generation of nurses to successfully meet the challenges of a complex health care environment , will require innovative and transformative educational experiences.
