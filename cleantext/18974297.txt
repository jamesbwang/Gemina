  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is known as the most predominant cause of dementia among the aged people. Previously , two hallmarks of AD pathology including extracellular amyloid-β ( Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs) inside neurons have been identified. With a better understanding of this disease , neuroinflammation has been a focus , and as its initial event , innate immune activation plays an indispensable role. In brain , as an endogenous stimulator , extracellular Aβ deposition activates innate immunity through binding to the pattern recognition receptors ( PRR) , thus leading to the production and release of substantial inflammatory mediators ( NO and ROS) and cytokines ( IL-1β , IL-10 , IL-33 and TNF-α) contributing to the development of AD. Epidemiologic evidence has suggested an affirmative influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) on delaying the progression of AD. Therefore , blocking the inflammatory process may be an effective way to delay or even cure AD. In this review , we mainly elucidate the mechanism underlying these immune responses in AD pathogenesis and attempt to seek the therapeutic methods targeting neuroinflammation.
