  Analysis of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer ( IASLC) Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma ( MPM) database revealed that clinical ( cTNM) staging minimally stratified survival and was discrepant with pathological ( pTNM) staging. To improve prognostic classification of MPM , alternative staging models based on quantitative parameters were explored. An institutional review board-approved MPM registry was queried to identify patients with available pathological and preoperative imaging data. Qualifying patients were randomly assigned to training and test sets in a 1:2 ratio. Computed cTNM and pTNM staging ( AJCC Cancer Staging Manual , 7th ed.) were compared. Quantitative image analysis included tumor volume assessed from three-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography scans ( VolCT) and maximal fissural thickness ( Fmax). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method , and the relationship with VolCT was examined by Cox regression analysis to identify optimized cut-points. Performance of cTNM and quantitative models derived was compared in the test set using Harrell 's C index. A total of 472 patients met inclusion criteria. TNM staging was concordant with pathological TNM staging in 171 of 472 ( 36.2 %) , understaged in 209 ( 44.2 %) , and overstaged in 92 ( 19.4 %) patients. The most concordant feature was involvement of interlobar fissures. A quantitative clinical staging model comprising VolCT and Fmax ( c-index = 0.638 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.603 to 0.673) performed statistically significantly better as a prognostic classifier when compared in the test set with cTNM ( c-index = 0.562 , 95 % CI = 0.525 to 0.599 , P = .001). Improved prognostic performance may be achievable by quantitative clinical staging combining VolCT and Fmax , providing a cost-effective and clinically relevant surrogate for clinical TNM stage.
