  Seven patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations ( PAVMs) not well suited to coil and/or plug treatment were treated with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents. Mean diameter of treated arteries was 6 mm. Complete technical success was achieved in 7 of 8 PAVMs , 6 using only covered stents and 1 using both a covered and a bare stent owing to endoleak. In 1 patient , the parent vessel was sacrificed after identification of additional feeding vessels following stent graft placement. In 6 patients with median imaging follow-up of 8 months ( range , 1-121 months) , all stent grafts were patent , and all treated PAVMs were completely excluded without persistence.
