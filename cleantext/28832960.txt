  The differential diagnosis of chronic ulcers<disease> covers a wide range of diseases and poses a diagnostic challenge. Subcutaneous ischemic arteriolosclerosis can lead to local ischaemia and ulceration as a result of arteriolar narrowing and reduction of tissue perfusion. This pathophysiological feature can be seen in eutrophication ( nonuremic calciphylaxis) in morbid obesity , hypertensive ischemic leg ulcer<disease> ( Martorell ulcer<disease>) and calciphylaxis in chronic renal insufficiency. All of the ulcers<disease> happened in this way can be wrongly diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum because of clinical similarity and inadequate biopsies. We report a case of chronic ulcer<disease> due to subcutaneous arteriolosclerosis in morbid obesity , wrongly diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum. It can be detrimental to misdiagnose the ulcers<disease> due to subcutaneous arteriolosclerosis as pyoderma gangrenosum since they need a diametrically different approach.
