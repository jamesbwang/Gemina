  With the reduction of gene sequencing cost and demand for emerging technologies such as precision medical treatment and deep learning in genome , it is an era of gene data outbreaks today. How to store , transmit and analyze these data has become a hotspot in the current research. Now the compression algorithm based on reference is widely used due to its high compression ratio. There exists a big problem that the data from different gene banks ca n't merge directly and share information efficiently , because these data are usually compressed with different references. The traditional workflow is decompression-and-recompression , which is too simple and time-consuming. We should improve it and speed it up. In this paper , we focus on this problem and propose a set of transformation algorithms to cope with it. We will 1) analyze some different compression algorithms to find the similarities and the differences among all of them , 2) come up with a na√Øve method named TDM for data transformation between difference gene banks and finally 3) optimize former method TDM and propose the method named TPI and the method named TGI. A number of experiment result proved that the three algorithms we proposed are an order of magnitude faster than traditional decompression-and-recompression workflow. Firstly , the three algorithms we proposed all have good performance in terms of time. Secondly , they have their own different advantages faced with different dataset or situations. TDM and TPI are more suitable for small-scale gene data transformation , while TGI is more suitable for large-scale gene data transformation.
