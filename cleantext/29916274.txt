  The study explored design for well-being within dementia care by investigating the adoption of well-being-focused design in real-world practice , through observing National Health Service ( NHS) wards. Design for well-being is an approach that considers the psychological and physiological effects of architecture to improve health and well-being. The high psychological care requirement for dementia patients makes them a significant group to study in the evaluation of current hospital facilities. A literature review was conducted to frame the current theoretical perception of the key characteristics of a good environment for dementia care. A framework was generated to summarize and used as an assessment tool in a series of observational visits to NHS wards. Interviews with clinical staff focused on care outcomes and practicalities of implementing well-being-focused design , considering the historical and economical context. Key findings from the observations and interviews were analyzed for recurring themes. The ward observations and interviews provided insight into the current progression of well-being-led design in NHS hospitals in England. The research highlights key areas of success and factors that inhibit further progression. The case studies showed a good degree of ambition to utilize well-being-focused design , with belief among staff that the physical environment has a substantial role in the health and well-being of patients. Staff also felt that this approach is most effective for those in the less advanced stages of dementia. Despite the high level of support , the current degree of implementation appears to be varied.
