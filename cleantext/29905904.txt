  Î²-Alanine ( BA) supplementation may be ergogenic during high-intensity exercise , primarily due to the buffering of hydrogen cations , although the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on strength endurance are equivocal. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of 4 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation on skeletal muscle endurance using a battery of performance tests. This study employed a parallel group , repeated measures , randomised , double-blinded and placebo-controlled design. Twenty recreationally strength-trained healthy males completed tests of isotonic strength endurance ( repeated bench and leg press) , along with tests of isometric and isokinetic endurance conducted using an isokinetic dynamometer. Tests were performed before and after a 4 week intervention , comprising an intake of 6.4 g day
