  Immunotherapies are ineffective against pancreatic cancer. We investigated whether the activity of nuclear factor ( NF) κB in pancreatic stromal cells contributes to an environment that suppresses antitumor immune response. Pancreata of C57BL/6 or Rag1 C57BL/6 mice coinjected with KPC cells ( or LLC or B16-F10 cells) and p50 In studies of mice and cell lines , we found that NFκB activity in PSCs promotes tumor growth by increasing expression of CXCL12 , which prevents cytotoxic T cells from infiltrating the tumor and killing cancer cells. Strategies to block CXCL12 in pancreatic tumor cells might increase antitumor immunity.
