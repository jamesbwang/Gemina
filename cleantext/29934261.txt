  The surgical technique of olfactory cleft dilatation consists in transmucosal lateral fracture-dislocation of the lateral wall of each olfactory cleft ( i.e. , of the turbinate wall of the ethmoid , composed , from anterior to posterior , of the middle , superior and supreme turbinates) , in order to get access to the recess hosting the human olfactory mucosa and to the roof of the olfactory cleft ( i.e. , cribriform plate) , with minimal trauma to the mucosa. Olfactory cleft dilatation is indicated for dysosmia secondary to constitutional stenosis of the olfactory clefts due to abnormal development of the ethmoid. Constitutional stenosis of the olfactory clefts should be differentiated from inflammatory obstruction and other diseases of the olfactory clefts , and especially from respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma , which enlarges the olfactory clefts and must be treated by resection. The technique of olfactory cleft dilatation is illustrated by three surgical cases. There was clear improvement in dysosmia in all three cases , without any complications. The place of constitutional olfactory cleft stenosis needs still to be defined in both diagnosis and treatment of dysosmia.
