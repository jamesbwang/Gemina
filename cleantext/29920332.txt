  To examine differences in body mass index z-score ( BMIz) trajectory during early childhood among children with a younger sibling compared to those without and to test potential mediators. Longitudinal cohort study of 6050 participants of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Birth Cohort ( ECLS-B). Focal children 's weight , height , sibship status , screen time , active play time , family dinner frequency , and diet quality were assessed at 9 months , 24 months , preschool and kindergarten when available. A piecewise linear regression model was used to examine the association between sibling birth and focal child 's subsequent BMIz trajectory to kindergarten. Mediation by screen time , active play time , family dinner frequency , and diet quality was tested. BMIz trajectory was lower among children who had a new sibling join the family before kindergarten compared to children who did not have a new sibling join the family by kindergarten. The association was strongest when new sibship occurred when then the focal child was 48 to 66 months ( b = -0.026 , p = 0.044). The association was not mediated by screen time , active play time , family dinner frequency , or diet quality. Among a nationally representative cohort of US children , new sibship before kindergarten was associated with a lower BMIz trajectory. Several common obesogenic risk factors did not explain the association.
