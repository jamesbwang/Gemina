  The versatility offered by zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> makes it a powerful and an attractive vertebrate model in developmental toxicity and teratogenicity assays. Apart from the newly introduced chemicals as drugs , xenobiotics also induce abnormal developmental abnormalities and congenital malformations in living organisms. Over the recent decades , zebrafish embryo/larva has emerged as a potential tool to test teratogenicity potential of these chemicals. Zebrafish responds to compounds as mammals do as they share similarities in their development , metabolism , physiology , and signaling pathways with that of mammals. The methodology used by the different scientists varies enormously in the zebrafish embryotoxicity test. In this chapter , we present methods to assess lethality and malformations during zebrafish development. We propose two major malformations scoring systems: binomial and relative morphological scoring systems to assess the malformations in zebrafish embryos/larvae. Based on the scoring of the malformations , the test compound can be classified as a teratogen or a nonteratogen and its teratogenic potential is evaluated.
