  To examine changes in retinal ganglion cell complex ( GCC) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) thicknesses by optical coherence tomography ( OCT) in contralateral and ipsilatateral eyes of carotid artery stenosis ( CAS) patients before and after carotid endarterectomy ( CEA). Forty-two consecutive patients diagnosed with CAS ( 70-99 % stenosis rate) who underwent CEA were included in this prospective cross-sectional study. The indication for CEA was based on the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study. Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography were performed to calculate CAS. All the subjects underwent an ophthalmological examination , including best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , intraocular pressure ( IOP) measurements , biomicroscopy , fundoscopy , and OCT before and after the surgery. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 15.2 ± 2.1 mmHg in the ipsilateral eye and 15.8 ± 2.7 in the contralateral eye. The mean postoperative intraocular pressure in the ipsilateral and contralateral eye was 18.6 ± 3.0 and 19.3 ± 3.8 , respectively. The intraocular pressure was significantly higher in postoperative eyes ( p = 0.0001). There was a statistically significant decrease in peripapillary RNFL thickness in superior quadrants postoperatively in ipsilateral eyes. The retinal GCC layer thickness was not significantly different before and after CEA in ipsilateral and contralateral eyes. Carotid endarterectomy results in thinning of the superior peripapillary RNFL thickness. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to examine peripapillary RNFL and GCC thicknesses before and after CEA.
