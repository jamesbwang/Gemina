  Multidetector row CT ( MDCT) offers superior soft tissue characterization and is useful for diagnosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic cysts<symptom> and tumors , fibro-osseous lesions<symptom> , inflammatory , malignancy , metastatic lesions<symptom> , developmental abnormalities , and maxillofacial trauma. The rapid advances in MDCT technology , including perfusion CT , dual-energy CT , and texture analysis , will be an integrated anatomic and functional high-resolution scan , which will help in diagnosis of maxillofacial lesions<symptom> and overall patient care.
