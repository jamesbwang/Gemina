  This study aimed to examine the blood lactate and blood pH kinetics during high-intensity interval training. Seventeen well-trained athletes exercised on two different occasions. Exercises consisted of three 30 s bouts at a constant intensity ( 90 % of peak power) with 4 min recovery between bouts followed by a Wingate test ( WT). The recoveries were either active recovery ( at 60 % of the lactate threshold intensity) or passive recovery ( resting at sitting position). During the exercise , blood samples were taken to determine blood gasses , blood lactate , and blood pH , and peak and average power were calculated for the WT. When performing the active recovery trials , blood pH was significantly higher ( p < 0.01) and blood lactate was significantly lower ( p < 0.01) compared with the passive recovery trials. WT performance was significantly higher in the active recovery trials: peak power was 671 ± 88 and 715 ± 108 watts , and average power was 510 ± 70 and 548 ± 73 watts ( passive and active respectively; p < 0.01). However , no statistically significant correlations were found between the increased pH and the increased performance in the active recovery trials. These results suggest that active recovery performed during high-intensity interval exercise favors the performance in a following WT. Moreover , the blood pH variations associated with active recovery did not explain the enhanced performance.
