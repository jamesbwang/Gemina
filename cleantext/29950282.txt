  Fast-track programs for diagnostic work-up and start of cancer treatment are defined by legislation in Denmark. The aim was to examine whether age , comorbidity or WHO performance status influence the time from referral due to suspicion of cancer to start of treatment ( waiting time) in the Danish fast-track program. For this descriptive cohort study , consecutive head and neck cancer ( HNC) patients who underwent radiotherapy or surgery from January 2014 to July 2016 at Odense University Hospital ( OUH) were identified in the database of the Danish Head and Neck Cancer group ( DAHANCA). Age ( < 70 vs. ≥ 70 years) , comorbidity ( none vs. any) , and WHO performance status ( 0-1 vs. 2-4) were correlated to waiting time. In total , 650 HNC-patients were included and of those , 92 % were discussed at the multidisciplinary team conference. Patients ≥ 70 years were less frequently discussed in a multidisciplinary setting compared to younger patients ( 88 % vs. 93 % , p < 0.05). The time spent for diagnostic workup and treatment planning ( waiting time) was longer for patients having primary radiotherapy than for primary surgery ( p < 0.001) , and 21 % of patients treated with primary radiation exceeded the recommended maximum waiting time , whereas this was the case for only 7 % of the patients treated with primary surgery. However , age ≥ 70 years , presence of comorbidity or poor performance status did not significantly influence the waiting time. Age ≥ 70 years , comorbidity and poor WHO performance status did not influence the waiting time among patients with head and neck cancer treated at OUH.
