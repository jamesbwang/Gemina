  A 42-year-old woman without a history of catheter ablation or cardiac surgery was referred to our institution for a paroxysmal atrial tachycardia<symptom> ( AT). Programed stimulation could not induce any AT. The AT spontaneously initiated during a continuous isoproterenol infusion. The earliest activation during the AT was recorded at the cavo-tricuspid isthmus , and local abnormal atrial activity ( LAATA) was recorded during sinus rhythm at that same site. When rapid atrial activity was recorded at the cavo-tricuspid isthmus where the LAATA was recorded , an AT was induced. Radiofrequency ablation was performed over the entire area where the LAATA was recorded during sinus rhythm , rendering the AT non-inducible.
