  Graves ' disease ( GD) is an autoimmune disorder that causes the overproduction of thyroid hormones and consequent cascade of systemic metabolism dysfunction. Moreover , Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( GO) is the main extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves ' disease ( GD). The goal of the study was to identify metabolic signatures in association with diagnostic biomarkers of GD without GO and GO , respectively. Ninety metabolites were profiled and analyzed based on a non-targeted primary metabolite profiling from plasma samples of 21 GD patients without GO , 26 subjects with GO , and 32 healthy subjects. Multivariate statistics showed a clear discrimination between healthy controls and disease group ( R2Y = 0.518 , Q2 = 0.478) and suggested a biomarker panel consisting of 10 metabolites. Among them , most of metabolites showed the positive association with the levels of thyrotropin receptor antibodies. With combination of proline and 1,5-anhydroglucitol , which were identified as GO-specific modulators , the re-constructed biomarker model greatly improved the statistical power and also facilitated simultaneous discrimination among healthy control , GO , and GD without GO groups ( AUC = 0.845-0.935). Finally , the comparative analysis of tissue metabolite profiles from GO patients proposed putative metabolic linkage between orbital adipose/connective tissues and the biofluidic consequences , in which fumarate , proline , phenylalanine , and glycerol were coordinately altered with the blood metabolites.
