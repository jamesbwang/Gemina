  To explore whether endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress regulates inflammation<symptom> in adipose tissue of obese rats via TLR4 signaling. Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups , and body<symptom> weight , food intake , and free fatty acids ( FFA) were measured. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to determine mRNA or protein expression of TLR4 , TRAF6 , IKKβ , TNF-α , IL-6 , and GRP78. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GRP78 protein expression. The FFA levels in HFD , HFD+PBA , and HFD+VIPER groups were higher than that in the control group ( HFD could induce inflammation<symptom> in adipose tissue via ER stress and its downstream TLR4 signaling.
