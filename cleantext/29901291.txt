  Traditionally , evaluation of the split renal function is performed using nephroscintigraphy. However , as shown in several studies , there might be quite significant inaccuracy in the interpretation of dynamic nephroscintigraphy results. But due to the lack of alternative methods for evaluation of split renal function , nephroscintigraphy remains the method of choice. To investigate the feasibility of digital analysis of contrast-enhanced MSCT imaging for evaluation of the split renal function. This is a prospective study conducted at the R.M. Fronshteyn Clinic of Urology from November 2015 to February 2017. The study comprised 31 patients with urolithiasis ( n = 7) , hydronephrosis ( n = 9) , kidney cancer ( n = 14) and urinary bladder tumor ( n = 1). During the preoperative period , the patients underwent contrast-enhanced MSCT , 3D-reconstruction , and digital analysis. The obtained data were compared with the results of dynamic nephroscintigraphy. Contrast-enhanced MSCT findings were not inferior to data obtained with dynamic nephroscintigraphy regarding information content ( p < 0.004). The new method of digital processing of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MSCT allows for concomitant assessment of both the anatomical features of the kidney and renal function that may help to improve the accuracy of surgical planning to choose the optimal extension of the intervention.
