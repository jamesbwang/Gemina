  The development of simple , fast and reproducible techniques that provide information about the antioxidant activity ( AA) of different compounds is essential to screen and discover new molecules with potential applications in the therapeutic , cosmetic , toxicological and food fields. Here , a novel and simple colorimetric method ( `` BCB assay '') is proposed for measuring the AA of chemical compounds by protection of the reporter dye Brilliant Cresyl Blue ( BCB) from loss of color due to oxidation by hypochlorite ( a physiological oxidant). The decay in BCB blue color ( Î»
