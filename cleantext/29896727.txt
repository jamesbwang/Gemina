  To assess the value of whole-genome amplification ( WGA) and next generation sequencing ( NGS) for the pre-implantation screening of discarded embryos. In total 476 discarded embryos were collected. After continued culture , 23 high-quality blastocysts were obtained. Blastocysts graded as 4BC or above based on Gardner classification were subjected for blastula biopsy. Five to ten nourish ectoderm cells were hatched with a biopsy needle. Following WGA and NGS , deletion and/or duplication of chromosomal fragments and numerical chromosomal aberrations were analyzed. In total 148 trophoblast cells were obtained from the 23 blastocysts. Following WGA , 60 amplification products were selected for NGS. The results showed that there were 39 abnormal chromosomes derived from 14 blastocysts , which gave an abnormal rate of blastocyst of 60.87 % ( 14/23). WGA combined with NGS can enable pre-implantation genetic screening for discarded embryos , which may improve the efficacy of in vitro fertilization as well as reduce the risk for birth defects.
