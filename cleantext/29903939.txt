  Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices , from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability , a critical performance metric , is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor ( the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths , quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths , notably , increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution , with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments , single-cell nanocalorimetry , nanoscale gas chromatography , atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry , and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.
