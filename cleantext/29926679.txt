  To investigate the interventional effects of 16-week aerobic exercises on the elderly 's arteriosclerosis and its mechanism. Twenty-seven elderly people with the average age of 62. 70 ± 3. 26 joined a 16-week square dance/taijiquan exercise program that conducted 60 minutes each time , six times per week. Arterial stiffness and its related indexes such as systolic pressure ( SBP) , diastolic pressure ( DBP) , left brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( L-baPWV) , right brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( R-baPWV) , left ankle brachial index ( L-ABI) , right ankle brachial index ( R-ABI) , serum triglyceride ( TG) , total cholesterol ( TC) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c) , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) and glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px) were detected at 3 time points including before exercise program , by the end of exercise for 8 weeks and 16 weeks. ① Compared with pre-exercise , the R-baPWV and R-ABI of the elderly people were decreased at the end of the 8 Sixteen-week aerobic exercises could reduce baPWV and ABI levels , regulate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , blood lipids and lipid peroxides levels of the elderly evidently , thus improve the controlling quality of atherosclerosis.
