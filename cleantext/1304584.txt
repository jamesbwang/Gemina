  The annual cyclicality of cortical bone growth marks ( BGMs) allows reconstruction of some important life history traits , such as longevity , growth rate or age at maturity. Little attention has been paid , however , to non-cyclical BGMs , though some record key life history events such as hatching ( egg-laying vertebrates) , metamorphosis ( amphibians) , or weaning ( suggested for Microcebus and the hedgehog). Here , we investigate the relationship between non-cyclical BGMs and a stressful biological event in mammals: the moment of birth. In the present study , we histologically examine ontogenetic series of femora , tibiae and metapodia in several extant representatives of the genus Equus ( E. hemionus , E. quagga and E. grevyi). Our analysis reveals the presence of a non-cyclical growth mark that is deposited around the moment of birth , analogous to the neonatal line described for teeth. We therefore refer to it as neonatal line. The presence of this feature within the bone cross-section agrees with a period of growth arrest in newborn foals regulated by the endocrine system. The neonatal line is accompanied by modifications in bone tissue type and vascularization , and has been identified in all bones studied and at different ontogenetic ages. Our discovery of a non-cyclical BGM related to the moment of birth in mammals is an important step towards the histological reconstruction of life histories in extant and fossil equids.
