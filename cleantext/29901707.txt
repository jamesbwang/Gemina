  Breast augmentation in trans-women requires special consideration and thorough preoperative planning. This study aimed to present our long-term outcome and experience gained over the past 21 years. Trans-women who have undergone breast augmentation since 1995 were reviewed for primary surgery , type of incision , implant site , implant size & shape , and revisions. A total of 138 patients with a follow-up of 4.6 years ( range , 2.0-13.3) were included. In 112 patients ( 82.4 %) the inframammary incision was chosen. Subpectoral implantation was performed in 70 patients ( 51.5 %). Round breast implants ( 91 patients , 66.9 % , p = 0.010) with low projection ( 103 patients , 75.7 % , p < 0.001) were favoured. The implant size used during 2011-2016 of 363.3 ± 97.3 cc was significantly increased as compared to the implant size reported during 1995-1999 ( mean difference , +142,1 cc , p < 0.001) and 2000-2004 ( mean difference , +113,5 cc , p < 0.001). Simultaneously , revision rates dropped significantly over time ( 52.9 % during 1995-1999 as compared to 6.9 % during 2011-2016 , p < 0.001). Overall , request for larger implants was the most common indication for revision ( 13 patients , 9.4 %) after 6.0 months ( range , 4.0-18.7). At revision , implant volume was 355.4 ± 132.8 cc , showing significant increase of 107.0 ± 48.1 cc as compared to primary implants ( +30.0 % , p = 0.048). Request for larger breast implants was the most common reason for revision. Depending on the various degrees of breast tissue growth due to hormonal therapy , whenever applicable we recommend round , low projection implants with a mean size of 360cc in the prepectoral pocket.
