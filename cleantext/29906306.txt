  New biomaterials based on nanoparticles ( NPs) carrying polyphenols-rich extracts ( Cornus mas) recently showed promising anti-inflammatory activity in psoriasis. We aimed to understand how topically delivered silver and gold nanoparticles complexed with Cornus mas ( Ag-NPs-CM , Au-NPs-CM) modulate inflammation<symptom> in psoriasis at cellular and molecular level. The impact on psoriatic inflammation<symptom> was assessed in vitro on pro-inflammatory macrophages , by clinical score , high-frequency ultrasonography and immunohistology of psoriasis plaques treated with Ag-NPs-CM , Au-NPs-CM or control. Incubation of pro-inflammatory macrophages with nanoparticles significantly decreased the release of NO , IL-12 and TNF-α. Immunofluorescence confirmed that nanoparticles significantly reduced CD68-positive macrophages and their IL-12 and TNF-α production in human psoriasis plaques. NPs-CM appear to repress NF-κB activation in macrophages , inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory factors with causal role in psoriasis. Ag and Au NPs-CM represent a novel nanoparticle-based `` green '' technology which may provide an efficient tool for modern psoriasis therapy , circumventing immunosuppression-related side effects of biologicals.
