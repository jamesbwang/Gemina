  DNA methylation , chromatin states and their interrelationships represent critical epigenetic information , but these are largely unknown in human early embryos. Here , we apply single-cell chromatin overall omic-scale landscape sequencing ( scCOOL-seq) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution during human preimplantation development. Unlike in mice , the chromatin of the paternal genome is already more open than that of the maternal genome at the mid-zygote stage in humans , and this state is maintained until the 4-cell stage. After fertilization , genes with high variations in DNA methylation , and those with high variations in chromatin accessibility , tend to be two different sets. Furthermore , 1,797 out of 5,155 ( 35 %) widely open chromatin regions in promoters closed when transcription activity was inhibited , indicating a feedback mechanism between transcription and open chromatin maintenance. Our work paves the way for dissecting the complex , yet highly coordinated , epigenetic reprogramming during human preimplantation development.
