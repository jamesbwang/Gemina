  Astrocytes are glial cells that are essential for the maintenance of central nervous system functions , modulating neurotransmitters , providing metabolic , trophic and antioxidant support , and producing a wide range of cytokines to modulate the inflammatory response. These cells can be targets for antipsychotics , medications used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this regard , several studies have shown that antipsychotics are able to modulate peripheral cytokine release , but their effects on astroglial inflammatory response need to be further investigated. In this study , we evaluated the effects of risperidone and haloperidol , common atypical and typical antipsychotics , respectively , on cytokine release and redox status in C6 astroglial cells , an astrocyte-like cell line. Risperidone showed an anti-inflammatory activity , decreasing the release of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α) , interleukins 1β ( IL-1 β) and 6 ( IL-6) , and increasing interleukin 10 ( IL-10). This atypical antipsychotic was also able to decrease the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor κB ( NFκB) and improve glutathione content. However , haloperidol induced a pro-inflammatory response , increasing the extracellular levels of TNF-α and IL-1β , in addition to decreasing IL-10. This typical antipsychotic could induce an inflammatory response by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK)/ NFκB pathways. In summary , our results suggest that risperidone and haloperidol present different effects on astroglial cells , in this way being able to differentially affect the neuroinflammation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.
