  This study describes the time trend of renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) in the Provence-Alpes CÃ´te d'Azur region ( PACA) between 2004 and 2015 , and forecasts up to 2030. A longitudinal study was conducted on all ESRD patients treated in PACA and recorded in the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network ( REIN) during this period. Time trends and forecasts to 2030 were analyzed using Poisson regression models. Since 2004 , the number of new patients has steadily increased by 3.4 % per year ( 95 % CI , 2.8-3.9 , p < 0.001) and the number of patients receiving RRT has increased by 3.7 % per year ( RR 1.037 , 95 % CI: 1.034-1.039 , p < 0.001). If these trends continue , the PACA region will be face with 7371 patients on dialysis and 3891 with a functional renal transplant who will need to be managed in 2030. The two most significant growth rates were the percentage of obese people ( RR 1.140 , 95 % CI: 1.131-1.149 , p < 0.001) and those with diabetes ( RR 1.070 , 95 % CI; 1.064-1.075 , p < 0.001). This study highlights the increase in the number of ESRD patients over 12 years , with no prospect of stabilization. These findings allow us to anticipate the quality and quantity of care offered and to propose more preventive measures to combat obesity and diabetes.
