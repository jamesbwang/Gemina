  Electroplating of nanoporous Pt ( nPt) induces an extremely strong tensile stress , which results in the exfoliation of nPt on flexible polymer substrate despite plasma treatment to improve adhesion. Here , we overcame this challenge by modifying flexible stainless-steel , and developed wearable , robust , flexible , and non-enzymatic continuous glucose monitoring system. The flexible stainless-steel was highly effective in improving the adhesion between the metal layer and substrate. The developed wireless system included electrochemical analysis circuits , a microcontroller unit , and a wireless communication module. Finally , we evaluated the continuous glucose monitoring system through two animal testing , by implanting into subcutaneous tissue and measuring interstitial fluid ( ISF) glucose values at 5-15-min intervals. Comparison of the measured ISF glucose with blood glucose determined by the Clarke error grid analysis showed that 82.76 % of the measured glucose was within zone A. Furthermore , the wearable glucose sensor exhibited bio-compatible to implant through various bio-compatibility tests.
