  Inorganic polyphosphate ( polyP) is known to modulate coagulation , inflammation<symptom> , and metabolic pathways. It also amplifies inflammatory responses of HMGB1 ( high mobility group box 1) in endothelial cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of polyP on von Willebrand factor ( VWF) release from endothelial cells with or without HMGB1. EA.hy926 endothelial cells were treated with different concentrations of polyP PolyP
