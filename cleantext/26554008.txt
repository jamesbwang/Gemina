  Organic field-effect transistors ( OFETs)- based sensors have a great potential to be integrated with the next generation smart surgical tools for monitoring different real-time signals during surgery. However , allowing ultraflexible OFETs to have compatibility with standard medical sterilization procedures remains challenging. A novel capsule-like OFET structure is demonstrated by utilizing the fluoropolymer CYTOP to serve both encapsulation and peeling-off enhancement purposes. By adapting a thermally stable organic semiconductor , 2,10-diphenylbis ( 1) benzothieno ( 2,3-d; 2 ' ,3 '- d') naphtho ( 2,3-b; 6,7-b ') dithiophene ( DPh-BBTNDT) , these devices show excellent stability in their electrical performance after sterilizing under boiling water and 100 °C- saturated steam for 30 min. The ultrathin thickness ( 630 nm) enables the device to have superb mechanical flexibility with smallest bending radius down to 1.5 µm , which is essential for application on the highly tortuous medical catheter inside the human body. By immobilizing anti-human C-reactive protein ( CRP) ( an inflammation<symptom> biomarker) monoclonal antibody on an extended gate of the OFET , a sensitivity for detecting CRP antigen down to 1 µg mL
