  Infectious specialist consultations ( ISC) provide ever more evidence for improved outcome in Multicenter retrospective analysis of methicillin-sensitive ( MS) SAB. Patients were stratified according to age ≥ 60 years ( sub-analyses for ≥ 75 years and females) and formal ( bedside) ISC given within 7 days of SAB diagnosis. The impact on management and outcome of formal ISC was explored. Statistics were performed with univariate analysis , Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis , including propensity-score adjustment , and graphic Kaplan-Meier interpretation. Altogether 617 patients were identified and 520 ( 84 %) had formal ISC. Presence of formal ISC resulted in equivalent clinical management regardless of age over or under 60 years: localization and eradication of infection foci ( 80 vs. 82 % and 34 vs. 36 %) and use of anti-staphylococcal antibiotics ( 65 vs. 61 %). Patients aged ≥ 60 years managed without formal ISC , compared to those with formal ISC , had less infection foci diagnosed ( 53 vs. 80 % , Formal ISC ensures proper active clinical management irrespective of age and improve prognosis in aged patients with MS-SAB.
