  The effect of ion partitioning on the electrostatics of a soft particle with a volumetrically charged core and a pH-dependent polyelectrolyte layer ( PEL) is numerically investigated. It is observed that , whenever the ion partitioning is noticeable , the soft layer can be fully charged in a broader range of pH. Besides , a higher number density of the PEL functional groups and a lower charge density of the core result in a sharper dependence of the electric potential on the electrolyte pH. Briefly , we conclude that , since the PEL charge is dependent upon the concentration of the hydroxide/hydrogen ions , for the pH-regulated soft particles , the ion partitioning effect , as a phenomenon influencing the ionic distribution , can be a determinant factor. So taking the effect of the ion partitioning into consideration is strongly recommended for a more realistic description of the electrostatics of the pH-regulated soft particles.
