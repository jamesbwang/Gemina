  The objective of this study is to assess the utility of facebow transfer in the fabrication of occlusal splints , complete dentures and full arch fixed dental prosthesis. A systematic review protocol was registered at PROSPERO registry , University of York , UK ( CRD42016041919). Following databases were explored: PubMed , CINAHL , Cochrane , and Web of knowledge. The PICO model included participants who received occlusal splint or complete denture or full arch fixed dental prosthesis at the centric relation position. The intervention was the use of facebow transfer. Comparators were prosthesis made without using a facebow. Outcomes were the patient satisfaction of the prosthesis and the need for laboratory adjustments. Only randomized clinical trials were included in the present review. A customized data extraction pro forma was used to extract the data and assess its quality. A total of 505 articles were retrieved. On excluding duplicates , protocols , case reports , case series , narrative reviews , etc. , only eight studies were selected for review. Six clinical trials on 249 complete dentures and two clinical trials on 65 occlusal splints were reviewed. No study on full arch crown and bridge work satisfied the inclusion criteria. The use of facebow did not yield a superior fit or comfort of the complete dentures or occlusal splints. Therefore , there is no evidence of the utility facebow transfer for these prostheses. However , no inference could be drawn for its utility in full arch fixed dental prosthesis as there were no studies to draw an inference.
