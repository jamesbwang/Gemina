  ABSTRACTObjectives: Errorless learning is a promising rehabilitation principle for learning tasks in patients with amnesia , including patients with Korsakoff 's syndrome<disease>. Errorless learning might possibly also contribute to decreases in behavioral and psychiatric problems , as patients in long-term care facilities become more independent after training. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of errorless learning on potential changes in psychotic and affective symptoms , aggression and apathy , in contrast with a control group who received care as usual. The current study is a quasi-experimental study on errorless learning and psychotic and affective symptoms , aggression , and apathy in patients with Korsakoff 's syndrome<disease> , living in long-term care facilities for patients with Korsakoff 's syndrome<disease> ( KS) in the Netherlands. The GIP-28 , HoNOS-ABI , and NVCL-20 were administered to a group of patients with KS who received errorless learning training ( n = 51) and a patient control group who received care as usual ( n = 31). Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests were performed to examine psychotic and affective symptoms , aggression , and apathy at baseline and at follow-up in the errorless learning group and the control group. Errorless learning training effectively reduced psychotic symptoms ( including provoked confabulations) , affective symptoms , and agitation/aggression. There were no significant changes ( increases nor decreases) in the control group. Levels of apathy were stable over time in both groups. Results with respect to psychotic and affective symptoms , aggression , and apathy are discussed in depth. Patients with KS can become more autonomous in a cared for setting using errorless learning principles. This might also result in decreases in behavioral and psychiatric problems in patients.
