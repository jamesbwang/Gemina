  Acute chest syndrome<disease> ( ACS) mortality in sickle cell disease ( SCD) rises sharply in young adult patients and mechanism-based prophylaxis is lacking. In SCD , haem oxygenase-1 ( HO-1) declines with age and ACS is associated with low HO-1. To test if enhanced HO-1 can reduce ACS mortality , young SCD mice were treated with D3T ( 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) , an activator of nuclear-factor erythroid 2 like 2 , which controls HO-1 expression , for 3 months. Following haem-induced ACS , all vehicle-treated mice succumbed to severe lung injury , while D3T-treated mice had significantly improved survival. Blocking HO-1 activity abrogated the D3T effect. Thus HO-1 may be targeted to reduce ACS severity in adult patients.
