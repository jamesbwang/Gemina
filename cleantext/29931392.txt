  To compare the efficacy and safety of modified Robert Jones bandage ( MRJB) and non-compressive dressing ( NCD) on reducing invisible blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( IBL) after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Eighty patients who underwent unilateral TKA were randomly assigned into two groups: MRJB and NCD groups. Pre- and post-operative hematocrit levels , amount of drained blood and transfused blood were measured and calculated into IBL. Pain score , amount of morphine usage , range of motion ( ROM) at discharge , blood transfusion rate , and complications were also recorded and compared between both groups. There was no significant difference in the mean IBL between MRJB ( 221.2 ± 233.3 ml) and NCD groups ( 158.5 ± 186.7 ml) ( p = 0.219). Post-operative pain score at rest and during ambulation , amount of morphine usage , ROM at discharge , blood transfusion rate , and complications were also similar between two groups. This study can not determine the benefit of MRJB over NCD. The use of MRJB may not be necessary after primary TKA.
