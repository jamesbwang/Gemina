  The discovery of graphene one decade ago has triggered enormous interest in developing two-dimensional materials ( 2DMs)- that is 2D allotropes of various elements or compounds ( consisting of two or more covalently bonded elements) or molecular frameworks with periodic structures. At present , various synthesis strategies have been exploited to produce 2DMs , such as top-down exfoliation and bottom-up chemical vapor deposition and solution synthesis methods. In this review article , we will highlight the interfacial roles toward the controlled synthesis of inorganic and organic 2DMs with varied structural features. We will summarize the state-of-the-art progress on interfacial synthesis strategies and address their advancements in the structural , morphological , and crystalline control by the direction of the arrangement of the molecules or precursors at a confined 2D space. First , we will provide an overview of the interfaces and introduce their advantages and uniqueness for the synthesis of 2DMs , followed by a brief classification of inorganic and organic 2DMs achieved by interfacial synthesis. Next , the currently developed interfacial synthesis strategies combined with representative inorganic and organic 2DMs are summarized , including the description of method details , the corresponding structural features , and the insights into the advantages and limitations of the synthesis methods , along with some recommendable characterization methods for understanding the interfacial assembly of the precursors and crystal growth of 2DMs. After that , we will discuss several classes of emerging organic 2DMs with particular emphasis on the structural control by the interfacial synthesis strategies. Note that , inorganic 2DMs will not be categorized separately due to the fact that a number of review articles have covered the synthesis , structure , processing , and applications. Finally , the challenges and perspectives are provided regarding the future development of interface-assisted synthesis of 2DMs with diverse structural and functional control.
