  Glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems , which can maintain a stable level of blood glucose , have been proposed as a promising method to treat diabetes. Such systems can reduce potential toxicity and enhance patient compliance compared to traditional therapies. Accordingly , we designed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle ( MSN)- based glucose-sensitive and self-regulated drug release system to achieve the goal of long circulation and `` touch switch '' in vivo. In this system , carboxyphenylboronic acid ( CPBA) was first modified on the surface of MSN using amidation reaction. Insulin ( INS) was then loaded in the channels of MSN ( CPBA-MSN/INS) through physical adsorption , and sodium alginate ( SA) was introduced onto the surface of the CPBA-MSN/INS nanoparticles as the gatekeeper via amidation reaction ( SA/CPBA-MSN/INS). We found the drug loading capacity of INS was 261 mg/g. In the normal range of blood glucose , INS was scarcely released due to the reversible covalent interaction between 1,2-diols of SA and CPBA. Within the high concentration of glucose , the boronate esters could be dissociated , which results in the mesoporous channels opening and the release of INS. In vivo experiments on diabetic mice showed SA/CPBA-MSN/INS sustained a normal blood glucose level for up to 12 h with a single dose. Moreover , the lipid metabolism disorder and organ damage of diabetic mice were alleviated after treatment with SA/CPBA-MSN/INS. Therefore , SA/CPBA-MSN/INS characterized by an `` on-off '' regulated drug release property and high biosafety shows promise for applications in diabetes treatment.
