  A case of a 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM) presented with intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea<symptom> and chest<symptom> discomfort<symptom>. Her coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries but with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with an increasing left ventricular-aortic gradient on isoproterenol provocation. Likewise , an intensified gradient was observed after a premature ventricular contraction ( PVC) that is distinguished as the Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign substantiating confirmation of left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT) obstruction.
