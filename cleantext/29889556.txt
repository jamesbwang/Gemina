Urinary alpha-1-acid glycoprotein is a sensitive marker of glomerular protein leakage at altitude. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000 , 2018. Proteinuria<symptom> is an established feature of ascent to altitude and may be caused by a loss of negative charges on glomerular capillary walls ( GCWs). To test this hypothesis , we measured two similar sized but oppositely charged proteins in urine: negatively charged alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( α1-AGP , 41-43 kDa) and positively charged dimeric lambda free light chains ( λ-FLCs , 50 kDa). Twenty-four-hour urinary leakage was compared with albumin , a 66 kDa negatively charged protein. We studied 23 individuals ( ages 23-78 years , male = 17) at baseline ( 140 m) and daily during an expedition to 5035 m. The results showed a significant increase in median urinary leakage of α1-AGP ( p < 0.0001; 6.85-fold) and albumin ( p = 0.0006; 1.65-fold) with ascent to altitude , but no significant increase in leakage of λ-FLCs ( p = 0.39; 1.14-fold). α1-AGP correlated with the daily ascent profile ( p = 0.0026) and partial pressure of oxygen ( p = 0.01) , whereas albumin showed no correlation ( p = 0.19). Urinary α1-AGP was a more sensitive marker of altitude proteinuria<symptom> than urinary albumin and λ-FLCs , and supported the possibility of loss of GCW negative charges at altitude.
