  Circulating levels of endostatin are elevated in many underlying conditions leading to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> such as hypertension , diabetes , chronic kidney disease and ischemic heart disease. Yet , the association between endostatin and the incidence of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> has not been reported previously in the community. We investigated the longitudinal association between serum endostatin levels and incident heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in two community-based cohorts of elderly: Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( PIVUS , n = 966; mean age 70 years , 51 % women , 81 events , mean follow-up 10 years) and Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men ( ULSAM , n = 747 men; mean age 78 years , 98 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> events , mean follow-up 8 years). We also investigated the cross-sectional association between endostatin and echocardiographic left ventricular systolic function and diastolic function ( ejection fraction and E/A-ratio , respectively). Higher serum endostatin was associated with an increased risk for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in both cohorts after adjustment for established heart<symptom> failure<symptom> risk factors , glomerular filtration rate and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) ( PIVUS: multivariable hazard ratio ( HR) per 1-standard deviation ( SD) increase , HR 1.46 ( 95 % CI , 1.17-1.82 , p < .001); ULSAM: HR 1.29 ( 95 % CI , 1.00-1.68 , p < .05). In cross-sectional analyses at baseline , higher endostatin was significantly associated with both worsened left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in both cohorts. Conclusion Higher serum endostatin was associated with left ventricular dysfunction and an increased heart<symptom> failure<symptom> risk in two community-based cohorts of elderly. Our findings encourage further experimental studies that investigate the role of endostatin in the development of
