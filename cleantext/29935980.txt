  Measuring patients satisfaction is an important part of continuous quality improvement in health care. In intensive care , family satisfaction is often used as a proxy for patient experience. At present , no suitable instrument to measure this has been fully validated in Sweden. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire intended to evaluate families ' satisfaction of quality of care in Swedish intensive care units. Based on literature and the modification of pertinent items in two existing North American questionnaires , a Swedish questionnaire was developed. Content validity was assessed by experts , and the cognitive method Think Aloud was used with twelve family members of intensive care patients in two different intensive care units. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. Seven items in the questionnaire were identified as problematic , causing eight problems concerning questioning of content and 23 concerning misunderstanding. Six of these items were changed in order to be understood the way they were intended , and one item was removed. A family satisfaction questionnaire applicable in Swedish intensive care units has been developed and validated for respondents ' understanding of the questions being asked. However , further psychometric testing should be performed when more data are available.
