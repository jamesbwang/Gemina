  F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 ( FBW7) functions as a major tumor suppressor by targeting oncoproteins for degradations. FBW7 has been reported to be one of the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer ( CRC). However , its roles and possible mechanisms in the development of CRC are still unclear. In the present study , we adopted immunohistochemistry staining in tissue microarray ( TMA) , consisting of 276 samples from stage I-IV CRC patients , and analyzed the correlation between FBW7 expression and clinicopathological parameters , as well as overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS). The impact of FBW7 on migration was further validated
