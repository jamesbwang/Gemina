  Gastric cancer is one of the most common and lethal malignancies globally , especially in East Asia. Although significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease , the overall survival rate remains unchanged at 20‑25 %. Thus , there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the disease. Recent years have witnessed the critical roles of aberrant cancer cell metabolism in the maintenance of malignant properties of cancer cells , and targeting cancer cell metabolism has been regarded as a novel aspect in the development of treatments against cancer. In the present study , we identified a novel gene , AAED1 ( AhpC/TSA antioxidant enzyme domain containing 1) , which is upregulated in gastric cancer cells. By using lentivirus mediated transfection method , we silenced AAED1 expression and silencing of AAED1 inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro in gastric cancer cell lines , as demonstrated by cell viability and colony formation assay. Furthermore , we uncovered novel functions of AAED1 in regulating hypoxia inducible factor 1α ( HIF1α) and the resultant aerobic glycolysis , which was measured by extracellular flux analysis. Collectively , the results of the present study uncovered novel markers that could identify the possible molecular mechanisms involved in gastric cancer.
