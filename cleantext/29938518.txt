  Opioid-related adverse drug events ( ORADEs) include a range of complications , from respiratory arrest to ileus and urinary<symptom> retention<symptom>. ORADEs correlate to morbidity , mortality , and increased costs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database , which represents approximately 35 % of hospital discharges. The authors searched for previously published ICD-9 codes that defined ORADEs. A group of surgical diagnosis-related groups ( DRGs) were selected. Recurring queries were programmed using these ICD codes and DRGs and used to update an online dashboard. The dashboard presents an estimate of the burden of ORADEs to frontline clinicians and hospital leadership and allows users to compare local data on ORADEs rates to other hospitals. Users are able to refine their search by surgery type or ORADE type. An interface was created , using national administrative claims data , to allow hospitals to access their ORADEs and benchmark local data against national trends.
