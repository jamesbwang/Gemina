  Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV)- positive aggressive natural killer-cell leukemia<disease> ( ANKL) is a rare malignancy of mature natural killer cells , with a very poor survival rate. Patients have a rapidly declining clinical course and a poor prognosis , with a median survival of only a few months. Herein , we describe a 16-year-old boy who was diagnosed with EBV-positive ANKL and successfully treated using combination chemotherapy and a subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT). The patient is disease free 4 years and 9 months after alloHSCT. Thus , combination chemotherapy followed by alloHSCT seems to be a promising therapeutic option for EBV-positive ANKL.
