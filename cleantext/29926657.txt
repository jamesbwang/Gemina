  To establish an animal model for loaded swimming , so as to investigate the energy metabolism effects of soybean isoflavones ( SI) on swimming mice. Thirty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal control , swimming group , and swimming + SI group. The normal control group mice were fed a basic AIN-93M diet , the SI groups were supplied with soybean isoflavones ( 4 g/kg). Two weeks later , the mice were forced to swim for an hour , and then all the mice were killed , the samples of blood , liver and muscles of hind were collected.The serum contents of lactic acid ( Lac) , the activities of lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH) , succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH) , creatine kinase ( CK) and ATPase were measured. Compared with normal control , the serum content of Lac was significantly improved in the group of the swimming control and SI ( Soybean isoflavones can improve the energy metabolism , antioxidant capacity of the swimming mice.
