  This study aimed to identify lifestyle factors associated with cognitive change and to explore whether the effect of lifestyle varies by socioeconomic status ( SES). Participants aged 65 years and older were recruited from elderly health checkup programs from 2011 to 2013 in Taiwan. Neuropsychological tests , including tests of global cognition , logical memory , executive function , verbal fluency and attention , were administered at baseline ( N = 603) and 2 years later ( N = 509). After literature review , 9 lifestyle factors and 3 SES indicators were chosen and their effects on cognitive change were evaluated using linear regression adjusting for age , sex , education , APOE ε4 status , and baseline cognitive score. Five lifestyle factors ( high vegetable and fish intake , regular exercise , not smoking , and light to moderate alcohol consumption) and 3 SES indicators ( annual household income ( > 33,333 USD vs. less) , occupational complexity ( high vs. low mental demanding job) , and years of education ( > 12 years vs. less)) were found to be protective against cognitive decline ( P < 0.1 in any cognitive domains , ß ranging from 0.06 to 0.38). After further adjusting for all the lifestyle and SES factors , fish intake , higher income and occupational complexity remained protective. Significant interactions were found between a healthful lifestyle ( defined as having ≥ 3 healthful lifestyle factors) and income on changes of global cognition and verbal fluency ( Pinteraction = 0.02 and 0.04). The protective effect of a healthful lifestyle was observed only among participants with lower income in global cognition and logical memory ( ß = 0.17 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.07-0.26; ß = 0.30 , 95 % CI = 0.14-0.46). To the best of our knowledge , this study for the first time explored how the interactions of lifestyle and SES affect cognitive change. Our findings will aid in developing dementia prevention programs and reduce health inequalities.
