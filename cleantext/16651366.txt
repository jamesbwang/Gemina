  Protein coding sequences represent only 2 % of the human genome. Recent advances have demonstrated that a significant portion of the genome is actively transcribed as non-coding RNA molecules. These non-coding RNAs are emerging as key players in the regulation of biological processes , and act as `` fine-tuners '' of gene expression. Neurological disorders are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations , epigenetic and environmental factors , and the exact pathophysiology of many of these conditions is still unknown. It is currently recognized that dysregulations in the expression of non-coding RNAs are present in many neurological disorders and may be relevant in the mechanisms leading to disease. In addition , circulating non-coding RNAs are emerging as potential biomarkers with great potential impact in clinical practice. In this review , we discuss mainly the role of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in several neurological disorders , such as epilepsy , Huntington disease , fragile X-associated ataxia<symptom> , spinocerebellar ataxias<symptom> , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) , and pain. In addition , we give information about the conditions where microRNAs have demonstrated to be potential biomarkers such as in epilepsy , pain , and ALS.
