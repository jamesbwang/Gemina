  Adolescence is a fundamental transition phase , marked by physical , social , cognitive and emotional changes. At this stage in development two contrasting phenomena take place: brain changes cause a sensitivity to emotional aspects ( Dahl , 2004); while also control processes register as well impressive improvements ( e.g. , Hooper et al. , 2004; Best and Miller , 2010). The study is aimed to investigate the relationship between a core cognitive feature such as working memory ( WM) ( Diamond , 2013) and complex abilities such as emotion regulation ( ER) and behavioral self-reported outcomes using a structural equation model approach. A sample of 227 typically developed adolescents between 14 and19 years of age ( 148 females; mean age in months 202.8 , SD 18.57) participated in this study. The following tasks and self-reports were administered in a 45-min test session at school: Symmetry Span task ( Kane et al. , 2004). Reading Span task ( Daneman and Carpenter , 1980) , Mr. Cucumber ( Case , 1985); Youth Self-Report ( YSR , 11-18 years , Achenbach and Rescorla , 2001); Difficulties ER Scale ( DERS , Gratz and Roemer , 2004; Italian version by Giromini et al. , 2012). Results showed that difficulties in ER correlated with WM: high levels of ER difficulties are associated with low WM efficiency while no significant contributions of these predictors was observed on externalizing or internalizing symptoms. This study showed a significant relationship between self-reported difficulties in ER and WM , while no significant contribution of the considered predictors was showed on the outcomes , adding knowledge about how behavioral and emotional self-reported outcomes may relate to these processes.
