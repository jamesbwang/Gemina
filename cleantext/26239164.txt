  Effects of a 12-week physiological ischemic training ( PIT) programme on safety of training and quality of life ( QOL) in patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD) complicated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> were evaluated. A total of 30 patients with CHD complicated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> were randomized to either an intervention group ( n = 15) or to controls ( n = 15) after baseline testing. A 12-week , 5 times a week , maximum subjective force group PIT was conducted. Safety of the training was measured with ECG and heart rate and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , QOL was measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Questionnaire ( MLHFQ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) was measured with peripheral blood. VEGF and MLHFQ were improved in the intervention group. The finding of the study shows PIT is safe to patients with CHD complicated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> by improving VEGF of peripheral blood and QOL.
