  The European Network of Teratology Information Services ( ENTIS) is in a privileged position to perform independent post-marketing surveillance of drugs in pregnancy. The aim of this survey was to describe the legal requirements and procedures involved in obtaining ethical approval for collaborative cohort studies. We sent a survey questionnaire to all 28 Teratology Information Services ( TIS) , of which 25 ( 89 %) in 18 countries completed our questionnaire. For 15 TIS , specific research ethical approval was mandatory. The review process was estimated to last from 2 up to 16 weeks. Procedures for patients ' information and consent were oral ( 12) , written ( 5) or both ( 3). Five TIS had no requirement to inform patients and seek consent. Since data on drug exposure during pregnancy are scarce , ENTIS research efforts should be further encouraged , and procedures optimized so that legitimate ethical and legal requirements do not translate into deterrent administrative constraints and costs.
