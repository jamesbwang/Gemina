  The objectives<pathogen> of this study<pathogen> were to: ( a) genotypically characterize Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> isolates<pathogen> recovered from clinical mastitis<pathogen> ( CM<pathogen>) cases<pathogen> in dairy<pathogen> cows<pathogen> and , ( b) determine the association<pathogen> of antimicrobial susceptibility<pathogen> ( AMS<pathogen>) and genotypes<pathogen> of Strep agalactiae clustered according to the genetic similarity<pathogen>. A total<pathogen> of 89 Strep<pathogen>. agalactiae<pathogen> isolates<pathogen> recovered from bovine CM<pathogen> were genotyped using random amplified polymorphic DNA<pathogen> ( RAPD<pathogen>) analysis<pathogen>. In addition<pathogen> , the AMS<pathogen> of the isolates<pathogen> was determined using a commercial broth<pathogen> microdilution<pathogen> test<pathogen> composed of 10 antimicrobials<pathogen> ( penicillin<pathogen> , ampicillin<pathogen> , oxacillin<pathogen> , cephalothin<pathogen> , ceftiofur<pathogen> , penicillin/novobiocin<pathogen> , erythromycin<pathogen> , pirlimycin<pathogen> , tetracycline<pathogen> , and sulfadimethoxine<pathogen>). Descriptive analysis<pathogen> was used to report the frequency<pathogen> of RAPD-types<pathogen> and genotypic clusters<pathogen> within herd<pathogen> , housing<pathogen> system<pathogen> , season<pathogen> and CM<pathogen> severity<pathogen> scores<pathogen>. The minimal antimicrobial concentrations<pathogen> that inhibited 50 %<pathogen> ( MIC50<pathogen>) and 90 %<pathogen> ( MIC90<pathogen>) of the isolates<pathogen> were calculated and survival<pathogen> analysis<pathogen> was completed to verify the differences<pathogen> of AMS<pathogen> among genotypic clusters<pathogen>. Results<pathogen> of RAPD<pathogen> showed a great genotypic diversity<pathogen> of Strep<pathogen>. agalactiae<pathogen> ( 45 RAPD-types<pathogen>) and three clusters<pathogen> ( Ia<pathogen> , Ib<pathogen> and II) were created based on the genetic similarity<pathogen> among genotypes<pathogen>. After clustering<pathogen> , a high genetic similarity<pathogen> was observed within and between herds<pathogen>. Overall , Strep<pathogen>. agalactiae<pathogen> showed high susceptibility<pathogen> to most antimicrobials<pathogen> , except to tetracycline<pathogen> and erythromycin<pathogen>. Differences<pathogen> in the AMS<pathogen> among clusters<pathogen> were observed for ampicillin<pathogen> , ceftiofur<pathogen> , erythromycin<pathogen> , pirlimycin<pathogen> , sulfadimethoxine<pathogen> and tetracycline<pathogen>. In conclusion<pathogen> , Strep<pathogen>. agalactiae<pathogen> is still highly susceptible to most antimicrobials<pathogen> , although differences<pathogen> in susceptibility<pathogen> to certain antimicrobials<pathogen> were observed among genotypic
