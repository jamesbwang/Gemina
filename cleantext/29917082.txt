  The national human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) immunization program was introduced in England in September 2008 using the bivalent vaccine. We collected residual vulva-vaginal swab specimens from 16 to 24-year-old women attending for chlamydia<pathogen> screening between 2010 and 2016 and tested for HPV<pathogen> DNA. We compared changes in type-specific ( vaccine and nonvaccine) HPV<pathogen> prevalence over time and association with vaccination coverage. For women with known vaccination status , vaccine effectiveness was estimated. HPV<pathogen> DNA testing was completed for 15459 specimens. Prevalence of HPV16/18 decreased between 2010/2011 and 2016 from 8.2 % to 1.6 % in 16-18 year olds and from 14.0 % to 1.6 % in 19-21 year olds. Declines were also seen for HPV31/33/45 ( 6.5 % to 0.6 % for 16-18 year olds and 8.6 % to 2.6 % for 19-21 year olds). Vaccine effectiveness for HPV16/18 was 82.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 60.6 % -91.8 %) and for HPV31/33/45 was 48.7 % ( 95 % CI , 20.8 % -66.8 %). Prevalence of HPV16/18 was compared to findings in 2007-2008 ( prevaccination) and to predictions from Public Health England 's mathematical model. Eight years after the introduction of a national HPV<pathogen> vaccination program , substantial declines have occurred in HPV16/18 and HPV31/33/45. The prevalence of other high-risk HPV<pathogen> types has not changed.
