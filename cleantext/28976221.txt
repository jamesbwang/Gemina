  Gaspari T , Spizzo I , Liu HB , et al. ( 2018) Dapagliflozin attenuates human vascular endothelial cell activation and induces vasorelaxation: A potential mechanism for inhibition of atherogenesis. Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 2018; 15 ( 1): 64-73. DOI: 10.1177/ 1479164117733626 The authors have highlighted a typographical error which exists in the NFκB reverse primer sequence outlined in the paper. The published NFκB reverse primer sequence reads 5 '- TGT-CGT-GCT-CCA-CAC-AGC-CAG-GT-3 '. The correct sequence for the NFκB reverse primer sequence should read 5 '- TGT-CGT-GCT-CCA-CAG-CCA-GGT-3 '. The correct NFκB primer sequence was the sequence utilised in production of the NFκB reverse primer used in all PCR experiments undertaken in this study and thus does not impact on the validity of the PCR results.
