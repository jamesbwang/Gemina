  In the current study , the puerarin was investigated for both acute Carrageenan and chronic CFA-induced inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> models. The Puerarin treatment significantly attenuated ( P < 0.001) the mechanical hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in both Carrageenan and CFA-induced hyperalgesia. The Puerarin treatment also remarkably reduced ( p < 0.001) the thermal hyperalgesic responses in both acute Carrageenan as well as chronic CFA-induced models. Furthermore , the Puerarin administration was also associated with significant inhibition of ( p < 0.001) paw edema<symptom> in both Carrageenan and CFA-induced models. The inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β , IL-6 , TNF-α and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) are significantly enhanced during inflammatory conditions , however , the Puerarin administration significantly altered ( P < 0.001) the mRNA expression levels of these mediators. Additionally , the Puerarin treatment also significantly enhanced ( P < 0.001) the mRNA expressions levels of the anti-oxidant enzymes such as Nrf2 , HO-1 and SOD2. The Puerarin treatment is associated with significant ( P < 0.001) inhibition of the acetic acid-induced Evans blue vascular permeability. Moreover , the concentration of Puerarin in various tissues was analyzed using High-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) and the results showed that the Puerarin was significantly distributed towards the peripheral tissues such as liver and kidney and less distributed towards the brain.
