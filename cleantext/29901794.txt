  Accurate measurement of total body surface area ( TBSA) burned is a key factor in the care of pediatric patients with burn , especially those with large thermal injuries. There is a paucity of data on the accuracy of these measurements by prehospital , nonburn center , and emergency department ( ED) providers , which can have drastic implications for patient management and outcomes. We sought to determine the accuracy of these estimates for large pediatric burns. A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with TBSA ≥ 10 % admitted to an American Burn Association ( ABA)- verified pediatric burn center from 2007 to 2015. Final TBSA was determined by pediatric burn surgeons and compared with prehospital emergency medical service providers , outside hospital physicians for transferred patients , and burn center ED physicians. Statistical significance was determined using a paired t-test with P < 0.05. A total of 139 patients ≤ 18 years of age met inclusion criteria , with an average TBSA of 18.9 ± 1.1 % , weight 23.7 ± 1.6 kg and age of 5.4 ± 0.41 years. When compared in a pairwise fashion to the TBSA values determined by pediatric burn surgeons , estimates of TBSA were higher by: prehospital emergency medical service providers , 40.0 % ( n = 67 , P < 0.0001); outside hospital physicians , 18.7 % ( n = 46 , P = 0.0009) , and burn center ED physicians , 7.2 % ( n = 120 , P = 0.0117). TBSA burn estimates for pediatric patients by prehospital , nonburn center , and ED providers are significantly higher than those recorded by burn surgeons at an ABA-verified pediatric burn center. These inaccuracies in TBSA measurement may have profound clinical implications.
