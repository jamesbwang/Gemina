  Surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) is defined as infection at or near surgical incisions within 30 days of an operative procedure and classified either incisional superficial and deep or organ/space. The aim of the study is to report and compare the incidence and management of SSIs after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALP) and retropubic radical prostatectomy ( RRP). Within the last 4 years , we identified 285 patients that underwent RRP , n = 187 ( 66 %) or RALP , n = 98 ( 34 %). We reviewed the frequency , types and way of management of SSI complications. A significant difference was found between RALP and RRP ( 2/98 , 2 % vs. 27/187 , 14.4 %; p < 0.0001) as for SSIs. The time interval between the time of surgery and diagnosis of SSIs was longer in RALP relative to RRP ( median 13.5 vs. 12.9 days , p = 0.761). All types of SSIs could be developed after RP , however RALP patients only experienced organ or space SSIs and have a lower rate of SSIs and shorter treatment time.
