  A photon channel perspective on high harmonic generation ( HHG) is proposed by quantizing both the driving laser and high harmonics. It is shown that the HHG yield can be expressed as a sum of the contribution of all the photon channels. From this perspective , the contribution of a specific photon channel follows a simple scaling law and the competition between the channels is well interpreted. Our prediction is shown to be in good agreement with the simulations by solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. It also can explain well the experimental results of the HHG in the noncollinear two-color field and bicicular laser field.
