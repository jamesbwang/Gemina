  To evaluate adherence to antihypertensive treatment in rural South Africa and identify potential determinants given concerns with adherence and its impact in this priority disease area. Patients & methods: Face-to-face interviews with hypertensive patients and rating their adherence to treatment using defined categorized responses. Associations between adherence and patient characteristics assessed and sensitivity analyses performed. 54.6 % of patients were adherent to treatment. Controlled blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP; odds ratios ( OR) = 2.1; 95 % CI: 1.1 , 3.8; p = 0.019) , comorbidity ( OR = 2.0; 95 % CI: 1.1 , 3.6; p = 0.032) and smoking ( OR = 0.3; 95 % CI: 0.1 , 0.8; p = 0.018) were associated with adherence. Adherence and BP control were suboptimal , only smoking was an independent risk factor for adherence. Adherent patients were twice as likely to have controlled BP , although results were sensitive to the definition of adherence. Initiatives are in place to improve adherence , which will be monitored.
