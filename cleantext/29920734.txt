  Sperm chromatin packaging is a very complex and highly regulated phenomenon. While most of the sperm chromatin is replaced by protamines , some are retained in nucleosomes. It is recently being recognised that these nucleosomes are intentionally retained and could be contributing to the expression of genes in the very early stages of embryogenesis. Endocrine disruption has been previously shown to affect reproductive outcome and sperm DNA methylation. This study aims to decipher the possibility of changes in nucleosome occupancy in sperm chromatin , induced by tamoxifen ( selective oestrogen receptor modulator) and cyproterone acetate ( androgen antagonist). We used next-generation sequencing approach ( MNase-Seq) to identify changes in the nucleosome landscape of the spermatozoa. We demonstrated that endocrine disruption affects nucleosome occupancy at critical regions of the genome and many of them harbour genes relevant for embryogenesis. This study emphasises that environmental factors could affect embryo development by way of modulating male epigenetic factors.
