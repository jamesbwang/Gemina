  Constipation<symptom> is suspected to occur frequently after acquired brain injury ( ABI). In patients with ABI , heart rate variability ( HRV) is reduced suggesting autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction may be associated with prolonged gastrointestinal transit time ( GITT). The primary aim of this study was to investigate if GITT is prolonged in patients with ABI. Secondarily , HRV and its correlation with GITT was investigated. We included 25 patients with ABI ( 18 men , median age: 61.3 years , range ( 30.7-74.5)). GITT was assessed using radio-opaque markers and HRV was calculated from 24-hour electrocardiograms. Medical records were reviewed for important covariates , including primary diagnosis , time since injury , functional independence measure , and use of medication. The GITT assessed in patients was compared to a control group of 25 healthy subjects ( 18 men , median age: 61.5 years , range ( 34.0-70.9)). In ABI patients , the mean GITT was significantly longer than in healthy controls ( 2.68 days , 95 % CI ( 2.16-3.19) versus ( 1.92 days , 95 % CI ( 1.62-2.22) , Patients with mild to moderate ABI have prolonged GITT unrelated to the HRV.
