  This study aimed to compare the efficacy of intratympanic dexamethasone ( ITD) therapy and hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO) therapy for the salvage treatment of patients with high-frequency sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( SSNHL) after the failure of conventional therapy. 104 refractory high-frequency SSNHL patients were enrolled in our study. Among them , 31 received ITD alone ( ITD group) , 32 received HBO alone ( HBO group) and 41 received no salvage therapies ( control group). Hearing outcomes were determined by pure-tone average measured by audiometry. The total effective rates in the hearing recovery and improvement of tinnitus<symptom> were calculated before and after salvage treatment. There was no significant difference of the total effective rates in the hearing recovery between ITD and HBO group ( p = 0.368). However , ITD therapy showed much better improvements of tinnitus<symptom> than HBO therapy ( p = 0.039). After ITD and HBO therapy , there were no significant differences in hearing gains at 2 and 4 KHz between ITD and HBO group ( p = 0.468 and 0.934 , respectively). Nevertheless , ITD therapy showed significant improvements of hearing gains at 8 KHz ( p = 0.049) compared to that of HBO therapy. ITD therapy may have better improvements of tinnitus<symptom> and hearing gains at 8 KHz than HBO therapy in patients with refractory high-frequency SSNHL.
