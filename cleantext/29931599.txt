  Soil disinfestation is an important agricultural practice to conquer soil-borne diseases and thereby ensure crop productivity. Reductive soil disinfestation ( RSD) had been developed as an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical soil disinfestation ( CSD). However , the differences between CSD and RSD on soil-borne pathogen suppression and fungal community structure remain poorly understood. In this work , five treatments , i.e. , untreated soil ( CK) , CSD with 0.5 t ha
