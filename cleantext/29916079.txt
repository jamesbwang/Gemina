  Membrane trafficking is essential for multiple aspects of plant growth and development. Some small molecules have been widely used to study the mechanisms of membrane trafficking in plants. For example , short-term treatment with small molecules combined with live cell imaging has been shown to be very useful in understanding the dynamic processes of membrane trafficking. Small molecule Endosidin2 ( ES2) has been found to target Exo70 protein and inhibit exocytosis and promote vacuolar trafficking in plants. Here we describe the method of using short-term ES2 treatment combined with live cell imaging to study plant exocytosis and vacuolar trafficking in Arabidopsis seedlings expressing a cargo protein PIN2: GFP.
