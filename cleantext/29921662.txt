  During mammalian brain development , radial glial progenitors balance<symptom> between proliferation and differentiation to generate the laminated cortical layers in a temporally precise fashion. Defects in the individual steps going into this complex organogenesis can result in cortical malformations and human nervous system disorders. In this issue of
