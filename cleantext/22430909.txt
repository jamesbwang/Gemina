  Inadvertent injury of the ureter is a known risk of pelvic surgery. If the injury is noticed intraoperatively , the treatment is relatively straightforward. However , if the discovery of the injury is delayed , the treatment is more difficult and less assured. We encountered a case of a completely transected ureter that had occurred during laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and was diagnosed on the 8th postoperative day. The patient was treated with minimally invasive retrograde endoscopic realignment with excellent results. Therefore , we decided to report this case and perform a literature review on this subject.
