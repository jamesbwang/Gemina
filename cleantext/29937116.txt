  Alteration in cytokine levels , particularly , IL-6 , TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-2 , has been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine ( LTG) , an antiepileptic drug with mood stabilizing properties , has documented immunomodulatory effects. However , its effect on cytokine secretion in vivo has not been examined. Besides , studies have reported inconsistent results of the in vitro effects of LTG on cytokine secretion. Hence , we used murine models of inflammation<symptom> to characterize the in vivo and the in vitro effects of LTG on the secretion of the aforementioned cytokines , using ELISA. LTG significantly inhibited basal and mitogen-induced IL-6 , TNF-α and IL-1β secretion in vivo and in LPS-treated RAW264 .7 cells in vitro. In PMs , LTG inhibited basal and LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α secretion. Our findings extend the current understanding of the anti-inflammatory properties of LTG and may be relevant to its role in modulating the immune system in epilepsy and bipolar disorder.
