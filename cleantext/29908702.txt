  In this work , we designed a novel hybrid material based on the polymerization of an ionic liquid on a magnetic core and further functionalized with carboxylatocalix ( 4) arene. Scanning electron microscope , transmission electron microscope , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , thermal gravimetric-derivative thermogravimetric analysis , energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy , X-ray diffractometer , and vibrating sample magnetometer were utilized to examine the physicochemical properties of the hybrid material obtained. The material was used as the adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction of phthalate esters. To obtain the maximum pre-concentration efficiency , a series of parameters influencing the extraction efficiency , including sample pH , adsorbent amount , adsorption time , eluent type as well as salt addition , was examined systematically. Under the optimum conditions , a fast and feasible pre-concentration protocol for phthalate esters was established with satisfactory enrichment factors between 158.7 and 191.3. The limits of detection from high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis for the target analytes were in the range of 0.02-0.31 ng mL
