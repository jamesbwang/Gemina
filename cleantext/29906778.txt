  The aim of this study is to examine the effect of age correction on the developmental assessment scores of preterm infants , using for the first time , the Mullen scales of early learning ( MSEL) test. Participants included 110 preterm infants ( born at a gestational age of â‰¤ 34 weeks) at ages 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 and 36 months. The corrected age-based MSEL composite score and each of the five MSEL scale scores were significantly higher than chronological age-based scores at all ages. These corrected scores were significantly higher than the chronological scores regardless of gestational age whether weight was , or adequate or small for gestational age. Larger differences between corrected and chronological age-based scores significantly correlated with earlier gestational age and with lower birth weight between 1 and 24 months but not at 36 months. Using chronological age-based scores yielded significantly more infants identified with developmental delays than using corrected age-based scores. The findings indicate that clinicians and researchers , as well as family members , should be aware of and acknowledge the distinction between corrected and chronological ages when evaluating preterm infants in research and clinical practices.
