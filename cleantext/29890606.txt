  We introduce the INSPIRATION bottom-up approach for the development of a strategic research agenda for spatial planning , land use and soil-sediment-water-system management in Europe. Research and innovation needs were identified by more than 500 European funders , endusers , scientists , policy makers , public administrators and consultants. We report both on the concept and on the implementation of the bottom-up approach , provide a critique of the process and draw key lessons for the development of research agendas in the future. Based on identified strengths and weaknesses<symptom> we identified as key opportunities and threats 1) a high ranking and attentiveness for the research topics on the political agenda , in press and media or in public awareness , 2) availability of funding for research , 3) the resources available for creating the agenda itself , 4) the role of the sponsor of the agenda development , and 5) the continuity of stakeholder engagement as bases for identification of windows of opportunity , creating ownership for the agenda and facilitating its implementation. Our derived key recommendations are 1) a clear definition of the area for which the agenda is to be developed and for the targeted user , 2) a conceptual model to structure the agenda , 3) making clear the expected roles , tasks , input formats regarding the involvement and communication with the stakeholders and project partners , 4) a sufficient number of iterations and checks of the agenda with stakeholders to insure completeness , relevance and creation of co-ownership for the agenda , and 5) from the beginning prepare the infrastructure for the network to implement the agenda.
