  Timely and accurate state detection and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings are very critical to ensuring the reliability of rotating machinery. This paper proposes a novel method of rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on a combination of ensemble empirical mode decomposition ( EEMD) , weighted permutation entropy ( WPE) and an improved support vector machine ( SVM) ensemble classifier. A hybrid voting ( HV) strategy that combines SVM-based classifiers and cloud similarity measurement ( CSM) was employed to improve the classification accuracy. First , the WPE value of the bearing vibration signal was calculated to detect the fault. Secondly , if a bearing fault occurred , the vibration signal was decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions ( IMFs) by EEMD. The WPE values of the first several IMFs were calculated to form the fault feature vectors. Then , the SVM ensemble classifier was composed of binary SVM and the HV strategy to identify the bearing multi-fault types. Finally , the proposed model was fully evaluated by experiments and comparative studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect bearing faults and maintain a high accuracy rate of fault recognition when a small number of training samples are available.
