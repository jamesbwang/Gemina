  Water/solid interfaces are ubiquitous and play a key role in many environmental , biophysical , and technological processes. Resolving the internal structure and probing the hydrogen-bond ( H-bond) dynamics of the water molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces are fundamental issues of water science , which remains a great challenge owing to the light mass and small size of hydrogen. Scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM) is a promising tool for attacking these problems , thanks to its capabilities of sub-Ångström spatial resolution , single-bond vibrational sensitivity , and atomic/molecular manipulation. The designed experimental system consists of a Cl-terminated tip and a sample fabricated by dosing water molecules in situ onto the Au ( 111)- supported NaCl ( 001) surfaces. The insulating NaCl films electronically decouple the water from the metal substrates , so the intrinsic frontier orbitals of water molecules are preserved. The Cl-tip facilitates the manipulation of the single water molecules , as well as gating the orbitals of water to the proximity of Fermi level ( EF) via tip-water coupling. This paper outlines the detailed methods of submolecular resolution imaging , molecular/atomic manipulation , and single-bond vibrational spectroscopy of interfacial water. These studies open up a new route for investigating the H-bonded systems at the atomic scale.
