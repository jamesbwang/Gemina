  The combustion of multi-hole pyrophoric activated metal is solid combustion and the combustion mechanism is quite complex , which is a difficult problem to be solved. Once the pyrophoric activated metal is exposed to air , the oxygen diffuses to the interior of the activated metal within plenty of holes and reacts with it , which enlarges the contact area with oxygen. Consequently , the whole combustion is vigorous and the temperature rises rapidly. To study the combustion mechanism of the chaff , the surface heat balance<symptom> equation is established in this work by taking Mg as the activated metal. To solve this equation , the chaff adiabatic wall temperature distribution is computed by computational fluid dynamics in the presence of high-speed airflow. Then , the chaff surface temperature distribution is obtained by solving the heat balance<symptom> equations. Finally , numerical and experimental results obtained via an infrared thermal imager are compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the established equation.
