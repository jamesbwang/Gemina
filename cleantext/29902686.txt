  Swallowing muscle strength weakens with aging. Although numerous studies have investigated tongue pressure ( TP) changes with age , studies on jaw-opening force ( JOF) , an indicator of suprahyoid muscle strength , are lacking. We investigated differences between age-related declines in TP and JOF in a cross-sectional study of 980 healthy and independent participants ( 379 men , 601 women) without dysphagia<symptom>. Hand grip strength ( HGS) , TP , and JOF were compared among decade-based age groups in multiple comparison analyses with post-hoc tests and effect size calculated. Participants were divided into adult ( 20 s-50 s) and elderly groups ( 60 s-80 s); within each group , Pearson correlations between age and muscle strength indices were evaluated. TP started to significantly decline in the 60 s and 50 s for men and women ( p < .01 , medium effect size and p < .05 , small effect size , respectively); HGS also declined at these ages ( men: p < .01 , women: p < .01 , medium effect size). JOF started to significantly decline in men in their 80 s ( p < .01 , large effect size) , but remained unchanged in women. In the elderly group , all measurements declined with age more sharply in men ( HGS: r = -0.56 , TP: r = -0.63 , JOF: r = -0.13) than in women ( HGS: r = -0.38 , TP: r = -0.49 , JOF: r = -0.003). TP declined more steeply than did JOF. Thus , the age related-decline in TP was similar to that of the HGS , but not the JOF. The results reveal that different patterns exist in the age-related decline in swallowing muscle strength , and suggest that maintenance of JOF might contribute to safe swallowing in healthy elderly individuals.
