  Echo intensity reflects both intramuscular adiposity and fibrous tissue content. Recently , equations that allow investigators to estimate the percentage of intramuscular fat for individual muscles via measurements of echo intensity and subcutaneous fat were created. However , as the trial-to-trial consistency of these values has not been reported in the literature , it is unclear if they can be used to track changes during physical activity and/or nutritional interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest reliability of rectus<pathogen> femoris percent intramuscular fat. Nineteen healthy adults ( mean ± SD age = 22 ± 3 year; ten females , nine males) with a body mass index ≤ 30 kg/m Uncorrected and corrected echo intensity , subcutaneous fat and cross-sectional area exhibited excellent consistency ( P > 0 · 05 , intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs) ≥ .900 , standard errors of measurement ( SEMs) ≤ 7 · 26 %). Percent intramuscular fat for all participants also demonstrated satisfactory reliability ( ICC = 0 · 980 , SEM = 3 · 07 %) , with similar findings for males ( ICC = 0 · 970 , SEM = 3 · 63 %) and females ( ICC = 0 · 968 , SEM = 1 · 41 %). The high ICCs and low SEMs suggest that ultrasonography-derived rectus<pathogen> femoris percent fat may be a reliable tool for tracking changes in lower extremity intramuscular adiposity.
