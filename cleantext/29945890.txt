  Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 ( IDO1) is a powerful immunoregulatory enzyme that is deficient in patients with type 1 diabetes ( T1D). In this study , we present the first systematic evaluation of IDO1 expression and localization in human pancreatic tissue. Although IDO1 was constitutively expressed in β-cells from donors without diabetes , less IDO1 was expressed in insulin-containing islets from double autoantibody-positive donors and patients with recent-onset T1D , although it was virtually absent in insulin-deficient islets from donors with T1D. Scatter plot analysis suggested that IDO1 decay occurred in individuals with multiple autoantibodies , prior to β-cell demise. IDO1 impairment might therefore contribute to β-cell demise and could potentially emerge as a promising therapeutic target.
