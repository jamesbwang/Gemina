  Indirect carbon emissions account for a large ratio of the total carbon emissions in processes to make the final products , and this implies indirect carbon emission flow across industries. Understanding these flows is crucial for allocating a carbon allowance for each industry. By combining input-output analysis and complex network theory , this study establishes an indirect carbon emission flow network ( ICEFN) for 41 industries from 2005 to 2014 to investigate the interrelationships among different industries. The results show that the ICEFN was consistent with a small-world nature based on an analysis of the average path lengths and the clustering coefficients. Moreover , key industries in the ICEFN were identified using complex network theory on the basis of degree centrality and betweenness centrality. Furthermore , the 41 industries of the ICEFN were divided into four industrial subgroups that are related closely to one another. Finally , possible policy implications were provided based on the knowledge of the structure of the ICEFN and its trend.
