  Small-scale poultry farming is common in rural communities across the developing world. To examine the extent to which small-scale poultry farming serves as a reservoir for resistance determinants , the resistome of fecal samples was compared between production chickens that received antibiotics and free-ranging household chickens that received no antibiotics from a rural village in northern Ecuador. A qPCR array was used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs) and mobile genetic elements ( MGEs) using 248 primer pairs; and the microbiome structure was analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A large number of ARGs ( 148) and MGEs ( 29) were detected. The ARG richness in production chickens was significantly higher than that of household chickens with an average of 15 more genes detected ( p < 0.01). Moreover , ARGs and MGEs were much more abundant in production chickens than in household chickens ( up to a 157-fold difference). Production chicken samples had significantly lower taxonomic diversity and were more abundant in Gammaproteobacteria , Betaproteobacteria , and Flavobacteria. The high abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs found in small-scale poultry farming was comparable to the levels previously found in large scale animal production , suggesting that these chickens could act as a local reservoir for spreading ARGs into rural communities.
