  Fibroblast migration to damaged zones in different tissues is crucial to regenerate and recuperate their functional activity. However , fibroblast migration patterns have hardly been studied in disease terms. Here , we study this fundamental process in dermal and cardiac fibroblasts by means of microfluidic-based experiments , which simulate a three-dimensional matrix in which fibroblasts are found in physiological conditions. Cardiac fibroblasts show a higher mean and effective speed , as well as greater contractile force , in comparison to dermal fibroblasts. In addition , we generate chemical gradients to study fibroblast response to platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF- & beta ;-RRB- gradients. Dermal fibroblasts were attracted to PDGF , whereas cardiac fibroblasts are not. Notwithstanding , cardiac fibroblasts increased their mean and effective velocity in the presence of TGF- & beta;. Therefore , given that we observe that the application of these growth factors does not modify fibroblasts & rsquo; morphology , these alterations in the migration patterns may be due to an intracellular regulation.
