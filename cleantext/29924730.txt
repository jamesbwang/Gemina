  Induction of apoptosis by selective BH3-mimetics is currently investigated as a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Here , we report that selective BH3-mimetics induce apoptosis in a variety of hematological malignancies. Apoptosis is accompanied by severe mitochondrial toxicities upstream of caspase activation. Specifically , the selective BH3-mimetics ABT-199 , A-1331852 and S63845 , which target BCL-2 , BCL-XL and MCL-1 , respectively , induce comparable ultrastructural changes including mitochondrial swelling , a decrease of mitochondrial matrix density and severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of cristae structure. These shared effects on mitochondrial morphology indicate a similar function of these anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
