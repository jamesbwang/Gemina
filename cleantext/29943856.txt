  Alterations in left atrial<symptom> ( LA) and left ventricular ( LV) function have been documented in hypertensive patients. However , the correlation of LA with LV functional changes has not been established. Using normotensive controls , we examined LA functional changes in hypertensive patients by strain deformation analysis , and their relationship to LV functional changes including contractile reserve ( CR). One hundred and sixteen patients ( 61 men , aged 57.6 ± 9.1 years , 67 with hypertension) underwent dobutamine echocardiography. Patients with significant coronary or valvular disease , previous myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization , and diabetes were excluded. LA reservoir ( Ɛs) , conduit ( Ɛe) , and atrial contractile ( Ɛa) strain were measured at rest. LV global longitudinal strain ( GLS) and ejection fraction ( LVEF) were measured at rest and at low-dose dobutamine. LV CR was calculated as the difference in GLS and LVEF between the low dose and their corresponding resting values. Hypertensive patients , compared with controls , had significantly impaired LA Ɛs ( 30.7 ± 3.9 % vs 42.4 ± 4.9 %) , Ɛe ( 16.2 ± 4.1 % vs 22.5 ± 5.5 %) , and Ɛa ( 14.5 ± 4.1 % vs 19.9 ± 5.0 % , all P < .001) strain. All LA phasic strain correlated with LV GLS at rest , at low-dose dobutamine , and LV CR. There was no correlation between LA strain and LVEF or LV CR assessed by LVEF. LV GLS and LAVImax were the strongest independent determinants for LA Ɛs/Ɛe and LA Ɛa , respectively. Compared to controls , hypertensive patients had impaired LA strain , which correlated with LV GLS and CR. LV GLS and LAVImax were the strongest independent determinants for LA Ɛs/Ɛe and LA Ɛa , respectively , independent of BP and LVMi.
