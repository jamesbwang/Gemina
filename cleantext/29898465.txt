  The free margin running suture ( FMRS) is a novel technique for nonresection correction of degenerative mitral regurgitation. It was employed in 37 minimally invasive mitral repair cases. We performed a retrospective collection of in-hospital data and a clinical/echocardiographic follow-up. All patients were discharged with none or mild mitral regurgitation , except one who had mild-to-moderate ( 2 +) regurgitation. At follow-up ( average: 2.1 years) , all patients were alive; there were no instances of recurrent regurgitation , one case of 2 + regurgitation , and no valve-related complications. Average mitral valve area , mean gradient , and coaptation length were 2.9 cm
