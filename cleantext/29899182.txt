  Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) remains a major health problem for delayed diagnosis , inefficient surveillance and poor prognosis. Recent studies have indicated that non-coding RNAs contribute to the development of new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of HCC. In the present study , we employed 18 pairs of HCC and matched non-tumor tissues for the identification of differentially expressed microRNAs ( miRNAs) in HCC , among which 7 paired specimens were selected randomly for microarray detection. Totally , twenty-three miRNAs were screened out to have statistically significant differences with the threshold of P < 0.01 and fold-change ≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5 using miRNA microarray. In the validation stage , two miRNAs exhibited higher expression levels in the HCC tissues compared with those in the matched non-tumor tissues , whereas the expression levels of ten miRNAs were lower in the HCC tissues than those in the matched non-tumor tissues. In further analysis , eight miRNAs , including miR-4270 , miR-125b-5p , miR-199a-3p , miR-10a-5p , miR-424-5p , miR-195-5p , miR-106b-5p and miR-3651 , were retained , when another constraint about the signal intensity of microarray probes was established. Among these miRNAs , our study was the first to show the higher expression level of miR-3651 and the lower expression level of miR-4270 in HCC. The areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve values of miR-3651 and miR-4270 were 0.730 and 0.967 , respectively , indicating their potential diagnostic values. Our results may help provide the context for expanded interpretations of miRNA studies involved in the progression of liver disease , potentially serving as a diagnostic tool of HCC.
