  Objectives Two-stage open reduction and internal fixation ( ORIF) and limited internal fixation combined with external fixation ( LIFEF) are two widely used methods to treat Pilon injury. However , which method is superior to the other remains controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively compare two-stage ORIF and LIFEF and clarify which method is better with respect to postoperative complications in the treatment of tibial Pilon fractures. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively compare the postoperative complications between two-stage ORIF and LIFEF. Eight studies involving 360 fractures in 359 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Results The two-stage ORIF group had a significantly lower risk of superficial<disease> infection<disease> , nonunion , and bone healing problems than the LIFEF group. However , no significant differences in deep infection , delayed union , malunion , arthritis<disease> symptoms , or chronic osteomyelitis<disease> were found between the two groups. Conclusion Two-stage ORIF was associated with a lower risk of postoperative complications with respect to superficial<disease> infection<disease> , nonunion , and bone healing problems than LIFEF for tibial Pilon fractures. Level of evidence 2.
