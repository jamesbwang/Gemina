  Over 350 million individuals suffer from depression<symptom> , a psychiatric illness classified as major depressive disorder ( MDD) with symptoms that include a loss of interest or pleasure in life accompanied by depressed mood. The present understanding of major depressive disorder does not encompass a systematic characterization of the neurobiological processes that drive the behavioral physiology in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Psychiatric illness is a complex intersection between genetics , physiology , immunology and environmental stress. The increased attention to the relevance of depression<symptom> has led to new discoveries that highlight the biological significance of & lsquo; neuroinflammation & rsquo; and immunity underlying a spectrum of psychiatric illnesses. The process of neuroinflammation involves sentinel immune cells in the central nervous system ( CNS). The activation and polarization of microglia , CNS-resident macrophages , modulates the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder , and this phenomenon has been aptly titled the & lsquo; macrophage theory of depression<symptom> & rsquo;. Of particular interest are three hallmark cytokines , IL-6 , TNF & alpha; and IL-1 & beta; , which have been studied extensively in basic research , cell-receptor signaling and drug development. The field of inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation is an emerging area of MDD research that is providing new cellular insight into how macrophages mechanistically support cytokine-associated neuropathology , particularly in the case of IL-1 & beta;- associated inflammation<symptom> in MDD. With the increasing number of individuals identified with depression<symptom> , a comprehensive understanding of macrophage-cytokine signaling pathways in the CNS in depression<symptom> is necessary for developing effective anti-depressant therapeutics.
