  There is limited data on the use of Genotype MTBDRslVersion 1 ( MTBDRsl V1) as an initial rapid screening test to rule out XDR-TB and most importantly its performance in various genotypes of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> is scarcely studied. A total of 359 MDR-TB isolates were tested for gene mutations representing second line drug resistance , using the MTBDRsl_V .1 and the results were compared with phenotypic method ( Bactec MGIT-960 system) for second-line drug ( SLD) susceptibility testing. Genetic lineages of all these isolates were also determined using spoligotyping and SITVIT2 WEB database. The MTBDRsl V1 detected mutations in the gyrA , rrs , and emb genes in 108 ( 30 %) , 2 ( 0.5 %) and 129 ( 35.9 %) isolates , respectively. Remaining 120 ( 33.4 %) had no second line drug ( SLD) resistance. In 17 ( 4.7 %) isolates mutations were detected in both gyrA and rrs genes. Its concordance with MGIT-960 culture drug susceptibility testing ( DST) was 97 % and 94.1 % , 93.5 % , 60.5 % and 50 % for the detection of XDR-TB , pre-XDR , Ethambutol , and Aminoglycosides/Cyclopeptides resistance. The Beijing lineage was predominant ( 46 %) between both the pre-XDR/XDR-TB isolates. We conclude that MTBDRsl is useful for rapid detection of SLD resistance. Also in pre-XDR and XDR-TB isolates the frequency of relevant genetic mutations was significantly higher in the Beijing strains.
