  Paraneoplastic syndromes<disease> involving the visual system are a heterogeneous group of disorders occurring in the setting of systemic malignancy. Although these syndromes<disease> are rare , the clinical manifestations can herald an unsuspected , underlying malignancy. The associated antibodies and histopathology of each syndrome<disease> are presented to help in the understanding of these autoimmune phenomena. Outlined in this review article are diagnostic features useful in differentiating cancer-associated retinopathy , melanoma-associated retinopathy , paraneoplastic polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy , bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation and paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes<disease> such as optic neuropathy , opsoclonus-myoclonus , Lambert-Eaton myasthenia and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
