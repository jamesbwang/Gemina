  The study was conducted to investigate the effect of Yinhuangerchen mixture ( YM) on Avian infectious laryngotracheitis ( AILT) induced by artificial infection and provide a scientific basis for its clinical application. A total of 200 chickens were challenged with infectious laryngotracheitis virus ( ILTV). At 72 h post-challenge , the chickens were treated with different doses of YM or the Chinese herbal medicine Houyanjing powder. The relative expression of ILTV , the pathological changes of trachea , and the number of SIgA-secreting cells were detected. Thin-layer chromatography results confirmed that the YM contained Scutellaria baicalensis , Flos lonicerae , Pericarpium citri reticulatae , and Liquorice. The AILT model was successfully established by artificial infection. In the high-dose YM group ( HD) and middle-dose YM group ( MD) , the effective rate of treatment was 100 and 96.7 % , respectively , and the overall cure rate was 83.3 %. In addition , the results of necropsy<disease> showed that the degree of tissue damage in chicken trachea was relatively low. Compared with positive control group , HD and MD chicken had lower relative expression of ILTV but more SIgA-secreting cells. In conclusion , YM can reduce ILTV level in tissue , mitigate tissue damage caused by infection , and enhance mucosal immunity having obvious therapeutic effect on AILT.
