  Previous studies suggested that exposure to traumatic events during childhood and adulthood and post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) are associated with a dysregulation of different neuroendocrine systems. However , the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system ( RAAS) in relation to trauma/PTSD has been largely neglected. Traumatization , PTSD , and plasma concentrations of renin and aldosterone were measured in 3092 individuals from the general population. Subgroups according to the status of traumatization ( ` without trauma '; ` trauma , without PTSD ' , ` PTSD ') were formed and compared regarding renin and aldosterone concentrations. Additionally , we calculated the associations between the number of traumata , renin , and aldosterone concentrations. Finally , associations of PTSD with renin/aldosterone levels were controlled for the number of traumata ( ` trauma load '). Levels of renin , but not aldosterone , were increased in traumatized persons without PTSD ( p = 0.02) and , even stronger , with PTSD ( p < 0.01). Moreover , we found a dose-response relation between the number of traumata and renin levels ( β = 0.065; p < 0.001). Regression analyses showed PTSD as a significant predictor of renin ( β = 0.38; p < 0.01). This effect was only slightly attenuated when controlled for trauma load ( β = 0.32; p < 0.01). Our results suggest that traumatization has lasting and cumulative effects on RAAS activity. Finding elevated renin levels in PTSD independent from trauma load supports the concept of PTSD as a disorder with specific neuroendocrine characteristics. Alternatively , elevated renin levels in traumatized persons may increase the risk for developing PTSD. Our findings contribute to explain the relationship between traumatic stress/PTSD and physical disorders.
