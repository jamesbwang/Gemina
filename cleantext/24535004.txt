  Primary immune deficiency disorders ( PIDs) are a group of diseases with profound defects in immune cells. The traditional diagnostics have evolved from clinical evaluation , flow cytometry , western blotting , and Sanger sequencing to focusing on small groups of genes. However , this is not sufficient to confirm the suspicion of certain PIDs. Our innovative approach to diagnostics outlines the algorithm for PIDs and the clinical utility of immunophenotyping with a custom-designed multigene panel. We have designed a diagnostic algorithm based on flow cytometry studies to classify the patients; then the selected multigene panel was sequenced. In silico analysis for mutations was carried out using SIFT , Polyphen-2 , and MutationTaster. The causative mutation was identified in 46 % of PIDs. Based on these results , this new algorithm including immune phenotyping and NGS for PIDs was suggested for the clinical use. This study provides a thorough validation of diagnostic algorithm and indicates that still the traditional methods can be used to collect significant information related to design of most current diagnostics. The benefits of such testing are for diagnosis and prevention including the prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , and research.
