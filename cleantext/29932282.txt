  Invasive mold infections ( IMIs) are a leading cause of mortality among immunocompromised patients. Isavuconazole is a new drug that shows promise in the adult population for the treatment of IMIs. No data regarding the use of isavuconazole in pediatric patients have been published. Patients with a diagnosis of IMI from our pediatric hemato-oncology division , treated with isavuconazole between 2010 and 2016 , were identified using the hospital 's computerized database. Data including demographics , clinical course , and outcome were collected. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained from two younger patients to guide dosing. In total , three patients ( 4.5 , 5 , and 19 years of age) with invasive mucormycosis who were treated with isavuconazole were identified. All patients were treated with isavuconazole as a second line therapy and experienced improvement following the initiation of this treatment. Based on our limited clinical experience , isavuconazole may be a safe and effective treatment option for children and adolescents afflicted by IMI. Prospective clinical trials should be performed in order to evaluate the pharmakokinetics and safety of isavuconazole in the pediatric population.
