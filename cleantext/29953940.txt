  Few patients with dysphagia<symptom> because of stroke receive early palliative care ( PC) to align treatment goals with their values , as called for by practice guidelines , particularly before enteral access procedures for artificial nutrition. To increase documented goals of care ( GOC) discussions among acute stroke patients before feeding gastrostomy tube placement. We undertook a rapid-cycle continuous quality improvement process with interdisciplinary planning , implementation , and performance review to operationalize an upstream trigger for PC referral prompted by the speech and language pathology evaluation. During a six-month period , 21 patients underwent gastrostomy tube placement; 52 % had preprocedure GOC discussions postintervention , with the rate of compliance increasing steadily from 13 % ( 11/87 , preintervention) to 100 % ( 2/2) in the final two months. We effectively increased documented GOC discussions before feeding gastrostomy tube placement among stroke patients. Systems-based tools and education will enhance this upstream trigger model to ensure early PC for stroke patients.
