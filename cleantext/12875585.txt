  The purpose of this study was to clarify the factors related to mental health and hearing in community-dwelling elderly. Elderly participants in a project to prevent long-term care need were given a self-administered questionnaire and tested by pure-tone audiometry. One hundred fifty were taken as subjects. Forty-one of these subjects ( 27.3 %) were found to have poor mental health. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis with mental health level as the dependent variable indicated that subjects 65-74 years old who did not think their own hearing was bad had better mental health than those who did think their hearing was bad ( odds ratio 10.800). Among subjects 75 years and older , those who had not been certified as needing long-term care had better mental health than those who had been certified ( odds ratio 3.937). When planning mental health support for community-dwelling elderly in the future , it will be necessary to consider differences in background due to age group. The present results suggest that appropriate support for awareness of hearing and acceptance of decreased hearing ability in people in early old age ( 65-74 years old) may help to prevent declining mental health in later old age.
