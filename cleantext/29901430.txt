  Operating theatre scrub<disease> nurses ( OTSNs) are not required to have undertaken a secondary or specialist post-registration theatre qualification to work in the operating theatre ( OT) setting in the UK. From the systematic review there is only very limited literature or research in how technical scrub<disease> skills are acquired. This study explores the lived experiences of OTSNs learning technical scrub<disease> skills. The study employed the qualitative methodology of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Data was collected from six participating OTSNs using semi-structured interviews. Four superordinate themes emerged: How technical scrub<disease> skills are established , Gatekeepers , How the learner feels whilst learning and , Reflections of the experienced scrub<disease> nurse. The study found that the experiences of OTSNs learning technical scrub<disease> skills are varied and a variety of teaching and learning methods are utilised. These experiences were influenced by the team , mentor and surgeon within the OT environment. Lived experiences were also influenced by organisational structure and service pressures within the NHS.
