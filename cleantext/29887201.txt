  We examined seasonal and longitudinal patterns in the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria in the James River Estuary ( Virginia). Highest chlorophyll and cyanobacteria levels were observed in the tidal freshwater segment , particularly during dry summers when freshwater replacement time was long. Cyanobacteria accounted for a small proportion of phytoplankton biomass ( 7-15 %) , and Microcystis comprised a small proportion of the cyanobacteria ( < 1 %). Despite this , measureable levels of microcystin were commonly observed in water ( > 85 % of samples in July , August and September) , fish tissues ( 87 % of planktivorous fishes) and shellfish ( 83 % of individuals). Generic indicators of algal blooms ( chlorophyll and algal biomass) had limited utility for predicting microcystin concentrations. However , chlorophyll was found to be a useful predictor for the probability of exceeding specific toxin thresholds. Tissue microcystin concentrations were highest in fish and shellfish collected from the tidal fresh segment , but were detectable in biota collected from the oligohaline at distances 50 km seaward.
