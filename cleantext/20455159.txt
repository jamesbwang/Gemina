  Ochratoxin A is a potent toxic fungal metabolite whose undesirable presence in food commodities constitutes a problem of public health , so it is strictly regulated and controlled. For the first time , two derivatives of ochratoxin A ( OTAb and OTAd) functionalized through positions other than the native carboxyl group of the mycotoxin , have been synthesized in order to better mimic , during the immunization process , the steric and conformational properties of the target analyte. Additionally , two conventional haptens making use of that native carboxyl group for protein coupling ( OTAe and OTAf) were also prepared as controls for the purpose of comparison. The immunological performance in rabbits of protein conjugates based on OTAb and OTAd overcome that of conjugates employing OTAe and OTAf as haptens. After immunization of mice with OTAb and OTAd conjugates , a collection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies to ochratoxin A was generated. In particular , one of those antibodies , the so-called OTAb # 311 , is very likely the best antibody produced so far in terms of selectivity and affinity to ochratoxin A.
