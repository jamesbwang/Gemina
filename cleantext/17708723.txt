  This study aimed to assess the knowledge , attitudes and skills of non-specialist doctors on timely referral of suspicious lesions<symptom> for melanoma diagnosis. One hundred and twenty-three doctors ( mean age; 30.4 years , SD Â± 8.015) were enrolled. Very few ( 3.3 %) correctly stated all four types of melanoma. Only 8.1 % of the total sample had been trained to perform a total body examination for skin cancer detection and a majority ( 110/123) had never performed one. Almost all ( 95.2 %) were not confident in using a dermatoscope for examination of a skin<symptom> lesion<symptom>. Only 17.9 % of participants had discussed skin cancer/melanoma risk reduction with patients. Only 13.8 % had educated at least one patient regarding skin self-examination for suspicious skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Knowledge and clinical skills regarding melanoma recognition was unsatisfactory in our sample. Urgent attention is needed to bridge the gap in knowledge and clinical skills on this topic.
