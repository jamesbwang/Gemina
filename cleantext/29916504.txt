  A nickel-catalyzed cyanation of phenol derivatives activated by 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine ( TCT) using aminoacetonitrile as the cyanating agent is described. This catalytic system delivered the desired products in moderate to good yields with good substrate compatibility. The readily available starting materials , cost-effective nickel catalyst and metal-free cyanating agent are the major features of the present method.
