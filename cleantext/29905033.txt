  Ultrafiltration-level polyacrylonitrile ( PAN) flat sheet membranes<symptom> were chemically modified through cross-linking and hydrolysis to provide a suitable surface for the growth of a selective layer composed of a Zn benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid ( Zn ( BDC)) metal-organic framework ( MOF). Unlike typical membrane modification methods or conventional MOF synthesis procedures , deionized ( DI) water was the only solvent used for each of the modification steps. To better understand the layer-by-layer MOF growth process , several MOF growth conditions were also studied , including the effects of solution concentration , growth temperature , membrane immersion time and the number of layers. Subsequently , organic solvent nanofiltration ( OSN) was used to test the effectiveness of the modifications and compare the performances of the fabricated membranes<symptom>. With the appropriate combination of the MOF growth conditions , the layer-by-layer method was used to produce an OSN membrane with an isopropanol permeance of 2.39 L m
