  Oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> are two key secondary pathological mechanisms following spinal cord injury ( SCI). Ketogenic diet ( KD) and its metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate have been found to exhibit anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties both in rats with SCI and in healthy rats; however , the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We investigated the effects of KD on the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> , activation of nuclear factor-E2 related factor 2 ( Nrf2) , and inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) signaling pathway in rats with SCI. We assessed functional recovery and evaluated the status of oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> using tests of superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase activity. We further assessed the presence of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α) , interleukin 1β ( IL-1β) , and interferon γ ( IFN-γ) by ELISA. Western blotting was used to detect Nrf2 and NF-κB pathway-associated proteins in spinal cord tissue. Finally , we measured the levels of the NF-κB downstream genes TNF-α , IL-1β , and IFN-γ by western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR. Following SCI , KD improved functional recovery , attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> , and induced Nrf2 activation. In addition , KD suppressed the NF-κB pathway and the expression of TNF-α , IL-1β , and IFN-γ. Together , these findings provide new insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms of KD.
