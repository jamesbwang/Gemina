  Compton imaging is a promising technology for various applications including nuclear safety , nuclear medicine , and astrophysics. For quasi-point-source applications , which are widely found in practice , a novel Compton imaging algorithm incorporating the concept of self-adaption is proposed that provides excellent precision and high efficiency. In particular , this algorithm significantly improves the imaging precision of backward-scattering imaging events so that they can be revived for reconstruction without degrading image quality. From Monte Carlo simulations , a comparison between the self-adaption Compton imaging algorithm and the conventional Compton imaging algorithm was conducted , and the feasibility and reliability of this algorithm was verified in various scenarios.
