  In a self-paced reading study on German sluicing , Paape ( Paape , 2016) found that reading times were shorter at the ellipsis site when the antecedent was a temporarily ambiguous garden-path structure. As a post-hoc explanation of this finding , Paape assumed that the antecedent 's memory representation was reactivated during syntactic reanalysis , making it easier to retrieve. In two eye tracking experiments , we subjected the reactivation hypothesis to further empirical scrutiny. Experiment 1 , carried out in French , showed no evidence in favor in the reactivation hypothesis. Instead , results for one out of the three types of garden-path sentences that were tested suggest that subjects sometimes failed to resolve the temporary ambiguity in the antecedent clause , and subsequently failed to resolve the ellipsis. The results of Experiment 2 , a conceptual replication of Paape 's ( Paape , 2016) original study carried out in German , are compatible with the reactivation hypothesis , but leave open the possibility that the observed speedup for ambiguous antecedents may be due to occasional retrievals of an incorrect structure.
