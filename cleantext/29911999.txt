  The diagnosis of small round cell tumors always has been extremely difficult , and our current classification systems continue to evolve. Since its initial discovery by Dr James Ewing , the historical context of what is acceptably included under the designation `` Ewing sarcoma<disease> '' has changed. Although Ewing sarcoma<disease> and primitive neuroectodermal tumor were both initially described in the early 20th century , these tumors were considered likely distinct entities until the end of that same century , almost 75 years later. With modern immunohistochemistry and more recent advances in molecular techniques , the understanding of Ewing sarcoma<disease> and Ewing-like tumors has improved dramatically but also raises new questions and challenges. We now know that this category of tumors is remarkably more heterogenous than initially thought , especially in regards to its cytogenetics and molecular properties , and some of these differences likely have prognostic relevance. Whether we are now expanding the spectrum of Ewing sarcoma<disease> or simply recognizing new entities is controversial. Therapeutic approaches to address these new categories and/or entities need further focus and attention. Herein , we provide a comprehensive historical perspective on Ewing sarcoma<disease> , Ewing-like tumors ( CIC and BCOR-rearranged sarcomas<disease>) , and related and/or similar small round cell tumors , often included in the differential diagnosis , including mesenchymal chondrosarcoma , desmoplastic small round cell tumor , and small cell osteosarcoma. We also seek to provide updates and insights into the evolving classification and clinical relevance of the Ewing family of tumors.
