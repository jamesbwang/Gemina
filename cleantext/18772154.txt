  Systems biology is an important field for understanding whole biological mechanisms composed of interactions between biological components. One approach for understanding complex and diverse mechanisms is to analyze biological pathways. However , because these pathways consist of important interactions and information on these interactions is disseminated in a large number of biomedical reports , text-mining techniques are essential for extracting these relationships automatically. In this study , we applied node2vec , an algorithmic framework for feature learning in networks , for relationship extraction. To this end , we extracted genes from paper abstracts using pkde4j , a text-mining tool for detecting entities and relationships. Using the extracted genes , a co-occurrence network was constructed and node2vec was used with the network to generate a latent representation. To demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec in extracting relationships between genes , performance was evaluated for gene-gene interactions involved in a type 2 diabetes pathway. Moreover , we compared the results of node2vec to those of baseline methods such as co-occurrence and DeepWalk. Node2vec outperformed existing methods in detecting relationships in the type 2 diabetes pathway , demonstrating that this method is appropriate for capturing the relatedness between pairs of biological entities involved in biological pathways. The results demonstrated that node2vec is useful for automatic pathway construction.
