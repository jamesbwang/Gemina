  Children with primary hypertension have been reported to have diminished scores in measures of cognition. However , little is known about the relative correlation between office and ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and neurocognitive test performance , and whether short-term BP variability is associated with decreased neurocognitive function. We sought to determine whether ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM) was more strongly associated with neurocognitive test performance compared with office BP , and whether increased short-term BP variability was associated with lower neurocognitive scores. Seventy-five subjects ages 10-18 years , with untreated primary hypertension , and 75 matched normotensive controls completed neurocognitive testing. All subjects had office BP and ABPM prior to neurocognitive testing. On multivariate analyses , there was no significant association between office BP and neurocognitive tests. However , several ABPM parameters were significantly associated with neurocognitive test scores in the lower quartile , in particular 24 h SBP load and wake systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) index ( Rey Auditory Verbal learning Test ( RAVLT) List A Trial 1 , 24 h SBP load , odds ratio ( OR) = 1.02 , wake SBP index , OR = 1.06; List A Total , 24 h SBP load , OR = 1.02 , wake SBP index , OR = 1.06; Short Delay Recall , wake SBP index , OR = 1.06; CogState Maze delayed recall , 24 h SBP load , OR = 1.03 , wake SBP index , OR = 1.08; Grooved Pegboard , 24 h SBP load , OR = 1.02; all p < 0.05). In contrast , short-term BP variability measures were not associated with neurocognitive test performance. ABPM is superior to office BP in distinguishing hypertensive youth with lower neurocognitive test performance.
