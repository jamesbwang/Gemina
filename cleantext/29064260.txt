  Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD) are one of the most common causes of emergency hospital admission and place great burden upon healthcare systems. Furthermore , AECOPD represent an important life event for patients , and are associated with significant reductions in physical activity , skeletal muscle function , exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation , an intervention comprising supervised exercise-training and education , may counteract these negative consequences and target modifiable risk factors for hospital readmission. A recent Cochrane systematic review included 20 randomized controlled trials comparing pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbation of COPD versus conventional care. Overall , the evidence supports moderate to large effects on health-related quality of life and exercise capacity. However , there is substantial heterogeneity across studies , and more recent studies have been more equivocal , including around hospital readmissions , particularly when rehabilitation is started in the inpatient setting. In this narrative review , we examine the rationale for pulmonary rehabilitation following AECOPD with a particular focus on skeletal muscle function , review the current evidence for pulmonary rehabilitation in the AECOPD setting , and identify areas that require future research , including the structure and nature of the intervention , improving uptake and adherence , and the role of alternative rehabilitation strategies for patients with AECOPD.
