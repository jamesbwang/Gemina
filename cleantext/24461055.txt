  The medicinal fungus Laetiporus sulphureus is widely distributed worldwide. To screen for molecular markers potentially useful for phylogenetic analyses of this species and related species , the mitochondrial genome of L. sulphureus was sequenced and assembled. The complete circular mitochondrial genome was 101,111 bp long , and contained 38 protein-coding genes ( PCGs) , 2 rRNA genes , and 25 tRNA genes. Our BLAST search aligned about 6.1 kb between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of L. sulphureus , indicative of possible gene transfer events. Both the GC and AT skews in the L. sulphureus mitogenome were negative , in contrast to the other seven Polyporales species tested. Of the 15 PCGs conserved across the seven species of Polyporales , the lengths of 11 were unique in the L. sulphureus mitogenome. The Ka/Ks of these 15 PCGs were all less than 1 , indicating that PCGs were subject to purifying selection. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that three single genes ( cox1 , cob , and rnl) were potentially useful as molecular markers. This study is the first publication of a mitochondrial genome in the family Laetiporaceae , and will facilitate the study of population genetics and evolution in L. sulphureus and other species in this family.
