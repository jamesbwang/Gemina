  Breast cancer is known as the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide , and has an undeniable negative impact on public health , both physically , and mentally. This study aims to investigate the effects of toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) gene silencing on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells to explore for a new theoretical basis for its treatment. TLR4 small interference RNA ( siRNA) fragment recombinant plasmids were constructed , including TLR4 siRNA-1 , TLR4 siRNA-2 , and TLR4 siRNA-3. Human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were assigned into blank , negative control ( NC) , TLR4 siRNA-1 , TLR4 siRNA-2 , and TLR4 siRNA-3 groups. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth was detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the expression of TLR4 , CDK4 , cyclin D1 , Livin , Bcl-2 , p53 , c-FLIP , and caspase-3. In comparison with the NC and blank groups , the TLR4 siRNA-1 , TLR4 siRNA-2 , and TLR4 siRNA-3 groups showed decreased the expression of TLR4 , inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and promoted MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis , and the cells were blocked in G1 phase. In comparison with the NC and blank groups , in the TLR4 siRNA-1 , TLR4 siRNA-2 , and TLR4 siRNA-3 groups , siRNA-TLR4 significantly increased expression of p53 and caspase-3 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells , while it decreased the expressions of CDK4 , cyclinD1 , Livin , Bal-2 , and c-FLIP. The study demonstrates that TLR4 gene silencing inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
