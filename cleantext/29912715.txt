  Ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor is a rare and benign neoplasm with a predilection for the anterior dorsal tongue. Despite morphologic heterogeneity , most cases are characterized by a proliferation of bland spindle cells with a distinctive reticular growth pattern and myxoid stroma. The immunophenotype of these neoplasms is likewise variable; most cases express glial fibrillary acid protein and S100 protein , with inconsistent reports of keratin and myoid marker expression. The molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood; however , a subset of cases has been reported to harbor EWSR1 gene rearrangement. Following identification of an RREB1-MKL2 fusion gene by RNA Sequencing in an index patient , a retrospective review of additional cases of ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumors was performed to better characterize the clinical , immunohistochemical , and molecular attributes of this neoplasm. A total of 21 cases were included in this series. A marked predisposition for the dorsal tongue was confirmed. Most cases conformed to prior morphologic descriptions; however , hypercellularity , hyalinized stroma , and necrosis<symptom> were rare attributes not previously emphasized. The neoplastic cells frequently coexpressed glial fibrillary acid protein , S100 protein , keratin , smooth muscle actin , and/or desmin; a single case was found to contain significant myogenin expression. An RREB1-MKL2 fusion product was identified in 19 tumors ( 90 %) , a single tumor ( 5 %) had an EWSR1-CREM fusion product , and the remaining case lacked any known fusion gene by RNA Sequencing. The latter 2 cases subtly differed morphologically from many in the cohort. This series illustrates that recurrent RREB1-MKL2 fusions occur in most , perhaps all , cases of ectomesenchymal chondromyxoid tumor.
