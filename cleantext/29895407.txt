  Normal phase ( NP) high-performance liquid and sub- and supercritical fluid chromatographic ( both acronymed as SFC) methods have been developed for the enantiomer separation of three basic and three ampholytic structurally related C-3-substituted indole analogs on seven non-ionic ( neutral) polysaccharide-based and two chemically entirely different zwitterionic Cinchona alkaloid- and sulfonic acid-based chiral stationary phases ( CSPs). In a systematic fashion the effect of the composition of the mobile phase , the nature of the alcohol and amine additives on the retention characteristics and enantioselectivity of the ionizable analytes were investigated. On all studied polysaccharide-based CSPs the three ampholytes remained unretained in NP-LC mode , while they were nicely retained and resolved in SFC mode. These unexpected results underline a specific property of liquid CO
