  Creating and teaching successful writing and communication assignments for biology undergraduate students can be challenging for faculty trying to balance the teaching of technical content. The growing body of published research and scholarship on effective teaching of writing and communication in biology can help inform such work , but there are also local resources available to support writing within biology courses that may be unfamiliar to science faculty and instructors. In this article , we discuss common on-campus resources biology faculty can make use of when incorporating writing and communication into their teaching. We present the missions , histories , and potential collaboration outcomes of three major on-campus writing resources: writing across the curriculum and writing in the disciplines initiatives ( WAC/WID) , writing programs , and writing centers. We explain some of the common misconceptions about these resources in order to help biology faculty understand their uses and limits , and we offer guiding questions faculty might ask the directors of these resources to start productive conversations. Collaboration with these resources will likely save faculty time and effort on curriculum development and , more importantly , will help biology students develop and improve their critical reading , writing , and communication skills.
