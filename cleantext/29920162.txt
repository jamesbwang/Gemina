  The QRS-T angle is a key ECG predictor for ventricular arrhythmia. Lead has a strong relation with cardiovascular diseases; however , no study has been conducted to investigate the association between lead exposure and QRS-T angle. Thus , we explored this association in a population-based representative sample: NHANES III. We used the standard 12-lead ECGs to calculate Spatial QRS-T angles. Blood lead concentrations were measured using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry method. We conducted multivariate weighted logistic regression to adjust for impaired fasting glucose , hypertension , poverty index , age , race , and smoking status. We found that when the logarithm of blood lead increased by one unit , the odds of an abnormal QRS-T angle increased by 34 % among men and 4 % among women. We suggest the use of QRS-T angle deviation among those who are exposed to lead to detect individuals at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
