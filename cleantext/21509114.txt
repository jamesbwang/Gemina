  ( Purpose) To explore the effects of good binocular visual acuity ( BVA) compared to poor BVA , reach distance , task velocity , and center of mass ( COM) acceleration were evaluated in elderly females performing the Y-Balance Test ( YBT) using a cross-sectional design. ( Subjects and Methods) A total of 13 participants had BVA of ≥ 0.4 log of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR) ( poor BVA group) , and the other 13 had BVA of ≤ 0.3 logMAR ( good BVA group). An accelerometer was attached over participants ' L3 spinous process , and they then performed the YBT. ( Results) The normalized reach distances in the three directions among the good BVA group were longer than those among the poor BVA group. The task velocity in the good BVA group was significantly higher , whereas COM acceleration in the A direction was significantly lower compared with the poor BVA group. ( Conclusion) Visual status must be considered when older adult individuals undergo physical therapy and functional training to ensure that healthcare professionals can better assist older adult women.
