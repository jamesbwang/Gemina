  The response to temozolomide ( TMZ) treatment in small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC) correlated with O ( 6)- methylguanine- DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT) promoter methylation. 1p/19q co-deletion within oligodendroglioma is a responsive predictor for TMZ. Currently , the status of MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion in pulmonary carcinoid ( PC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma ( LCNEC) is not reported. Nine PC ( two atypical carcinoids ( AC) , seven typical carcinoids ( TC)) and six LCNEC patients were collected retrospectively. The pyrosequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to detect the MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion in surgically resected specimens. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the rate of disease-free survival ( DFS). MGMT promoter methylation was found in two ( 2/6 , 15.3 %) LCNEC patients but not in any PC patients. Three ( 3/6 , 50 %) 1p and two ( 2/6 , 33.3 %) 19q single deletions were found in LCNEC patients. One 1p single deletion was found in AC patients. One ( 1/7 , 14.3 %) 1p and two ( 2/7 , 28.6 %) 19q single deletions were found in TC patients. After a median follow-up of 38 months , three LCNEC patients developed distant metastasis and one patient died of LCNEC disease. The DFS of PC patients was much longer than LCNEC patients ( Ï‡ MGMT promoter methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion might not be the ideal biomarkers for TMZ treatment in TC/AC patients. Thus , the detection of MGMT promoter methylation and whether it can be used as a medication for TMZ in LCNEC patients necessitates investigation. Furthermore , 1p deletion could be a negative prognostic factor for LCNEC patients.
