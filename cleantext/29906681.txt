  Negative symptoms have traditionally been assessed based on clinicians ' observations. The subjective experience of negative symptoms in people with psychosis may bring new insight. The Apathy Evaluation Scale ( AES) is commonly used to study apathy in psychosis and has corresponding self-rated ( AES-S) and clinician-rated ( AES-C) versions. The aim of the present study was to determine the validity and reliability of the AES-S by investigating its concordance with the AES-C. Eighty-four first-episode ( FEP) patients completed the shortened 12-item AES-S and AES-C at baseline ( T1) and 12 months ( T2). Concordance was studied by degree of correlation , comparison of mean scores , and change and difference between diagnostic groups. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS) was used to study convergent and discriminative properties. High concordance was found between AES-S and AES-C at both T1 and T2 regarding mean values , change from T1 to T2 , and the proportion with high levels of apathy. Both versions indicated high levels of apathy in FEP , while associations with PANSS negative symptoms were weaker for AES-S than AES-C. Controlling for depression<symptom> did not significantly alter results. We concluded that self-rated apathy in FEP patients is in concordance with clinician ratings , but in need of further study.
