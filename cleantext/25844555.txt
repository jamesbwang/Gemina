  To evaluate the use of virtual reality ( VR) therapies as a clinical tool for the management of acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Recent articles support the hypothesis that VR therapies can effectively distract patients who suffer from chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and from acute<symptom> pain<symptom> stimulated in trials. Clinical studies yield promising results in the application of VR therapies to a variety of acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions , including fibromyalgia , phantom limb<symptom> pain<symptom> , and regional specific pain from past injuries and illnesses. Current management techniques for acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , such as opioids and physical therapy , are often incomplete or ineffective. VR trials demonstrate a potential to redefine the approach to treating acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in the clinical setting. Patient immersion in interactive virtual reality provides distraction from painful stimuli and can decrease an individual 's perception of the pain. In this review , we discuss the use of VR to provide patient distraction from acute<symptom> pain<symptom> induced from electrical , thermal , and pressure conditions. We also discuss the application of VR technologies to treat various chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions in both outpatient and inpatient settings.
