  Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 ( IDO1) catalyzes the oxidation of tryptophan into kynurenine and is partially responsible for acquired immune tolerance associated with cancer. The IDO1 small molecule inhibitor navoximod ( GDC-0919 , NLG-919) is active as a combination therapy in multiple tumor models. This open-label Phase Ia study assessed safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK) , pharmacodynamics ( PD) , and preliminary anti-tumor activity of navoximod in patients with recurrent/advanced solid tumors , administered as 50-800 mg BID on a 21/28 day and at 600 mg on a 28/28 day schedule. Plasma kynurenine and tryptophan were longitudinally evaluated and tumor assessments were performed. Patients ( n = 22) received a median of 3 cycles of navoximod. No maximum tolerated dose was reached. One dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 4 lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage<symptom> was reported. Adverse events ( AEs) regardless of causality in ≥ 20 % of patients included fatigue<symptom> ( 59 %) , cough<symptom> , decreased appetite<symptom> , and pruritus ( 41 % each) , nausea<symptom> ( 36 %) , and vomiting<symptom> ( 27 %). Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in 14/22 patients ( 64 %) , and were related to navoximod in two patients ( 9 %). Navoximod was rapidly absorbed ( T Navoximod was well-tolerated at doses up to 800 mg BID decreasing plasma kynurenine levels consistent with its half-life. Stable disease responses were observed.
