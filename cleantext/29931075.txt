  Dimethylglycine sodium salt ( DMG-Na) , has exhibited excellent advantages in animal experiments and human health. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with 0.1 % DMG-Na on the growth performance , hepatic antioxidant capacity and mRNA expression of mitochondria-related genes in low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) piglets during weaning period. Sixteen piglets with normal birth weight ( NBW) and sixteen LBW piglets were fed either a basal diet or a 0.1 % DMG-Na supplemented diet from age of 21 d to 49 d. Blood and liver samples were collected at the end of the study. The results showed that compared with NBW piglets , LBW piglets exhibited greater ( P < 0.05) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) and alkaline phosphatase activities in the serum. LBW decreased ( P < 0.05) the activity of glutathione peroxidase , and increased ( P < 0.05) the contents of malondialdehyde and H2O2 in liver. DMG-Na supplementation increased ( P < 0.05) body<symptom> weight gain , feed intake , and feed efficiency , decreased ( P < 0.05) ALT and AST activities , and reduced the content of H2O2 in LBW piglets. LBW piglets had downregulated ( P < 0.05) mRNA expression of thioredoxin 2 , thioredoxin reductases 2 , and nuclear respiratory factor-1 ( Nrf1) in the liver. However , DMG-Na supplementation increased ( P < 0.05) mRNA expression of Nrf1 in the liver. In conclusion , DMG-Na supplementation has beneficial effects in alleviating LBW-induced hepatic oxidative damage and changed mitochondrial genes expression levels , which is associated with increased antioxidant enzyme activities and up-regulating mRNA gene abundance.
