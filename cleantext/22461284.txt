  To compare short with long intramedullary hip nailing for elderly patients with unstable pertrochanteric fractures. We prospectively studied 50 patients ( 33 women , 17 men; mean age , 80 years; range , 74-93 years) with unstable pertrochanteric fractures admitted and treated with a short ( group A) or a long ( group B) intramedullary hip nail from January 2013 to 2017. The patients were randomly allocated into each group according to their order of admission. The mean follow-up was 2 years ( range , 1-5 years). We evaluated operative time , function , fracture healing , varus/valgus loss of reduction , and distance between the distal line of the fracture and the distal locking screw of the nail. Operative time was significantly shorter in group A. Function , fracture healing and varus/valgus loss of reduction was similar between the two groups. The mean distance between the distal fracture line and distal locking screw was 7.2 cm ( range , 3-10 cm) in patients of group A; in all patients of group B , an appropriate nail length was chosen so that the distal locking screw was inserted at least 3 times the diameter of the bone at the distal fracture line. Complications included periprosthetic fracture ( one patient of group A) , and z-effect phenomenon ( one patient of group B); complications rate was similar between the two groups. Short intramedullary hip nailing is associated with similar function and complications , but shorter operative time compared to long intramedullary hip nails for patients with unstable pertrochanteric fractures.
