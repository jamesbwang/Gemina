  Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA) is caused by deletions/mutations in SMN1. Most heterozygous SMA carriers have only one SMN1 copy in one of the alleles ( 1/0 carriers). However , a few carriers lack SMN1 in one of their chromosomes , but present two gene copies in the other. These `` 2/0 carriers '' are undistinguishable from non-carrier individuals ( 1/1) with currently available methods. Previous association of SMN1 variants c. * 3 + 80 T > G and c. * 211 _ * 212del with two SMN1 copies in cis in Ashkenazi population prompted us to analyze them in 270 Spanish individuals ( SMA carriers , patients and general population). Both variants were much more frequently detected in chromosomes with 2 SMN1 copies in cis in comparison with chromosomes carrying one copy ( 17.9 vs. 0.7 %; p < 0.001). In particular , one-fifth of 2/0 SMA carriers harboured one or both variants compared to none of 99 non-carriers with two SMN1 copies ( p < 0.001). The c. * 211 _ * 212del variant was also much more frequent in exon 8 of SMN2-SMN1 hybrids than in that of intact SMN1 genes ( 20 vs. 0.83 % , p < 0.001) , suggesting its association with chromosomal rearrangements. Although absence of these variants does not exclude that a particular individual is a 2/0 SMA carrier , their presence is valuable to substantially increase residual risk in putative carriers , thus improving genetic counselling.
