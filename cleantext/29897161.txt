  Epidemiological studies on pressure ulcers<disease> ( PUs) in hospitalised infants are scarce. Spain lacks comprehensive research studies providing data on the prevalence or incidence in this population. This work was developed to determine the incidence of PUs in hospitalised infants admitted to intensive and intermediate care units , along with relevant risk factors and preventive measures. A prospective study appraising the incidence of PUs in infants was performed. The risk factors and preventive measures were evaluated using a multivariate logistic regression model. A sample of 268 infants was included. The cumulative incidence of PUs was 12.70 % ( 95 % confidence interval , CI
