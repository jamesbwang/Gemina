  New drugs that improve the function of the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) protein with discreet disease-causing variants have been successfully developed for cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) patients. Preclinical model systems have played a critical role in this process , and have the potential to inform researchers and CF healthcare providers regarding the nature of defects in rare CFTR variants , and to potentially support use of modulator therapies in new populations. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ( CFF) assembled a workshop of international experts to discuss the use of preclinical model systems to examine the nature of CF-causing variants in CFTR and the role of in vitro CFTR modulator testing to inform in vivo modulator use. The theme of the workshop was centered on CFTR theratyping , a term that encompasses the use of CFTR modulators to define defects in CFTR in vitro , with application to both common and rare CFTR variants. Several preclinical model systems were identified in various stages of maturity , ranging from the expression of CFTR variant cDNA in stable cell lines to examination of cells derived from CF patients , including the gastrointestinal tract , the respiratory tree , and the blood. Common themes included the ongoing need for standardization , validation , and defining the predictive capacity of data derived from model systems to estimate clinical outcomes from modulator-treated CF patients. CFTR modulator theratyping is a novel and rapidly evolving field that has the potential to identify rare CFTR variants that are responsive to approved drugs or drugs in development.
