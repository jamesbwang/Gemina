  Metronidazole-resistant Bacteroides<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> ( B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen>) have been reported worldwide. Several mechanisms contribute to B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> resistance to metronidazole. In some cases , the mechanisms of metronidazole resistance are unknown. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is important for therapy , the design of new alternative drugs , and control of resistant strains. In this study , a comprehensive review of the B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> resistance mechanisms to metronidazole was prepared. The rate of metronidazole-resistant B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> has been reported as ranging from 0.5 % to 7.8 % in many surveys. According to CLSI , isolates with MICs ≥ 32 μg/mL are considered to be metronidazole-resistant. In the majority of cases , metronidazole resistance in B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> is coupled with the existence of nim genes. Metronidazole resistance could be induced in nim-negative strains by exposure to sub-MIC levels of metronidazole. There are multi-drug efflux pumps in B.<pathogen> fragilis<pathogen> which can pump out a variety of substrates such as metronidazole. The recA overexpression and deficiency of feoAB are other reported metronidazole resistance mechanisms in this
