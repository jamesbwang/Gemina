  Mitochondrial transcription factor A ( TFAM) is essential for the maintenance , expression and transmission of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA). However , mechanisms for the post-translational regulation of TFAM are poorly understood. Here , we show that TFAM is lysine acetylated within its high-mobility-group box 1 , a domain that can also be serine phosphorylated. Using bulk and single-molecule methods , we demonstrate that site-specific phosphoserine and acetyl-lysine mimics of human TFAM regulate its interaction with non-specific DNA through distinct kinetic pathways. We show that higher protein concentrations of both TFAM mimics are required to compact DNA to a similar extent as the wild-type. Compaction is thought to be crucial for regulating mtDNA segregation and expression. Moreover , we reveal that the reduced DNA binding affinity of the acetyl-lysine mimic arises from a lower on-rate , whereas the phosphoserine mimic displays both a decreased on-rate and an increased off-rate. Strikingly , the increased off-rate of the phosphoserine mimic is coupled to a significantly faster diffusion of TFAM on DNA. These findings indicate that acetylation and phosphorylation of TFAM can fine-tune TFAM-DNA binding affinity , to permit the discrete regulation of mtDNA dynamics. Furthermore , our results suggest that phosphorylation could additionally regulate transcription by altering the ability of TFAM to locate promoter sites.
