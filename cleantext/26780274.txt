  Decreased levels of vitamin D were associated with increased risk of multiple diseases , including cardiovascular diseases. However , there seem to be some discrepancies among the results obtained from different studies. The aim of the present study was to explore the importance of having sufficient serum levels of vitamin D in reducing the incidence and the progression of coronary artery stenosis and ischemic heart disease ( IHD). Serum levels of vitamin D were measured using radioimmunoassay in 186 Jordanian patients who underwent investigative coronary catheterization. Of these patients , 133 were suffering from coronary artery stenosis. The association between vitamin D levels , coronary stenosis and many risk factors was determined using SPSS software. Interestingly , the current results did not show an association between vitamin D abnormalities and the incidence or the reoccurrence of coronary artery stenosis. Moreover , significant differences were detected in the prevalence of vitamin D abnormalities based on the patient 's gender , and there was a significant association between vitamin D abnormalities and both body mass index and dyslipidemia. However , current results did not show any significant association with other risk factors for IHD. For instance , no association was found with smoking , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , stable and unstable angina or with acute recent myocardial infarction.
