  Determine if mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI) history is associated with balance<symptom> disturbances. Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium ( CENC) centres. The CENC multi-centre study enrols post-9/ 11 era Service Members and Veterans with combat exposure. This sample ( n = 322) consisted of enrolees completing initial evaluation by September 2016 at the three sites conducting computerized dynamic post-urography ( CDP) testing. Observational study with cross-sectional analyses using structural equation modelling. Comprehensive structured interviews were used to diagnose all lifetime mild traumatic brain injuries ( mTBIs). The outcome , Sensory Organization Test ( SOT) , was measured on CDP dual-plate force platform. Other studied variables were measured by structured interviews , record review and questionnaires. The overall positive/negative mTBI classification did not have a significant effect on the composite equilibrium score. However , the repetitive mTBI classification showed lower scores for participants with â‰¥ 3 mTBI versus 1-2 lifetime mTBIs. For repetitive mTBI , pain interference acted as a mediator for the indirect effect , and a direct effect was evident on some sensory condition equilibrium scores. These findings show that repeated mTBI , partially mediated by pain , may lead to later balance<symptom> disturbances among military combatants. Further study of CDP outcomes within this accruing cohort is warranted.
