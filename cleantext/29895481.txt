  To 1) identify barriers to medication adherence and 2) examine the relationship between the Indian Health Service ( IHS) 3 prime questions and medication adherence in patients with diabetes , hypertension , or hyperlipidemia before and 6 months after intervention. This quasi-experimental study evaluated the effectiveness of an adherence program at an independent community pharmacy. Patients who met inclusion criteria were telephoned monthly to answer questions related to their medications. Patients served as their own controls to show comparison between pre- and postintervention adherence rates calculated according to proportion of days covered over the previous 6 months. Mean medication adherences before and after intervention were assessed via paired t test. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of average medication adherence. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure the impact of comorbid conditions on medication adherence. Fifty-six of 354 patients met inclusion criteria , consented , and completed the study. The percentage of patients achieving an adherence rate of 80 % or more increased from 9 % initially to 59 % at study completion. Each medication class showed improvement in adherence rates: diabetes from 66.24 % to 80.06 % ( P = 0.0153) , hypertension from 72.33 % to 81.34 % ( P = 0.0192) , and hyperlipidemia from 64.45 % to 74.66 % ( P = 0.0103). Overall , average medication adherence increased by 11 % ( P < 0.0001). The top patient-reported barrier to adherence was convenience/forgetfulness ( 46.43 %). Pharmacist-led counseling sessions with the use of the 3 prime questions showed short-term improvement in adherence rates among patients participating in a medication adherence program. Future studies should assess if improved adherence is sustained long-term following active intervention.
