  Whereas statistical association<pathogen> of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection<pathogen> with cardiomyopathy<pathogen> is long known , establishment<pathogen> of a causal relationship<pathogen> has not been achieved so far. Patients<pathogen> with advanced heart<pathogen> failure<pathogen> ( HF<pathogen>) are mostly unable to tolerate interferon<pathogen> ( IFN)- based treatment<pathogen> , resulting in limited experience<pathogen> regarding the possible pathogenic role<pathogen> of HCV<pathogen> in this patient<pathogen> group<pathogen>. HCV<pathogen> infection<pathogen> often triggers disease<pathogen> in a broad spectrum<pathogen> of extrahepatic organs<pathogen> , with innate immune and autoimmune pathogenic processes<pathogen> involved. The fact<pathogen> that worldwide more than 70 million patients<pathogen> are chronically infected with HCV<pathogen> illustrates the possible clinical impact<pathogen> arising if cardiomyopathies<pathogen> were induced or aggravated by HCV<pathogen> , resulting in progressive HF<pathogen> or severe arrhythmias<pathogen>. A novel path<pathogen> has been opened to finally resolve the long-standing question<pathogen> of cause-effect relationship<pathogen> between HCV<pathogen> infection<pathogen> and cardiac dysfunction<pathogen> , by the recent development<pathogen> of IFN-free<pathogen> , highly efficient , and well tolerable anti-HCV regimens<pathogen>. The new direct-acting antiviral ( DAA<pathogen>) agents<pathogen> are highly virus-specific and lack unspecific side-effects<pathogen> upon cardiac function<pathogen> which have always confounded the interpretation<pathogen> of IFN treatment<pathogen> data<pathogen>. The actual frequency<pathogen> of unexplained HF<pathogen> in chronic HCV<pathogen> infection<pathogen> will be determined from a planned large-scale study<pathogen>. Whereas such patients<pathogen> probably constitute a rather small fraction<pathogen> of all those harboring HCV<pathogen> , they have major clinical relevance<pathogen>. It is not yet known which fraction<pathogen> of these patients<pathogen> will significantly benefit from HCV<pathogen> eradication<pathogen> , but this issue<pathogen> will be addressed now in a prospective
