  Fecal calprotectin ( FC) is a useful marker for assessing the activity of intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. However , most studies have used ileocolonoscopy to evaluate the association of FC with intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , and it is not clear whether FC is useful for the evaluation of small-bowel Crohn 's disease ( CD). This study aimed to determine the usefulness of FC for predicting intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> evaluated by balloon-assisted endoscopy ( BAE) , which can visualize the deep small intestine. This was a cross-sectional , observational study involving 69 CD patients , 39 of whom had only small-bowel disease. The extended simplified endoscopic activity score for Crohn 's disease ( eSES-CD) was calculated based on the findings of BAE. Mucosal healing was defined as an eSES-CD of 0. In all CD patients , FC levels were correlated with the eSES-CD ( r = 0.663 , P < 0.001). The cutoff value to predict mucosal healing was 92 mg/kg , with a sensitivity of 94 % , specificity of 88 % , positive predictive value of 98 % , negative predictive value of 64 % , and the area under the curve of 0.91. Even in small-bowel CD patients , FC levels were correlated with the eSES-CD ( r = 0.607 , P < 0.001). The cutoff value was 92 mg/kg , with a sensitivity of 87 % , specificity of 88 % , positive predictive value of 96 % , negative predictive value of 64 % , and area under the curve of 0.85. Fecal calprotectin showed a significant correlation with the intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> evaluated with BAE even in patients with only small intestinal disease. FC is useful for the evaluation of CD including both the small and large intestines.
