  Sanionia uncinata is a dominant moss species in the maritime Antarctic. Due to its high adaptability to harsh environments , this extremophile plant has been considered a good target for studying the molecular adaptation mechanisms of plants to a variety of environmental stresses. Despite the importance of S. uncinata as a representative Antarctic plant species for the identification and characterization of genes associated with abiotic stress tolerance , suitable reference genes , which are critical for RT-qPCR analyses , have not yet been identified. In this report , 11 traditionally used and 6 novel candidate reference genes were selected from transcriptome data of S. uncinata and the expression stability of these genes was evaluated under various abiotic stress conditions using three statistical algorithms; geNorm , NormFinder , and BestKeeper. The stability ranking analysis selected the best reference genes depending on the stress conditions. Among the 17 candidates , the most stable references were POB1 and UFD2 for cold stress , POB1 and AKB for drought treatment , and UFD2 and AKB for the field samples from a different water contents in Antarctica. Overall , novel genes POB1 and AKB were the most reliable references across all samples , irrespective of experimental conditions. In addition , 6 novel candidate genes including AKB , POB1 and UFD2 , were more stable than the housekeeping genes traditionally used for internal controls , indicating that transcriptome data can be useful for identifying novel robust normalizers. The reference genes validated in this study will be useful for improving the accuracy of RT-qPCR analysis for gene expression studies of S. uncinata in Antarctica and for further functional genomic analysis of bryophytes.
