  Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine ( Dex) can prolong the duration of analgesia when added to local anaesthetic as an adjuvant in a central or peripheral nerve block. We hypothesized that intrathecal Dex can reduce the ED95 of spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine. Therefore , we conducted this prospective , double-blinded , randomized study to verify our hypothesis. Ninety patients were allocated into the Dexmedetomidine group ( received bupivacaine + 5 mcg dexmedetomidine) and the Control group ( received bupivacaine + the same volume of saline) using a double-blinded and randomized method. The first patient in each group received 5 mg of IT hyperbaric bupivacaine , and the next dose for the following patient was determined by the probability of successful anaesthesia of the previous neighbouring dose. An improved up-down sequence allocated method combined with probit analysis was used to determine the ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine for the two groups. The ED95 and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI) of IT hyperbaric bupivacaine of the Dex group and Control group were 8.4 mg ( 95 % CI , 6.5 ~ 13.8 mg) and 12.1 mg ( 95 % CI , 8.3 ~ 312.8 mg) , respectively. The duration of sensory block was longer in the Dex group than in the Control group ( 110.3 ± 35.3 vs 67.5 ± 26.2). The duration of analgesia was also longer in the Dex group than in the Control group ( 224.9 ± 45.4 vs 155.1 ± 31.6). The consumption of postoperative rescued sufentanil was significantly higher in the Control group than in the Dex group. Intrathecal 5 mcg dexmedetomidine potentiated hyperbaric bupivacaine antinociception by 31 % in spinal anaesthesia for patients undergoing caesarean section. We registered this study in a Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR) centre on Nov 1st 2016 and received the registration number: ChiCTR-IPR-16009699.
