  Trail running is a complex sport and performance prediction is challenging. Our aim is to evaluate three standard laboratory exercise tests in trail runners and correlate measurements to the race time of a trail competition evaluating its predictive power. Nine competitive male trail runners ( mean age 31 ± 5.8 years) completed three different laboratory exercise tests ( step , ramp and trail test) for determination of VO Linear regression analysis revealed that variables measured during step and ramp test significantly predicted performance. Step test variables ( speed at individual anaerobic threshold ( IAT) 16.4 ± 1.7 km/h and RE 12km/h ( % VO The graded exercise test ( VO
