  The Pleistocenic Arc Hypothesis ( PAH) posits that South American Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests ( SDTF) were interconnected during Pleistocene glacial periods , enabling the expansion of species ranges that were subsequently fragmented in interglacial periods , promoting speciation. The lizard genus Lygodactylus occurs in Africa , Madagascar , and South America. Compared to the high diversity of African Lygodactylus , only two species are known to occur in South America , L. klugei and L. wetzeli , distributed in SDTFs and the Chaco , respectively. We use a phylogenetic approach based on mitochondrial ( ND2) and nuclear ( RAG-1) markers covering the known range of South American Lygodactylus to investigate ( i) if they are monophyletic relative to their African congeners , ( ii) if their divergence is congruent with the fragmentation of the PAH , and ( iii) if cryptic diversity exists within currently recognized species. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses recovered a well-supported monophyletic South American Lygodactylus , presumably resulting from a single trans-Atlantic dispersal event 29 Mya. Species delimitation analyses supported the existence of five putative species , three of them undescribed. Divergence times among L. klugei and the three putative undescribed species , all endemic to the SDTFs , are not congruent with the fragmentation of the PAH. However , fragmentation of the once broader and continuous SDTFs likely influenced the divergence of L. wetzeli in the Chaco and Lygodactylus sp. 3 ( in a SDTF enclave in the Cerrado).
