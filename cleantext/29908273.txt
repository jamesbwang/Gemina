  Controlling the activity of tyrosinase , which plays an important role in melanin synthesis , is essential endeavor in the field of medicine , food , cosmetics , and agriculture. Baicalein is a widely available inhibitor of tyrosinase. The mechanism of this inhibition was studied through an integrated approach coupling enzyme kinetics , multiple types of spectroscopy and computational simulation. Baicalein conspicuously inhibited the diphenolase activity with an IC
