  To explore the perceived barriers and facilitators of tele-rehabilitation by stroke patients , caregivers and rehabilitation therapists in an Asian setting. Qualitative study involving semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. General community PARTICIPANTS: 37 participants including stroke patients , their caregivers and tele-therapists selected by purposive sampling. STARS trial. Perceived barriers and facilitators for tele-rehabilitation uptake , as reported by patients , their caregivers and tele-therapists. Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify following themes: facilitators identified by patients were affordability and accessibility; by tele-therapists , was filling a service gap and common to both was unexpected benefits such as detection of uncontrolled hypertension. Barriers identified by patients were equipment set-up related difficulties and limited scope of exercises , by tele-therapists were patient assessments , interface problems and limited scope of exercises and common to both was connectivity barriers. Patient characteristics like age , stroke severity , caregiver support and cultural influence modified patient perceptions and choice of rehabilitation. Patient attributes and context are significant determinants in adoption and compliance of stroke patients to technology driven interventions like tele-rehabilitation. Policy recommendations from our work are inclusion of introductory videos in tele-rehabilitation program , provision of technical support to older patients , longer facetime sessions as re-enforcement for severely disabled stroke patients and training of tele-therapists in assessments methods suitable for virtual platform.
