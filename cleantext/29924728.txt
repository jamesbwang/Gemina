  Aerobic glycolysis ( ` Warburg effect ') is used by cancer cells to fuel tumor growth. Interestingly , metastatic melanoma cells rely on glutaminolysis rather than aerobic glycolysis for their bioenergetic needs through the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle. Here , we compared the effects of glucose or glutamine on melanoma cell proliferation , migration and oxidative phosphorylation in vitro. We found that glutamine-driven melanoma cell 's aggressive traits positively correlated with increased expression of HIF1Î± and its pro-autophagic target BNIP3. BNIP3 silencing reduced glutamine-mediated effects on melanoma cell growth , migration and bioenergetics. Hence , BNIP3 is a vital component of the mitochondria quality control required for glutamine-driven melanoma aggressiveness.
