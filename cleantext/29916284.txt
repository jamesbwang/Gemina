  The aim of the study was to evaluate whether ovarian reserve depends on chronic kidney disease. Twenty-four patients , 23-45 years with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) stages 3-4 were included in the study. All the patients underwent transvaginal ultrasounds to assess antral follicle count ( AFC) and ovarian volume. The serum samples were obtained on days 3-5 of the menstrual cycle from all participants for anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH) , follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) , and estradiol ( E2) levels. On the base of the study , it was concluded that the most sensitive parameters of ovarian reserve are AMH and AFC. AMH levels and number of antral follicles in both ovaries were statistically significantly lower in the group of patients with CKD than in control ones. But there were no significant differences in the ovarian volumes ( right and left ovary) , FSH and E2 levels between study and control groups. Ovarian reserve is not dependent on the duration of CKD and hormonal parameters of ovarian reserve like FSH and estradiol ( E2) are not dependent on the presence or absence of proteinuria<symptom> in patients with CKD , but the most sensitive parameter- AMH is significantly lower in patients with CKD and
