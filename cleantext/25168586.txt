  Lateral gene transfer ( LGT) , also known as horizontal gene transfer , into multicellular eukaryotes with differentiated tissues , particularly gonads , continues to be met with skepticism by many prominent evolutionary and genomic biologists. A detailed examination of 26 animal genomes identified putative LGTs in invertebrate and vertebrate genomes , concluding that there are fewer predicted LGTs in vertebrates/chordates than invertebrates , but there is still evidence of LGT into chordates , including humans. More recently , a reanalysis of a subset of these putative LGTs into vertebrates concluded that there is not horizontal gene transfer in the human genome. One of the genes in dispute is an N-acyl-aromatic-L-amino acid amidohydrolase ( ENSG00000132744) , which encodes ACY3. This gene was initially identified as a putative bacteria-chordate LGT but was later debunked as it has a significant BLAST match to a more recently deposited genome of Saccoglossus kowalevskii , a flatworm , Metazoan , and hemichordate. Using BLAST searches , HMM searches , and phylogenetics to assess the evidence for LGT , gene loss , and rate variation in ACY3/ASPA homologues , the most parsimonious explanation for the distribution of ACY3/ASPA genes in eukaryotes involves both gene loss and bacteria-animal LGT , albeit LGT that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago prior to the divergence of gnathostomes. ACY3/ASPA is most likely a bacteria-animal LGT. LGTs at these time scales in the ancestors of humans are not unexpected given the many known , well-characterized , and adaptive LGTs from bacteria to insects and nematodes.
