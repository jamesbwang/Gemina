  To determine whether patients distinguish between biospecimens and electronic health records ( EHRs) when considering research participation to inform research protections. We conducted 20 focus groups with individuals who identified as African American , Hispanic , Chinese , South Asian , and non-Hispanic white on the collection of biospecimens and EHR data for research. Our study found that many participants did not distinguish between biospecimens and EHR data. However , some participants identified specific concerns about biospecimens. These included the need for special care and respect for biospecimens due to enduring connections between the body and identity; the potential for unacceptable future research , specifically the prospect of human cloning; heightened privacy risks; and the potential for unjust corporate profiteering. Among those who distinguished biospecimens from EHR data , many supported separate consent processes and would limit their own participation to EHR data. Considering that the potential misuse of EHR data is as great as , if not greater than , for biospecimens , more research is needed to understand how attitudes differ between biospecimens and EHR data across diverse populations. Such research should explore mechanisms beyond consent that can address diverse values , perspectives , and misconceptions about sources of patient information to build trust in research relationships.
