  The ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein NIPP1 ( also known as PPP1R8) recruits phosphoproteins for regulated dephosphorylation by the associated protein phosphatase PP1. To bypass the PP1 titration artifacts seen upon NIPP1 overexpression , we have engineered covalently linked fusions of PP1 and NIPP1 , and demonstrate their potential to selectively explore the function of the PP1: NIPP1 holoenzyme. By using inducible stable cell lines , we show that PP1-NIPP1 fusions cause replication stress in a manner that requires both PP1 activity and substrate recruitment via the ForkHead Associated domain of NIPP1. More specifically , PP1-NIPP1 expression resulted in the build up of RNA-DNA hybrids ( R-loops) , enhanced chromatin compaction and a diminished repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) , culminating in the accumulation of DSBs. These effects were associated with a reduced expression of DNA damage signaling and repair proteins. Our data disclose a key role for dephosphorylation of PP1: NIPP1 substrates in setting the threshold for DNA repair , and indicate that activators of this phosphatase hold therapeutic potential as sensitizers for DNA-damaging agents.
