  There is scarce available information on the treatment or prophylaxis with anticoagulant drugs of outpatients with medical diseases and complex clinical conditions. There are no clinical practice guidelines and/or specific recommendations for this patient subgroup , which are frequently treated by internists. Complex clinical conditions are those in which , due to comorbidity , age , vital prognosis or multiple treatment with drugs , a clinical situation arises of disease-disease , disease-drug or drug-drug interactions that is not included within the scenarios that commonly generate the scientific evidence. The objective of this narrative review is collecting and adapting of the clinical guidelines recommendations and systematic reviews to complex clinical conditions , in which the direct application of recommendations based on studies that do not include patients with this complexity and comorbidity could be problematic.
