  Perioperative anemia<symptom> is challenging during hospital stay because anemia<symptom> and red blood cell ( RBC) transfusions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. With the implementation of patient blood management ( PBM) , a preanesthesia assessment clinic to screen and treat anemia<symptom> before elective surgery was institutionalized at Muenster University Hospital , Germany. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between treating preoperative anemic patients with intravenous iron ( IVI) and ( primarily) presurgical hemoglobin levels and ( secondarily) use of RBCs and mortality. Between April 1 , 2014 , and July 4 , 2016 , patients scheduled for elective surgery with a risk for RBC transfusions > 10 % in 2013 were screened for preoperative anemia<symptom> and , if indicated , treated with IVI. Patients ' data , time span between visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and surgery , demographic data , type of surgery , the difference of hemoglobin levels between visit and surgery , RBC transfusion , infectious-related International Classification of Disease codes during hospital stay , and 1-year survival were determined retrospectively by screening electronic data files. In addition , patients were interviewed about adverse events , health-related events , and infections via telephone 30 , 90 , and 365 days after visiting the anesthesia/PBM clinic. A total of 1101 patients were seen in the anesthesia/PBM clinic between days -28 and -1 ( median ( Q1-Q3) , -3 days ( -1 , -9 days)) before elective surgery. Approximately 29 % of patients presented with anemia<symptom> , 46.8 % of these anemic patients were treated with ferric carboxymaltose ( 500-1000 mg). In the primary analysis , hemoglobin levels at median were associated with a reduction between the visit in the anesthesia/PBM clinic and the surgery in all nonanemic patients on beginning of medical treatment ( nonanemic patients at median -2.8 g/dL ( -4 , -0.9 g/dL) , while anemic patients without IVI presented with median differences of -0.8 g/dL ( -2 , 0 g/dL) and anemic patients with IVI of 0 g/dL ( -1.0 , 0.5 g/dL)). Hemoglobin levels raised best at substitution 22-28 days before surgery ( 0.95 g/dL ( -0.35 , 1.18 g/dL)). Due to the selection criteria , transfusion rates were high in the cohort. Overall , there was no association between IVI treatment and the use of RBC transfusions ( odds ratio for use of RBCs in anemic patients , no IVI versus IVI: 1.14; 95 % confidence interval , 0.72-1.82). Patients treated with or without IVI presented a comparable range of International Classification of Disease codes related to infections. Telephone interviews indicated similar adverse events , health-related events , and infections. Cox regression analysis showed an association between anemia<symptom> and reduced survival , regardless of IVI. An anemia<symptom> clinic within the preanesthesia assessment clinic is a feasible and effective approach to treat preoperative anemia<symptom> The IVI supplementation was safe but was associated with decreased RBC transfusions in gynecology/obstetric patients only. The conclusions from this retrospective analysis have to be tested in prospective , controlled trials.
