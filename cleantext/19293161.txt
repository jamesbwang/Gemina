  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is a common chronic and degenerative joint condition that is mainly characterized by cartilage degradation , osteophyte formation , and joint stiffness. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway in inflammation<symptom> , autophagy , and apoptosis plays a prominent role in the progression of OA. Icariin , a prenylated flavonol glycoside extracted from Epimedium , have been proven to exert anti-osteoporotic and anti-inflammatory effects in OA. However , the action mechanisms of its effect on chondrocytes have yet to be elucidated. In the present study , we demonstrated that the
