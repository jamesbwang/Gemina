  Although several meta-analyses have demonstrated the utility of intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) in guiding drug-eluting stent ( DES) implantation compared to angiography-guidance , there has been a dearth of evidence in the left main coronary artery ( LMCA) lesion<symptom> subset. We performed a meta-analysis to compare clinical outcomes of IVUS versus conventional angiography guidance during implantation of DES for patients with LMCA disease. Pubmed , Cochrane Library , Embase were searched. A total of 1002 publications were reviewed; and finally , seven clinical studies- one prospective randomized controlled trial and six observational studies with 4592 patients ( 1907 IVUS-guided and 2685 angiography-guided)- were included in the meta-analysis. IVUS guidance was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events ( relative ratio ( RR) 95 % CI 0.61; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001) , all-cause death ( RR 0.55; 95 % CI 0.42 to 0.71; P < 0.001) , cardiac death ( RR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001) , myocardial infarction ( RR 0.66; 95 % CI 0.55 to 0.80; P < 0.001) , and stent thrombosis ( RR 0.48; 95 % CI 0.27 to 0.84; P = 0.01) compared with angiographic guidance. However , there was no significant difference regarding target lesion<symptom> revascularization ( RR 0.60; 95 % CI 0.31 to 1.18; P = 0.099) and target vessel revascularization ( RR 0.64; 95 % CI 0.26 to 1.56; P = 0. 322). Compared to angiographic guidance , IVUS-guided DES implantation was associated with better clinical outcomes for patients with LMCA lesions<symptom> , especially hard endpoints of death , myocardial infarction , and stent thrombosis.
