  To investigate the interaction of E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF2 with p21 and the mechanism of UHRF2 in repairing DNA damage caused by hydroxyurea ( HU) in HEK293 cells. Western blotting indicated that the overexpression of UHRF2 reduced the level of p21 , particularly in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining reveled that UHRF2 combined with p21 in the nucleus. In addition , UHRF2 degraded p21 through ubiquitination and shortened the half-life of p21. UHRF2 could repair DNA damage caused by HU treatment , which was impaired by the inhibition of p21 in HEK293 cells. UHRF2 may negatively modulate p21 to regulate DNA damage response , suggesting a novel pathway of UHRF2 repairing DNA damage through the partial regulation of p21.
