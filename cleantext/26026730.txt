  The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent advances in gene therapy as a treatment for bone regeneration. While most fractures heal spontaneously , patients who present with fracture nonunion suffer from prolonged pain , disability , and often require additional operations to regain musculoskeletal function. In the last few years , BMP gene delivery by means of electroporation and sonoporation resulted in repair of nonunion bone defects in mice , rats , and minipigs. Ex vivo transfection of porcine mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) resulted in bone regeneration following implantation in vertebral defects of minipigs. Sustained release of VEGF gene from a collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold to the mandible of a human patient was shown to be safe and osteoinductive. In conclusion , gene therapy methods for bone regeneration are systematically becoming more efficient and show proof-of-concept in clinically relevant animal models. Yet , on the pathway to clinical use , more investigation is needed to determine the safety aspects of the various techniques in terms of biodistribution , toxicity , and tumorigenicity.
