  To optimize the synergistic efficacy of combination therapy with controlled molar ratio , complex small molecule-based nanodrug ( Co-SMND) of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu)/ vorinostat ( SAHA) was developed. Co-SMND with various ratios of 5-Fu-D-Î±-tocopherol ( VE)/ SAHA-VE were prepared and characterized including co-assembly mechanism , hydrolytic stability , cytotoxicity , synergistic effect and apoptosis inducing ability. The antitumor activity , systematic toxicity and biodistribution of optimized Co-SMND were evaluated in CT-26 bearing BALB/c mouse. Maximal synergistic effect of Co-SMND could be obtained via simply adjusting the feeding molar ratio. The optimized Co-SMND showed superior in vivo antitumor efficacy , upregulated security and selective intratumoral accumulation. Such Co-SMND is of great significance for future clinical translation , and would be an efficient platform for combination chemotherapy.
