  To study the status of physical activities and its influencing factors among parents of primary and secondary school students , to provide basis for improving students ' parents physical activities. A total of 12 501 parents ofprimary and secondary school students from Shenyang , Guangzhou , Chengdu and Wuhan were selected by stratified random cluster sampling. They completed a self-designed questionnaire that was derived from International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ). Logistic regression model was used to analyze the influence of region , stage of school , gender , age , education level , occupation and economic level on physical activities among parents of primary and secondary school students. The rate of students ' parents with insufficient physical activity was 58. 3 % , and the rate of students ' parents spending2 h and more on sedentary activities per day was 55. 7 %. Logistic regression analysis showed that compared with primary school students ' parents , the risk of insufficient physical activity and spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities of junior and senior middle school students ' parents were decreased ( the risk of insufficient physical activity: ORjunior ( 95 % CI) = 0. 796 ( 0. 728-0. 869) , ORsenior ( 95 % CI) = 0. 746 ( 0. 683-0. 815); the risk of spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities: ORjunior ( 95 % CI) = 0. 823 ( 0. 750-0. 904) , ORsenior ( 95 % CI) = 0. 788 ( 0. 712-0. 872)). Compared with students ' parents with primary school education , the risk of insufficient physical activity and spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities of parents with junior college or above education were increased ( the risk of insufficient physical activity: OR ( 95 % CI) = 1. 288 ( 1. 107-1. 497); the risk of spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities: OR ( 95 % CI) = 1. 303 ( 1. 120-1. 515)). Compared with housework/unemployed/retirees , the risk of insufficient physical activity and spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities of agricultural/equipment operators were decreased ( the risk of insufficient physical activity: OR ( 95 % CI) = 0. 755 ( 0. 634-0. 899); the risk of spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities: OR ( 95 % CI) = 0. 731 ( 0. 617-0. 867)). The rate of insufficient physical activity and spending 2 h and more on sedentary activities among students ' parents were relatively higher. The influencing factors on physical activity level and sedentary activity time were region , stage of school , education level and occupation. Specific interventions should be developed for different people.
