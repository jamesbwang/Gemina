  Hemodynamic monitoring is mandatory for perioperative management of cardiac surgery. Recently , the estimated continuous cardiac output ( esCCO) system , which can monitor cardiac output ( CO) non-invasively based on pulse wave transit time , has been developed. Patients who underwent cardiovascular surgeries with hemodynamics monitoring using arterial pressure-based CO ( APCO) were eligible for this study. Hemodynamic monitoring using esCCO and APCO was initiated immediately after intensive care unit admission. CO values measured using esCCO and APCO were collected every 6 h , and stroke volume variation ( SVV) data were obtained every hour while patients were mechanically ventilated. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were used to compare APCO and esCCO. Welch 's analysis of variance , and four-quadrant plot and polar plot analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of time course , and the trending ability. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Twenty-one patients were included in this study , and 143 and 146 datasets for CO and SVV measurement were analyzed. Regarding CO , the correlation analysis showed that APCO and esCCO were significantly correlated ( r = 0.62) , and the bias ± precision and percentage error were 0.14 ± 1.94 ( L/min) and 69 % , respectively. The correlation coefficient , bias ± precision , and percentage error for SVV evaluation were 0.4 ,- 3.79 ± 5.08 , and 99 % , respectively. The time course had no effects on the biases between CO and SVV. Concordance rates were 80.3 and 75.7 % respectively. While CO measurement with esCCO can be a reliable monitor after cardiovascular surgeries , SVV measurement with esCCO may require further improvement.
