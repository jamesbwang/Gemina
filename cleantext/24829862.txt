  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths , patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) usually have distant metastases , such as bone metastasis , brain metastasis , and lung metastasis. The purpose of this study was to explore the risk factors for bone metastasis in NSCLC patients. A total of 176 cases of NSCLC were selected from May 2009 to May 2011 , and patients were divided into two groups , namely the bone metastasis group and non-bone metastasis group. The general clinicopathological data of the two groups and analyzing the independent risk factors of bone metastasis were compared. In the general clinicopathological data of NSCLC patients. The thrombus or not and tumor-node-metastasis ( TNM) stage were closely related to the occurrence of bone metastasis , and were statistically significant ( all P < 0.01). Prothrombin time , activated partial thromboplastin time , Fibrinogen , thrombin time , blood platelet , D-Dimer and alkaline phosphatase have significantly difference between the two groups ( all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that fibrinogen , activated partial thromboplast in time , alkaline phosphatase , T4 phase , N3 phase and d-dimer were independent risk factors for bone metastasis in NSCLC patients. Fibrinogen , alkaline phosphatase , T3 , N2 stage and D-Dimer is the independent risk factors of bone metastases in patients with NSCLC..
