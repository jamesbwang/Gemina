  To better understand the carbohydrate ( CHO) requirement of Australian Football ( AF) match play by quantifying muscle glycogen utilisation during an in-season AF match. After a 24 h CHO loading protocol of 8 g/kg and 2 g/kg in the pre-match meal , two elite male forward players had biopsies sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after participation in a South Australian Football League game. Player A ( 87.2 kg) consumed water only during match play whereas player B ( 87.6 kg) consumed 88 g CHO via CHO gels. External load was quantified using global positioning system technology. Player A completed more minutes on the ground ( 115 vs. 98 min) and covered greater total distance ( 12.2 vs. 11.2 km) than Player B , though with similar high-speed running ( 837 vs. 1070 m) and sprinting ( 135 vs. 138 m) , respectively. Muscle glycogen decreased by 66 % in Player A ( Pre-: 656 , Post-: 223 mmol ∙ kg-1 dw) and 24 % in Player B ( Pre-: 544 , Post-: 416 mmol ∙ kg-1 dw) , respectively. Pre-match CHO loading elevated muscle glycogen concentrations ( i.e. > 500 mmol.kg-1 dw) , the magnitude of which appears sufficient to meet the metabolic demands of elite AF match play. The glycogen cost of AF match play may be greater than soccer and rugby and CHO feeding may also spare muscle glycogen use. Further studies using larger sample sizes are now required to quantify the inter-individual variability of glycogen cost of match play ( including muscle and fibre-type specific responses) as well examine potential metabolic and ergogenic effects of CHO feeding.
