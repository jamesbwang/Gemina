  Inhibiting tumor angiogenesis is a well-established approach for anticancer therapeutic development. A Disintegrin-like and Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin Motifs 5 ( ADAMTS5) is a secreted matrix metalloproteinase in the ADAMTS family that also functions as an anti-angiogenic/anti-tumorigenic molecule. Its anti-angiogenic/anti-tumorigenic function is independent from its proteinase activity , but requires its first thrombospondin type 1 repeat ( TSR1). However , it is not known if recombinant TSR1 ( rTSR1) can function as an anticancer therapeutic. In this report , we expressed and purified a 75-residue recombinant TSR1 polypeptide from
