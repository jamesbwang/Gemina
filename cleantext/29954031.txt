  Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy ( MIILE) is increasingly being used in the treatment of middle or lower esophageal cancer. Hand-sewn purse-string stapled anastomosis is a classic approach in open esophagectomy. However , this procedure is technically difficult under thoracoscopy. The hardest part is delivering the anvil into the esophageal stump. Herein , we report an approach to performing this step under thoracoscopy. A total of 257 consecutive patients who underwent MIILE between April 2013 and July 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The operator hand sewed the purse string using silk thread under thoracoscopy , and the 25-mm circular stapler was passed through the anterior axillary line at the fourth intercostal space to finish the side-to-end gastroesophageal anastomosis. Patient demographics , intraoperative data , postoperative complications were evaluated. The mean operative time , thoracoscopy time , and anvil fixation time was 307.0 ± 34.3 , 155.4 ± 21.5 , and 7.1 ± 1.6 minute , respectively. The anastomotic leak and anastomotic stricture occurred in 6.6 % ( 17 of 257) and 3.9 % ( 10 of 257) of patients , respectively. There was no intraoperative death; one case was death of acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) for conduit gastric leakage on the 21st postoperative day. Using the hand-sewn purse-string stapled anastomotic technique for MIILE is feasible and relatively safe in patients with middle or lower esophageal cancer.
