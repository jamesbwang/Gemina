  Pythium<pathogen> species attack various vegetable crops causing seed , stem and root rot , and ` damping-off ' after germination. Pythium diseases are prevalently controlled by two classes of fungicides , QoIs with azoxystrobin and phenlyamides with mefenoxam as representatives. The present study aims at testing the sensitivity of six Pythium<pathogen> species from different vegetable crops to azoxystrobin and mefenoxam and differentiating species based on ITS , cytochrome b and RNA polymerase I gene sequences. The inter- and intra-species sensitivity to azoxystrobin was found to be rather stable , with exception of one Pythium<pathogen> paroecandrum isolate which showed reduced sensitivity and two cytochrome b amino acid changes. For mefenoxam , the inter-species sensitivity was quite variable and besides sensitive also many resistant isolates were found in all six Pythium<pathogen> species , but no RNA polymerase I amino acid changes were observed in them. ITS and cytochrome b phylogenetic analyses permitted a clear separation of Pythium<pathogen> species corresponding to globose- and filamentous- sporangia clusters. The results document the necessity of well-defined chemical control strategies adapted to different Pythium<pathogen> species. Since the intrinsic activity of azoxystrobin among species was quite stable and no resistant isolates were found , it may be applied without species differentiation provided it is used preventatively to also control highly aggressive isolates. For a reliable use of mefenoxam , precise identification and sensitivity tests of Pythium<pathogen> species are crucial because its intrinsic activity is quite variable and resistant isolates may exist. Appropriate mixtures and/or alternation of products may help to further delay resistance development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
