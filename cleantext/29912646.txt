  The RNA decapping enzyme Dcp2 is a crucial enzyme involved in the process of RNA turnover , which can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Dcp2 has been found to be highly expressed in embryonic , but not adult , kidneys. Here we showed that Dcp2 mRNA was expressed , but Dcp2 proteins were absent , in mouse kidneys after postnatal day 10 ( P10). In kidneys of adult Dcp2-IRES-EGFP knock-in mice , Dcp2 was undetectable but EGFP was expressed , indicating that Dcp2 mRNA was not completely silenced in adult kidneys. Using luciferase reporter assays , we found that miR-141-3p/ 200a-3p directly targeted the 3 ' UTR of Dcp2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p downregulated endogenous Dcp2 protein expression. Furthermore , miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p expression was low in embryonic kidneys but increased dramatically after P10 and was negatively correlated with Dcp2 protein expression during renal development. These results suggest miR-141-3p/ 200a-3p may be involved in post-transcriptional repression of Dcp2 expression during renal development.
