  Previous work has shown that exposure to images of nature results in elevated state body appreciation , but static images may lack ecological validity. Here , we examined the impact of exposure to short films of simulated , first-person walks in natural or built environments. Thirty-six university students completed a measure of state body appreciation before and after watching films of either a walk in a natural or a built environment created specifically for the present study. Two weeks later , they completed the same task but watched the other film type. Results indicated that exposure to the film of a natural environment resulted in significantly elevated state body appreciation ( d = 0.66). There was no significant change in state body appreciation following exposure to the film of the built environment ( d = 0.14). These findings suggest that exposure to films depicting the natural environment may promote immediate , moderate-sized improvements in state body image.
