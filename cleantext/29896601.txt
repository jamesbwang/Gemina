  We present a novel gas phase detection prototype based on assembling core-shell nanospheres made of a silver core and coated with a molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) adsorbed onto an interdigitated array ( IDA) electrode chemiresistor ( CR). The core-shell nanospheres , AgNP@MIPs , were imprinted with linalool , a volatile terpene alcohol , as a model system. The thickness of the MIP layer was tuned to a few nanometers to enable the facile ingress and egress of the linalool , as well as to enhance the electrical transduction through the Ag core. The AgNP@MIPs were spread onto the IDA-CR modified with various positively charged polymers , by drop casting and dip-coating. The AgNP@MIPs were characterized by various techniques such as extra high-resolution scanning and tunnelling electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The MIP recognition event was transduced into a measurable increase in the resistance. The response to linalool exposure and removal was fast and the device was fully recovered and could be reused. Finally , the difference in the resistance change between imprinted and non-imprinted nanospheres was substantial.
