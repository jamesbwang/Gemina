  Traumatic brain injury is common and yet effective treatments of the secondary brain injury are scarce. Melatonin is a potent , non-selective neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent that is showing promising results in neonatal brain injury. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pre-clinical and clinical literature for the effectiveness of Melatonin to improve outcome after TBI. Using the systematic review protocol for animal intervention studies ( SYRCLE) and Cochrane methodology for clinical studies , a search of English articles was performed. Eligible studies were identified and data was extracted. Quality assessment was performed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean differences ( SMD). Seventeen studies ( 15 pre-clinical , 2 clinical) met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity in the studies , and all had moderate-to-low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioural outcome with SMD of 1.51 ( 95 % CIs: 1.06-1.96). Melatonin treatment had a favorable effect on the neurological status , by a SMD of 1.35 ( 95 % CI: 0.83-1.88) and cognition by a SMD of 1.16 ( 95 % CIs: 0.4-1.92). Melatonin decreased the size of the contusion by a SMD of 2.22 ( 95 % CI: 0.84-3.59) and cerebral oedema by SMD of 1.91 ( 95 % CI: 1.08-2.74). Only two clinical studies were identified. They were of low quality , used for symptom management , and were of uncertain significance. In conclusion , there is evidence that Melatonin treatment after TBI significantly improves both behavioural outcomes and pathological outcomes , but significant research gaps exist especially in clinical populations.
