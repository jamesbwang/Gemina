  Transintestinal cholesterol excretion ( TICE) is known as an alternate non-biliary route of cholesterol excretion from the body. The aim of this study was to determine whether exercise training has effects on intestinal membrane receptors involved in TICE in intact and ovariectomized ( Ovx) rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were first divided into 4 groups: Sham operated and Ovx rats fed a standard diet ( Sham-SD; Ovx-SD) , or a high cholesterol diet ( Sham-Chol; Ovx-Chol). These 4 groups were subsequently subdivided into either sedentary or voluntary wheel running groups for 6 weeks. The cholesterol diet resulted in increased hepatic cholesterol accumulation ( p < 0.001) in both Sham and Ovx rats. Exercise training increased ( p < 0.01) transcripts of intestinal low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) , which are involved in trans-intestinal cholesterol uptake from circulation , in both Sham and Ovx rats compared to rats remaining sedentary in all diet conditions. The up-regulation of intestinal gene expression of LDL-R and PCSK9 following voluntary wheel running in intact and Ovx rats suggests that exercise training may contribute to elimination of cholesterol through the TICE pathway.
