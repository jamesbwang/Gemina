  The reference standard treatment of unstable AO type 44-B ankle fractures is open reduction and internal fixation. However , delayed-staged surgery because of compromised soft tissues results in prolonged hospitalization and increased total healthcare costs in the elderly ( age â‰¥ 65 years). The aim of the present study was to measure the efficiency of intramedullary fibular nailing ( IMFN) in the elderly. A prospective series of 15 elderly patients with an AO type 44-B ankle fracture treated with IMFN were compared with a retrospective cohort of 97 elderly patients treated with plate and screw osteosynthesis ( PSOS). Clinical and process-related variables and total healthcare costs , including 5 cost categories , were assessed. Functional outcomes , general health status , and quality of life were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot and EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level visual analog scales. Although the preoperative length of stay was significantly shorter for the patients treated with IMFN , the total length of stay and total healthcare costs were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The complication and reintervention rates were similar in both groups , with improved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale scores in the IMFN group. Compared with delayed-staged surgery , early IMFN led to a significant reduction in total healthcare costs. We could not prove significant cost savings for IMFN compared with PSOS for the treatment of AO type 44-B ankle fractures. However , early IMFN was financially beneficial compared with a delayed-staged ( IMFN and PSOS) surgery protocol. Because , ultimately , IMFN allows for early percutaneous fixation in most cases , IMFN is a potentially profitable treatment strategy for AO type 44-B ankle fractures in the elderly with good outcomes.
