  To determine the agreement between focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( FAST) exams and computed tomography ( CT) for the detection of pleural and peritoneal fluid and pneumothorax in animals that have sustained recent trauma. Prospective study. University Teaching Hospital. Thirteen dogs and 2 cats were enrolled into the study , with 10 having sustained blunt force trauma and 5 penetrating trauma. Abdominal FAST ( AFAST) and thoracic FAST ( TFAST) exams were performed by emergency room ( ER) clinician or house officers and radiology house officers ( radiology). TFAST evaluated for the presence of pneumothorax and pleural effusion<symptom> , and AFAST evaluated for the presence of peritoneal effusion<symptom>. A minimally sedated , full-body CT exam was performed on each patient and interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. The exams were performed in the same order for all patients: ER FAST , followed by radiology FAST , followed by CT , and operators were blinded to the results of the other exams. A kappa statistic was calculated to assess for agreement between the FAST exams and CT.. The median time to perform all 3 exams was 55 minutes ( range 30-150 min). There was moderate to excellent agreement between AFAST and CT for detection of free peritoneal fluid ( ER K = 0.82; radiology K = 0.53) , fair to moderate agreement between TFAST and CT for detection of pleural free fluid ( ER K = 0.53; radiology K = 0.36) , and poor agreement between TFAST and CT for detection of pneumothorax ( ER K = -0.06; radiology K = -0.12). FAST exams reliably identify the presence of free fluid in the peritoneal and pleural cavities; however , TFAST is not a reliable method to diagnose pneumothorax in dogs and cats following trauma.
