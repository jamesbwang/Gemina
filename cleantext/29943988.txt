  A new granular , slow-release fertilizer prepared by a cold-extrusion strategy ( GSRFEx) based on urea-formaldehyde ( UF) , ammonium polyphosphate ( APP) , and amorphous silica gel ( ASG) was presented. Characterizations showed that there were strong hydrogen-bond interactions and good compatibility among UF , APP , and ASG in GSRFEx. The mechanical properties as well as the slow-release properties of GSRFEx were greatly enhanced after the addition of APP and ASG to UF. Rape pot experiments indicated that GSRFEx could improve N-use efficiency dramatically and thereby facilitate the growth of rape. Importantly , as an economical , effective , and environment-friendly technology , cold extrusion has great potential to be applied in horticulture and agriculture. We hope that our work can offer an alternative method for the design of slow-release fertilizers with desirable properties.
