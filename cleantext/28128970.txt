  The coexistence of both Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD) and bronchiectasis ( BE) define an emerging phenotype with a worse prognosis; however , data about these patients do not consider baseline characteristics as confounders. We evaluate the impact of BE on outcomes of hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of COPD ( AECOPD). We prospectively considered AECOPD patients , analysed using a propensity score matching ( PSM) method. The outcomes included length of hospital stay , use of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation , intensive care unit admission , and mortality up to 3-years. Out of the 449 patients enrolled , 160 had associated BE. AECOPD with BE were older , had lower body mass index and greater functional impairment and severity of symptoms than AECOPD without BE. After PSM , 91 patients were considered for each group and no significant differences were found for all baseline characteristics. In full cohort , the cumulative mortality rate , the survival time , the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the risk of death were worse in AECOPD with BE in the follow-up of 6-months , 1-year and 3-years. After PSM , data on mortality were similar between AECOPD with and without BE. In conclusion , in AECOPD patients the presence of BE does not influence mortality in a long-term follow-up.
