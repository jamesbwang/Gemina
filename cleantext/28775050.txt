  Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) develops in 7-12 % of patients with systemic sclerosis ( SSc) and is associated with a 3 year survival of 52 %. Early detection by screening is therefore recommended for all patients with SSc. Historically , screening has been performed using echocardiography and measurement of gas transfer. More recently the DETECT protocol , using a combination of biomarkers ( including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) and clinical parameters , has been developed. The optimal method of screening for PAH with high sensitivity and specificity is , however , not clear. Protein expression differences between different SSc disease phenotypes have been reported , and include alterations in concentration of NT-proBNP , endoglin , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 , placenta growth factor , growth differentiation factor-15 , vascular endothelial growth factor alpha , resistin-like molecule beta , and soluble thrombomodulin. This review summarizes the current knowledge of these protein changes in patients with SSc and PAH.
