  The marine dinoflagellate , Symbiodinium , is a well-known photosynthetic partner for coral and other diverse , non-photosynthetic hosts in subtropical and tropical shallows , where it comprises an essential component of marine ecosystems. Using molecular phylogenetics , the genus Symbiodinium has been classified into nine major clades , A-I , and one of the reported differences among phenotypes is their capacity to synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids ( MAAs) , which absorb UV radiation. However , the genetic basis for this difference in synthetic capacity is unknown. To understand genetics underlying Symbiodinium diversity , we report two draft genomes , one from clade A , presumed to have been the earliest branching clade , and the other from clade C , in the terminal branch. The nuclear genome of Symbiodinium clade A ( SymA) has more gene families than that of clade C , with larger numbers of organelle-related genes , including mitochondrial transcription terminal factor ( mTERF) and Rubisco. While clade C ( SymC) has fewer gene families , it displays specific expansions of repeat domain-containing genes , such as leucine-rich repeats ( LRRs) and retrovirus-related dUTPases. Interestingly , the SymA genome encodes a gene cluster for MAA biosynthesis , potentially transferred from an endosymbiotic red alga ( probably of bacterial origin) , while SymC has completely lost these genes. Our analysis demonstrates that SymC appears to have evolved by losing gene families , such as the MAA biosynthesis gene cluster. In contrast to the conservation of genes related to photosynthetic ability , the terminal clade has suffered more gene family losses than other clades , suggesting a possible adaptation to symbiosis. Overall , this study implies that Symbiodinium ecology drives acquisition and loss of gene families.
