  Chronic pruritus , or itch lasting greater than 6 weeks , is an increasingly common and debilitating medical problem. Recent studies have unveiled previously unrecognized neuroimmune axes whereby inflammatory cytokines act directly on the nervous system to promote itch. Thus , the emergence of newer targeted biologic therapies has generated the possibility of novel treatment strategies for chronic itch disorders. This article reviews the pathophysiology of multiple chronic itch disorders , including atopic dermatitis<disease> , chronic idiopathic pruritus , chronic urticaria , and prurigo nodularis. Furthermore , new and emerging immunomodulatory therapies that will likely alter current treatment paradigms are discussed.
