  To compare the equivalence on detection total coliforms and E Coli between a new technique with portable sterile culture system and enzyme substrate technique by 51 holes in water. Collected drinking water and source water , then detected total coliforms and E Coli using the twomethod in three laboratories respectively. Analyzed the experimentalresult according to the ISO 17994 âˆ¶ 2014 which was dedicated to analyze the equivance of water quality between different microbial detection method. The confidence upper limit of the expanded uncertainty of the mean of total coliforms from three laboratories were within the range from 0. 0494 to 0. 0903 , andthe range of confidence lower limit were from minus 0. 0713 to minus 0. 0490. The confidence upper limit of the expanded uncertainty of the mean of E Coli from three laboratories were within the range from 0. 0307 to 0. 0882 , while the range of confidence lower limit were from minus 0. 0928 to minus 0. 0381. They were all within the acceptable range which the confidence upper limit was from 0 to 0. 10000 , and the confidence lower limit was from minus 0. 10000 to 0. The aforementioned method in detecting total coliforms and E Coli possess the equivalence compared with the classical method , so the portable sterile culture system can be an alternative of method detecting total coliforms and E Coli in water.
