  Ozenoxacin , a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria , has been developed as a cream with 1 % active drug for the treatment of impetigo , a highly contagious bacterial skin<disease> infection<disease> To evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of ozenoxacin cream , 1 % , after 5-day twice-daily topical treatment in patients with impetigo. This randomized , double-blind , vehicle-controlled clinical trial included patients 2 months or older with impetigo who were enrolled at centers in 6 countries from June 2 , 2014 , through May 30 , 2015. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat from July 9 through July 22 , 2015. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topical ozenoxacin or placebo control. Efficacy was measured using the Skin<disease> Infection<disease> Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Among the 411 patients who received treatment ( 210 males ( 51.1 %); mean ( SD) age , 18.6 ( 18.3) years) , ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success compared with placebo , which was evident after 5 days of therapy ( 112 of 206 ( 54.4 %) vs 78 of 206 ( 37.9 %); P = .001). Ozenoxacin also demonstrated superior microbiological success compared with placebo after 2 days of therapy ( 109 of 125 ( 87.2 %) vs 76 of 119 ( 63.9 %); P = .002). Ozenoxacin was well tolerated , with 8 of 206 patients experiencing adverse effects , with only 1 of these potentially related to the study treatment; none were serious. Topical ozenoxacin is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of impetigo in patients 2 months and older. This effect is demonstrated by rapid onset of response and superior clinical and microbiological response compared with placebo. Topical ozenoxacin represents a novel option for the treatment of impetigo. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02090764.
