  Silver diamine fluoride ( SDF) has invoked interest in recent times due to its remineralization capacity and non-invasive application procedure. The aim of this systematic review was to report the findings concerning the effectiveness of SDF in managing caries<disease> in the elderly adults. A systematic search of publications was conducted using four databases: PubMed , MEDLINE , Embase , and CENTRAL. The key MeSH term combinations used were ( silver diamine fluoride) AND ( caries<disease>) AND ( elderly). The review found only three well-conducted randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of SDF on root caries<disease> in community-dwelling elders. None of the studies addressed coronal caries<disease>. The effectiveness improved when combined with structured oral health education. The available limited evidence on SDF shows that it is effective in arresting and preventing root caries<disease> in the elderly. More high-quality studies need to be done to verify the effectiveness on coronal caries<disease> and long-term effects of SDF in the elderly with varying levels of dependency.
