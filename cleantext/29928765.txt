  Surface hydrophobicity ( SH) properties of the trimeric storage protein phaseolin ( black gram phaseolin ( BGP)) of black gram ( Vigna mungo) were investigated using 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate ( ANS) as an extrinsic fluorescent probe. The emission maxima of fluorescence spectra of BGP: ANS complex were blue-shifted to 455 nm as compared to 515 nm for the free ANS. Saturation binding occurred at a dye-to-protein ratio of about 30:1. The quantum yield of the complex increased with increasing ionic strength. The K Varying solvent and/or processing conditions can assist to modulate the surface hydrophobicity of functional legume proteins to achieve desired textural properties in the end product.
