  Thoracoscopic surgery for pediatric benign tumors is a common procedure. However , a large incision is needed to remove large tumors from the thoracic cavity. And , for intrapulmonary sequestration in lower lobe , it sometimes needs a large incision to ligate the aberrant vessels. A muscle-sparing axillar skin crease incision ( MSASCI) has been introduced for thoracic open surgery , resulting in excellent aesthetic outcomes compared with a standard incision. We herein report the utility of this MSASCI technique in thoracoscopic surgery to remove large tumors from the thoracic cavity and to ligate the aberrant vessels in intrapulmonary sequestration in lower lobe. From 2014 April to 2016 March , we performed the MSASCI technique in thoracoscopic surgeries for 5 children. Five cases were diagnosed as mediastinal masses ( mature teratoma for 1 case , ganglioneuroblastoma for 2 cases , and extrapulmonary sequestration and intrapulmonary sequestration for 1 case each). The age at surgery was 32.0 ± 25.0 months ( range 5-58 months). The size of the mediastinal mass was 9 × 5 × 5 cm , 4 × 3 × 3 cm , 5 × 5 × 2.5 cm , and 3 × 2.5 × 2 cm. For 4 other cases , except for the intrapulmonary sequestration case , the mass was resected under thoracoscopic surgery using only three or four 5-mm trocars and the mass was removed from the thoracic cavity using the MSASCI technique. For the intrapulmonary sequestration case , the aberrant vessels were resected under thoracoscopic surgery using only two 5-mm and one 12-mm trocars and the left lower lobectomy was performed using the MSASCI technique. All lesions<symptom> were resected completely. No cases had surgical complications , none showed recurrence , and all cases demonstrated good cosmetic outcomes. Performing thoracoscopic surgery using a MSASCI technique is associated with good cosmetic outcome.
