  Nanocomposites containing 2D materials have attracted much attention due to their potential for enhancing electrical , magnetic , optical , mechanical , and thermal properties. However , it has been a challenge to integrate 2D materials into ceramic matrices due to interdiffusion and chemical reactions at high temperatures. A recently reported sintering technique , the cold sintering process ( CSP) , which densifies ceramics with the assistance of transient aqueous solutions , provides a means to circumvent the aforementioned problems. The efficacious co-sintering of Ti
