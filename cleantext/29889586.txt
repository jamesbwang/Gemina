  Convergence excess esotropia describes a heterophoria with binocular single vision ( BSV) on distance viewing that becomes esotropic on accommodation upon near fixation. Prism adaptation test ( PAT) is a procedure routinely used to reveal the maximum angle of deviation preoperatively for many types of strabismus and has been shown to improve surgical outcomes; however , it is not conventionally used for convergence excess esotropia. This study compares the angle of deviation at 1/3 m and 6 m before and after prism adaptation in subjects with convergence excess esotropia to determine if a masked distance angle of deviation can be demonstrated similar to the masked near angle of deviation in some intermittent exotropes. Surgical results are reported. Fifty-eight children with convergence excess esotropia were prescribed prism adaptation prior to strabismus surgery and 49 met the inclusion criteria. A median increase in the angle of deviation of 20 prism dioptres ( PD) was seen at both 1/3 m and 6 m following PAT. These changes were statistically significant ( p < 0.001) at both distances. Following one surgical procedure , 83.6 % were fully binocular postoperatively. Prism adaptation frequently reveals an otherwise masked large distance angle of deviation in convergence excess esotropia. Convergence excess esotropia can be subdivided into two categories: true and simulated. Those with true convergence excess exhibit a manifest convergent strabismus when viewing a close object and a small , well-controlled latent strabismus upon fixation of a distant object. Those with simulated convergence excess have a comparable near deviation to those with true convergence excess but can be shown to have a distance deviation that approaches the size of the near strabismus once the normal fusional mechanisms are disrupted by a period of prism adaptation.
