  Deciphering absolute configuration of a single molecule by direct visual inspection is the next step in compound identification , with far-reaching implications for medicinal chemistry , pharmacology , and natural product synthesis. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach utilizing low temperature atomic force microscopy ( AFM) with a CO-functionalized tip to determine the absolute configuration and orientation of a single , adsorbed ( 123) tetramantane molecule , the smallest chiral diamondoid. We differentiate between single enantiomers on Cu ( 111) by direct visual inspection , and furthermore identify molecular dimers and molecular clusters. The experimental results are confirmed by a computational study that allowed quantification of the corresponding intermolecular interactions. The unique toolset of absolute configuration determination combined with AFM tip manipulation opens a route for studying molecular nucleation , including chirality-driven assembly or reaction mechanisms.
