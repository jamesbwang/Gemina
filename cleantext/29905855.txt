  Social health insurance ( SHI) , one mechanism for achieving universal health coverage , has become increasingly important in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) as they work to achieve this goal. Although small private providers supply a significant proportion of healthcare in LMICs , integrating these providers into SHI systems is often challenging. Public-private partnerships in health are one way to address these challenges , but we know little about how these collaborations work , how effectively , and why. Drawing on semi-structured interviews conducted with National Health Insurance ( NHI) officials in Kenya and Ghana , as well as with staff from several international NGOs ( INGOs) representing social franchise networks that are partnering to increase private provider accreditation into the NHIs , this article examines one example of public-private collaboration in practice. We found that interviewees initially had incomplete knowledge about the potential for cross-sector synergy , but both sides were motivated to work together around shared goals and the potential for mutual benefit. The public-private relationship then evolved over time through regular face-to-face interactions , reciprocal feedback , and iterative workplan development. This process led to a collegial relationship that also has given small private providers more voice in the health system. In order to sustain this relationship , we recommend that both public and private sector representatives develop formalized protocols for working together , as well as less formal open channels for communication. Models for aggregating small private providers and delivering them to government programmes as a package have potential to facilitate public-private partnerships as well , but there is little evidence on how these models work in LMICs thus far.
