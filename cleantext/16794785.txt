  The inability to elicit strong and durable cellular responses is a major obstacle in the development of successful vaccines , in particular those against malaria<disease> In this regard , the generation of novel adjuvants that will potently boost cell-mediated immunity induced by candidate vaccines is helpful. We and others have found a glycolipid , called α-galactosylceramide ( α-GalCer) , which could be presented on CD1d expressed by antigen-presenting cells ( APCs) and stimulate natural killer T ( NKT) cells. This triggers the activation/maturation of APCs , particularly dendritic cells ( DCs). By activating NKT cells and subsequently DCs , α-GalCer has been shown to enhance adaptive immune responses , particularly of CD8
