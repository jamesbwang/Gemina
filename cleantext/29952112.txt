  Following the ever-expanding technological demands , printed electronics has shown palpable potential to create new and commercially viable technologies that will benefit from its unique characteristics , such as , large-area and wide range of substrate compatibility , conformability and low-cost. Through the last few decades , printed/solution-processed field-effect transistors ( FETs) and circuits have witnessed immense research efforts , technological growth and increased commercial interests. Although printing of functional inks comprising organic semiconductors has already been initiated in early 1990s , gradually the attention , at least partially , has been shifted to various forms of inorganic semiconductors , starting from metal chalcogenides , oxides , carbon nanotubes and very recently to graphene and other 2D semiconductors. In this review , the entire domain of printable inorganic semiconductors is considered. In fact , thanks to the continuous development of materials/functional inks and novel design/printing strategies , the inorganic printed semiconductor-based circuits today have reached an operation frequency up to several hundreds of kilohertz with only a few nanosecond time delays at the individual FET/inverter levels; in this regard , often circuits based on hybrid material systems have been found to be advantageous. At the end , a comparison of relative successes of various printable inorganic semiconductor materials , the remaining challenges and the available future opportunities are summarized.
