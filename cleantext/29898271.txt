  Primary angiitis of the central nervous system ( PACNS) is a rare autoimmune vasculitis affecting the brain and spinal cord. Treatment with biological agents has revolutionised the treatment of many rheumatic conditions but there is scant literature regarding the use of biological agents in PACNS. We present three cases of PACNS treated with rituximab , including two cases of relapsed disease , and a literature review suggesting a role for rituximab in this condition.
