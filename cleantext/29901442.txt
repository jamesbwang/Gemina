  We sought to develop a reproducible animal model for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) in adult atherosclerosis-prone pigs. A coil was placed in the right coronary artery or the left anterior descending artery in 26 downsized spontaneously hypercholesterolemic pigs and left untreated until thrombotic occlusion. Then , we crossed the thrombotic occlusion with a guidewire , followed by pre-dilatation , thrombus visualization with Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT) imaging and , finally , deployment of a stent and repeated OCT.. After revascularization , we calculated the index of microcirculatory resistance ( IMR). After a feasibility phase ( 6 animals) , acute thrombotic occlusion was achieved in all 20 pigs. Eighteen animals were successfully revascularized and survived until sacrifice. Thrombus formation was confirmed by OCT , thrombin-antithrombin complexes measurements and pathology examination. Myocardial necrosis<symptom> was confirmed by troponin T elevation , myocardial staining and pathology examination. Distal thrombotic embolization and microvascular obstruction were supported by increased IMR and pathology examination. A porcine model of thrombotic occlusion AMI in miniaturized adult spontaneously atherosclerosis-prone pigs is feasible by percutaneous intracoronary placement of a coil. The reperfusion by angioplasty completed this model which mirrors human pathological conditions with myocardial infarction , necrosis<symptom> and distal embolization.
