  The gradual deterioration of cognitive functions in Alzheimer 's disease is paralleled by a hierarchical progression of amyloid-beta and tau brain pathology. Recent findings indicate that toxic oligomers of amyloid-beta may cause propagation of pathology in a prion-like manner , although the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that small extracellular vesicles , exosomes , from Alzheimer patients ' brains contain increased levels of amyloid-beta oligomers and can act as vehicles for the neuron-to-neuron transfer of such toxic species in recipient neurons in culture. Moreover , blocking the formation , secretion or uptake of exosomes was found to reduce both the spread of oligomers and the related toxicity. Taken together , our results imply that exosomes are centrally involved in Alzheimer 's disease and that they could serve as targets for development of new diagnostic and therapeutic principles.
