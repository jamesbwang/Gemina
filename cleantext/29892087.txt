  We evaluated strategies for identifying disease-causing variants in genetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM). Cardiomyopathy gene panel testing was performed in 532 DCM patients and 527 healthy control subjects. Rare variants in 41 genes were stratified using variant-level and gene-level characteristics. A majority of DCM cases and controls carried rare protein-altering cardiomyopathy gene variants. Variant-level characteristics alone had limited discriminative value. Differentiation between groups was substantially improved by addition of gene-level information that incorporated ranking of genes based on literature evidence for disease association. The odds of DCM were increased to nearly 9-fold for truncating variants or high-impact missense variants in the subset of 14 genes that had the strongest biological links to DCM ( P < 0.0001). For some of these genes , DCM-associated variants appeared to be clustered in key protein functional domains. Multiple rare variants were present in many family probands , however , there was generally only one `` driver '' pathogenic variant that cosegregated with disease. Rare variants in cardiomyopathy genes can be effectively stratified by combining variant-level and gene-level information. Prioritization of genes based on their a priori likelihood of disease causation is a key factor in identifying clinically actionable variants in cardiac genetic testing.
