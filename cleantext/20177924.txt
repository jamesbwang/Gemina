  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment for gallbladder diseases. In recent times , single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC) has developed as a less invasive alternative technique to conventional laparoscopy. In the literature , many studies have compared SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( CLC) procedures but a limited number of studies have compared the two techniques with regard to quality of life ( QOL). The choice of surgical procedure was effected by QOL of the patients. The effects of SILC on QOL remain unclear. In this study , we aimed to compare the effects of conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( CLC) and single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC) procedures on the clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients by short-term follow-up evaluation. In this study , 142 patients who underwent cholecystectomy operations with either technique underwent SILC and CLC were evaluated. The quality of life index in the patients was measured with short form 36 ( SF 36) test. The results of mean operative time , length of stay and complication rate for SILC and CLC were similar. The postoperative health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) scores were not significantly different between the SILC and CLC patients but only physical functioning score were higher in SILC patients. SILC is a safe and effective alternative to CLC. To detect the effects of SILC on HRQOL , we need long-term prospective comparative studies.
