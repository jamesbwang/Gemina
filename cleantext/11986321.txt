  Pediatric meningococcal sepsis<disease> often results in morbidity and/or death , especially in young children. Our understanding of the reasons why young children are more susceptible to both the meningococcal infection itself and a more fulminant course of the disease is limited. Immunoglobulin G ( IgG) is involved in the adaptive immune response against meningococcal infections , and its effector functions are highly influenced by the glycan structure attached to the fragment crystallizable ( Fc) region. It was hypothesized that IgG Fc glycosylation might be related to the susceptibility and severity of meningococcal sepsis<disease>. Because of this , the differences in IgG Fc glycosylation between 60 pediatric meningococcal sepsis<disease> patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and 46 age-matched healthy controls were investigated , employing liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection of tryptic IgG glycopeptides. In addition , Fc glycosylation profiles were compared between patients with a severe outcome ( death or the need for amputation) and a nonsevere outcome. Meningococcal sepsis<disease> patients under the age of 4 years showed lower IgG1 fucosylation and higher IgG1 bisection than age-matched healthy controls. This might be a direct effect of the disease; however , it can also be a reflection of previous immunologic challenges and/or a higher susceptibility of these children to develop meningococcal sepsis<disease>. Within the young patient group , levels of IgG1 hybrid-type glycans and IgG2/3 sialylation per galactose were associated with illness severity and severe outcome. Future studies in larger groups should explore whether IgG Fc glycosylation could be a reliable predictor for meningococcal sepsis<disease> outcome.
