  Sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) is now the predominant bariatric surgery performed , yet there is limited long-term data comparing important outcomes between LSG and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB). This study compares weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and impact on comorbidities of the two procedures. We retrospectively evaluated weight , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , hemoglobin A1c , cholesterol , and medication use for hypertension , diabetes , and hyperlipidemia at 1-4 years post-operatively in 380 patients who underwent RYGB and 334 patients who underwent LSG at the University of Michigan from January 2008 to November 2013. Follow-up rates from 714 patients initially were 657 ( 92 %) , 556 ( 78 %) , 507 ( 71 %) , and 498 ( 70 %) at 1-4 years post-operatively. Baseline characteristics were similar except for higher weight and BMI in LSG. There was greater weight<symptom> loss<symptom> with RYGB vs. LSG at all points. Hemoglobin A1c and total cholesterol improved more in RYGB vs. LSG at 4 years. There was greater remission of hypertension and discontinuation of all medications for hypertension and diabetes with RYGB at 4 years. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , reduction in medications for hypertension and diabetes , improvements in markers of diabetes and hyperlipidemia , and remission rates of hypertension were superior with RYGB vs. LSG 4 years post-operatively. Choice of bariatric procedures should be tailored to surgical risk , comorbidities , and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> goals.
