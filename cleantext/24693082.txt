  Stem cell-based therapies require cells with a maximum regenerative capacity in order to support regeneration after tissue injury and organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. Optimization of this regenerative potential of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells ( MSC) or their conditioned medium by in vitro preconditioning regimens are considered to be a promising strategy to improve the release of regenerative factors. In the present study , MSC were isolated from inguinal adipose tissue ( mASC) from C57BL/6 mice , cultured , and characterized. Then , mASC were either preconditioned by incubation in a hypoxic environment ( 0.5 % O â‚‚) , or in normoxia in the presence of murine epidermal growth factor ( EGF) or tumor necrosis<symptom> factor & alpha; ( TNF & alpha ;-RRB- for 48 h. Protein expression was measured by a commercially available array. Selected factors were verified by PCR analysis. The expression of 83 out of 308 proteins ( 26.9 %) assayed was found to be increased after preconditioning with TNF & alpha; , whereas the expression of 61 ( 19.8 %) and 70 ( 22.7 %) proteins was increased after incubation with EGF or in hypoxia , respectively. Furthermore , we showed the proliferation-promoting effects of the preconditioned culture supernatants on injured epithelial cells in vitro. Our findings indicate that each preconditioning regimen tested induced an individual expression profile with a wide variety of factors , including several growth factors and cytokines , and therefore may enhance the regenerative potential of mASC for cell-based therapies.
