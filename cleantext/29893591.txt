  This field-based observational study was designed to examine the intra-individual variation of first morning body mass and urine specific gravity ( Usg) in male hockey players ( n = 22) during a 10-day training camp. Also , to evaluate the prevalence and interrelationship of morning hypohydration and post-match dehydration<symptom> using Usg and changes in body mass , respectively. Body mass and Usg were measured upon waking; body mass was also measured before and after matches. Individual means , standard deviation and coefficient of variation were calculated for morning body mass and Usg using 3 , 6 and 8 days. Daily prevalence for euhydration and post-match dehydration<symptom> using morning Usg ( < 1.020) and changes in body mass ( > -2 %) , respectively , were determined. Measurement of morning body mass and Usg for 3 days had low variability ( CV < 1 %) with no improvement using 6 or 8 days. Between 36-73 % of players were considered euhydrated based on morning Usg. Post-match body mass was reduced > 1 % in 50-85 % of players with up to 40 % experiencing changes > -2 %. Post-match changes in body mass were unrelated to Usg the subsequent morning. These outcomes can be helpful in establishing criteria for detecting meaningful changes in morning body mass and Usg in similar settings; thus , helping to monitor hydration status in elite male athletes. Despite ample fluid availability and consumption many players experienced hypohydration and dehydration<symptom> during the camp indicating that careful monitoring and an individual fluid replacement approach is warranted in these environments.
