  We studied the occurrence of adverse events ( AEs) in low-risk non-survivors ( LNs) , compared to low-risk survivors ( LSs) , high-risk non-survivors ( HNs) , and high-risk survivors ( HSs) in two pediatric intensive care units ( PICUs). The study was performed as a retrospective patient record review study , using a PICU-trigger tool. A random sample of 48 PICU patients ( 0-18 years) was chosen , stratified into four subgroups of 12 patients: LNs , LSs , HNs , and HSs. Primary outcome was the occurrence of AEs. The severity , preventability , and nature of the indentified AEs were determined. In total , 45 AEs were found in 20 patients. The occurrence of AEs in the LN group was significantly higher compared to that in the LS group and HN group ( AE occurrence: LN 10/12 patients , LS 1/12 patients; HN 2/12 patients; HS 7/12 patients; LN-LS difference , p < 0.001; LN-HN difference , p < 0.01). The AE rate in the LN group was significantly higher compared to that in the LS and HN groups ( median ( IQR): LN 0.12 ( 0.07-0.29) , LS 0 ( 0-0) , HN 0 ( 0-0) , and HS 0.03 ( 0.0-0.17) AE/PICU day; LN-LS difference , p < 0.001; LN-HN difference , p < 0.01). The distribution of the AEs among the four groups was as follows: 25 AEs ( LN) , 2 AEs ( LS) , 8 AEs ( HN) , and 10 AEs ( HS). Fifteen of forty-five AEs were preventable. In 2/12 LN patients , death occurred after a preventable AE. The occurrence of AEs in LNs was higher compared to that in LSs and HNs. Some AEs were severe and preventable and contributed to mortality. What is Known: • 59-76 % of all PICU patients encounter at least one adverse event during their PICU stay. • It is unknown if adverse events play a role in death of low-risk PICU patients. What is New: • In low-risk PICU non-survivors , occurrence of adverse events is higher compared to low-risk PICU survivors and to high-risk PICU non-survivors. • Severe and preventable adverse events occur in low-risk PICU non-survivors , some contributing to mortality.
