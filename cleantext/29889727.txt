  Neonatal nurse practitioner ( NNP) procedural competence is essential. Procedural simulation provides opportunity to practice high-risk , low-frequency procedures and helps improve skill retention. A formal procedural simulation experience was created in an attempt to provide sufficient experience for NNPs. While preparing for the simulation experience , the group recognized the lack of validated competency metrics for most neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) procedures. The purpose of this study was to create and validate procedural checklists measuring competence of NNPs participating in simulated performance of 9 high-risk NICU procedures. IRB approval was obtained and NNPs agreed to data collection. A self and peer assessment tool was developed and distributed to NNPs , nurses , and neonatologists to gather a baseline perception of procedural competency. Procedural checklists were then developed to measure/assess individual skills against a standard. Benchmark videos were created to demonstrate the standard approach to procedural performance. Each procedural skill performed by the NNP participant was scored by 3 individual evaluators: once in real time and twice by video recording analysis. A Cronbach Î± was used to measure the reliability and validity of the procedural checklists. Comparison was made between live grading and video-based grading scores using analysis of variance. Difference between grading modalities was less than 3 % and nonsignificant for 8 of 9 procedures. No significant difference was found between individual graders for any of the skills being evaluated and suggested high interrater reliability of the checklists. Objective , standardized procedural checklists are valid tools to evaluate NNP procedural skills in simulation. Procedural simulation experiences help strengthen skills , improve performance , and possibly improve patient outcomes.
