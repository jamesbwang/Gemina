  Truncated mis-disordered tau protein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD). Tau In this study , we genetically fused tau The results showed that T294-HBc self-assembled into HBc chimeric virus-like particles ( VLPs) with tau T294-HBc VLP vaccine elicited strong immune response and alleviated cognitive deficits and neuropathology progression in Tau.P301S mice , indicating that the T294-HBc VLP vaccine has promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD and FTD.
