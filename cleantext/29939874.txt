 : In this issue of the Journal of Addiction Medicine , 2 studies fill an important gap in knowledge by examining predictors of leaving against medical advice from inpatient withdrawal management settings. The studies identify important risk factors for leaving against medical advice and highlight important areas for inpatient withdrawal management. These include the use of substance specific standardized protocols and initiation of opioid agonist treatment instead of opioid detoxification given harms associated with opioid withdrawal. Further need for increased training in addiction medicine for primary care physicians , and use of inpatient addiction medicine consult services as part of early intervention for substance withdrawal are also discussed.
