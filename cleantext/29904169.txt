  It is now recognized that post-copulatory traits , such as sperm and ejaculate production can impose metabolic costs , and such traits are therefore expected to exhibit condition-dependent expression , whereby , low condition individuals experience a greater marginal cost of investment compared to high condition individuals. Ejaculates are especially costly in species where males invest in offspring quality through nutrient-rich spermatophores or other seminal nuptial gifts. However , recent evidence shows that , in species where males do not provision females or offspring , males can still influence offspring development through paternal effects mediated by epigenetic factors , such as non-coding RNAs , DNA methylation and chromatin structure. Because such epigenetic paternal effects do not involve the transfer of substantial quantities of resources , such as nutrients , the costs of conferring such effects have not been considered. Here we argue that if selection favours paternal investment in offspring quality through epigenetic factors , then the epigenetic machinery required to bring about such effects may also be expected to evolve strongly condition-dependent expression. We outline indirect evidence suggesting that epigenetic paternal effects could impose substantial metabolic costs , consider the conditions under which selection may act on such effects , and suggest ways to test for differential costs and condition-dependence of these effects. Incorporating epigenetic paternal effects into condition-dependent life history theory will further our understanding of the heritability of fitness and the evolution of paternal investment strategies.
