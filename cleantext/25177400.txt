  The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Institute of Canada Phase III trial has validated as a current regimen for high-grade gliomas ( HGG) a maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolamide. However , it is essential to balance maximal tumor resection with preservation of the patient & rsquo; s neurological functions. Important developments in the fields of pre-operative and intra-operative neuro-imaging and neuro-monitoring have ameliorated the survival rate and the quality of life for patients affected by HGG. Moreover , even though the natural history remains extremely poor , advancement in the molecular and genetic fields have opened up new potential frontiers in the management of this devastating brain disease. In this review , we aim to present a comprehensive account of the main current pre-operative , intra-operative and molecular approaches to HGG with particular attention to specific chaperones , also called heat shock<symptom> proteins ( Hsps) , which represent potential novel biomarkers to detect and follow up HGG , and could also be therapeutic agents.
