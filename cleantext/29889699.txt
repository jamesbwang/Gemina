  Retrospective dosimetry is the method of using materials on or near a person who is exposed to ionizing radiation to determine the amount of radiation received by the person. A possible candidate material for retrospective dosimetry is Ivoclar Vivadent IPS e.max Â® CAD ceramic dental restoration material , which exhibits radiation-induced thermoluminescence when exposed to gamma- and x-ray radiation from a Cs source. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the material and study the behavior of the thermoluminescence signal with radiation dose and with delay time between radiation exposure and thermoluminescence measurement. The first glow peak is well-modeled by a first-order glow curve deconvolution formula. The height of the first glow peak is approximately linear with dose. The fading of the signal with time is approximately described by a power law curve with cutoff. The material appears to be suitable for retrospective radiation dosimetry.
