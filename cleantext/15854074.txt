  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes of conjunctival bacterial flora 1 year after successful dacryocystorhinostomy ( DCR). Seventy-two consecutive adult patients with successful DCR were enrolled in this study. We obtained conjunctival cultures from the operated eyes , fellow eyes , and nasal mucosa of the operated side 1 year after the operation. After the period of incubation , further evaluation was performed using standard laboratory techniques. In the conventional media , positive bacterial growth was detected in 48 ( 66.7 %) of the 72 operated eyes and in 31 of the 72 normal fellow eyes ( 43.1 %). Nasal specimens were positive for bacterial growth in 65 ( 90.3 %) patients. Isolation rate was significantly different between the operated and the fellow ( nonoperated) eyes ( One year after DCR , conjunctival bacterial isolation rate increased compared with the normal fellow eyes. Remote DCR may be considered as a local risk factor for developing postoperative
