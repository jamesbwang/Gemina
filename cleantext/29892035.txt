  Differentiating problematic feeding from variations of typical behavior is a challenge for pediatric providers. The Pediatric Eating Assessment Tool ( PediEAT) is a parent-report measure of symptoms of problematic feeding in children 6 months to 7 years old with evidence of reliability and validity. This study aimed to determine age-based , norm-referenced values for the PediEAT. Parents of children between 6 months and 7 years old ( n = 1110) completed the PediEAT. Descriptive statistics were calculated for subscale and total scores of the PediEAT within 11 age groups. The PediEAT total scores followed a general downward trajectory with increasing age. Physiologic Symptoms were relatively steady from 6 to 15 months , and then rapidly declined in 15-18 month olds and continued to decline thereafter. Problematic Mealtime Behaviors increased from 6 to 9 months to a peak in 24-30 month olds and then declined with increasing age. Selective/Restrictive Eating increased from 6 to 9 months to a peak at 12-15 months and then decreased over time thereafter. Symptoms of difficulty with Oral Processing were highest in 6-9 month olds and decreased with age. The PediEAT now has age-based norm-reference values to guide score interpretation and clinical decision-making.
