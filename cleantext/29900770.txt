  To define a protocol of anesthesia for long-duration invasive surgery in a lizard , eight young adult Argentine tegus ( Salvator merianae) of mean body<symptom> weight 3.0 kg ( interquartile range ( IQR) 3.40-2.65) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine ( K) and medetomidine ( M) at 19 °C , injected intramuscularly and equally distributed in the four limbs. As the experimental surgery procedure required a prolonged deep anesthesia with a good myorelaxation ( between 16 and 21 hr) , reinjections were required and reflexes were checked during surgery. Times for anesthetic induction , anesthetic reinjection , and recovery periods were recorded for five different combinations of ketamine-medetomidine: 1) 66 mg/kg K + 100 μg/kg M; 2) 80 mg/kg K + 100 μg/kg M; 3) 100 mg/kg K + 130 μg/kg M; 4) 125 mg/kg K + 200 μg/kg M; and 5) 150 mg/kg K + 200 μg/kg M. The effect on the recovery speed of the postoperative atipamezole injection was also evaluated. The median induction time was 30 ( IQR 35-27.5) min with no statistical difference between all the concentrations tested. The first reinjection of half a dose was administered after a mean of 5 hr ( 5.64 hr , IQR 5.95-4.84) as were the subsequent reinjections of a quarter dose ( 3.99 hr , IQR 5.98-3.23). Intramuscular administration of the ketamine-medetomidine combination is a simple , rapid , and efficient anesthesia for long-term surgery ( > 12 hr). A mix of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 200 μg/kg medetomidine , with reinjections every 4 hr of half a dose of the previous injection can maintain a good quality of anesthesia for at least 16 hr. The injection of atipamezole after the surgery reverses the effects of medetomidine and permits a reduction of the recovery period.
