  Many techniques in forensic anthropology employ osteometric data , although little work has been done to investigate the intrinsic error in these measurements. These data were collected to quantify the reliability of osteometric data used in forensic anthropology research and case analyses. Osteometric data ( n = 99 measurements) were collected on a random sample of William M. Bass Donated Collection skeletons ( n = 50 skeletons). Four observers measured the left elements of 50 skeletons. After the complete dataset of 99 measurements was collected on each of the 50 skeletons , each observer repeated the process for a total of four rounds. The raw data is available on Mendeley Data (
