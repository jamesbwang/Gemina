  The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between isometric mid-thigh pull ( IMTP) force-time characteristics ( peak force and time-specific force vales ( 100 ‚Åª 250 ms)) and dynamic performance and compare dynamic performance between stronger and weaker athletes. Forty-three athletes from different sports ( rowing , soccer , bicycle motocross , and hockey) performed three trials of the squat jump ( SJ) , countermovement jump ( CMJ) , and IMTP , and performed a one repetition maximum power clean ( PC). Reactive strength index modified ( RSImod) was also calculated from the CMJ. Statistically significant large correlations between IMTP force-time characteristics and PC (
