  This review focuses on burn care in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs). It attempts to put the burden of disease in perspective by showing that burn care is under-resourced across the spectrum of LMICs and by interrogating the ethical dilemmas and challenges that staff face in caring for burn patients in this environment , with a focus on South Africa. More specifically , it will attempt to address the following issues: the threshold for utilizing the intensive care unit ( ICU) , how to balance treatment against cost , the percentage burn considered survivable and how it should be determined , the use of skin from both cadavers and living related donors , and the appropriate ethical guidelines for LMICs.
