  Small regulatory RNAs are now recognized as key regulators of gene expression in bacteria. They accumulate under specific conditions , most often because their synthesis is directly controlled by transcriptional regulators , including but not limited to alternative sigma factors and response regulators of two-component systems. In turn , small RNAs regulate , mostly at the posttranscriptional level , expression of multiple genes , among which are genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Small RNAs are thus embedded in mixed regulatory circuits combining transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls , and whose properties are discussed here.
