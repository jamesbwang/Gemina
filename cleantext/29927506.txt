  A simple trifluoromethoxylation method enables non-directed functionalization of C-H bonds on a range of substrates to provide access to aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. This light-driven process is distinctly different than conventional protocols and occurs through an OCF3 radical mechanism mediated by a photoredox catalyst , triggering an N-O bond fragmentation. This pyridinium-based reagent is bench-stable and provides access to synthetic diversity in lead compounds in an operationally simple manner.
