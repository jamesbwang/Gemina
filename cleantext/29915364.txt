  Obesity is a highly stigmatizing condition , and reduced cognitive functioning is a stereotypical trait ascribed to individuals with obesity. In the present work , we tested the hypothesis that stereotype threat ( i.e. , a depletion of working memory resources due to the fear of confirming a negative self-relevant stereotype when a stereotype-related ability is assessed) contributes to cognitive deficits in individuals with obesity. Computerized tests of ( a) working memory and ( b) probabilistic learning-an ability unrelated with working memory-were administered to a community sample of 131 adults. Stereotype threat was manipulated by altering the alleged nature of the tasks; the tasks were alternatively labeled as intelligence tests ( high stereotype threat condition) , memory and learning tests ( standard instructions condition) , or distraction games ( low stereotype threat condition). A negative relation between body mass index ( BMI) and working memory emerged in both the high stereotype threat ( 95 % CIs = -0.872 , -0.175 , p = 0.003) and the standard instructions conditions ( 95 % CIs = -0.974 , -0.153 , p = 0.007) , but not in the low stereotype threat condition ( 95 % CIs = -0.266 , 0.430 , p = 0.643). No effect emerged on probabilistic learning. Stereotype threat is associated with impaired working memory of individuals with obesity. Implications for researchers and clinicians are discussed.
