  3D printing contributes to a better understanding of the surgical approach , reduction and fixation of complex fractures. It is unclear how a 3D-printed model relates to a human bone. The accuracy of 3D-printed models is important to pre-bend plates and fit of surgical guides. We conduct a validation study in which we compare human cadavers with 3D-printed models to test the accuracy of 3D printing. Nine specimens were scanned , volume rendered into 3D reconstructions and saved as STL data. All models were in a ratio of 1:1 printed on the Ultimaker 3 and Makerbot Replicator Z18. Two independent observers measured all distances between the K-wires on the human cadavers , 2DCT , 3D reconstruction , Meshlab and both printers. A paired Samples T test was used to compare the measurements between the different modalities. The least decrease in average distance in millimetres was seen in `` the 3D printed pelvis 1 '' ,- 0.3 and- 0.8 % on respectively the Ultimaker and Makerbot when compared with cadaver Pelvis ( 1) The 3D model of `` Hand 2 '' showed the most decrease ,- 2.5 and- 3.2 % on the Ultimaker and Makerbot when compared with cadaver hand ( 2) Most significant differences in measurements were found in the conversion from 3D file into a 3D print and between the cadaver and 3D-printed model from the Makerbot. Our 3D printing process results in accurate models suitable for preoperative workup. The Ultimaker 3 is slightly more accurate than the Makerbot Replicator Z18. We advise that medical professionals should perform a study that tests the accuracy of their 3D printing process before using the 3D-printed models in medical practice.
