  Whole-mount in situ hybridization ( WISH) and fluorescent whole-mount in situ hybridization ( FISH) allow for visualization of specific mRNA transcripts to answer diverse biological questions. In planarians , in situ hybridization enables determination of gene expression profiles and identification of cell-type specific markers for analyzing experimental treatments. Here , we describe a robust whole-mount protocol for detecting gene expression patterns in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea.
