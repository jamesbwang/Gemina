  The etiology of 80 % of patients with primary antibody deficiency ( PAD) , the second most common type of human immune system disorder after human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection , is yet unknown. Clinical/immunological phenotyping and exome sequencing of a cohort of 126 PAD patients ( 55.5 % male , 95.2 % childhood onset) born to predominantly consanguineous parents ( 82.5 %) with unknown genetic defects were performed. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria were used for validation of pathogenicity of the variants. This genetic approach and subsequent immunological investigations identified potential disease-causing variants in 86 patients ( 68.2 %); however , 27 of these patients ( 31.4 %) carried autosomal dominant ( 24.4 %) and X-linked ( 7 %) gene defects. This genetic approach led to the identification of new phenotypes in 19 known genes ( 38 patients) and the discovery of a new genetic defect ( CD70 pathogenic variants in 2 patients). Medical implications of a definite genetic diagnosis were reported in ~ 50 % of the patients. Due to misclassification of the conventional approach for targeted sequencing , employing next-generation sequencing as a preliminary step of molecular diagnostic approach to patients with PAD is crucial for management and treatment of the patients and their family members.
