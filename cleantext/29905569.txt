  Our results showed , that EPR method using DMPO spin-trapping is characterized with high sensitivity , which enables to define anti oxidative activity of very small concentration of major antioxidants in Georgian and foreign red and white wines and in red wine. It was concluded , that red as well as white wines have very high anti oxidative activities. Herewith it has to be mentioned , that anti oxidative activity of red wine does not always correlate with the total concentration of phenol in it and mostly depends on the concentration of different major antioxidants. This was showed up in the results of modeling process for the wine `` Nika ''. If adding concentration of predefined major antioxidants to the wine `` Nika '' , a good correlation with the total anti oxidative activity was showed up.
