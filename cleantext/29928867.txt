  This paper describes a method to construct three-dimensional ( 3D) contractile human skeletal muscle tissues from a cell line. The 3D tissue was fabricated as a fiber-based structure and cultured for two weeks under tension by anchoring its both ends. While myotubes from the immortalized human skeletal myocytes used in this study never contracted in the conventional two-dimensional ( 2D) monolayer culture , myotubes in the 3D tissue showed spontaneous contraction at a high frequency and also reacted to the electrical stimulation. Immunofluorescence revealed that the myotubes in the 3D tissues had sarcomeres and expressed ryanodine receptor ( RyR) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca
