  Diabetic nephropathy ( DN) is the primary root of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Unfortunately , currently , no effective therapeutic strategies are available to ameliorate and reverse the progression of DN. Rhein ( RH) is an anthraquinone derivative extracted from herbal medicines with various pharmacological effects on DN. However , its clinical administration is limited by its poor solubility , low bioavailability , reduced distribution into the kidney and adverse effects. To improve the delivery of RH into kidney and the therapeutic effect on DN , we synthesized and utilized polyethyleneglycol- Therefore , this study not only stimulates further clinical research on RH but also , more importantly , proposes a promising DN therapy consisting of an effective kidney-targeted drug delivery.
