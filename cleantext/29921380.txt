  This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of breast invasive ductal carcinoma ( BIDC) in patients with different molecular subtypes and identify possible correlation to prognosis. miR- 10b expression level was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). Tissue sections were collected and stained using the immunohistochemical method. The samples were grouped into human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 , ( HER2) overexpression , Triple negative , Luminal A and Luminal B groups. Age , tumor size , breast cancer molecular subtype , clinical stage , miR-10b positive expression , positive expression of Ki-67 and survival rate of patients diagnosed with BIDC were analyzed. The expression of miR-10b was down-regulated in the breast carcinoma tissues. Age and clinical stage were distinctly different among patients with different molecular subtypes of BIDC ( p less than 0.05). Tumor size was not remarkably different ( p less than 0.05) among different subtypes. The positive expression rate of miR-10b was lowest in patients with Luminal B BIDC; the positive expression of Ki-67 was in different correlation with the expression of different receptors , and there was a remarkable difference ( p less than 0.05); moreover , the survival rate of patients with Luminal A and B BIDC was significantly higher compared to patients with other molecular subtypes ( p less than 0.05). Clinical characteristics and prognosis of BIDC vary among different molecular subtypes. This study provides valuable input on BIDC therapy.
