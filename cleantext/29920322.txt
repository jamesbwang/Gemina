  We examined within-person and between-person differences in self-selected diets of free-living individuals when they choose to consume or not to consume plain water. We used 2-days of dietary data from the NHANES 2005-2012 for this study. For within-person analyses , we compared recalls of respondents who reported water in one of the two available recalls ( n = 1875 men and 1479 women). For between-person analysis , we compared dietary recalls of respondents who reported water in two , one of two , or zero of two recalls ( n = 8632 men and 8907 women). The outcomes examined included reported intakes of 24-h energy from foods , beverages , and dietary and eating pattern attributes. We used covariate-adjusted regression methods for both types of analyses. For within-person analyses , the regression models included separate person-level fixed effects. Relative to the water day , on the no-water day , amount of beverages and energy contribution of beverages were significantly higher in both men ( 106 kcal) and women ( 43 kcal) ( P â‰¤ 0.002). However , the water and the no-water days did not differ in 24-h energy intake , or the amount and energy from reported foods ( P > 0.05). Energy density of foods , servings of fruits or vegetables and eating patterns did not differ between the water and the no-water day in both men and women ( P > 0.05). For between-person analysis , however , intakes of energy and energy density of foods were higher , but density of sodium , potassium , and magnesium were lower among those who reported no water in both recalls. Overall , beverages partially substituted for plain water on the no-water day but qualitative dietary characteristics and eating patterns , which may relate to habitual food intake and personal preferences , were not appreciably different within individuals.
