  Patients with patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) are usually detected and treated during childhood , however , some are not detected until adulthood. In addition , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , severe pulmonary hypertension , and calcification of the ductus may also exist. Transcatheter occlusion has become a widely used technique for the closure of small to moderate sized PDAs since Cambier first reported use of Gianturco coils for transcatheter closure of PDA in 1992 ( Cambier 1992). In the case studies reported here , the one-stage hybrid procedure for PDA combined with other cardiac anomalies in adults was applied with satisfactory results.
