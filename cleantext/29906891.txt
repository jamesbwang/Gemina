  The evolutionary transition to multicellularity transformed life on earth , heralding the evolution of large , complex organisms. Recent experiments demonstrated that laboratory-evolved multicellular `` snowflake yeast '' readily overcome the physical barriers that limit cluster size by modifying cellular geometry ( Jacobeen et al. , Nat. Phys. 14 , 286 ( 2018) 10.1038/ s41567-017-0002-y). However , it is unclear why this route to large size is observed , rather than an evolved increase in intercellular bond strength. Here , we use a geometric model of the snowflake yeast growth form to examine the geometric efficiency of increasing size by modifying geometry and bond strength. We find that changing geometry is a far more efficient route to large size than evolving increased intercellular adhesion. In fact , increasing cellular aspect ratio is on average âˆ¼ 13 times more effective than increasing bond strength at increasing the number of cells in a cluster. Modifying other geometric parameters , such as the geometric arrangement of mother and daughter cells , also had larger effects on cluster size than increasing bond strength. Simulations reveal that as cells reproduce , internal stress in the cluster increases rapidly; thus , increasing bond strength provides diminishing returns in cluster size. Conversely , as cells become more elongated , cellular packing density within the cluster decreases , which substantially decreases the rate of internal stress accumulation. This suggests that geometrically imposed physical constraints may have been a key early selective force guiding the emergence of multicellular complexity.
