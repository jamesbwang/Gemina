  Patients with vertebral compression fracture ( VCF) usually exhibit impaired postural control and consequently are at an increased risk of falling. This study aimed to assess the sensory and kinematic components of the limits of stability ( LOS) test in patients with VCF. This study enrolled 13 adults with ( VCF) , 13 older adults without spinal deformity ( NE) , and 13 young adults ( NY). The Biodex balance<symptom> system was employed to calculate the balance<symptom> score and the LOS of participants. An inertia motion system was used to record kinematic data. The center of pressure signals of postural stability and LOS were used to calculate the frequency power spectrum for interpreting the sensory component. Compared with the NY group , the VCF group exhibited a longer reaction time and lower balance<symptom> scores and used a higher median frequency in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior direction of body acceleration to perform the LOS test. The required ranges of hip rotation and pelvic pitch were significantly higher in the older adult group than in the NY group. In the postural stability test , the VCF group exhibited significantly higher frequency power in the 0.01- to 0.5-Hz band ( visual and vestibular) under both the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions than the other groups. In the LOS test , the VCF group also exhibited lower sensory component activity than the other groups , particularly in vestibular function ( 0.1-0.5 Hz). Both musculoskeletal degeneration and sensory integration impairment may contribute to poor direction control and a longer reaction time in patients with VCF.
