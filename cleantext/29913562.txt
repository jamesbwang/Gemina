  The conventional secretory pathway is indispensable for eukaryotic cells. Newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins are released from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) through ER-derived vesicles to their appropriate destination. Vesicle formation is important for steady protein trafficking. O-GlcNAcylation ( O-GlcNAc) is a unique protein glycosylation signature , whose dynamic regulation by O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase occurs exclusively for nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Because of this locally limited property , the role of O-GlcNAc in the conventional protein secretory pathway is unknown. We report that Sec31A on COPII vesicles , a specific coat-protein complex for anterograde trafficking in the ER-Golgi network , is O-GlcNAcylated on S964 , which accelerates COPII vesicle formation through control of its binding affinity to apoptosis-linked gene 2 , a calcium-binding protein. Together , O-GlcNAc on Sec31A regulates conventional secretory vesicle trafficking in the ER-Golgi network. These modifications accelerate COPII vesicle formation and accelerated anterograde transport of vesicles within the ER-Golgi networks.-Cho , H. J. , Mook-Jung , I.
