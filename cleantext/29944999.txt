  To clarify the safety and efficacy of flow diverter ( FD) treatment for blood blister-like aneurysm<disease> ( BBA) through a systematic review and literature analyzing perioperative and long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes. We performed a comprehensive review of the current literature for studies with > 2 patients related to FD treatment of BBAs published. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: complete occlusion , technical success , aneurysm<disease> recurrence , rebleeding , perioperative mortality , perioperative stroke , procedure-related morbidity and mortality , long-term neurological morbidity and mortality , and overall good neurologic outcome. We included 15 noncomparative studies with a total of 165 target BBAs. Complete occlusion rates were 72 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.59-0.85). Recurrence occurred in 13 % ( 95 % CI , 0.04-0.29) and rebleeding in 3 % ( 95 % CI , -0.02 to 0.07) of patients. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 26 % ( 95 % CI , 0.19-0.33) and 3 % ( 95 % CI , -0.01 to 0.07) , respectively. The rate of long-term good outcomes was 83 % ( 95 % CI , 0.77-0.89). Subgroup analysis indicated that a single FD strategy for BBA seemed to have a higher rate of good outcomes compared with an overlapped FD strategy ( 89.9 % vs. 61.9 %; odds ratio , 1.42; 95 % CI , 1.25-14.98 , P = 0.02). Complete occlusion rate and procedure-related morbidity rate did not see any significant difference between these 2 strategies. Our meta-analysis suggests that in selected cases , FD can be safe and effective. A single FD strategy may result in a higher rate of good outcomes compared with an overlapped FD strategy. Ultimately , treatment of BBA should be considered on a case-by-case basis to maximize patient benefits and limit the risk of perioperative complications.
