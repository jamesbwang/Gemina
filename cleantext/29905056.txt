  To review the basical research progress of porous tantalum in bone tissue engineering. The related basical research in fabrication , cytobiology , and surface modification of porous tantalum was reviewed and analyzed. The outstanding physiochemical properties of porous tantalum granted its excellent performance in biocompatibility and osteointegration , as well as promoting cartilage and tendon tissue restoration. However , the clinical utilization of porous tantalum is somehow greatly limited by the complex and rigid commercial fabrication methods and extraordinary high cost. Along with the publication of novel fabrication and surface modification technology , the application of porous tantalum will be more extensive , the promotion in bone tissue regeneration will be more prominent. Porous tantalum has advantage in bone defect restoration , and significant breakthrough technology is needed in fabrication methods and surface modification.
