  Mixed ionic-electronic conducting ( MIEC) membranes<symptom> attract the attention because of their high potential for oxygen separation and energy conversion applications. The different fabrication methods of asymmetric membranes<symptom> consisting of a thin MIEC layer on porous support were developed. The basically dense but not completely hermetic thin layers were achieved. To overcome this problem , we suggest a new concept of bilayer MIEC-Redox membrane. This solid/liquid composite membrane consists of a gastight MIEC thin external layer and a thick internal layer in which the redox reactions and oxygen bubbling occur. Here , we report the transport properties of a copper oxide-based MIEC-Redox membrane.
