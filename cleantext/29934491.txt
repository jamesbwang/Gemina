  Sulphation of carbohydrate residues occurs on a variety of glycans destined for secretion , and this modification is essential for efficient matrix-based signal transduction. Heparan sulphate ( HS) glycosaminoglycans control physiological functions ranging from blood coagulation to cell proliferation. HS biosynthesis involves membrane-bound Golgi sulphotransferases , including heparan sulphate 2-
