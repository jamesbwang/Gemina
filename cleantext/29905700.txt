  Several matrix approaches were developed to control light propagation through multiple scattering media under illumination of ultrashort pulses of light. These matrices can be recorded with either spectral or temporal resolution. Thanks to wavefront shaping , temporal and spatial refocusing has been demonstrated. In this Letter , we study how these different methods can be exploited to enhance a two-photon excitation fluorescence process. We first compare the different techniques on micrometer-size isolated fluorescent beads. We then demonstrate point-scanning imaging of these fluorescent microbeads located after a thick scattering medium at a depth where conventional imaging would be impossible because of scattering effects.
