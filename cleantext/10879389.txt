  Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is a proven therapy for typical atrial flutter ( AFl); however , in some patients , new atrial arrhythmias ( AA) may occur after AFl ablation. This study explored the difference in the occurrence of spontaneous AA after AFl ablation as a function of the patient 's presenting rhythm on the day of the AFl ablation. A retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent AFl ablation at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas was performed. A total of 188 subjects were included; 50 % ( 94) presented in AFl ( Group AFl) on the day of the ablation procedure and 94 presented in sinus rhythm ( SR; Group SR). Group AFl patients were older (
