  T315I mutation is the most common BCR-ABL mutation and confers resistance to all the first and second generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases , including nilotinib and dasatinib. We report a high risk chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) patient harboring the T315I mutation treated by Interferon-α ( INF-α) solo and subsequently combined with dasatinib. Hematological investigation , bone<disease> marrow cytology inspection , chromosomal analysis ( G-banding) , and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RQ-PCR) were performed on a 47-year-old male patient. After 8 months IFN-α monotherapy , the patient lost the T315I mutation but acquired a new F359V mutation. After 2 months on dasatinib and INF-α treatment , the patient achieved complete hematologic response ( CHR). IFN-α based combination therapy could be a viable treatment option for CML patients harboring T315I BCR-ABL mutation.
