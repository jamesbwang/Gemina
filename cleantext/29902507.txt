  In this study , we report pH-responsive liposomes consisting of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine ( HSPC) as a lipid , hyaluronic acid ( HA) grafted with functional 3-diethylaminopropyl ( DEAP) groups ( hereafter denoted as HA-g-DEAP) as a pH-responsive polymer , and docetaxel ( DTX) as an antitumor drug. DTX-loaded HSPC liposomes were prepared via a conventional liposome manufacturing procedure and then were decorated with HA-g-DEAP ( HA-g-DEAP
