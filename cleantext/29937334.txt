  Squamous cell carcinomas are the most frequent subgroup among head and neck malignant tumors ( HNSCC). Tobacco ( Â± alcohol) and HPV infection , the two main risk factors , define two entities with distinct anatomo-clinical and genetic features. HPV-positive , non-tobacco-related HNSCCs are associated with a better prognosis , a rather simple genomic profile , frequent activating mutations of genes involved in pi3kinase-pathway , and the scarcity of mutations of tumor suppressor genes. HPV-negative , tobacco-related HNSCC are genetically more complex , are characterized by almost mandatory inactivating mutations/deletions of tumor suppressor genes ( TP53 , CDKN2A) and the possible , but less frequent , activating mutations or amplifications of some oncogenes that encode for cell cycle proteins or receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. This review describes the genetic features of HNSCC and discusses how these abnormalities could be incorporated into a therapeutic approach.
