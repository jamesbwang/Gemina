  The `` One Health '' concept recognizes that human health and animal health are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystem in which they ( co) exist. This interconnection favors the transmission of bacteria and other infectious<disease> agents<disease> as well as the flow of genetic elements containing antibiotic resistance genes. This problem is worsened when pathogenic bacteria have the ability to establish as biofilms. Therefore , it is important to understand the characteristics and behaviour of microorganisms in both planktonic and biofilms states from the most diverse environmental niches to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of resistance. The purpose of this work was to assess the antibiotic susceptibility of four bacteria ( The susceptibility profile classified the bacteria as multidrug-resistant. Three genes coding for Î²-lactamases were detected in The results highlight wildlife as important host reservoirs and vectors for the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria and genetic determinants of resistance. The ability of these bacteria to form biofilms should increase their persistence.
