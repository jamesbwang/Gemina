  We analyze the earnings penalty of smoking among Swedish twins in two social contexts: the 1970s , when smoking was common and widely accepted and when there were relatively few tobacco laws aiming to reduce smoking; and the 2000s , when smoking had become more expensive , stigmatizing and less common , and when tobacco laws and regulations had intensified. The results show that the short-term earnings penalty of smoking was much higher in the 21st century than in the 1970s for men. For women , smokers had on average higher annual earnings compared to nonsmokers in the 1970s , but lower annual earnings in the 2000s. In the long run , there was an earnings gap for men between never-smokers and continuous smokers , whereas there was a pronounced earnings ` bonus ' of smoking cessation for women. The results emphasize the importance of social context and the long-term horizon when evaluating the consequences of smoking for earnings.
