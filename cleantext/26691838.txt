  Metabolomics has been used in unraveling metabolites that play essential roles in plant-microbe ( including pathogen) interactions. However , the problem of profiling a plant metabolome with potential contaminating metabolites from the coexisting microbes has been largely ignored. To address this problem , we implemented an effective stable isotope labeling approach , where the metabolome of a plant bacterial pathogen
