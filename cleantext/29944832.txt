  Promoters are among the most-important and most-basic tools for the control of metabolic pathways. However , previous research mainly focused on the screening and characterization of some native promoters in Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> To develop a broadly applicable promoter system for this important platform organism , we created a de novo synthetic promoter library ( SPL) based on consensus sequences by analyzing the microarray transcriptome data of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> 168. A total of 214 potential promoters spanning a gradient of strengths was isolated and characterized by a green fluorescence assay. Among these , a detailed intensity analysis was conducted on nine promoters with different strengths by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE). Furthermore , reconstructed promoters and promoter cassettes ( tandem promoter cluster) were designed via statistical model-based analysis and tandem dual promoters , which showed strength that was increased 1.2- and 2.77-fold compared to that of promoter P43 , respectively. Finally , the SPL was employed in the production of inosine and acetoin by repressing and over-expressing the relevant metabolic pathways , yielding a 700 % and 44 % increase relative to the respective control strains. This is the first report of a de novo synthetic promoter library for B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , which is independent of any native promoter. The strategy of improving and fine-tuning promoter strengths will contribute to future metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects in
