  Stress is a state of vulnerable homeostasis that alters the physiological and behavioral responses. Stress induces oxidative damage in several organs including the brain , liver , kidney , stomach , and heart. Preliminary findings suggested that the magnetic stimulation could accelerate the healing processes and has been an effective complementary therapy in different pathologies. However , the mechanism of action of static magnetic fields ( SMFs) is not well understood. In this study , we demonstrated the effects of static magnetic fields ( 0.8 mT) in a restraint stressed animal model , focusing on changes in different markers of oxidative damage. A significant increase in the plasma levels of nitric oxide ( NO) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , and advanced oxidation protein products ( AOPP) , and a decrease in superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione ( GSH) , and glycation end products ( AGEs) were observed in restraint stress model. Exposure to SMFs over 5 days ( 30 , 60 , and 240 min/day) caused a decrease in the NO , MDA , AGEs , and AOPP levels; in contrast , the SOD and GSH levels increased. The response to SMFs was time-dependent. Thus , we proposed that exposure to weak-intensity SMFs could offer a complementary therapy by attenuating oxidative stress. Our results provided a new perspective in health studies , particularly in the context of oxidative stress.
