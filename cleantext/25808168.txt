  Fra-1 ( fosl1) belongs to the activator protein1 ( AP-1) family inducing IL-11 expression in oxidative stress condition. IL-11 plays a pivotal role in protecting epithelial barriers integrity. In this study , we investigated the Fra-1 gene expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) as well as its relation to IL-11 expression. We enrolled 20 patients and 20 healthy controls with definite UC based on the clinical criteria. Fra-1 gene expression in inflamed and non-inflamed colonic biopsies was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). The IL-11 protein concentration was measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA) method. Pearson correlation was applied to calculate the relation between Fra-1 and IL-11. An increased level of Fra-1 gene expression was observed in patients with mild ulcerative colitis<disease>. The protein concentration of IL-11 was also increased in mild UC patients. Conversely , a significant decrease of IL-11 protein level was detected in severe UC patients compared to control group. Oxidative stress in inflamed intestinal biopsies can induce fra-1 gene expression. Our findings suggest that Fra-1 transcription factor leads to the production of IL-11 protein in UC patients.
