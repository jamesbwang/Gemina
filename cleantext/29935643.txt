  To determine if alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) concentration in vaginal blood , in the setting of dissolved fetal tissue , is significantly higher than its concentration in the maternal serum. A prospective cohort study. Medical center. Four groups of women were evaluated: 1) with missed/incomplete miscarriage with vaginal bleeding; 2) with threatened miscarriage; 3) with vaginal bleeding during cerclage placement; and 4) undergoing dilation and curettage ( D&C). None. In each patient , AFP concentration in the vaginal blood or in the liquid component of the evacuated products of conception ( POC; D&C group) was compared with the AFP concentration in the maternal serum. The median ( range) concentration ratios of AFP in vaginal blood ( or POC) to AFP in maternal serum were 24.5 ( 5.1-8,620) and 957 ( 4.6-24,216) for the missed/incomplete ( n = 30) and the D&C ( n = 22) groups , respectively , whereas they were only 1.2 ( 0.4-13.4) and 1.01 ( 0.7-1.5) for the threatened miscarriage ( n = 15) and cerclage ( n = 9) groups , respectively. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis demonstrated 100 % sensitivity and 86.7 % specificity for the detection of the passage of fetal tissue ( ratio 4.3 , area under the ROC curve 0.96). Higher concentrations of AFP in vaginal blood than in maternal serum may indicate the presence of dissolved fetal tissue ( i.e. , confirming a failed pregnancy).
