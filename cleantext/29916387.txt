  Genome-wide association studies have implicated around 250 genomic regions in predisposition to type 2 diabetes , with evidence for causal variants and genes emerging for several of these regions. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms , including the interplay between Î²-cell failure , insulin sensitivity , appetite<symptom> regulation , and adipose storage has been facilitated by the integration of multidimensional data for diabetes-related intermediate phenotypes , detailed genomic annotations , functional experiments , and now multiomic molecular features. Studies in diverse ethnic groups and examples from population isolates have shown the value and need for a broad genomic approach to this global disease. Transethnic discovery efforts and large-scale biobanks in diverse populations and ancestries could help to address some of the Eurocentric bias. Despite rapid progress in the discovery of the highly polygenic architecture of type 2 diabetes , dominated by common alleles with small , cumulative effects on disease risk , these insights have been of little clinical use in terms of disease prediction or prevention , and have made only small contributions to subtype classification or stratified approaches to treatment. Successful development of academia-industry partnerships for exome or genome sequencing in large biobanks could help to deliver economies of scale , with implications for the future of genomics-focused research.
