  Over the past 35 years , DNA has been used to produce various nanometer-scale constructs , nanomechanical devices , and walkers. Construction of complex DNA nanostructures relies on the creation of rigid DNA motifs. Paranemic crossover ( PX) DNA is one such motif that has played many roles in DNA nanotechnology. Specifically , PX cohesion has been used to connect topologically closed molecules , to assemble a three-dimensional object , and to create two-dimensional DNA crystals. Additionally , a sequence-dependent nanodevice based on conformational change between PX and its topoisomer , JX
