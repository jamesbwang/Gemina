  The objective of the study was to examine additive and synergistic effects of age and HIV<pathogen> infection on resting state ( RS) intra- and inter-network functional connectivity ( FC) of the brain. We also aimed to assess relationships with neurocognition and determine clinical- , treatment- , and health-related factors moderating intrinsic brain activity in aging HIV-positive ( HIV<pathogen> +) individuals. The current report presents data on 54 HIV<pathogen> + individuals ( age M = 41 , SD = 12 years) stabilized on cART and 54 socio-demographically matched healthy ( HIV<pathogen>-) comparators ( age M = 43 , SD = 12 years) , with cohort education mean of 16 years ( SD = 12). Age at seroconversion ranged 20-55 years old. ANOVA assessed additive and synergistic effects of age and HIV<pathogen> in 133 ROIs. Bivariate statistics examined relationships of FC indices vulnerable to age-HIV interactions and neurocognitive domains T-scores ( attention , executive , memory , psychomotor , semantic skills). Multivariate logistic models determined covariates of FC. This study found no statistically significant age-HIV effects on RS-FC after correcting for multiple comparisons except for synergistic effects on connectivity within cingulo-opercular network ( CON) at the trending level. However , for uncorrected RS connectivity analyses , we observed HIV-related strengthening between regions of fronto-parietal network ( FPN) and default mode network ( DMN) , and particular DMN regions and sensorimotor network ( SMN). Simultaneously , FC weakening was observed within FPN and between other regions of DMN-SMN , in HIV<pathogen> + vs. HIV<pathogen>- individuals. Ten ROI pairs revealed age-HIV interactions , with FC decreasing with age in HIV<pathogen> + , while increasing in controls. FC correlated with particular cognitive domains positively in HIV<pathogen> + vs. negatively in HIV<pathogen>- group. Proportion of life prior-to-after HIV-seroconversion , post-infection years , and treatment determined within-FPN and SMN-DMN FC. In sum , highly functioning HIV<pathogen> +/ cART + patients do not reveal significantly altered RS-FC from healthy comparators. Nonetheless , the current findings uncorrected for multiple comparisons suggest that HIV<pathogen> infection may lead to simultaneous increases and decreases in FC in distinct brain regions even in patients successfully stabilized on cART. Moreover , RS-fMRI ROI-based analysis can be sensitive to age-HIV interactions , which are especially pronounced for inter-network FC in relation to neurocognition. Aging and treatment-related factors partially explain RS-FC in aging HIV<pathogen> + patients.
