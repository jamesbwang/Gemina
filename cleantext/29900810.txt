  SUMMARYDNA barcoding is now a common tool in parasitology and epidemiology , which require good methods for identification not only of parasites and pathogens but vectors and reservoirs. This special issue presents some advances and challenges in barcoding of microbes , parasites , and their vectors and reservoirs. DNA barcoding found new applications in disease ecology , conservation parasitology , environmental parasitology and in paleoparasitology. New technologies such as next-generation sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight have made it now possible to investigate large samples of specimens. By allowing the investigation of parasites at the interface between environment , biodiversity , animal and human health , barcoding and biobanking have important policy outcomes as well as ethics and legal implications. The special issue ` Advances and challenges in the barcoding of parasites , vectors and reservoirs ' illustrates some recent advances and proposes new avenues for research in barcoding in parasitology.
