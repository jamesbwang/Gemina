  Aryl diazonium salts have emerged as a new generation of robust surface modifiers for a wide range of applications. However , their use for creating anti-icing surfaces has never been investigated so far. We fill this gap by modifying nano-textured copper surfaces with aryl diazonium salts , bearing low surface energy end groups , leading to efficient anti-icing properties.
