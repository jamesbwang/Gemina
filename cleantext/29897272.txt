  In Brazil , meat inspection occurs in a decentralized manner and consists of three types: ( i) federal inspection ( SIF) , ( ii) state inspection ( SISP) , and ( iii) municipal inspection ( SIM). The objective of this work was to discuss the three current inspection systems through the apparent prevalence of bovine brucellosis<disease> , a zoonosis that has an eradication program implemented by the Brazilian government. Nine abattoirs from federal , state , and municipal inspection systems were assessed and 1,490 animals were sampled. Serology for brucellosis<disease> was determined by the rose bengal test and the complement fixation test. The overall apparent prevalence ( and 95 % confidence interval) of brucellosis<disease> was 2.2 % ( 1.5 to 2.9 %). Apparent prevalence stratified by inspection system for SIF , SISP , and SIM was 0.4 % ( 0.0 to 0.9 %) , 2.0 % ( 0.8 to 3.2 %) , and 4.3 % ( 2.5 to 6.1 %) , respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the odds ratio for finding an animal positive for brucellosis<disease> among inspection systems. A statistical difference ( P < 0.0015) was observed among surveillance systems , with SISP × SIF , SIM × SISP , and SIM × SIF having an odds ratio of 4,996 , 2,304 , and 11,494 , respectively. Hence , the need for increasing official surveillance in state and municipal inspection systems seems to be necessary and could assist in the surveillance of bovine brucellosis<disease> and other diseases of interest to the federation. In addition , an increase in official presence would help to improve the selection of slaughtered cattle during ante- and postmortem inspection , with consequent impact on food safety and public health.
