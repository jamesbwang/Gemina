  Middle<pathogen> East<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> ( MERS) represents an important respiratory<pathogen> disease<pathogen> accompanied by lethal outcome in one-third of human patients. Recent data indicate that dromedaries represent an important source of infection , although information regarding viral cell tropism and pathogenesis is sparse. In the current study , tissues of eight dromedaries receiving inoculation of MERS-Coronavirus<pathogen> ( MERS-CoV) after recombinant Modified-Vaccinia-Virus-Ankara<pathogen> ( MVA-S)- vaccination ( n = 4) , MVA-vaccination ( mock vaccination , n = 2) and PBS application ( mock vaccination , n = 2) , respectively , were investigated. Tissues were analyzed by histology , immunohistochemistry , immunofluorescence , and scanning electron microscopy. MERS-CoV infection in mock-vaccinated dromedaries revealed high numbers of MERS-CoV-nucleocapsid positive cells , T cells , and macrophages within nasal turbinates and trachea at day four post infection. Double immunolabeling demonstrated cytokeratin ( CK) 18 expressing epithelial cells to be the prevailing target cell of MERS-CoV , while CK5/6 and CK14 expressing cells did not co-localize with virus.<pathogen> In addition , virus<pathogen> was occasionally detected in macrophages. The acute disease was further accompanied by ciliary loss along with a lack of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4) , known to mediate virus<pathogen> entry. DPP4 was mainly expressed by human lymphocytes and dromedary monocytes , but overall the expression level was lower in dromedaries. The present study underlines significant species-specific manifestations of MERS and highlights ciliary loss as an important finding in dromedaries. The obtained results promote a better understanding of coronavirus<pathogen> infections , which pose major health challenges.
