  Fibrous dysplasia ( FD) is a benign bone disease characterized by fibro-osseous lesions<symptom>. FD is caused by somatic mutations in the gene , guanine nucleotide-binding protein , alpha stimulating activity polypeptide 1 ( GNAS) , which encodes the G protein subunit , GsÎ±. FD manifests early in life , but the growth of lesions<symptom> usually ceases in adulthood. FD lesions<symptom> often exhibit somatic mutation mosaicism. In this study , the relationship between lesion<symptom> growth and mutation prevalence within a lesion<symptom> was investigated. Lesions<symptom> from five FD patients were characterized by radiographical , histological and immunohistochemical methods. To accurately calculate the prevalence of mutations within lesions<symptom> , GNAS codon 201 in genomic DNA isolated from fresh surgical FD specimens was sequenced. Uniquely , a lesion<symptom> in one 46-year-old patient was still growing , enabling simultaneous analysis of both stable-old and active-new FD lesions<symptom> in the same patient. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that a newer , proximal lesion<symptom> was growing while an older , distal lesion<symptom> was not. The mutation prevalence differed between these lesions<symptom>; it was low in the old and high in the new lesion<symptom>. Thus , the frequency of mutated cells had decreased in the older lesion<symptom>. This is the first direct evidence for the age-dependent demise of mutated cells in FD , helping to explain why FD lesion<symptom> growth generally ceases in adulthood.
