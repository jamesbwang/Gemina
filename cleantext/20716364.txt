  Electrical stimulation ( ES) has a long history of successful use in the clinical treatment of refractory , non-healing bone fractures and has recently been proposed as an adjunct to bone tissue-engineering treatments to optimize their therapeutic potential. This idea emerged from ES 's demonstrated positive effects on stem cell migration , proliferation , differentiation and adherence to scaffolds , all cell behaviors recognized to be advantageous in Bone Tissue Engineering ( BTE). In previous Rat bone marrow-derived MSC were exposed to 100 mV/mm , 1 hr/day for three , seven , and 14 days , then osteogenic differentiation was assessed at Day 14 of culture by measuring collagen production , calcium deposition , alkaline phosphatase activity and osteogenic marker gene expression. We found that exposing MSC to ES for three days had minimal effect , while seven and 14 days resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation , as indicated by significant increases in collagen and calcium deposits , and expression of osteogenic marker genes This study showed that while three days of ES is insufficient to solicit pro-osteogenic effects , seven and 14 days significantly increases osteogenic differentiation. Importantly , we found that cells treated with ES for only seven days , maintained this pro-osteogenic activity long after discontinuing ES exposure. This sustained positive osteogenic effect is likely due to the enhanced expression of
