  We report a case of a medullary thyroid carcinoma noncalcified brain metastasis characterized on Ga-dotatate PET/CT but not on an F-fluoride PET/CT performed 1 month later. Subsequent F-fluoride PET/CT studies performed 7 and 19 months after the Ga-dotatate PET/CT study demonstrated focal uptake in the metastasis. The CT images of the last PET/CT study also depicted a small focus of calcification beginning in the metastatic site.
