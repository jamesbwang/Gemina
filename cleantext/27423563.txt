  The differential diagnosis for a focal brain lesion<symptom> in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is broad and includes infection , malignancy , and vascular and inflammatory etiologies. One rarely considered vascular pathology is cerebral venous thrombosis ( CVT) , which is often associated with a delay in diagnosis because of variable presentation and rare incidence. We present the case of a young woman with a new discrete brain lesion<symptom> that appeared in the context of highly active SLE and was ultimately diagnosed with a CVT. We provide a literature review for diagnosis and management of cerebral venous thrombosis , a potentially serious complication of untreated systemic lupus erythematosus.
