  There is a high misdiagnosis rate between Parkinson 's disease ( PD) and atypical parkinsonian disorders ( APD) , such as progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP) , the second most common parkinsonian syndrome<disease>. In our earlier studies , we identified and replicated RNA blood biomarkers in several independent cohorts , however , replication in a cohort that includes PSP patients has not yet been performed. To this end , we evaluated the diagnostic potential of nine previously identified RNA biomarkers using quantitative PCR assays in 138 blood samples at baseline from PD , PSP and healthy controls ( HCs) nested in the PD Biomarkers Program. Linear discriminant analysis showed that
