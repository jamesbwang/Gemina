  Primary testing for high-risk HPV ( hrHPV) is increasingly implemented in cervical cancer screening programs. Many hrHPV-positive women , however , harbor clinically irrelevant infections , demanding additional disease markers to prevent over-referral and over-treatment. Most promising biomarkers reflect molecular events relevant to the disease process that can be measured objectively in small amounts of clinical material , such as miRNAs. We previously identified eight miRNAs with altered expression in cervical precancer and cancer due to either methylation-mediated silencing or chromosomal alterations. In this study , we evaluated the clinical value of these eight miRNAs on cervical scrapes to triage hrHPV-positive women in cervical screening. Expression levels of the eight candidate miRNAs in cervical tissue samples ( This study shows that miRNA expression analysis in cervical scrapes is feasible and enables the early detection of cervical cancer , thus underlining the potential of miRNA expression analysis for triage of hrHPV-positive women in cervical cancer screening.
