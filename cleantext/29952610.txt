  A critical barrier to the understanding of disruptions to cognitive flexibility following sports-related concussion is the use of assessments that conflate shifts of visuospatial attention and contextual rules. Because these dissociable forms of cognitive flexibility are subserved by distinct neural networks , the utility of a cognitive flexibility assessment following concussion may be reduced , depending upon the extent to which the task requires shifting visuospatial attention relative to shifting contextual rules. Accordingly , the current investigation examined the extent to which these aspects of cognitive flexibility exhibit differential trajectories of recovery following a sports-related concussion. Twenty-two athletes with sports-related concussions were assessed on a cognitive flexibility task with 2 switch conditions ( i.e. , perceptual-based and contextual rule-based) within 72 hr of injury , after return to play , and within 1 month following return to play. Thirty-three healthy control athletes were tested at the same intervals. Findings revealed that concussed athletes demonstrated protracted disruptions in task performance on a visuospatial attention-based cognitive flexibility task relative to healthy controls , whereas disruptions in task performance on a contextual rule-based cognitive flexibility task resolved after the acute phase of injury. These findings suggest that dissociable forms of cognitive flexibility exhibit differential trajectories of recovery. Therefore , evaluations detecting sports-related concussion disruptions in cognitive flexibility may be reduced depending on the extent to which they rely on contextual rule-based decisions. Test batteries focusing on visuospatial attention-based demands may be useful additions to aid in the objective assessment and follow-up management of athletes following the acute phase of injury.
