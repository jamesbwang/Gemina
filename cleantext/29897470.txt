  Atrial tachyarrhythmia , including atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , atrial flutter ( AFL) and intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia<symptom> ( IART) , occur frequently in patients with congenital heart disease ( CHD) , who may undergo multiple surgical procedures throughout life. However , data on the effectiveness of concomitant arrhythmia surgery in CHD patients are scarce. Outcome of concomitant arrhythmia surgery for AF or AFL/IART was examined in 66 successive patients ( 31 men ( 47 %); age at surgery: 56 Â± 14 ( 24-78) years) with various CHD. Concomitant arrhythmia surgery was performed in patients with a history of only AF ( n = 46 , 70 %) , only AFL/IART ( n = 6 , 9 %) or a combination of AF and AFL/IART ( n = 14 , 21 %). Median follow-up after arrhythmia surgery was 2 ( 1-4) years. AF reoccurred in 40 patients ( 67 %) , of whom 13 ( 22 %) only had early recurrences; none of the patients with only AFL or IART prior to arrhythmia surgery developed AF after arrhythmia surgery. Recurrence-free survival of late AF was 4.6 years and differed according to the type of AF prior to surgery. Late recurrence-free survival at 3-year follow-up was 71 % for paroxysmal AF , 45 % for persistent AF and 20 % for long-standing persistent AF ( P = 0.047). Age at arrhythmia surgery was an independent predictor for late AF recurrence ( odds ratio 1.05 , P = 0.006). AFL/IART occurred in 17 patients ( 26 %) after arrhythmia surgery , which was de novo in 11 patients ( 17 %). Arrhythmia surgery in CHD patients results in freedom from late AF recurrence for a small majority of patients after median follow-up of 2 years. ( Long-standing) persistent AF and older age at arrhythmia surgery are related to higher recurrence rates.
