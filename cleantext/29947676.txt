  Essential oils of green cumin ( Cuminum cyminum) and chamomile ( Chamomilla recutita) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Acetaminophen , N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol , is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic. Despite being safe at therapeutic doses , acetaminophen overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure. This study aimed to compare the possible protective effects of cumin and chamomile essential oils against acute acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in male rats. Cumin oil ( 400 mg/kg) and chamomile oil ( 250 mg/kg) were orally administered for 2 weeks prior to a single acetaminophen dose ( 1g/kg). Serum liver function enzymes , oxidative stress markers in the liver and histopathological features were evaluated. Acetaminophen caused marked damage to hepatocytes evidenced by a significant rise in the levels of liver function enzymes , including alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase , and disruption to the liver antioxidant protective system. Whereas the cumin oil normalized acetaminophen-induced liver enzymes elevation , the chamomile oil slightly attenuated the increase in alanine aminotransferase levels in acetaminophen-intoxicated rats. The Chamomile oil moderately ameliorated glutathione depletion and the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity in the liver of acetaminophen-administered rats. The Cumin oil preserved the liver structure to a greater extent than chamomile oil in acetaminophen-intoxicated rats. Essential oils of cumin and chamomile partially counteracted acute acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.
