  Feeding is a critical behavior that animals depend on for survival , and pathological alterations in food intake underlie disorders such as obesity and anorexia<symptom> nervosa. To understand these disorders and their development in animal models , researchers must quantify food intake. Although conceptually straightforward , it remains a challenge to obtain accurate records of food intake in rodents. Several approaches have been used to accomplish this , each with benefits and drawbacks. In this article , we survey the four most common methods for measuring food intake in rodents: manual weighing of food , automated weighing scales , pellet dispensers , and video-based analyses. We highlight each method 's benefits and drawbacks for use in feeding research , focusing on accuracy , potential sources of errors , affordability , and practical concerns relating to their use. Finally , we discuss the outlook for feeding devices and unmet challenges for measuring food intake in laboratory rodents.
