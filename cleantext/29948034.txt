  Post-pericardiotomy syndrome<disease> ( PPS) is an inflammatory process involving the pleura , pericardium , or both and occurs after cardiothoracic surgery. Surgical atrial septal defect ( ASD) closure is associated with higher incidence of PPS post-operatively as compared to other operations. Reported incidence of PPS varies from 1 to 40 %. NSAIDs are often used to treat PPS and in our center , some practitioners have prescribed ibuprofen prophylactically. This study sought to investigate the impact of prophylactic treatment with ibuprofen on the development and severity of PPS following surgical ASD closure , with particular attention to secundum-type ASDs. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and operative data of all surgical ASD repairs in our center from 1/2007 to 7/2017. ASDs were grouped by subtype. PPS was considered positive if the primary cardiologist diagnosed and documented clinical signs of PPS on post-operative outpatient follow-up. Records were reviewed to confirm documented diagnosis of PPS. A total of 245 cases were reviewed with 207 having sufficient data. Median age was 2 years ( range 4 months-27 years) , female 57 %. Overall incidence of PPS was 10 %. There was no difference in incidence of PPS in those prescribed ibuprofen as compared to those who were not. This was true for both the entire cohort and the subgroup analysis ( P = 1.0). Four patients overall required pericardiocentesis , none of whom received prophylactic ibuprofen. Prophylactic ibuprofen prescription following surgical ASD repair did not reduce the rate of PPS in our cohort.
