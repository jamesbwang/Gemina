  The design and synthesis of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) are of great importance for the successful development of hydrogen-based alternative energy technologies. Although Pt is considered to be the most active catalyst for the HER , its reaction performance is limited in alkaline solutions owing to a slow rate for water dissociation. Therefore , many research groups have intensively investigated reaction mechanisms and developed system designs and efficient Pt-based catalysts to enhance the alkaline HER. Herein , we summarize the catalytic surface specificity of Pt and Pt-Ni ( OH)
