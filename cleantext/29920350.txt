  It is not conclusive that magnetic resonance ( MR)- based carotid atherosclerotic plaque assessment identifies high-risk features associated with cerebrovascular events. We aimed to systematically summarize the association of MR imaging ( MRI)- determined intraplaque hemorrhage<symptom> ( IPH) , lipid-rich necrotic core ( LRNC) , and thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap ( TRFC) with subsequent ischemic events. We performed a comprehensive literature search evaluating the association of MRI-based carotid plaque composition with ischemic outcomes. We included cohort studies examining IPH , LRNC , or TRFC with mean follow-up of â‰¥ 6 months and an outcome measure of ipsilateral ischemic events. A meta-analysis was done according to the Cochrane guideline. We identified 13 studies including 1.150 patients and 1.208 analyzed carotid arteries , with mean follow-up of 21.1 months. The hazard ratios ( HR) for IPH , LRNC , and TRFC as predictors of subsequent ischemic events were 4.41 ( 95 % CI: 2.87 , 6.79) , 3.00 ( 95 % CI: 1.51 , 5.95) , and 5.94 ( 95 % CI: 2.66 , 13.28) , respectively. The predictive value of carotid plaque MRI for ischemic events was acceptable , with sensitivity of 0.80 ( 95 % CI: 0.66 , 0.90) and specificity of 0.63 ( 95 % CI: 0.57 , 0.68). However , it was limited to confirm or exclude future ischemic events in clinical context , with positive likelihood ratio ( LR) of 2.2 ( 95 % CI: 1.9 , 2.5) and negative LR of 0.31 ( 95 % CI: 0.18 , 0.55). No statistically significant heterogeneity or publication bias was observed. The presence of IPH , LRNC , and TRFC determined by MRI is associated with increased risk of future ischemic events , but its predictive value is moderate and should not be used for confirmation or exclusion of future ischemic events in clinical context.
