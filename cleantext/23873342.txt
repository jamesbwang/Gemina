  Near-infrared ( NIR) II luminescence between 1000 and 1700 nm has attracted reviving interest for biosensing due to its unique advantages such as deep-tissue penetration and high spatial resolution. Traditional NIR-II probes such as organic fluorophores usually suffer from poor photostability and potential long-term toxicity. Herein , we report the controlled synthesis of monodisperse NaCeF
