  Water-to-air carbon dioxide fluxes from tropical lakes and reservoirs ( artificial lakes) may be an important but understudied component of global carbon fluxes. Here , we investigate the seasonal dissolved carbon dioxide ( CO2) dynamics in a lake and a reservoir on a tropical volcanic island<disease> ( Bali , Indonesia). Observations were performed over four seasonal surveys in Bali 's largest natural lake ( Lake Batur) and largest reservoir ( Palasari Reservoir). Average CO2 partial pressures in the natural lake and reservoir were 263.7 ± 12.2 μatm and 785.0 ± 283.6 μatm respectively , with the highest area-weighted partial pressures in the wet season for both systems. The strong correlations between seasonal mean values of dissolved oxygen ( DO) and pCO2 in the natural lake ( r2 = 0.92) suggest that surface water metabolism was an important driver of CO2 dynamics in this deep system. Radon ( 222Rn , a natural groundwater discharge tracer) explained up to 77 % of the variability in pCO2 in the shallow reservoir , suggesting that groundwater seepage was the major CO2 driver in the reservoir. Overall , the natural lake was a sink of atmospheric CO2 ( average fluxes of -2.8 mmol m-2 d-1) while the reservoir was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere ( average fluxes of 7.3 mmol m-2 d-1). Reservoirs are replacing river valleys and terrestrial ecosystems , particularly throughout developing tropical regions. While the net effect of this conversion on atmospheric CO2 fluxes remains to be resolved , we speculate that reservoir construction will partially offset the CO2 sink provided by deep , volcanic , natural lakes and terrestrial environments.
