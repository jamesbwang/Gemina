  Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and Cannabidiol ( CBD) are two substances from cannabis sativa that have beenimplicated in the treatment of mental and neurological disorders. We concentrated on a previously validated neuroimaging phenotype , fronto-striatal connectivity across different striatal seeds , because of this loop 's relevance to executive functioning , decision making , salience generation and motivation and its link to various neuropsychiatric conditions. Therefore , we studied the effect of THC and CBD on fronto-striatal circuitry by a seed-voxel connectivity approach using seeds from the caudate and the putamen. We conducted a cross-over pharmaco-fMRI study in 16 healthy male volunteers with placebo , 10 mg oral THC and 600 mg oral CBD. Resting state was measured in a 3 T scanner. CBD lead to an increase of fronto-striatal connectivity in comparison to placebo. In contrast to our expectation that THC and CBD show opposing effects , THC versus placebo did not show any significant effects , probably due to insufficient concentration of THC during scanning. The effect of CBD on enhancing fronto-striatal connectivity is of interest because it might be a neural correlate of its anti-psychotic effect in patients.
