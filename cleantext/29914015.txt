  Ozone is used intensively worldwide in treatment and research of various pathologies due to its healing effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of major ozone autohemotherapy on erythrocyte deformability and aggregation. 10 and 50μg/ml doses of ozone was applied for 20 minute to venous blood samples obtained from 10 healthy male volunteers. Erythrocyte aggregation , deformability were measured by an ektacytometer. Total oxidant status , total antioxidant status were measured via a commercial kit. The oxidative stress index was calculated. Ozone at 10 and 50μg/ml doses did not alter erythrocyte aggregation. 50μg/ml ozone increased red blood cell ( RBC) deformability measured at 0.53 Pa.. Compared with the Control value , there was a significant increase in TOS , TAS for the doses of 10 and 50μg/ml. The increase in TAS was found to be more significant at 10μg/ml dose. The most obvious increase in OSI value was observed at 50μg/ml. Our results demonstrate that although 10μg/ml ozone has no effect on hemorheology , 50μg/ml ozone concentration has positive effects on RBC deformability , thus circulation at 0.53 Pa corresponding to the shear stress encountered during venous circulation.
