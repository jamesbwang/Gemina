  Local delivery of therapeutic drugs into the inner ear is a promising therapy for inner ear diseases. Injection through semicircular canals ( canalostomy) has been shown to be a useful approach to local drug delivery into the inner ear. The goal of this article is to describe , in detail , the surgical techniques involved in canalostomy in both adult and neonatal mice. As indicated by fast-green dye and adeno-associated virus serotype 8 with the green fluorescent protein gene , the canalostomy facilitated broad distribution of injected reagents in the cochlea and vestibular end-organs with minimal damage to hearing and vestibular function. The surgery was successfully implemented in both adult and neonatal mice; indeed , multiple surgeries could be performed if required. In conclusion , canalostomy is an effective and safe approach to drug delivery into the inner ears<disease> of adult and neonatal mice and may be used to treat human inner ear diseases in the future.
