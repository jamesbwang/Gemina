  Although visuo-motor temporal integration in children is suggested to be related to motor control and motor learning , its relevance is still unclear. On the other hand , visuo-motor temporal integration ability undergoes developmental changes with age. In the current correlational study , we measured manual dexterity and visuo-motor temporal integration ability in 132 children with typical development ( age , 4-15 years) and investigated the relationship between the two functions. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd edition was used as an indicator of manual dexterity. The delay detection threshold ( DDT) and steepness of the probability curve for delay detection , which was measured by the delayed visual feedback detection task for self-generated movement , were used as indices of the visuo-motor temporal integration ability. The results indicated significant correlations between manual dexterity/age and DDT/steepness of the probability curve for delay detection. In addition , hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that both manual dexterity and age significantly contributed to visuo-motor temporal integration , indicating a better fit than when only age was employed as an independent variable. Importantly , there was no interaction effect between age and manual dexterity. These findings were the first to suggest that manual dexterity is a significant predictor of visuo-motor temporal integration ability in children , regardless of age. The present study validated the important relationship between visuo-motor temporal integration and manual dexterity in children. Considering the limitations of the current study , including the non-homogeneous sample , further studies are still warranted to validate the results.
