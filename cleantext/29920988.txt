  Morphine has large pharmacokinetic variability , which is further complicated by developmental changes in neonates and small infants. The impacts of organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1) genotype and changes in blood-flow on morphine clearance ( CL) were previously demonstrated in children , whereas changes in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 ( UGT2B7) activity showed a small effect. This study , targeting neonates and small infants , was designed to assess the influence of developmental changes in OCT1 and UGT2B7 protein expression and modified blood-flow on morphine CL using physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) modeling. The implementation of these three age-dependent factors into the pediatric system platform resulted in reasonable prediction for an age-dependent increase in morphine CL in these populations. Sensitivity of morphine CL to changes in cardiac output increased with age up to 3 years , whereas sensitivity to changes in UGT2B7 activity decreased. This study suggests that morphine exhibits age-dependent extraction , likely due to the developmental increase in OCT1 and UGT2B7 protein expression/activity and hepatic blood-flow.
