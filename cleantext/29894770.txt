  miRNA-137 is an extremely abundant miRNA in the central nervous system and is thought to be closely related to synaptic plasticity. Here , we report a previously unrecognized role of miRNA-137 in epilepsy. The expression of miRNA-137 was decreased both in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) and in two different mouse models of epilepsy. Overexpression of miRNA-137 induced by an intrahippocampal injection of a specific agomir prolonged the latency to spontaneous recurrent seizures<symptom> ( SRSs) and reduced seizure<symptom> severity in a mouse model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Elevated levels of miRNA-137 also prolonged the latency to full kindling and reduced the seizure<symptom> severity in a mouse model of pentylenetetrazol ( PTZ)- kindled epilepsy. Suppression of miRNA-137 levels decreased the latency to the first SRS or the latency to full kindling and increased the seizure<symptom> severity in both epileptic mouse models. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that overexpression of miRNA-137 reduced the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3a region in a Mg
