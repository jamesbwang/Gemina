  This study compared pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , safety and immunogenicity profiles of INTP5 ( a potential pegfilgrastim biosimilar) with that of Neulasta In this randomised , assessor-blind , crossover study , 344 healthy subjects received single subcutaneous dose of both INTP5 and Neulasta at 3 mg/0 .3 ml ( n = 172) or 6 mg/0 .6 ml ( n = 172) dose. The primary endpoints were AUC All 344 subjects dosed were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses , and 292 subjects in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. At 6 mg dose , test to reference ratio ( 90 % CI) of AUC Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic bioequivalence was established between INTP5 and Neulasta following 3 and 6 mg doses. Safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between INTP5 and Neulasta.
