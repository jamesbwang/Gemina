  BACKGROUND Acute<symptom> mastitis<symptom> is a common disease occurring in postpartum lactating women. This study aimed to identify the high-risk factors for suppurative mastitis<symptom> ( SM) in women who were breastfeeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 262 non-SM patients and 63 SM patients admitted to the Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery of Liaocheng People 's Hospital were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The high-risk factors for SM during lactation were determined by assessing admission time after acute<symptom> mastitis<symptom> , galactostasis , primipara or pluripara , nipple injuries , antibiotic treatment course , and diabetes. RESULTS The incidence of SM in patients with admission time greater than 72 h after occurrence of acute<symptom> mastitis<symptom> was significantly higher than that in patients whose admission time was less than 72 h ( p < 0.0001). Patients with galactostasis were more prone to develop SM compared to patients without galactostasis ( p < 0.0001) , and the incidence of SM in primiparous patients was significantly higher than that in pluriparous patients ( p = 0.003). The incidence rate of SM was significantly higher in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes ( p = 0.002). Patients with nipple injuries were more prone to suffer from SM relative to the patients without nipple injuries ( p < 0.0001). However , there was no significant difference in the incidence of SM according to the antibiotic treatment course ( p = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS SM during lactation was closely associated with admission time after the occurrence of acute<symptom> mastitis<symptom> , galactostasis , primipara , diabetes , and nipple injuries.
