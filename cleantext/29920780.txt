  We aimed to determine the epidemiology , risk factors , and impact of bacterial infection on pancreatic function after pancreas transplantation. Data for pancreas transplant recipients were retrospectively reviewed between 2000 and 2014 for at least one year. We collected and analysed post-transplant data for bacterial infection , morbidity , and mortality. During the study period , 312 pancreas transplants were performed. In total , 509 episodes of bacterial infection were diagnosed in 191 patients ( 61 %). Multidrug-resistant ( MDR) organisms were present in 173 of the 513 isolated microorganisms ( 33 %). Risk factors independently associated with bacterial infection were acute allograft rejection ( OR 1.7 , 95 % CI 1.1-3) , the need for post-transplant haemodialysis ( OR 5.3 , 95 % CI 1.8-15.7) and surgical re-intervention ( OR 2.8 , 95 % CI 1.5-5.1) , which was also considered a risk factor for infections caused by MDR bacteria. Graft survival was associated with the occurrence of one or more episodes of bacterial infection ( log-rank test = 0.009). Surgical re-intervention was independently associated with graft loss ( OR 2.5 , 95 % CI 1.3-4.7). To conclude , pancreas recipients frequently experienced bacterial infections associated with the need for haemodialysis or surgical re-intervention. Infection by MDR organisms is a growing concern in these patients and was related to graft survival. Graft loss was independently associated with surgical re-intervention.
