  The identification of brain markers of suicidal risk is highly expected. However , neuroimaging studies have yielded mixed results , possibly due to phenotypic heterogeneity. In the present study , we addressed this issue using structural brain imaging. First , two independent samples of suicide attempters ( n = 17 in Montreal , 32 in Jena) , patient controls ( n = 26/34) , and healthy controls ( n = 66/34) were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging. Groups were compared with FSL. We then reviewed the literature and run a GingerALE meta-analysis of 12 structural imaging studies comparing suicide attempters and patient controls with whole-brain analyses ( n = 693). Finally , we explored the potential contribution of two variables previously associated with biological/cognitive deficits: a family history of suicide ( FHoS) , and the use of a violent suicidal means ( VSM). Here , we added two groups of healthy first-degree biological relatives of suicide victims and depressed patients ( n = 32). When comparing all suicide attempters and controls , very limited between-group differences were found in the two samples , and none in the meta-analysis. In contrast , a FHoS was associated with reduced volumes in bilateral temporal regions , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and left putamen , several of these differences being observed across groups. VSM was associated with increased bilateral caudate ( and left putamen) volumes. Some morphometric variations in cortico-subcortical networks may therefore be endophenotypes increasing the suicidal vulnerability , while others ( notably in striatum<pathogen>) may modulate action selection. These results therefore confirm at the neural level two phenotypes at high lethal risk with a strong biological background , and uncover motives of heterogeneous findings in neuroimaging studies of suicidal behavior.
