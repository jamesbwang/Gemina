  School performance is one of the most stable and heritable psychological characteristics. Notwithstanding , monozygotic twins ( MZ) , who have identical genotypes , differ in school performance. These MZ differences result from non-shared environments that do not contribute to the similarity within twin pairs. Because to date few non-shared environmental factors have been reliably associated with MZ differences in school performance , they are thought to be idiosyncratic and due to chance , suggesting that the effect of non-shared environments on MZ differences are age- and trait-specific. In a sample of 2768 MZ twin pairs , we found first that MZ differences in school performance were moderately stable from age 12 through 16 , with differences at the ages 12 and 14 accounting for 20 % of the variance in MZ differences at age 16. Second , MZ differences in school performance correlated positively with MZ differences across 16 learning-related variables , including measures of intelligence , personality and school attitudes , with the twin who scored higher on one also scoring higher on the other measures. Finally , MZ differences in the 16 learning-related variables accounted for 22 % of the variance in MZ differences in school performance at age 16. These findings suggest that , unlike for other psychological domains , non-shared environmental factors affect school performance in systematic ways that have long-term and generalist influence. Our findings should motivate the search for non-shared environmental factors responsible for the stable and systematic effects on children 's differences in school performance.
