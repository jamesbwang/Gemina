  Dark and photolysis reactions in solution were investigated for 9-acridinecarboxaldehyde ( ACL). ACL reacts in the dark at T = 20 °C and pH = 7.0 in an air saturated solution to the main product 9-acridinecarboxylic acid ( ACA) and to the minor product 9-acridinemethanol ( ACM) with a lifetime of τ = 4.3 days. The dissociation constant of the base ACLH + was determined to be pKa ± σ = 4.38 ± 0.04. The photolysis of ACL was investigated using a polychromatic Xe-light source. The quantum yield in aqueous solution at T = 20 °C in a concentration range of c0 ( ACL) = 0.18-16.6 μM for pH > pKa and for nitrogen , air and oxygen aerated solutions was found to be Φ ± σ = ( 0.015 ± 0.003) mol/mol , independent from concentration. The quantum yield of ACLH + , i.e. for pH ≪ pKa , is by a factor of 2 higher ( Φ = 0.029 mol/mol). Quantum yields in methanol and isopropanol are slightly lower compared to water and in acetone lower by about a factor of 20. In acetonitrile ACL was found to be practically photostable. Minimum lifetimes in sunlight for a measurement on September 5 , 2017 were in the range of τ = 5-10 minutes. The diurnal photolysis of ACL in sunlight was satisfactory explained using the mean quantum yield , the absorption spectrum and photon fluxes with suitable corrections for cloudiness and the dimensions of the setup. For low concentrations ACR is formed with a yield of practically 100 % in the photolysis reaction. However , with increasing concentration of ACL yields of ACR decrease and yields of ACA increase. 9 ( 10H)- Acridinone and ACM were always detected as minor products with yields below 2 %. 9-Methylacridine was never detected in any reaction of ACL. Strong indications are presented of a photolysis reaction of ACL in a river located in Lower Saxony ( Germany) with a corresponding equimolar formation of ACR. ACL is therefore a direct precursor of ACR in natural surface water.
