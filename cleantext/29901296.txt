  Benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) is a polyethological disease of elderly and old men. The symptomatic pharmacological treatment of BPH involves the use of drugs that reduce either the dynamic component of obstruction or the size of the prostate ( a mechanical component of obstruction). 5-reductase inhibitors ( 5-ARI) and- blockers are considered first-line therapy in the management of prostate adenoma. To investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with Fokusin and Penester in BPH patients. The study is based on the analysis of medical records of 67 BPH patients aged over 50 years. All patients included in the study were randomized to 3 groups and had comparable age , sex , clinical manifestations and severity of the disease. Group 1 comprised 21 patients ( mean age 63.8 +/ -9.7 years) , who received a 5-reductase inhibitor ( 5-ARI) Pentester ( Sanofi , France) 5 mg once daily. Group 2 included 22 patients ( mean age 65.2 +/ -7.8 years) , who received an- blocker Fokusin ( Sanofi , France) 0.4 mg once a day. Group 3 comprised 24 patients ( mean age 64.2 +/ -8.6 years) who received combination therapy with 5-reductase inhibitor ( 5-ARI) ( Penester 5 mg once daily) and blocker ( Fokusin 0.4 mg once daily). The study findings showed that in comparison with monotherapy , the concurrent administration of Fokusin and Penester was more effective in reducing the clinical manifestations of BPH , slowing the growth of adenomatous tissue thus reducing the size of the enlarged prostate. Combination therapy with Fokusin and Penester can be recommended to improve the treatment results of BPH patients.
