  This review examined ( a) the current evidence from studies on teleaudiology applications for rehabilitation of adults with hearing impairment with hearing aids and ( b) whether it is sufficient to support the translation into routine clinical practice. A search strategy and eligibility criteria were utilized to include articles specifically related to hearing aid fitting and follow-up procedures that are involved in consultations for the rehabilitation of adults , where the service was provided by the clinician by teleaudiology. A search using key words and Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH) was conducted on the main electronic databases that index health-related studies. The included studies were assessed using validated evaluation tools for methodological quality , level of evidence , and grade recommendations for application into practice. Fourteen studies were identified as being within the scope of this review. The evaluation tools showed that none of these studies demonstrated either a strong methodological quality or high level of evidence. Analysis of evidence identified 19 activities , which were classified into service outcomes categories of feasibility , barriers , efficiency , quality , and effectiveness. Recommendations could be made regarding the ( a) feasibility , ( b) barriers , and ( c) efficiency of teleaudiology for the rehabilitation of hearing loss with hearing aids. This review provides up-to-date evidence for teleaudiology hearing aid services in new and experienced hearing aid users in different practice settings. Findings direct future research priorities to strengthen evidence-based practice. There is a need for further studies of many aspects of teleaudiology services for rehabilitation with hearing aids to support their implementation into clinical practice. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.6534473.
