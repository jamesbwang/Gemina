  In the mid-1990s , whole-cell ( wP) pertussis<disease> vaccines were associated with local and systemic adverse events , which prompted their replacement with acellular ( aP) vaccines in many high-income countries. In the past decade rates of pertussis<disease> disease have increased in children receiving only acellular pertussis<disease> vaccines. We compared the immune responses to acellular pertussis<disease> boosters in children who received their initial doses with either wP or aP vaccines using activation-induced marker ( AIM) assays. Specifically , we examined pertussis-specific memory CD4 + T cell responses ex vivo , highlighting a Type 2/Th2 versus Type 1/Th1 and Th17 differential polarization as a function of childhood vaccination. Remarkably , after a contemporary aP booster , cells from donors originally primed with aP were 1) associated with increased IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-13 , IL-9 and TGF-β and decreased IFNγ and IL-17 production; 2) defective in their ex vivo capacity to expand memory cells; and 3) less capable to proliferate in vitro. These differences appeared to be T cell-specific , since equivalent increases of antibody titers and plasmablasts after aP boost were seen in both groups. In conclusion , our data suggest that long lasting effects and differential polarization and proliferation exists between adults originally vaccinated with aP versus wP despite repeated acellular boosters.
