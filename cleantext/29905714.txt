  In this Letter , a novel method for the characterization of mid-infrared pulses is presented. A cross-correlator system , with no moving parts , combining ultra-broadband pulsed upconversion detection with fast active electronic delay tuning was built to perform time-resolved spectral characterization of 1.6 ns mid-infrared supercontinuum pulses. Full wavelength/time spectrograms were acquired in steps of 20 ps over a range that can , in theory , extend to microseconds in a matter of seconds , with 48 ps temporal resolution and 22 cm
