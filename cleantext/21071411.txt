  A deeper mechanistic understanding of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) regulation is needed to improve current anti-metastasis strategies in ovarian cancer ( OvCa). This study was designed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in EMT regulation during process of invasion-metastasis in serous OvCa to improve current anti-metastasis strategies for OvCa. We systematically analyzes high-throughput gene expression profiles of both lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in OvCa samples with integrated epithelial ( iE) subtype<pathogen> and integrated mesenchymal ( iM) subtype<pathogen> labels. Mouse models , cytobiology , molecular biology assays and clinical samples were performed to elucidate the function and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA PTAF-mediated promotion of EMT and invasion-metastasis in serous OvCa. We constructed a lncRNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) regulatory network that affects the expression of many EMT-related protein-coding genes in mesenchymal OvCa. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies , we provided evidence that the lncRNA PTAF-miR-25-SNAI2 axis controlled EMT in OvCa. Our results revealed that up-regulated PTAF induced elevated SNAI2 expression by competitively binding to miR-25 , which in turn promoted OvCa cell EMT and invasion. Moreover , we found that silencing of PTAF inhibited tumor progression and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of OvCa. We then observed a significant correlation between PTAF expression and EMT markers in OvCa patients. The lncRNA PTAF , a mediator of TGF-Î² signaling , can predispose OvCa patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies for mesenchymal OvCa patients.
