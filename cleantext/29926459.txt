  We describe here one way to achieve hybrid DNA-inorganic nanostructures on rigid flat insulating substrates. We report methods to prepare rectangular DNA origami and incubate them onto arrays of anchoring gold nanodots either in a static solution or in a microfluidic system. We give details on the design and lithographic methods employed to pattern usable arrays of gold nanoanchors on naturally oxidized silicon wafer chips. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy methodological details are also given for obtaining the relevant characterizations of the immobilized and ordered DNA origami.
