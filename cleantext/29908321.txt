  Senescent cells display a senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP) , which contributes to aging. Resveratrol , an activator of SIRT1 , has anti-aging , anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant , anti-free radical and other pharmacological effects. The genus of the annual fish Nothobranchius has become an emerging animal model for studying aging. However , the underlying mechanism for resveratrol to delay aging by SASP regulation has not been elucidated in vertebrates. In this study , the annual fish N. guentheri were fed with resveratrol for long-term treatment. The results showed that resveratrol reversed intensive senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity with aging process , down-regulated levels of SASP-associated proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNFα , and up-regulated expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in gut of the fish. Resveratrol increased SIRT1 expression , and inhibited NF-κB by decreasing RelA/p65 , Ac-RelA/p65 and p-IκBα levels and by increasing the interaction between SIRT1 and RelA/p65. Moreover , resveratrol reversed the decline of intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs) and intestinal stem cells ( ISCs) caused by aging in gut of the fish. Together , our results implied that resveratrol inhibited SASP through SIRT1/NF-κB signaling pathway and delayed aging of the annual fish N. guentheri.
