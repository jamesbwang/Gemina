  The coastline detection is one of the main applications of the Gaofen-3 satellite in the ocean field. However , the capability of Gaofen-3 SAR image in coastline detection has not yet been validated. In this paper , two Gaofen-3 SAR images , acquired in 2016 , were used to extract the coastlines of the regions of Bohai and Taihu in China , respectively. The classical Fuzzy C-means ( FCM) method was used in the coastline detection , but had been improved by combining the Wavelet decomposition algorithm to better suppress the inherent speckle noises of SAR image. Coastline detection results obtained from two Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired on the same regions were compared with those of the Gaofen-3 images. By using the manually delineated coastlines as the standards in the qualitative evaluations , improvements of about 12.0 % , 8.3 % , 23.8 % , and 9.4 % can be achieved by the improved FCM method with respect to the indicators of mean , RMSE , PGSD , and P90 % , respectively; demonstrating that the Gaofen-3 data is superior to the Sentinel-1 data in the detection of coastline.
