  Asymmetric reductive amination for the synthesis of both chiral tetrahydroquinolines ( THQs) and tetrahydroisoquinolines ( THIQs) has been realized with an Ir/ZhaoPhos catalytic system via a one-pot N-Boc deprotection/intramolecular asymmetric reductive amination ( ARA) sequence. Control experiments reveal that HCl plays a vital role to the success of this transformation. The HCl acid assists the removal of the N-Boc protecting group and also provides chloride ions to interact with the thiourea moiety in ZhaoPhos , thus leading to excellent reaction enantiocontrol.
