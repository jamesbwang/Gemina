  Ionizing radiation is a valuable tool in many spheres of human life. At the same time , it is a genotoxic agent with a well-established carcinogenic potential. Progress achieved in the last two decades has demonstrated convincingly that ionizing radiation can also target the cellular epigenome. Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in the expression of genes that are not due to alterations of DNA sequence but consist of specific covalent modifications of chromatin components , such as methylation of DNA , histone modifications , and control performed by non-coding RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation , a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the control of expression of genetic information , may serve as one of the driving mechanisms of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Here , we review the literature on the effects of ionizing radiation on DNA methylation in various biological systems , discuss the role of DNA methylation in radiation carcinogenesis , and provide our opinion on the potential utilization of this knowledge in radiation oncology.
