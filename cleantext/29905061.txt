  This work demonstrates that a model system of poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) ( PNIPAam) macroporous hydrogels , with tailored microstructures and comprising gold ( Au) or silver ( Ag) nanoparticles , display enhanced and tunable catalytic activity. These nanocomposites are prepared using polymer templates obtained from melt-processed cocontinuous polymer blends. The reaction rate , controlled by both hydrogel porosity and the PNIPAam lower critical solution temperature , increases by more than an order of magnitude as compared to nonporous gels , and is comparable to micro- or nanocarrier-based systems , with easier catalyst recovery. The fabrication process is scalable , and is compatible with broad choices of polymer blend , gel , and nanoparticle chemistries.
