  To investigate and compare the feasibility , safety , and preliminary effectiveness of home-based self-managed manual wheelchair high-intensity interval training ( HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training ( MICT) programs. Eleven manual wheelchair users were randomly assigned to the HIIT ( The answers to the questionnaire demonstrated that both training programs were feasible in the community. No severe adverse events occurred , although some participants experienced increased shoulder pain during HIIT. Neither program yielded a significant change in cardiorespiratory fitness or upper limb strength. However , both groups reported moderate to significant subjective improvement. Home-based wheelchair HIIT appears feasible and safe although potential development of shoulder pain remains a concern and should be addressed with a future preventive shoulder exercise program. Some recommendations have been proposed for a larger study aiming to strengthen evidence regarding the feasibility , safety , and effectiveness of HIIT.
