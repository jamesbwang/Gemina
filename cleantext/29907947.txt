  In clinical practice , direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) are often started earlier ( ≤ 7 days) than in randomized clinical trials after stroke. We aimed to develop a nomogram model incorporating time of DOAC introduction ≤ 7 days of stroke onset in combination with different degrees of stroke radiological/neurological severity at the time of treatment to predict the probability of unfavorable outcome. We conducted a multicenter prospective study including 344 patients who started DOAC 1-7 days after atrial fibrillation-related stroke onset. Computed tomography scan 24-36 h after stroke onset was performed in all patients before starting DOAC. Unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) score > 2 at 3 months. Based on multivariate logistic model , the nomogram was generated. We assessed the discriminative performance by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC-ROC) and calibration of risk prediction model by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Onset-to-treatment time for DOAC ( OR: 1.21 , p = 0.030) , NIH Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) score at the time of treatment ( OR: 1.00 for NIHSS = 0-5; OR: 2.67 , p = 0.016 for NIHSS = 6-9; OR: 26.70 , p < 0.001 for NIHSS = 10-14; OR: 57.48 , p < 0.001 for NIHSS ≥ 15) , size infarct ( OR: 1.00 for small infarct; OR: 2.26 , p = 0.023 for medium infarct; OR: 3.40 , p = 0.005 for large infarct) , and age ≥ 80 years ( OR: 1.96 , p = 0.028) remained independent predictors of unfavorable outcome to compose the nomogram. The AUC-ROC of nomogram was 0.858. Calibration was good ( p = 2.889 for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The combination of onset-to-treatment time of DOAC with stroke radiological/neurological severity at the time of treatment and old age may predict the probability of unfavorable outcome.
