  Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy ( PTTM) is a fatal , malignancy-related respiratory complication; we herein report a PTTM case induced by metastatic prostate cancer. An 81-year-old Japanese man developed dyspnea<symptom>. High-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT) revealed ground-glass opacities spread across bilateral lung fields. Pulmonary microvascular aspiration cytology detected prostate cancer cells. As PTTM was highly suspected , docetaxel chemotherapy was performed immediately. His respiratory condition and HRCT findings improved temporarily , but he died approx. 6 weeks after admission. Autopsy showed fibrocellular intimal proliferation of small pulmonary arterioles , which confirmed the diagnosis of PTTM induced by prostate cancer. As in the present case , it is often difficult to confirm the presence of not only tumor embolization but also fibrocellular intimal proliferation before the patient 's death.
