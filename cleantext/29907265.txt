  The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of mandibular advancement or setback surgery on the facial soft tissue assessed using three-dimensional images. An electronic search was performed in the MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , Scopus , Virtual Health Library ( VHL) , Web of Science , and OpenGrey databases. Inclusion criteria comprised studies that evaluated the soft tissues of adult patients before and after mandibular advancement or setback surgery using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The risk of bias was analyzed. A total of 3501 studies were retrieved. The titles and abstracts of 2071 studies were read and 2040 of them were excluded. Thirty-one articles were read in full and six fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included. A meta-analysis was performed using three of these articles. The correlation was significant and strong in the chin area ( r = 0.876 and r = 0.868) and moderate for the lower lip/lower incisor ( r = 0.690). The ratio for lower lip/infradentale was 78 % and for Pog '/ Pog was 98 %. Due to the limited number of articles included , there is weak evidence to infer that changes in the facial soft tissue due to mandibular advancement or setback are significant , but changes in the lower lip tend to be smaller than changes in the chin area.
