  Tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( tongue cancer) is one of the most common malignancies in the oral maxillofacial region. The tumor easily relapses after surgery , and the prognosis remains poor. Recently , zinc oxide nanoparticles ( ZnO NPs) were shown to target multiple cancer cell types. In this study , we aimed to elucidate the anticancer effect of ZnO NPs on CAL 27 human tongue cancer cells and identify the role of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in this effect. We analyzed the dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of ZnO NPs on CAL 27 cells. Cells were cultured in media containing 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , or 100 μg/mL ZnO NPs for 24 h. We further examined the intracellular reactive oxygen species levels , monodansylcadaverine intensity and mitochondrial membrane potential following the administration of 25 μg/mL ZnO NPs for 4 , 8 , 12 , or 24 h and investigated the role of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in ZnO NP-induced toxicity in CAL 27 cells. The viability of CAL 27 cells decreased after treatment with increasing ZnO NP concentrations. The inhibitory concentration 50 % of the ZnO NPs was calculated as 25 μg/mL. The ZnO NPs increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in a time-dependent manner as well as activated the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy process in CAL 27 cells. Based on our findings , ZnO NPs may possess potential anticancer activity toward tongue cancer cells.
