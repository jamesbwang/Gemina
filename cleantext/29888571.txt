  To observe the effect of different frequencies of electroacupuncture ( EA) stimulation on pain threshold ( PT) and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) in dorsal horns ( DHs) of the lumbar spinal cord in resiniferatoxin ( RTX)- induced post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN) rats , so as to reveal its mechanism in alleviating PHN. Male SD rats were randomized into control , model , 2 Hz-EA , 15 Hz-EA , 100 Hz-EA and sham EA groups ( A single RTX injection gradually induced tactile allodynia ( significant reduction of the mechanical PT) within 3 weeks relevant to the control group ( EA at 2 Hz can significantly reduce VEGF expression in the lumbar spinal cord DHs of PHN rats , which is possibly in part related to its effect in alleviating the mechanical allodynia. Our study suggests that 2 Hz EA is the best stimulation frequency for relieving PHN.
