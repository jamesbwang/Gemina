  Parent-child relationship quality is an important factor when examining adolescent 's risk for problem behaviors. For this reason , many researchers have explored the impacts of parent-child relationship quality on adolescent and child behavior , yet the parent-child relationship has lasting consequences into adulthood. The current study examined the mediating role of risky sexual behavior ( as measured by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey) on the relationship between parent-child relationship quality ( as measured by the Parental Environment Questionnaire) and quality of life ( as measured by the World Health Organizations Quality of Life Questionnaire) beyond adolescence , during emerging adulthood. The additional moderating effects of gender were examined. Participants consisted of 507 undergraduate students ( 173 males , 334 females) recruited from a large university in the Southern United States between 18 and 25 years of age. Parent-child relationship quality was positively related to quality of life among both males and females. The indirect pathway from parent-child relationship quality to quality of life , through risky sexual behavior , was significant in females but not in males. Results suggest that the parent-child relationship , specifically for females , may be a target for intervention in the prevention of risky sexual behavior in Emerging Adulthood. Further results , implications , and limitations were discussed.
