  There is a growing cohort of patients requiring complex revascularization for failed carotid artery stenting. This revascularization can be complex in patients with coexisting supra-aortic vascular anomalies. Aberrant origin of the vertebral artery ( VA) is an example of such an anomaly. Although VA anomalies are rare , their occurrence is of significant importance in endovascular and open vascular procedures. We report a case of a 78-year-old man with rare VA anomaly , whose left internal carotid artery ostium was inadvertently covered during a carotid artery stenting procedure. We discuss the carotid artery revascularization in this patient as well as the relevant literature.
