  Machine learning approaches for human emotion recognition have recently demonstrated high performance. However , only/mostly for subject-dependent approaches , in a variety of applications like advanced driver assisted systems , smart homes and medical environments. Therefore , now the focus is shifted more towards subject-independent approaches , which are more universal and where the emotion recognition system is trained using a specific group of subjects and then tested on totally new persons and thereby possibly while using other sensors of same physiological signals in order to recognize their emotions. In this paper , we explore a novel robust subject-independent human emotion recognition system , which consists of two major models. The first one is an automatic feature calibration model and the second one is a classification model based on Cellular Neural Networks ( CNN). The proposed system produces state-of-the-art results with an accuracy rate between 80 % and 89 % when using the same elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands for both training and testing and an accuracy rate of 71.05 % when the elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands used in training are different from those used in training. Here , the following physiological signals are involved: ECG ( Electrocardiogram) , EDA ( Electrodermal activity) and ST ( Skin-Temperature).
