  Exosomes have emerged as a promising drug carrier with low immunogenicity , high biocompatibility and delivery efficiency. Here in , we isolated exosomes from A33-positive LIM1215 cells ( A33-Exo) and loaded them with doxorubicin ( Dox). Furthermore , we coated surface-carboxyl superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( US) with A33 antibodies ( A33Ab-US) , expecting that these A33 antibodies on the surface of the nanoparticles could bind to A33-positive exosomes and form a complex ( A33Ab-US-Exo/Dox) to target A33-positive colon cancer cells. The results showed that A33Ab-US-Exo/Dox had good binding affinity and antiproliferative effect in LIM1215 cells , as shown by increased uptake of the complex. In vivo study showed that A33Ab-US-Exo/Dox had an excellent tumor targeting ability , and was able to inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of the mice with reduced cardiotoxicity. In summary , exosomes functionalized by targeting ligands through coating with high-density antibodies may prove to be a novel delivery system for targeted drugs against human cancers.
