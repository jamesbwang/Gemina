  There are differences in number and localization of nucleolus organizer regions ( NORs) in genomes. In mammalian genomes , NORs are located on autosomes , which are often situated on short arms of acrocentric chromosomes and more rarely in telomeric , pericentromeric , or interstitial regions. In this work , we report the unique case of active NORs located on gon–æsomes of a eutherian mammal , the Javan mouse-deer (
