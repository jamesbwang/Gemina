  Regular exercise contributes to improved cardiovascular health and reduced cardiovascular mortality. Previous studies have shown that regular physical activity and high cardiorespiratory fitness both contribute to a reduction in incident atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). However , the risk of AF appears to be paradoxically increased by participation in endurance exercise. Although the mechanisms are not well understood , exercise-induced changes in autonomic tone alongside the development of an arrhythmogenic atrial substrate , appear to contribute to an excess of AF amongst athletes , despite an overall reduction in cardiovascular disease incidence. This review will ( i) summarise the evidence showing that regular physical activity and exercise reduces AF incidence , ( ii) review the evidence that supports an increase in AF risk by regular endurance exercise , and ( iii) discuss the mechanisms and risk factors that may contribute to AF susceptibility amongst otherwise healthy athletes.
