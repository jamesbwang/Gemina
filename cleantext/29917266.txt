  A copper-catalyzed net hydroamination of vinylphosphine boranes with hydrosilanes and O-benzoylhydroxylamines has been developed. The reaction proceeds regioselectively to form the corresponding α-aminophosphine boranes of potent interest in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. This copper catalysis is based on an umpolung , electrophilic amination strategy and provides a new electrophilic amination approach to α-aminophosphine derivatives. Additionally , although still preliminary , asymmetric synthesis has also been achieved by judicious choice of a chiral bisphosphine-ligated copper complex.
