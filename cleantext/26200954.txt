  Egg drop syndrome<disease> virus ( EDSV) is an economically important pathogen with a broad host range , and it causes disease that leads to markedly decreased egg production. Although EDSV is known to induce apoptosis in duck embryo fibroblasts ( DEFs) , the interaction between EDSV and its host needs to be further researched. Here , we provide the first evidence that EDSV infection triggers autophagy in DEFs through increases in autophagosome-like double-membrane vesicles , the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II , and LC3 colocalization with viral hexon proteins. Conversely , P62/SQSTM1 degradation , LC3-II turnover , and colocalization of LAMP and LC3 confirmed that EDSV infection triggers complete autophagy. Furthermore , we demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine ( CQ) and 3-methyladenine ( 3MA) or RNA interference targeting ATG-7 decreased the yield of EDSV progeny. In contrast , induction of autophagy by rapamycin increased the EDSV progeny yield. In addition , we preliminarily demonstrated that the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ Akt/mTOR pathway contributes to autophagic induction following EDSV infection. Altogether , these finding lead us to conclude that EDSV infection induces autophagy , which benefits its own replication in host cells. These findings provide novel insights into EDSV-host interactions.
