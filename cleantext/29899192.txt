  The adenylation domain of nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( NRPS) is responsible for its selective substrate recognition and activation of the substrate ( yielding an acyl-O-AMP intermediate) on ATP consumption. DhbF is an NRPS involved in bacillibactin synthesis and consists of multiple domains ( adenylation domain , condensation domain , peptidyl carrier protein ( PCP) domain , and thioesterase domain); DhbFA1 and DhbFA2 ( here named) are `` internal '' adenylation domains in the multidomain enzyme DhbF. We firstly succeeded in expressing and purifying the `` internal '' adenylation domains DhbFA1 and DhbFA2 separately. Furthermore , we initially demonstrated dipeptide synthesis by `` internal '' adenylation domains. When glycine and L-cysteine were used as substrates of DhbFA1 , the formation of N-glycyl-L-cysteine ( Gly-Cys) was observed. Furthermore , when L-threonine and L-cysteine were used as substrates of DhbFA2 , N-L-threonyl-L-cysteine ( Thr-Cys) was formed. These findings showed that both adenylation domains produced dipeptides by forming a carbon-nitrogen bond comprising the carboxyl group of an amino acid and the amino group of L-cysteine , although these adenylation domains are acid-thiol ligase using 4 '- phosphopantetheine ( bound to the PCP domain) as a substrate. Furthermore , DhbFA1 and DhbFA2 synthesized oligopeptides as well as dipeptides.
