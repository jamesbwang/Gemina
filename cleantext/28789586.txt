  Medical applications and biotechnological advances , including magnetic resonance imaging , cell separation and detection , tissue repair , magnetic hyperthermia<symptom> and drug delivery , have strongly benefited from employing iron oxide nanoparticles ( IONPs) due to their remarkable properties , such as superparamagnetism , size and possibility of receiving a biocompatible coating. Ongoing research efforts focus on reducing drug concentration , toxicity , and other side effects , while increasing efficacy of IONPs-based treatments. This review highlights the methods of synthesis and presents the most recent reports in the literature regarding advances in drug delivery using IONPs-based systems , as well as their antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms. Furthermore , the toxicity of IONPs alone and constituting nanosystems is also addressed.
