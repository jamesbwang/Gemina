  To estimate whether there are differences in obstetric interventions or outcomes by the gender of the delivering physician. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all nulliparous women delivering singleton , vertex , live births at 37 weeks of gestation or greater at a tertiary care institution ( 2014-2015). Patient clinical characteristics were analyzed by delivering physician gender. The primary outcomes were delivery mode and episiotomy. Secondary outcomes included major perineal laceration , postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> , 5-minute Apgar score less than 7 , cord umbilical artery pH less than 7.0 , and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Univariable and hierarchical multivariable analyses including physician as a random effect were utilized for analyses. Of the 7,027 women who met inclusion criteria , 81.3 % ( n = 5,716) were delivered by a female physician. Women delivered by female physicians were slightly younger than those delivered by male physicians and were more likely to be publicly insured ( 11.7 % vs 7.1 % , P < .001). Mode of delivery did not differ by physician gender; the cesarean delivery rate was 20.6 % for male physicians and 20.5 % for female physicians ( P = .61). Although the episiotomy rate did differ by physician gender , with 5.9 % of patients delivered by male physicians undergoing episiotomy compared with 3.6 % of patients delivered by female physicians ( P = .001) , this finding did not persist in the multivariable model after accounting for potential confounders ( adjusted odds ratio 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.49-1.56). There were no differences by physician gender regarding any of the examined secondary outcomes in univariable or multivariable analyses. Outcomes of nulliparous women undergoing a trial of labor did not differ by delivering physician gender.
