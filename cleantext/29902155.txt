  Background Some pediatric endocrinologists recommend that girls with central precocious puberty ( CPP) have cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) performed only if they are younger than 6 years of age. However , no practice guidelines exist. The objective of this review was to assess the frequency of intracranial lesions<symptom> in girls with CPP. Content We searched six electronic databases ( PubMed , Cochrane , Web of Science , SCOPUS , ProQuest , and Dissertation & Theses) from 1990 through December 2015. We included studies on girls with CPP and MRI data. Case reports , case series , studies from the same author/group with the same patient population , and studies with conditions predisposing to CPP were excluded. Two physicians independently reviewed the search results and extracted data. A random-effects model was used to obtain pooled prevalence of positive MRI 's across studies. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated with the Q-statistic. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger 's test. Pooled prevalence was computed by age group. A linear regression assessed the relationship between intracranial lesion<symptom> prevalence and healthcare availability. We included 15 studies with a total of 1853 girls < 8 year old evaluated for CPP. Summary The pooled prevalence from all studies was 0.09 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.06-0.12). There was a significant heterogeneity , indicating the appropriateness of a random effects model in computing pooled prevalence. In the few studies stratified by age group , pooled prevalence was 25 % in girls < 6 years vs. 3 % in girls 6-8 of age. Outlook Our results support that the benefit of routine MRIs in girls with CPP older than 6 years of age without any neurological concerns is not clear-cut.
