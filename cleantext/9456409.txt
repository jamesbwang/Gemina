  Glistening formation in the intraocular lens ( IOL) optic has the potential to impact quality of vision. The enVista One-Piece Hydrophobic Acrylic Spherical IOL Model MX60 ( MX60 IOL) is currently the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved IOL with a label of `` no glistenings ''. The purpose of this prospective , multicenter , partially randomized , partially controlled , double-masked , pivotal study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the enVista One-Piece Hydrophobic Acrylic MX60T Toric IOL ( enVista MX60T Toric IOL). Subjects ( n = 191) were implanted with the enVista MX60T Toric IOL ( cylinder powers 1.25 , 2.00 , or 2.75 D) or the parent MX60 IOL ( control). Eyes within the lowest range of corneal astigmatism were randomized to receive either Toric 1.25 D IOL or control IOL in a 1:1 ratio. All subjects with corneal astigmatism requiring 2.00 or 2.75 D cylinder IOLs received toric IOLs. Rotational stability , cylinder reduction , and best-corrected distance visual acuity were primary effectiveness endpoints measured at Visit 4 ( 120-180 days postoperatively). Visit 4 mean absolute axis misalignment in the All Toric group was 4.68 ° ± 7.33 ° , and all subjects had ≤ 5 ° absolute rotation from Visit 3 to Visit 4. The 1.25 D group had significantly greater improvement in dioptric cylinder reduction ( enVista MX60T Toric IOL is safe and effective for patients with preoperative corneal astigmatism undergoing IOL implantation.
