  Retrospective , cross-sectional study. To investigate the factor structure of the ADAPSS-short form ( ADAPSS-SF) in an acutely injured SCI population and to assess the relationship between cognitive appraisals made in the initial phase of rehabilitation and the experience of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> National Spinal Injuries Centre , UK. Participants were acutely injured patients admitted to the NSIC over 35 months. Cognitive appraisals were measured using the ADAPSS-SF; psychological distress was measured using the HADS. Individual profiles , including demographics and injury characteristics , were collected. Principle Component Analysis with oblique rotation demonstrated a coherent two-factor structure of the ADAPSS-SF: resilience and loss. Correlational analysis found that individuals who negatively appraised their injury were more likely to report lower mood. Findings identified four vulnerable subgroups that were more likely to negatively appraise their injury: females , individuals older at the time of SCI , individuals with AIS-A injuries and individuals whose SCI was acquired through assault. Hierarchical regression analysis reported that resilience and loss factors were significant predictors of depression<symptom> Gender , resilience and loss factors were significant predictors of anxiety<symptom>. Cognitive appraisals accounted for more variance in mood above biological markers. Findings support a two-factor structure and validity of ADAPSS-SF in acute SCI rehabilitation. The study provides support for the role of cognitive appraisals in psychological adjustment in the early phases of rehabilitation , above injury characteristics. Findings highlighted the vulnerable subgroups that are more likely to initially endorse negative appraisals , which may influence clinical practice and provides an avenue for further research.
