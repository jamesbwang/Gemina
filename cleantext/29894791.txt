  The lower inhaled oxygen per volume at high altitude poses an intimidating challenge for humans to survive and reproduce. Indigenous populations of the Himalayas reportedly exhibit higher microcirculatory blood flow accompanied by higher orders of magnitude of nitric oxide ( NO) products in lung , plasma and red blood cells as a vascular adaptation strategy for hypobaric hypoxia. The precise mechanism of such observed higher NO metabolites for hypoxia adaptation remains elusive. Studying high altitude native Ladakhi women , we observed significant higher eNOS mRNA and protein in blood/plasma as compared to lowland women. We also observed higher level of plasma l-citrulline and NOx ( nitrates and nitrites) with concomitant lower levels of arginase mRNA and protein further suggesting higher eNOS activity and NO bioavailability. Interestingly , middle aged postmenopausal Ladakhi women exhibited significantly higher level of eNOS activity , NOx and cGMP as compared to age matched lowland women. Preferential phosphorylation of eNOS on stimulatory Ser1177 and Ser615 as well as dephosphorylation of inhibitory Thr495 site contributed to higher NO availability in Ladakhi women irrespective of age. We also observed higher levels of eNOS activating humoral factors like bradykinin and estrogen in both young and middle-aged Ladakhi women. These results suggest that an altered phosphorylation status , together with an enhanced expression of eNOS and potential humoral endothelial activators , are involved in enhanced activation of the eNOS-NO-cGMP pathway in Ladakhi women irrespective of age , reinforcing the hypothesis that NO metabolites play a major role in Himalayan pattern of hypoxia adaptation.
