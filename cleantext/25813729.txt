  Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to indicate that , on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto , further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However , there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized , and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper , we look to clarify the nature , purposes and uses of saturation , and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation , which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted , and the relative emphasis on data collection , data analysis , and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches , and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues , we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed , a judgement that , we argue , results in equivocation , and may in part explain the confusion<symptom> surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question ( s) , and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted , but also that there should be some limit to its scope , so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.
