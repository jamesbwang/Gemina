  The results of overlapping metallic stents have been concerning but this practice is often unavoidable in the setting of long or tortuous lesions<symptom> , diameter discrepancy of proximal and distal vessel , and for residual dissections. Theoretically , bio-absorbable scaffolds may carry an advantage over metallic stents due to the progressive resorption of the scaffold theoretically rendering the overlap a non-issue; this has not been clinically evident. Since stent/scaffold overlap can not be entirely avoided , improved stent delivery/deployment and scaffold design modification may reduce complications in this complex patient subset.
