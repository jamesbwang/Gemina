  To investigate the effectiveness of a multi-facetted blended eHealth intervention , called SDM-Digital Intake ( SDM-DI) , in which patients and clinicians are supported in Shared Decision Making during the intake process. The study is a two-arm matched-paired cluster Randomised Controlled Trial in a specialist mental health outpatient setting with two conditions: SDM-DI and Intake As Usual ( IAU). Four intake teams were allocated to each arm. All patients who followed an intake , were asked to participate if they were capable to complete questionnaires. Decisional Conflict ( DC) , referring to patients ' engagement and satisfaction with clinical decisions , was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were patient participation , applying Shared Decision Making ( SDM) , working alliance , treatment adherence and symptom severity. Effects were measured at two weeks ( T1) and two months ( T2) after intake. Multilevel regression and intention-to-treat analyses were used. Additionally , the influence of subgroups and intervention adherence on DC were explored. At T1 , 200 patients participated ( 47 % intervention , 53 % control) , and at T2 175 patients ( 47 % intervention , 53 % control). At T1 and T2 , no differences were found between conditions on DC. Subgroup analyses showed that effects of SDM-DI on DC were not modified by primary diagnoses mood , anxiety<symptom> and personality disorders. Compared to IAU , at T2 , patients reported positive effects of SDM-DI on SDM ( β 7.553 , p = 0.038 , 95 % CI: 0.403-14.703 , d = 0.32) and reduction of symptoms ( β -7.276 , p = 0.0497 , 95 % CI: -14.544-- 0.008 , d = -0.43). No effects were found on patient participation , working alliance and treatment adherence. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that if SDM was applied well , patients reported less DC ( β = -0.457 , p = 0.000 , 95 % CI: -0.518-- 0.396 , d = -1.31) , which was associated with better treatment outcomes. Although , this trial fails to demonstrate that SDM-DI by itself is sufficient to reduce DC , the results are encouraging for further efforts in improving and implementing the SDM intervention.
