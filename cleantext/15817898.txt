  Haze leads to many direct serious public health impacts. Understanding haze related knowledge can not only help adolescents organize health protection awareness to prevent the harmful effects that haze has on the body , but also promote their normal growth and development. By considering , as the theoretical basis , the reasons behind the formation of haze and the underlying mechanisms of the diseases that it causes , in addition to also investigating extensive literature references , our research team developed the Adolescent Haze Related Knowledge Awareness Assessment Scale ( AHRKAAS-I). After 6 experts reviewed AHRKAAS-I , and 6 adolescents tested the scale , the research team further revised and improved AHRKAAS-I to form AHRKAAS-II. After which , researchers randomly selected 2 districts from the 20 districts of Baoding , and subsequently randomly selected 2 middle schools from these 2 districts. Conducting a stratified cluster sampling method , considering class as a unit , the research team randomly selected 22 classes. Finally , a total of 1100 adolescents were investigated and 1034 valid questionnaires were recovered. By analyzing the data of 1034 valid questionnaires , the researchers tested the reliability and validity of the scale and obtained the final scale ( AHRKAAS). AHRKAAS Cronbach 's Î± = 0.923 , content validity = 0.940 , criterion validity = 0.444 , and factor cumulative contribution rate = 66.178 % by exploratory factor analysis. Using confirmatory factor analysis , Chi square value = 662.780 , degrees of freedom = 242 , Chi square value/degrees of freedom = 2.739 , root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.049 , goodness of fit index = 0.929 , adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.905 , comparative fit index = 0.964 , normed fit index = 0.944 , and Tueker-Lewis index = 0.955. AHRKAAS consisted of 25 items and 4 dimensions. AHRKAAS with a good reliability and validity can be used to assess the cognition level of haze related knowledge among the adolescents , help medical workers and coordinators in schools when conducting targeted behavior interventions. Furthermore , it can be used for health guidance for adolescents relating to the health prevention of haze.
