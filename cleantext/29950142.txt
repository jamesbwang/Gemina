  Chaperone-mediated autophagy ( CMA) is a selective degradative process for cytosolic proteins that contributes to the maintenance of proteostasis. The signaling mechanisms that control CMA are not fully understood but might involve response to stress conditions including oxidative stress. Considering the role of CMA in redoxtasis and proteostasis , we sought to determine if the transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2 ( nuclear factor , erythroid derived 2 , like 2) has an impact on CMA modulation. In this work , we identified and validated 2 NFE2L2 binding sequences in the LAMP2 gene and demonstrated in several human and mouse cell types that NFE2L2 deficiency and overexpression was linked to reduced and increased LAMP2A levels , respectively. Accordingly , lysosomal LAMP2A levels were drastically reduced in nfe2l2-knockout hepatocytes , which also displayed a marked decrease in CMA activity. Oxidant challenge with paraquat or hydrogen peroxide , or pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 with sulforaphane or dimethyl fumarate also increased LAMP2A levels and CMA activity. Overall , our study identifies for the first time basal and inducible regulation of LAMP2A , and consequently CMA activity , by NFE2L2.
