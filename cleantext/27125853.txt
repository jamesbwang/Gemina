  In the search for interventions against aging and age-related diseases , biological screening platforms are indispensable tools to identify anti-aging compounds among large substance libraries. The budding yeast , Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , has emerged as a powerful chemical and genetic screening platform , as it combines a rapid workflow with experimental amenability and the availability of a wide range of genetic mutant libraries. Given the amount of conserved genes and aging mechanisms between yeast and human , testing candidate anti-aging substances in yeast gene-deletion or overexpression collections , or de novo derived mutants , has proven highly successful in finding potential molecular targets. Yeast-based studies , for example , have led to the discovery of the polyphenol resveratrol and the natural polyamine spermidine as potential anti-aging agents. Here , we present strategies for pharmacological anti-aging screens in yeast , discuss common pitfalls and summarize studies that have used yeast for drug discovery and target identification.
