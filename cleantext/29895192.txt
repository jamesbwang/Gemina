  Viral<disease> infection<disease> causes many physiological alterations in the host cell , and many of these alterations can affect the host mitochondrial network , including mitophagy induction. A substantial amount of literature has been generated that advances our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and several viruses. Some viruses trigger mitophagy directly , and indirectly and control the mitophagic process via different strategies. This enables viruses to promote persistent infection and attenuate the innate immune responses. In this review , we discuss the events of virus-regulated mitophagy and the functional relevance of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of viral<disease> infection<disease> and disease.
