  Women with diabetes are at increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Preconception care can improve pregnancy outcomes and is paramount to minimise complications , but , current provision is sub-optimal. Mobile technology , particularly smartphones and apps have the potential to improve preconception care provision but research is lacking in this area. The need to use modern technologies to improve preconception care knowledge and awareness led to the development of a preconception and diabetes information app in Stage A of this study. The aim of this paper , Stage B of the study , is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the Preconception and Diabetes Information app to improve preconception care knowledge and attitudes in women with diabetes , and explore the potential for wider implementation. A mixed-methods study design adopting a quasi-experimental approach will assess women 's knowledge and attitudes related to preconception care , and level of patient activation ( knowledge and confidence for self-management of health) before and after the three-month intervention period. A log of activity will be used to determine engagement with the app and semi-structured interviews will explore women 's experiences. This is the first study to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a preconception and diabetes information app for women with diabetes. The app has potential to change the way preconception care is delivered , improve pregnancy outcomes and be widely implemented both in developed and developing countries. This is important given the considerable shortfalls in current preconception care services in the United Kingdom and around the world.
