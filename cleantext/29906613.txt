  Fatty acid-binding proteins ( FABPs) are involved in binding and storing hydrophobic ligands such as long-chain fatty acids , as well as transporting them to the appropriate compartments in the cell. Epidermal fatty acid-binding protein ( FABP5) is an intracellular lipid-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. Previous studies have revealed that the FABP5 expression level is closely related to malignancy in various types of cancer. However , its precise functions in the metabolisms of cancer cells remain unclear. Here , we revealed that FABP5 knockdown significantly induced downregulation of the genes expression , such as hormone-sensitive lipase ( HSL) , monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL) , elongation of long-chain fatty acid member 6 ( Elovl6) , and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 ( ACSL1) , which are involved in altered lipid metabolism , lipolysis , and de novo FA synthesis in highly aggressive prostate and breast cancer cells. Moreover , we demonstrated that FABP5 induced inflammation<symptom> and cytokine production through the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway activated by reactive oxygen species and protein kinase C in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus , FABP5 might regulate lipid quality and/or quantity to promote aggressiveness such as cell growth , invasiveness , survival , and inflammation<symptom> in prostate and breast cancer cells. In the present study , we have revealed for the first time that high expression of FABP5 plays a critical role in alterations of lipid metabolism , leading to cancer development and metastasis in highly aggressive prostate and breast cancer cells.
