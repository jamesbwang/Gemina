  The aims of this study were ( 1) to evaluate clinical outcomes after ICSI cycles using surgically recovered sperm and ( 2) to assess the influence of maternal age on those outcomes. A retrospective cohort study of 24,763 IVF cycles of fresh autologous oocytes and ICSI using surgically recovered sperm reported to the SART CORS database from 2004 to 2015. Older women had significantly longer stimulation ( p < 0.001) , a lower number of oocytes retrieved ( p < 0.001) , a lower number of 2PN zygotes ( p < 0.001) , a lower chance of having a blastocyst transferred ( p < 0.001) , and a higher number of fresh embryos transferred ( p < 0.001). There was no significant association between the number of 2PNs per oocyte retrieved and maternal age ( p = 0.214). Both clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates ( LBR) decreased with advanced maternal age ( p < 0.001). LBR ranged from 50.4 % in women < 30 to 7.2 % in women > 42 years , and for cleavage-stage transfers , the LBR ranged from 47.3 % in women < 30 to 6.3 % in women > 42 years. There were no differences in gestational age at delivery , proportion of term deliveries , preterm deliveries , neonatal birth weight < 2500 g , neonatal birth weight > 4000 g and average birthweight of neonates for singleton pregnancies according to age. For twin pregnancies , women < 30 years had significantly higher number of live births , term deliveries , and lower preterm deliveries than older women. There was a similar number of female ( 6051) and male neonates ( 5858; p = 0.2). Overall , pregnancy outcomes with ICSI using surgically recovered sperm are reassuring and comparable to those of ICSI with ejaculated sperm.
