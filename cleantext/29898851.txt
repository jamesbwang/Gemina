  Appropriate information about the benefits and risks of invasive procedures is crucial , but limited data is available in this field. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental value of a short video about coronary angiography compared with standard information , in terms of patient understanding , satisfaction and anxiety<symptom>. This prospective multicenter study included patients admitted for scheduled coronary angiography , who were randomized to receive either standard information or video information by watching a three-dimensional educational video. After information was delivered , patients were asked to complete a dedicated 16-point information questionnaire , as well as satisfaction and anxiety<symptom> scales. From 21 September to 4 October 2015 , 821 consecutive patients were randomized to receive either standard information ( n = 415) or standard information with an added educational video ( n = 406). The information score was higher in the video information group than in the standard group ( 11.8 ± 2.8 vs 9.5 ± 3.1; P < .001). This result was consistent across age and education level subgroups. Self-reported satisfaction was also higher in the video information group ( 8.4 ± 1.9 vs. 7.7 ± 2.3; P < .001) , while anxiety<symptom> level did not differ between groups. The variables associated with a higher information score were the use of the educational video , younger age , higher level of education , previous follow-up by a cardiologist , prior information about coronary angiography and previous coronary angiography. In comparison with standard information , viewing a dedicated educational video improved patients ' understanding and satisfaction before scheduled coronary angiography. These results are in favor of widespread use of this incremental information tool.
