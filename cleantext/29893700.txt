  Neonatal cholestasis constitutes for 19 to 33 % of all chronic liver disease in India. Cholestasis leads to fibrosis<disease> of liver and ultimately cirrhosis. There are various methods of diagnosis of fibrosis<disease> of liver like fibroscan , APRI index , FIB-4 , fibro index , forns index , heap score , magnetic elastography. Here we are comparing APRI index with METAVIR index in patients with neonatal cholestasis without biliary atresia and determining whether APRI index can be used as a tool to determine fibrosis<disease> in these patients. Patients with neonatal cholestasis without biliary atresia were included in the study. This retrospective analysis was done between 2009 and 2015. All patients underwent a liver biopsy and METAVIR index was calculated. APRI at the time of liver biopsy was determined. Forty-eight patients were included in this study with mean age of 3.5 Â± 2.8 months with a male: female ratio of 35:13. Metavir Index F0 was seen in was 32 ( 66.67 %) patients , F1 in 6 ( 12.5 %) , F2 in 4 ( 8.33 %) , F3 in 0 and F4 in 6 ( 12.5 %) patients respectively. Mean APRI for F0-F3 was 1.38 and for F4 was 3.74 respectively. With an APRI of 1.38 , the sensitivity and specificity to detect fibrosis/cirrhosis was 100 % and 21.43 % respectively. APRI is not an effective tool to measure fibrosis<disease> or cirrhosis in patients with non-BA neonatal cholestasis in Indian children.
