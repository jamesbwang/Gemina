  Supraorbital salt-excreting glands are present in at least 10 avian orders and are largest in marine species , including penguins. Diseases of the avian salt gland have been described infrequently. From September 2015 , five captive northern rockhopper penguins ( Eudyptes moseleyi) were presented over a 6-wk period for unilateral or bilateral supraorbital swellings. In September 2016 , two cases recurred and two additional cases were identified. Histopathology demonstrated salt gland adenitis with extensive squamous metaplasia. Blood plasma testing demonstrated marked vitamin A and E deficiencies within the colony. Prolonged frozen storage of feed-fish was implicated as a cause of vitamin depletion; reducing storage times and addition of dietary supplementation prevented recurrence.
