  To prevent folate deficiencies , many countries supplement various foodstuffs with folic acid. This compound is a synthetic oxidised folate that differs from naturally occurring reduced folates in its metabolism and uptake. Notably , safety reviews of folic acid supplementation have not considered interactions with gut bacteria. Here , we use the Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen>- Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> animal- microbe model to examine a possible bacterial route for folic acid uptake. It has been assumed that supplements are taken up directly by the worm , especially because E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is unable to take up folates. However , E coli , like many other bacteria , can transport the folate breakdown product , para-aminobenzoate-glutamate ( PABA-glu) , via AbgT and use it for bacterial folate synthesis. This pathway may impact host health because inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis increases C. elegans<pathogen> lifespan. Folic acid supplementation was found to rescue a C. elegans<pathogen> developmental folate-deficient mutant; however , a much higher concentration was required compared to folinic acid , a reduced folate. Unlike folinic acid , the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation was dependent on the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> gene , abgT , suggesting a bacterial route with PABA-glu uptake by E coli as a first step. Surprisingly , we found up to 4 % PABA-glu in folic acid preparations , including in a commercial supplement. Via breakdown to PABA-glu , folic acid increases E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> folate synthesis. This pathway restores folate synthesis in a bacterial mutant defective in PABA synthesis , reversing the ability of this mutant to increase C. elegans<pathogen> lifespan. Folic acid supplementation in C. elegans<pathogen> occurs chiefly indirectly via bacterial uptake of breakdown products via E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> AbgT , and can impact C. elegans<pathogen> development and longevity. Examining how folic acid supplementation affects bacterial folate synthesis in the human gut may help us to better understand the safety of folic acid supplementation.
