  The primary objective of this study was to investigate the correlations between instrument measurements and sensory attributes of strawberry jam. For this purpose , a series of low sugar strawberry jams were prepared by using different contents of pectin from different sources , which were evaluated by sensory analysis for sensory attributes and by instrument measurements for specific physical properties. Model strawberry jams showed an elastic behavior that increased with higher low-methoxyl ( LM) pectin content. These results showed that the apparent viscosity from viscosity measurements was highly correlated with each sensory attribute. As jam is a non-Newtonian fluid , the apparent viscosity was dependent on the shear rate. Moreover , the secondary objective of this study was to discern the physical properties affecting human texture perception based on these relationships. Hence , the instrumental texture perception based on the oral cavity condition was able to predict human texture perception based on the shear rate , which was obtained from the apparent viscosity. These results indicated that human texture perception is judged by apparent viscosity as determined by controlling tongue<symptom> movement<symptom> and oral cavity condition ( e.g. , temperature , saliva , and shear rate). We could demonstrate the importance of texture measurement using replicated oral processing for each sensory attribute. Specifically , viscosity measurement results indicated that shear rate is a very important factor for texture perception. Moreover , our findings clarified that human texture perception is modified by apparent viscosity corresponding to shear rate. We anticipate that this technology might be applied as a measure of apparent viscosity to control texture for jam quality improvement.
