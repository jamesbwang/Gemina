  The number of cancer survivors is growing due to population ageing , earlier detection and more effective therapies. Routinely collected data ( RCD) , generally cancer registry data , has been used to investigate survivors ' needs and outcomes. We reviewed uses of RCD since 2017 , identifying novel findings and research directions. Survival is improving internationally but continues to vary between subgroups. Longitudinal survivor surveys suggest malignancy-specific temporal patterns in unmet needs and health-related quality-of-life ( HRQoL). Unmet needs are a risk factor for future depression<symptom> and depression<symptom> predicts poorer HRQoL in all domains. Emerging evidence suggests links between posttraumatic stress and poor HRQoL and posttraumatic growth and improved HRQoL. Evidence for a link between cancer-related financial hardship and poor HRQoL is accumulating. Surveys and linkage studies continue to show poorer work outcomes in survivors. Among survivors of childhood and young adult cancers , large linkage studies demonstrate significant risk of late effects , including hospitalization , pregnancy and labour complications , and cardiac death. RCD plays a significant role in understanding survivors ' needs and outcomes. New approaches which overlay different types of data- including detailed clinical and treatment data , biomarker data and nonhealth administrative data- have the potential to generate considerable new knowledge.
