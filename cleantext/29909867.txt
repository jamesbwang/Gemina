  Wearable devices offer huge potential to collect rich sources of data to provide insights into the effects of treatment interventions. Despite this , at the time of writing this report , limited regulatory guidance on the use of wearables in clinical trial programs has been published. To present recommendations from the Critical Path Institute 's Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Consortium regarding the selection and evaluation of wearable devices and their measurements for use in regulatory trials and to support labeling claims. The evaluation group was composed of Critical Path Institute 's clinical outcome assessment ( COA) scientists and COA specialists from pharmaceutical trial eCOA solution providers , including COA development and validation specialists. The resulting recommendations were drawn from a broad range of backgrounds , perspectives , and expertise that enriched the development of this report. Recommendations were developed through analysis of existing regulatory guidance relating to COA development and use in clinical trials , medical device certification/clearance regulations , literature-reported best practice , and practical experience of wearable technology application in clinical trials. We identify the essential properties of fit-for-purpose wearables and propose evidence needed to support their use. In addition , we overview the activities required to establish clinical endpoints derived from wearables data. Using this framework , we believe there is enough current understanding to promote the appropriate use of wearables in study protocols. We hope this will provide a basis for discussion among clinical trial stakeholders and catalyze the development of more robust regulatory guidance.
