  Protein assemblies are often symmetric , as this organization has many advantages compared to individual proteins. Complex protein structures thus very often possess high-order symmetries. Detection and analysis of these symmetries has been a challenging problem and no efficient algorithms have been developed so far. This paper presents the extension of our cyclic symmetry detection method for higher-order symmetries with multiple symmetry axes. These include dihedral and cubic , i.e. , tetrahedral , octahedral , and icosahedral , groups. Our method assesses the quality of a particular symmetry group and also determines all of its symmetry axes with a machine precision. The method comprises discrete and continuous optimization steps and is applicable to assemblies with multiple chains in the asymmetric subunits or to those with pseudo-symmetry. We implemented the method in C++ and exhaustively tested it on all 51,358 symmetric assemblies from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB). It allowed us to study structural organization of symmetric assemblies solved by X-ray crystallography , and also to assess the symmetry annotation in the PDB. For example , in 1.6 % of the cases we detected a higher symmetry group compared to the PDB annotation , and we also detected several cases with incorrect annotation.
