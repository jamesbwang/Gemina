  We developed a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP)- based detection method using lateral flow dipstick chromatography for genetically modified ( GM) soybean and maize events. The single-stranded tag hybridization ( STH) for the chromatography printed-array strip ( C-PAS) system was used for detections targeting the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter , mannose-6-phosphate isomerase gene , Pisum sativum ribulose 1 , 5-bisphosphate carboxylase terminator , a common sequence between the Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac genes , and a GA21-specific sequence. The STH C-PAS system was applicable for multiplex analyses to perform simultaneous detections. The limit of detection was 0.5 % or less for each target. By using the developed method , the LAMP amplification was visually detected. Moreover , the detection could be carried out without any expensive instruments , even for the DNA amplification steps , by virtue of the isothermal reaction. We demonstrated that the rapid and useful method developed here would be applicable for screening GM crops.
