  The accurate therapeutic evaluation for chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) drug is of great importance to minimize side effects and enhance efficacy. Herein , a facile and precise surface-enhanced scattering ( SERS) approach based on coupled plasmonic field has been introduced to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of antileukemia drug through ultrasensitive assay of caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells. Caspase-3 as an apoptosis indicator could specifically cleave the N-terminus of biotinylated DEVD-peptide ( biotin-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Cys) immobilized on the Au nanoparticle-decorated TiO
