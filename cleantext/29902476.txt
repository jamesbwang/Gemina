  The objective was to identify predictors of postabortion long-acting reversible contraception ( LARC) initiation to increase providers ' understanding of motivators of contraceptive choices. We prospectively enrolled a cohort of women having abortions<disease> at < 13 weeks ' gestational age who were eligible to receive no-cost contraceptive methods immediately postprocedure ( N = 1662) to evaluate the demographic and reproductive factors associated with choosing and receiving a long-acting contraceptive versus a short-acting method. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors of LARC initiation. During the study period , 1072 ( 64.5 %) chose an immediate postabortion LARC method and 590 ( 35.5 %) chose another method. Compared to the group of women who chose a non-LARC method , women who chose a LARC method were more likely to have a surgical abortion<disease> and were younger , more likely to be Hispanic , more likely to live greater than 70 miles from the clinic , more likely to have a nonurban address and less likely to have had a prior abortion<disease> We found that the differences in the demographic and reproductive factors of women choosing and receiving postabortion LARC were those which have been shown to be associated with difficulty in accessing contraception. Providers should offer a full range of contraceptive options to women immediately postabortion. Postabortion LARC is more likely to be utilized by women from groups who have been shown to have difficulty accessing traditional family planning clinical care: those who are young , do not live in a city and are from groups with recognized health disparities. Offering postabortion LARC increases the options for these women.
