  Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that affects the spatial vision of one or both eyes in the absence of an obvious organic cause; it is associated with a history of abnormal visual experience during childhood. Subtypes have been defined based on the purported etiology , namely , strabismus ( misaligned eyes) and/or anisometropia ( unequal refractive error). Here we consider the usefulness of these subclassifications.
