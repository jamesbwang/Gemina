  Percutaneous vertebroplasty ( PV) is a minimally invasive procedure designed to treat various spinal pathologies. The maximum number of levels to be injected at one setting is still debatable. This study was done to evaluate the usefulness and safety of multilevel PV ( more than three vertebrae) in management of osteoporotic fractures. This prospective study was carried out on consecutive 40 patients with osteoporotic fractures who had been operated for multilevel PV ( more than three levels). There were 28 females and 12 males and their ages ranged from 60 to 85 years with mean age of 72.5 years. We had injected 194 vertebrae in those 40 patients ( four levels in 16 patients , five levels in 14 patients , and six levels in 10 patients). Visual analogue scale ( VAS) was used for pain intensity measurement and plain X-ray films and computed tomography scan were used for radiological assessment. The mean follow-up period was 21.7 months ( range , 12-40). Asymptomatic bone cement leakage has occurred in 12 patients ( 30 %) in the present study. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism was observed in one patient. Significant improvement of pain was recorded immediate postoperative in 36 patients ( 90 %). Multilevel PV for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures is a safe and successful procedure that can significantly reduce pain and improve patient 's condition without a significant morbidity. It is considered a cost effective procedure allowing a rapid restoration of patient mobility.
