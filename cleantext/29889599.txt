  To determine the effectiveness of a therapeutic patient education ( TPE) intervention based on a biobehavioral approach combined with manual therapy ( MT) to reduce pain in patients with chronic nonspecific neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( CNSNP). In addition , this study intended to assess the effectiveness of a multimodal physiotherapy program including TPE to reduce pain in patients with CNSNP. Single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 47 patients with CNSNP were randomized into three groups: ( 1) MT ( control group); ( 2) MT plus TPE based on a biobehavioral approach ( Exp1); and ( 3) MT plus TPE based on a biobehavioral approach , and therapeutic exercise ( Exp2). The clinical outcomes were recorded at baseline and at 1 and 4 months after the initiation of treatment. The primary outcome was pain intensity ( Visual Analog Scale) , and the secondary outcomes were pain catastrophizing ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale) , illness severity and global improvement ( Clinical Global Impression Scale) , and mechanosensitivity of the median nerve ( Upper<symptom> Limb Neural Test) and the cervical region ( Modified Passive Neck Flexion Test). Statistically significant differences in pain intensity were found when Exp2 was compared with Exp1 and the control group at 4 months ( p = 0.015 and p = 0.001 , respectively) , but no difference was found between Exp1 and the control group at the same follow-up period ( p = 0.86). Exp2 showed statistically significant differences in all of the secondary outcomes except for pain catastrophizing when compared with the control group at 4 months. The Exp2 group was more effective than Exp1 and the control group in terms of reducing pain intensity at 4 months; at post-treatment , only Exp2 was more effective than the control group.
