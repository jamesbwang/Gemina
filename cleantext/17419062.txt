  Proteins have coevolved with cellular environments to improve or preserve their functions , maintaining at the same time the degree of hydrophobicity necessary to fold correctly and enough solubility to perform their biological roles. Here , we study the Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> proteome using a Pareto front analysis in the solubility-hydrophobicity space. The results indicate the existence of a Pareto optimal front , a triangle whose vertices correspond to archetypal proteins specialized in distinct tasks , such as regulatory processes , membrane transport , outer-membrane pore formation , catalysis , and binding. The vertices are further enriched with proteins that occupy different subcellular compartments , namely , cytoplasmic , inner membrane , outer membrane , and outer membrane bounded periplasmic space. The combination of various enriching features offers an interpretation of how bacteria use the physico-chemical properties of proteins , both to drive them into their final destination in the cell and to have their tasks accomplished.
