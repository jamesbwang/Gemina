  The population of elderly adults is constantly increasing and age is a strong determinant of the development of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , especially cardiovascular diseases; therefore old subjects represent a very high proportion of cardiac patients. Since cardiology is progressively more and more involved in the care of aged patients , a new area of Cardiology has been identified , the Geriatric Cardiology ( GC). On the other hand , Cardiac Rehabilitation ( CR) and GC show a wide overlap , and GC seems to be the application in the aged cardiac patient of the core-components that CR has already tested in younger cardiac patients. Now , CR is probably the cardiological area that seems better equipped , both from a cultural and organizational point of view , to care the aged cardiac patients who are often complex and frail , with multimorbidity , and `` frequent users '' of the health care services. The CR is therefore a concrete response , already ready and operative , to the demographic expansion of chronicity and aging. Beyond the definitions , CR and GC operate according to principles and methods which are in large part common; thus , CR and GC could merge themselves into a new area of cardiology , the Cardiogeriatric Rehabilitation ( CGR).
