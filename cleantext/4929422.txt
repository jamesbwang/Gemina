  Hemodynamic parameters measurements were widely conducted using pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC) with thermodilution as a reference standard. Due to its technical difficulties in children , transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) has been widely employed instead. Nonetheless , TTE requires expertise and is time-consuming. Noninvasive cardiac output monitoring such as ultrasonic cardiac output monitor ( USCOM) and electrical velocimetry ( EV) can be performed rapidly with less expertise requirement. Presently , there are inconsistent evidences , variable precision , and reproducibility of EV , USCOM and TTE measurements. Our objective was to compare USCOM , EV and TTE in hemodynamic measurements in critically ill children. This was a single center , prospective observational study in critically ill children. Children with congenital heart diseases and unstable hemodynamics were excluded. Simultaneous measurements of hemodynamic parameters were conducted using USCOM , EV , and TTE. Inter-rater reliability was determined. Bland-Altman plots were used to analyse agreement of assessed parameters. Analysis was performed in 121 patients with mean age of 4.9 years old and 56.2 % of male population. Interrater reliability showed acceptable agreement in all measured parameters ( stroke volume ( SV) , cardiac output ( CO) , velocity time integral ( VTI) , inotropy ( INO) , flow time corrected ( FTC) , aortic valve diameter ( AV) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR) , and stroke volume variation ( SVV); ( Cronbach 's alpha 0.76-0.98). Percentages of error in all parameters were acceptable by Bland-Altman analysis ( 9.2-28.8 %) except SVR ( 30.8 %) and SVV ( 257.1 %). Three noninvasive methods might be used interchangeably in pediatric critical care settings with stable hemodynamics. Interpretation of SVV and SVR measurements must be done with prudence.
