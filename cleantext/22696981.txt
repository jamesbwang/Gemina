  Femoral nerve palsy after total hip arthroplasty is an uncommon complication. We present a case report of delayed-onset femoral nerve palsy associated with iliopsoas hematoma and bursitis 10 years after primary total hip arthroplasty in a 57-year-old male patient with avascular necrosis<symptom> of the femoral head. The patient visited our clinic due to swelling of the inguinal area with sudden-onset knee extension weakness<symptom>. Radiologic examination at admission revealed suspicion of bursitis and hematoma on iliopsoas muscle. After evacuation of the hematoma and bursitis debridement , the patient 's clinical symptoms improved dramatically. This is a rare report of femoral nerve palsy due to noninfectious iliopsoas bursitis and hematoma after total hip arthroplasty.
