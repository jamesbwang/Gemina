  Reduced expression of GM1 and other major brain gangliosides GD1a , GD1b and GT1b have been reported in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) brain. Mechanisms underlying these changes are unclear but may be due to a deficit in the ganglioside biosynthetic process. The present study examined the extent to which deficits in gene expression of key biosynthetic enzymes involved in synthesis of GM1 and GD1b ( B3galt4) and GD1a and GT1b ( St3gal2) exist in neuromelanin-containing neurons in the PD substantia nigra ( SN). In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to examine gene expression of B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 in neuromelanin-containing neurons in the SN in 8 normal controls ( 61-92 yrs.) and 7 PD subjects ( 77-95 yrs). There was a significant decrease in both B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 gene expression in residual neuromelanin-containing cells in the SN of PD patients compared to age-matched neurologically normal controls. These changes appeared to be cell-type specific as abundant B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 gene expression was observed in non-neuromelanin containing neurons located outside of the SN in the PD brain. These data show that residual neuromelanin-containing neurons in the PD SN have decreased expression of the ganglioside biosynthetic genes B3GALT4 and ST3GAL2 , consistent with previous reports of decreased levels of gangliosides GM1 , GD1a , GD1b and GT1b in the PD SN. These changes may increase the vulnerability of these neurons to degeneration in response to a variety of potential stressors.
