  Several foods and nutrients have been independently associated with systolic ( SBP) and diastolic ( DBP) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of combined dietary habits on SBP and DBP values in a large cohort of healthy adults , with a cross-sectional design. Adherence of participants to four a priori dietary patterns was considered: the Healthy Eating Index 2010 ( HEI-2010); the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH); the Greek Mediterranean Diet Score ( MDS); and the Italian Mediterranean Index ( IMI). Overall , 13,597 volunteers ( 35-64 years) were enrolled in 1993-1998 in the EPIC-Florence cohort. Information on dietary habits , anthropometry , smoking status , education , physical activity habits , previous diagnosis of hypertension and SBP and DBP measurements were collected at baseline. Multivariate regression models were performed on 10,163 individuals ( 7551 women) after excluding subjects with prevalent hypertension. IMI , DASH and HEI-2010 were significantly and inversely associated with SBP and DBP values in the total population. The strongest association emerged between IMI and SBP ( β- 1.80 excellent adherence vs low adherence , 95 % CI- 2.99;- 0.61 , p trend 0.001) and DBP ( β- 1.12 , 95 % CI- 1.869;- 0.39 , p trend 0.001) values. In sub-group analyses , an inverse association also emerged between IMI and SBP and DBP values among females and between DASH and DBP among males. MDS was not associated with SBP or DBP. Overall , this study , carried out in a large cohort of healthy adults from Tuscany ( Central Italy) , showed inverse significant associations between specific a priori dietary patterns , identifying general models of health-conscious diet , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values.
