  Analysis of breast milk composition and influencing factors of the Han , Bai and Dai nationalities in Yunnan Province from 2010 to 2012. To choose two typical ethnic minorities-Bai and Dai in Yunnan province with high density of minorities population by using cross-sectional survey and multi-stage cluster sampling. 1053 aged 0-9 month babies and their healthy mothers with the first delivery of Dai , Bai and Han were selected as samples from Heqing county of Dali and Xishuangbanna city where most population were Bai and Dai people. The mothers were surveyed with the questionnaire and their breast milk was collected for the determination of the content of protein , fat and carbohydrate of breast milk; to evaluate the nutrition status of babies by using Z-scoremethod and to analyze the result by using multiple factors analysis of stepwise regression method. The contents of protein , fat and carbohydrate from the three nationalities breast milk are as follows. First , the protein , fat and carbohydrate from Han woman were ( 1. 509 ± 0. 700) , ( 3. 613 ± 1. 491) and ( 6. 168 ± 0. 599) g/100 mL , respectively. Secondly , those of Dai nationality the lastrias breast milk were ( 1. 464 ± 0. 980) , ( 2. 843 ± 1. 434) and ( 6. 386 ± 0. 652) g/100 mL. Finally , those from Bai people were ( 1. 567 ± 0. 724) , ( 3. 791 ± 1. 643) and ( 6. 190 ± 0. 669) g/100 mL. Morbidities of the babies sample including Han , Bai and Dai nationalities underweight , growth retardation and emaciation<symptom> were 3. 80 % ( 40/1053) , 5. 14 % ( 54/1051) , 2. 39 % ( 25/1045). With other variables excluded , within one month after postpartum , breading mothers ' milk was lower in fat due to their more outdoor activities and intake of olive and sesame oil compared with those who took peanut and soybean oil. More than 60 days after delivery , the more iodated salt and the more eating yellow fruits the mothers took in within one month by eating yellow fruits , the higher of fat content their breast milk was. More than 60 days after delivery , the more iodated salt the mothers take in within one month , the lower of carbohydrate content their breast milk was. Meanwhile the more number of pregnancy and more intake of olive and sesame oil comparing with peanut and soybean oil , the higher of carbohydrate content. The less of protein content of female babies compared with male babies their breast milk was. The lastrias who took in olive and sesame oil had less protein content of the breast milk compared with those taking in peanut and soybean oil. The lastrias who took in milk or milk products within 60 days after delivery had higher protein content of the breast milk. Nutrition problems of babies under 1 year old in Yunnan Province still exist. Breast milk contents of breast-feed mothers of Han , Dai and Bai can be influenced by a lot of factors , such as baby sex , pregnant times , outdoor activities in daytime and dietary intake of breast-feed mother.
