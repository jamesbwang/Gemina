  To describe the prevalence and outcome of assisted home feeding ( AHF) in medically complex neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) patients , and to identify variables associated with AHF in this population. 1223 infants who survived to discharge from 2013 to 2015 were identified in our single-center , retrospective cohort study at a large tertiary referral NICU. Demographic and selected disease-specific variables were compared between infants discharged on full oral feeding ( PO) versus AHF. 404 ( 33 %) infants were discharged on AHF ( NG = 201 , GT = 186 , NJ = 17). AHF neonates were born at an earlier gestational age , lower birth weight , had longer hospital admission , greater post-menstrual age at discharge , and had more associated co-morbidities compared to the PO group. AHF was a frequently used and safe intervention in our large cohort of infants. Treatment Study Level III.
