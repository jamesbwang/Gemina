  Wound<disease> healing is a dynamic process involving gene-expression changes that drive re-epithelialization. Here , we describe an essential role for polyamine regulator , AMD1 in driving cell migration at the wound<disease> edge. The polyamines , putrescine , spermidine and spermine are small cationic molecules that play essential roles in many cellular processes. We demonstrate that AMD1 , is rapidly upregulated following wounding in human skin biopsies. Knockdown of AMD1 with shRNAs causes a delay in cell migration that is rescued by the addition of spermine. We further show that spermine can promote cell migration in keratinocytes and in human ex-vivo wounds<disease> where it significantly increases epithelial tongue migration. Knockdown of AMD1 prevents the upregulation of uPA/uPAR on wounding and results in a failure in actin cytoskeletal reorganization at the wound<disease> edge. We demonstrate that keratinocytes respond to wounding by modulating polyamine regulator AMD1 in order to regulate downstream gene expression and promote cell migration. This paper highlights a previously unreported role for the regulation of polyamine levels and ratios in cellular behavior and fate.
