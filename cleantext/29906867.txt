  Graph theory constitutes a widely used and established field providing powerful tools for the characterization of complex networks. The intricate topology of networks can also be investigated by means of the collective dynamics observed in the interactions of self-sustained oscillations ( synchronization patterns) or propagationlike processes such as random walks. However , networks are often inferred from real-data-forming dynamic systems , which are different from those employed to reveal their topological characteristics. This stresses the necessity for a theoretical framework dedicated to the mutual relationship between the structure and dynamics in complex networks , as the two sides of the same coin. Here we propose a rigorous framework based on the network response over time ( i.e. , Green<symptom> function) to study interactions between nodes across time. For this purpose we define the flow that describes the interplay between the network connectivity and external inputs. This multivariate measure relates to the concepts of graph communicability and the map equation. We illustrate our theory using the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process , which describes stable and non-conservative dynamics , but the formalism can be adapted to other local dynamics for which the Green<symptom> function is known. We provide applications to classical network examples , such as small-world ring and hierarchical networks. Our theory defines a comprehensive framework that is canonically related to directed and weighted networks , thus paving a way to revise the standards for network analysis , from the pairwise interactions between nodes to the global properties of networks including community detection.
