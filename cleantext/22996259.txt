  The interactions between two or more molecules or colloidal particles can be used to obtain a variety of self-assembled systems called supramolecules or supracolloids. There is a clear , but neglected , convergence between these two fields. Indeed , the packing of molecules into colloidal or supracolloidal particles emerges as a smart solution to build an infinite variety of reversible systems with predictable properties. In this respect , the molecular building blocks are called `` tectons '' whereas `` colloidal tectonics '' describes the spontaneous formation of ( supra) colloidal structures using tectonic subunits. As a consequence , a bottom-up edification is allowed from tectons into ( supra) colloidal particles with higher degrees of organization ( Graphical Abstract). These ( supra) colloidal systems can be very useful to obtain catalysts with tunable amphiphilic properties. In this perspective , an overview of colloidal tectonics concept is presented as well as its use for the design of new , smart , and flexible catalytic systems. Finally , the advantages of these catalytic devices are discussed and the perspective of future developments is addressed especially in the context of `` green chemistry. ''
