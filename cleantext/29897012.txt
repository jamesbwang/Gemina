  Meniscus injuries are very common in the knee joint. Treating a damaged meniscus continues to be a scientific challenge in sport medicine because of its poor self-healing potential and few clinical therapeutic options. Tissue engineering strategies are very promising solutions for repairing and regenerating a damaged meniscus. Meniscus is exposed to a complex biomechanical microenvironment , and it plays a crucial role in meniscal development , growth , and repairing. Over the past decades , increasing attention has been focused on the use of biomechanical stimulus to enhance biomechanical properties of the engineered meniscus. Further understanding the influence of mechanical stimulation on cell proliferation and differentiation , metabolism , relevant gene expression , and pro/anti-inflammatory responses may be beneficial to enhance meniscal repair and regeneration. On the one hand , this review describes some basic information about meniscus; on the other hand , we sum up the various biomechanical stimulus based strategies applied in meniscus tissue engineering and how these factors affect meniscal regeneration. We hope this review will provide researchers with inspiration on tissue engineering strategies for meniscus regeneration in the future.
