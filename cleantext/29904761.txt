  An antiproliferative platinum ( ii)- terpyridine complex bearing two piperidine substituents at positions 2 and 2 ' ( compound 1 , hereafter) interacts non-covalently with DNA and induces cell death through necrosis<symptom> , i.e. a mode of action that is distinct from that exhibited by cisplatin ( Suntharalingam , et al. , Metallomics , 2013 , 5 , 514). Here , the interaction between this Pt compound and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme ( HEWL) was studied by both electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI MS) and X-ray crystallography. The ESI MS data collected after 24 h protein incubation with compound 1 at two different pH values offer evidence that the metal complex degrades upon reaction with HEWL , forming adducts with 1: 1 , 2: 1 and 3: 1 Pt/protein ratios. Two different X-ray structures of Pt-protein adducts , obtained by the reaction of HEWL with the Pt compound under different experimental conditions and incubation times , are then reported. An unexpected extensive platination of the protein is clearly observed: Pt containing fragments bind close to the NZ atom of Lys1 and OE1 atom of Glu7 , NE2 atom of His15 and NH1 atom of Arg14 , ND1 atom of His15 , NZ atom of Lys96 , NZ atom of Lys97 and ND1 atom of Asn93 , NZ atom of Lys13 and the C-terminal carboxylate , and the N-terminal amine. An additional binding site was observed close to the NZ atom of Lys33. These results suggest that both N- and C-terminal tails , as well as Lys side chains , have to be considered as potential binding sites of Pt-containing drugs. The peculiar reactivity of compound 1 with biological macromolecules could play a role in its mode of action.
