  In thin magnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , a periodic `` up-down '' stripe-domain structure can be originated at remanence , on a mesoscopic scale ( ~ 100 nm) comparable with film thickness , by the competition between short-range exchange coupling and long-range dipolar interaction. However , translational order is perturbed because magnetic edge dislocations are spontaneously nucleated. Such topological defects play an important role in magnetic films since they promote the in-plane magnetization reversal of stripes and , in superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids , the creation of superconducting vortex clusters. Combining magnetic force microscopy experiments and micromagnetic simulations , we investigated the motion of two classes of magnetic edge dislocations , randomly distributed in an ( Formula: see text)- implanted Fe film. They were found to move in opposite directions along straight trajectories parallel to the stripes axis , when driven by a moderate dc magnetic field. Using the approximate Thiele equation , analytical expressions for the forces acting on such magnetic defects and a microscopic explanation for the direction of their motion could be obtained. Straight trajectories are related to the presence of a periodic stripe domain pattern , which imposes the gyrotropic force to vanish even if a nonzero , half-integer topological charge is carried by the defects in some layers across the film thickness.
