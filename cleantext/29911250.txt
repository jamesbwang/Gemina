  Electromyography ( EMG) in a bio-driven system is used as a control signal , for driving a hand prosthesis or other wearable assistive devices. Processing to get informative drive signals involves three main modules: preprocessing , dimensionality reduction , and classification. This paper proposes a system for classifying a six-channel EMG signal from 14 finger movements. A feature vector of 66 elements was determined from the six-channel EMG signal for each finger movement. Subsequently , various feature extraction techniques and classifiers were tested and evaluated. We compared the performance of six feature extraction techniques , namely principal component analysis ( PCA) , linear discriminant analysis ( LDA) , uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis ( ULDA) , orthogonal fuzzy neighborhood discriminant analysis ( OFNDA) , spectral regression linear discriminant analysis ( SRLDA) , and spectral regression extreme learning machine ( SRELM). In addition , we also evaluated the performance of seven classifiers consisting of support vector machine ( SVM) , linear classifier ( LC) , naive Bayes ( NB) , k-nearest neighbors ( KNN) , radial basis function extreme learning machine ( RBF-ELM) , adaptive wavelet extreme learning machine ( AW-ELM) , and neural network ( NN). The results showed that the combination of SRELM as the feature extraction technique and NN as the classifier yielded the best classification accuracy of 99 % , which was significantly higher than those from the other combinations tested.
