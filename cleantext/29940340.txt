  A series of new 1,2,3-triazole linked coumarinopyrazole conjugates 4a-e and 5a-e have been synthesized via the Copper ( I)- catalysed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition ( CuAAC). Going through the reaction of compound 2 with the 3-propargyl bromide gave a mixture of propargylated regioisomers 3 + 3 ' used as a dipolarophile to access to triazoles 4a-e and 5a-e. The structures of the prepared cycloadducts were determined by
