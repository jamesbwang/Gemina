  To create a multivariable model to predict early cognitive decline among de novo patients with Parkinson 's disease , using brief , inexpensive assessments that are easily incorporated into clinical flow. Data for 351 drug-na√Øve patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease were obtained from the Parkinson 's Progression Markers Initiative. Baseline demographic , disease history , motor , and non-motor features were considered as candidate predictors. Best subsets selection was used to determine the multivariable baseline symptom profile that most accurately predicted individual cognitive decline within three years. Eleven per cent of the sample experienced cognitive decline. The final logistic regression model predicting decline included five baseline variables: verbal memory retention , right-sided bradykinesia<symptom> , years of education , subjective report of cognitive impairment , and REM behavior disorder. Model discrimination was good ( optimism-adjusted concordance index = .749). The associated nomogram provides a tool to determine individual patient risk of meaningful cognitive change in the early stages of the disease. Through the consideration of easily-implemented or routinely-gathered assessments , we have identified a multidimensional baseline profile and created a convenient , inexpensive tool to predict cognitive decline in the earliest stages of Parkinson 's disease. The use of this tool would generate prediction at the individual level , allowing clinicians to tailor medical management for each patient and identify at-risk patients for clinical trials aimed at disease modifying therapies.
