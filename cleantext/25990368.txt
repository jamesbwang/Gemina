  Increased expression of integrin β1 has been reported to correlate with progression and therapy resistance in many types of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of integrin β1 on the invasion and radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells. The expression of integrin β1 in the tumor specimens of laryngeal cancer patients was assessed by immunohistochemical assays. The invasion ability of laryngeal cancer cells was detected by transwell and wound<disease> healing assays. The radiosensitivity of laryngeal cancer cells was evaluated by flow cytometry and colony formation assays. High expression of integrin β1 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis , TNM stage and poor clinical outcomes ( all Integrin β1 has potential as a therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of laryngeal cancer.
