  Bevacizumab is approved for use in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic/recurrent cervical cancer ( CC) , with increased survival/response rates. However , use of bevacizumab is not always feasible or safe. The purpose of this study was to identify the percentage of metastatic/recurrent CC patients at our institution who would have been eligible to receive bevacizumab. A retrospective study was conducted to identify metastatic/recurrent CC patients treated at UFHealth between 2006 and 2016. Chart review was performed to determine if the patient met bevacizumab eligibility criteria. In total , 79 patients with metastatic/recurrent CC were identified; 85.5 % would have been ineligible to receive bevacizumab , and 14.5 % would have been eligible. The most common reason for exclusion was active bleeding ( 68.4 %); 94 % of which was vaginal. In all , 27.6 % would be excluded due to poor renal function , and 23.7 % due to poor performance status ( PS). Despite improved survival , only 14.5 % of metastatic/recurrent CC patients treated over a 10-year period would have been eligible to receive bevacizumab. Most patients would have been excluded due to active bleeding , most commonly vaginal bleeding , a common complication from their disease. Identifying novel therapies for metastatic/recurrent CC patients with improved safety profiles that would allow for their use in this challenging population is critical.
