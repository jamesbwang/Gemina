  This study presents the results of 25 consecutive patients and evaluates the success of reverse sural fasciocuteneous flap ( RSFF) on coverage of the foot and ankle region. A total of 25 patients with soft tissue defects in the lower leg , foot , or ankle were treated with RSFF , from January 2010 to January 2017. In the evaluation of patients , the form prepared by the clinic was used and the following data were collected: age , follow-up , gender , etiology , defect size , complications , and patient satisfaction rates. Mean follow up time was 18 months. In all patients , the defects were fully covered. Three patients developed partial necrosis<symptom> due to venous congestion<symptom>. There was no complete flap loss in any of the patients. Patient satisfaction was excellent in all cases. RSFF is quick , versatile , and easy to apply; it also provides safe soft tissue coverage , requires no microvascular repair , and provides an alternative to microsurgical reconstruction.
