  Non-hibernating pikas collect winter food reserves and store them in hay piles. Individualization of alarm calls might allow discrimination between colony members and conspecifics trying to steal food items from a colony pile. We investigated vocal posture<symptom> , vocal tract length , and individual acoustic variation of alarm calls , emitted by wild-living Altai pikas Ochotona alpina toward a researcher. Recording started when a pika started calling and lasted as long as possible. The alarm call series of 442 individual callers from different colonies consisted of discrete short ( 0.073-0.157 s) , high-frequency ( 7.31-15.46 kHz) , and frequency-modulated calls separated by irregular intervals. Analysis of 442 discrete calls , the second of each series , revealed that 44.34 % calls lacked nonlinear phenomena , in 7.02 % nonlinear phenomena covered less than half of call duration , and in 48.64 % nonlinear phenomena covered more than half of call duration. Peak frequencies varied among individuals but always fitted one of three maxima corresponding to the vocal tract resonance frequencies ( formants) calculated for an estimated 45-mm oral vocal tract. Discriminant analysis using variables of 8 calls per series of 36 different callers , each from a different colony , correctly assigned over 90 % of the calls to individuals. Consequently , Altai pika alarm calls are individualistic and nonlinear phenomena might further increase this acoustic individualization. Additionally , video analysis revealed a call-synchronous , very fast ( 0.13-0.23 s) folding , depression<symptom> , and subsequent re-expansion of the pinna confirming an earlier report of this behavior that apparently contributes to protecting the hearing apparatus from damage by the self-generated high-intensity alarm calls.
