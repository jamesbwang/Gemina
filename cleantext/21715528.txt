  Efforts to promote the health and well-being of military veterans have been criticised for being inadequately informed of veterans ' most pressing needs as they separate from military service , as well as the programmes that are most likely to meet these needs. The current article summarises limitations of the current literature and introduces The Veterans Metrics Initiative ( TVMI) study , a longitudinal assessment of US veterans ' well-being and programme use in the first three years after they separate from military service. Veterans were assessed within 3 months of military separation and will complete five additional assessments at 6-month intervals during the subsequent period. The TVMI study cohort consists of a national sample of 9566 newly separated US veterans that were recruited in the fall of 2016. The TVMI sample includes representation from all branches of service , men and women , and officers and enlisted personnel. Although representative of the larger population on many characteristics , differential response rates were observed for some subgroups , necessitating the development of non-response bias weights. Comparisons between unweighed and weighted results suggest that the weighting procedure adequately adjusts for observed differences. Analyses are under way to examine veterans ' well-being and programme use in the period following separation after military service , as well as factors associated with poor outcomes. We have also begun to decompose programmes into their core components to facilitate examination of how these components relate to well-being. Once our third data collection is complete , we will examine factors related to different patterns of readjustment over time.
