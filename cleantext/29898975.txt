  In November 2015 , Medtronic announced the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval for the use of deep brain stimulation ( DBS) therapy in people with Parkinson disease ( PD) `` of at least 4 years duration and with recent onset motor complications , or motor complications of longer-standing duration that are not adequately controlled with medication. '' The approval was based on data from the EARLYSTIM clinical trial , a randomized , prospective , multicenter , parallel-group clinical trial in Germany and France involving 251 patients with PD. While others have reviewed the application of DBS earlier in the disease course and the results from EARLYSTIM , we focus on the conceptual , scientific , clinical , ethical , and policy issues that arise regarding the recent FDA approval.
