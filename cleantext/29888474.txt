  Each region of the world has its own methods , protocols , instruments and procedures to brew coffee. The final result in the cup is strongly affected by the extraction method , and many papers have focused on this subject. However , few studies have looked at slow , cold extraction methods , despite their popularity among baristas. Therefore , the aim of this study was to characterize and to compare two cold extraction methods: cold brew and cold drip. Physical and chemical analyses were used to describe coffee beverages in terms of pH , total solids , refractive index , density and viscosity. Caffeine and cinnamic acids were quantified using HPLC/DAD and HPLC/MS. A sensory evaluation included aroma , flavor and textural attributes. Significant differences were found in the chemical and physical parameters both between and within the two methods , as a function of the extraction temperature and contact time. Similarly , the sensory evaluation found differences in flavor profiles , measured in terms of bitterness , sweetness , sourness and global intensity. This article is protected by copyright.
