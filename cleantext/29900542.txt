  The detection of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF)- specific IgG oligoclonal bands ( OCB) by isoelectric focusing ( IEF) is widely used to help diagnose inflammatory neurological disorders ( IND) , including multiple sclerosis. However , the quantification of free light chains ( FLC) is increasingly evaluated as a surrogate method to determine the presence of an intrathecal inflammatory process. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of kappa ( κ) FLC measurement in comparison with OCB detection by IEF. We measured serum and CSF κFLCs by turbidimetry using the SPA The κFLC index was significantly increased in OCB-positive MS and IND patients versus OCB-negative patients. Its performance was relatively comparable to that of IEF for MS diagnosis. When using a κFLC index cutoff value of 6.29 , sensitivity increased from 61.2 % to 75.7 % in comparison with IEF for diagnosing IND ( P = .0051) , with a slightly lower non-statistically significant specificity ( 82.1 % vs 100 %). When considering both OCB status positivity or a κFLC index superior to 6.29 to diagnose IND status , sensitivity raised to 80.6 % ( P < .05) with an equal specificity. Our results demonstrate that the κFLC index does not discriminate MS from other IND patients , but is a reliable technique to detect intrathecal inflammation<symptom>. However , κFLC quantification should probably be considered as a complementary method , rather than a substitute , to OCB detection.
