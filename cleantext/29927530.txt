  With slowly increasing survival rates in pancreatic cancer and international consensus guidelines recommending surgical resection of premalignant lesions<symptom> , survival post-pancreatic resection is increasing. With longer survival time , the significant comorbidities of such major surgery have far-reaching effects on the nutrition status of the survivor of pancreatic cancer. This review describes the many nutrition-related side effects of pancreatic surgery , including the development of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency , micronutrient deficiencies , diabetes , fatty liver , and metabolic bone disease. Beyond causing additional medical problems , each of these can have significant effects on quality of life and functional status. The potential mechanisms , diagnosis criteria , and potential treatments of these conditions are described. Overall , little literature exists to fully describe the effects of these comorbidities , and even less is able to guide effective treatments for this population. Clinicians caring for these patients should begin incorporating goals for promotion of long-term health and reduction of these known and reported comorbidities in patients who have undergone pancreatic surgery. Treatment plans in this population remain understudied , and clinicians may need to consider recommendations for similar disease states when developing interventions for these patients.
