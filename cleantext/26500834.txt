  The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of relationship with parents , emotion regulation , and callous-unemotional traits with Internet addiction in a community sample of adolescents. Self-report measures of relationship with parents ( both mothers and fathers) , emotion regulation ( in its two dimensions: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) , callous- unemotional traits ( in its three dimensions: callousness , uncaring , and unemotional) , and Internet addiction were completed by 743 adolescents aged 10 to 21 years. Results showed that a low perceived maternal availability , high cognitive reappraisal , and high callousness appeared to be predictors of Internet addiction. The implications of these findings are then discussed.
