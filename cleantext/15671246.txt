  Fluoxetine ( FLX) is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) antidepressants , which could be used to relieve depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> among AD patients. This study was designed to search for new mechanisms by which fluoxetine could activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and reduce amyloidosis in AD brain. Fluoxetine was administered via intragastric injection to APP/tau/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer 's disease ( 3 × Tg-AD) mice for 4 months. In the hippocampus of AD mouse model , there could be observed neuronal apoptosis , as well as an increase in Aβ ( amyloid-β) production. Moreover , there is a strong association between down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the alteration of AD pathology. The activity of protein phosphatases of type 2A ( PP2A) could be significantly enhanced by the treatment of fluoxetine. The activation of PP2A , caused by fluoxetine , could then play a positive role in raising the level of active β-catenin , and deliver a negative impact in GSK3β activity in the hippocampal tissue. Both the changes mentioned above would lead to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Meanwhile , fluoxetine treatment would reduce APP cleavage and Aβ generation. It could also prevent apoptosis in 3 × Tg-AD primary neuronal cell , and have protective effects on neuron synapse. These findings imply that Wnt/β-catenin signaling could be a potential target outcome for AD prevention , and fluoxetine has the potential to be a promising drug in both AD prevention and treatment.
