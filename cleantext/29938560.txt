  Although it has been well documented that the HIV<pathogen> infection experience can be problematic for those affected , the experiences and perceptions of living with HIV<pathogen> among married males in Cambodia have not yet been examined until now. This study 's purpose was to describe the revelations , emotions , reactions , and adjustments to HIV<pathogen> diagnosis among infected Cambodian males in seroconcordant heterosexual relationship. Fifteen qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 HIV-positive males using unstructured , open-ended questions and in the local Khmer language. Conventional content analysis method was employed for analyzing data. After analysis , four main categories were developed: knowledge of HIV-positive status; realization of self-deeds; discouraging news for both partners; and comparative improvement of life. Participants reported the appearance of physical symptoms as the only reason for pursuing HIV<pathogen> testing. Feelings ranged from sadness and guilt to acceptance of HIV<pathogen> infection in their lives. The participants ' wives expressed anger and worry about being infected by their husbands. However , sufficient inspiration from medical personnel and peer groups , as well as a shared concern for their children , helped couples adjust to their dyadic relationship. The study results highlight the link between individual and couple experiences and emotions post-infection , with implications for designing and implementing coping interventions for this population. The findings of this study have public health implications in the design of couple-based intervention and counseling programs for HIV<pathogen> prevention and treatment with the input of the HIV-positive individuals ' voices.
