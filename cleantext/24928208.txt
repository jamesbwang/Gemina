  Disturbed sleep is strongly correlated with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. The aim of this study was to examine the association between sleep disturbance and incident joint<symptom> pain<symptom> focusing on neuropathic-like pain symptoms<symptom>. A total of 423 individuals who had undergone total joint replacement ( TJR) for osteoarthritis were assessed at the mean time of 3.6 years post-surgery and again at 5.9 years post-TJR , using the Medical Outcomes Survey sleep subscale , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC) , and painDETECT questionnaire instruments. Cox hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were computed adjusting for age , body mass index , sex , and use of hypnotic and analgesic medication. The presence of neuropathic pain symptoms<symptom> predicted incidence of disturbed sleep after adjustment for covariates and pain severity ( adjusted HR ( aHR) 2.01 , 95 % CI: 1.00-4.10; These data suggest a causal bidirectional link between sleep disturbance and joint<symptom> pain<symptom> with neuropathic features but not with other types of
