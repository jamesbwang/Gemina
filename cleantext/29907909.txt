  Although the current glucocorticoids ( GCs) treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is effective to a certain extent , the difference in therapeutic effect between patients is still a widespread problem. Some patients can have repeated attacks that greatly diminish their quality of life. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between HSP90AA2 polymorphisms and disease susceptibility , GCs efficacy and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) in Chinese SLE patients. A case-control study was performed in 470 SLE patients and 470 normal controls. Then , 444 patients in the case group were followed up for 12 weeks to observe efficacy of GCs and improvement of HRQoL. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of HSP90AA2 were selected for genotyping: rs1826330 and rs6484340. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The minor T allele of rs1826330 and the TT haplotype formed by rs1826330 and rs6484340 showed associations with decreased SLE risk ( T allele: P
