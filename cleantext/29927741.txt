  Research into sensory substitution systems has expanded , as alternative senses are utilized in real-time to afford object recognition or spatial understanding. Tactile stimulation has long shown promise as a communicatory strategy when applied unobtrusively to the redundant surface areas of the skin. Here , a novel belt , integrating a matrix of macro fiber composites , is purposed to deliver tactile stimuli to the abdomen. The design and development of the belt is presented and a systematic experimental study is conducted to analyze the impact of frequency and duty cycle. The belt is a beta precursor to a soft haptic feedback device that will enable situational awareness and obstacle avoidance through the localization of tactile stimulation relative to a body-centric frame of reference in a local environment.
