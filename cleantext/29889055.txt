  Shoulder internal rotation angular velocity at the time of ball release is a crucial factor deciding the ball velocity in throwing. Even though there are some studies conducted regarding the effectiveness of complex training on the lower limb , the researchers has not given much attention to the upper limb. To investigate the efficacy of a complex training program combining plyometric and weight training on the angular velocity of shoulder with a program composed of only plyometric training or only weight training. It was a pre-test- post-test experimental study. Thirty healthy male collegiate basketball players were randomly divided into three groups: Plyometric training group ( n = 10) , weight training group ( n = 10) , complex training group which includes both plyometric training and weight training ( n = 10). The training was given for six weeks with a frequency of two days per week. Subjects were measured for angular velocity of shoulder before and after the training period by using Biodex upper body cycle. All the three groups were compared by using one way ANOVA. Post-hoc fisher least significant difference ( LSD) test was used to find out the difference between groups. All the groups showed a significant gain in angular velocity after the six-week training period ( p < 0.05). However , the improvement attained in complex training group were significantly greater than other training groups ( p < 0.05). The study concluded that a combination of plyometric and weight training ( complex training) can improve the angular velocity of shoulder in male collegiate basketball players more than plyometric or weight training alone.
