  Non-urgent patients are one of the important causes of emergency department ( ED) overcrowding. In this study , it is aimed to identify the characteristics of these patients and the reasons why they prefer the ED. This study was conducted during regular office hours. The characteristics of non-urgent patients , their complaints , the frequency of visits to family physicians ( FPs) , the frequency of using the Central Hospital Appointment System ( CHAS) and reasons for preferring the ED were questioned by a questionnaire. This study was conducted on 624 patients. Among them , 326 ( 52.2 %) were male. The mean age was 38.4 years ( SD: 14.4). It was identified that 80.3 % of the patients had no chronic<disease> disease<disease> and that 97.4 % had health insurance. The most common complaints at presentation were musculoskeletal system pain ( 25.2 %) and upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> symptoms ( 19.7 %). It was identified that 28.7 % of the patients did not prefer to visit their FPs and that 48.6 % did not use the CHAS. The reasons of preferring ED were as follows: rapid physical examination ( 36.4 %) , not being able to book an earlier appointment at alternative health facilities ( 30.9 %) , being close to the facility ( 12.8 %) and being at the hospital for a different reason ( 12.3 %). Among the patients , 20.2 % did not express any particular reason. Non-urgent patients who admitted to the ED are mostly middle-aged patients with no chronic<disease> disease<disease>. They usually visit the ED for preventable reasons. The use of alternative health facilities and CHAS should be encouraged.
