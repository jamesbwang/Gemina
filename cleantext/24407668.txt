  The anticorrosion effect of thiazolyl blue ( MTT) for copper in 3 % NaCl at 298 K was researched by electrochemical methods , scanning electron-microscopy ( SEM) , and atomic force microscopy ( AFM). The results reveal that MTT can protect copper efficiently , with a maximum efficiency of 95.7 %. The corrosion inhibition mechanism was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , Fourier transform infrared spectral ( FT-IR) , and theoretical calculation. The results suggest that the MTT molecules are adsorbed on metal surface forming a hydrophobic protective film to prevent copper corrosion. It also indicates that the MTT and copper form covalent bonds. The molecular dynamic simulation further gives the evidence for adsorption. The adsorption isotherm studies demonstrate that a spontaneous , mixed physical and chemical adsorption occurs , which obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The present research can help us better understand the corrosion inhibition process and improve it.
