  Orchiopexy for congenital cryptorchid testes is recommended between 1/2 and 1 year of age to preserve testicular germ cell maturation. Early operation is not enough to preserve fertility in 22 and 36 % of cases. Aim of this study was to set up a protocol for optional adjuvant hormonal therapy after orchiopexy and thereafter cryopreservation of testicular biopsies from infants with bilateral cryptorchidism and high infertility<symptom> risk. We included 17 boys with bilateral cryptorchidism , normal FSH , and impaired germ cell number per tubular transverse section ( G/T) in testicular biopsies at orchiopexy , 7 months to 3 1/2 years old. Postoperatively , optional adjuvant LHRH ( kryptocur Two out of five kryptorcur Based on literature and the present results , we recommend adjuvant LHRH treatment to boys with cryptorchidism and insufficient genuine gonadotropin stimulation at time of surgery , as these patients have high infertility<symptom> risk. Cryopreservation should be an option in case of treatment failure of adjuvant LHRH. However , to avoid repeat surgery with biopsy , some parents may choose biopsy for cryopreservation at time of the initial bilateral orchiopexy , well informed that the procedure may only be truly indicated in 22 and 36 % of the cases.
