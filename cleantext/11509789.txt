  The application of laparoscopic surgery via the vagina has been introduced at the beginning of this millennium. Here , we report a case of transvaginal extraction of a laparoscopic hepatectomy specimen. An exophytic liver mass originated from segment VI in a 24-year-old female was excised with laparoscopic technique using four trocars ( 0.5-1.2 cm sizes). The specimen ( 11 Ã— 8.5 cm) was removed transvaginally instead of an abdominal incision. To the best of our knowledge , only six similar cases have been previously reported , with a patient age range of 32-74 years. Our case , due to younger age , had high cosmetic expectations. Specific to this case , we aimed a better aesthetic outcomes and better convalescence period and , we achieved these objectives. We believe that patient selection and experience on natural orifice specimen extraction were the keys to the success of the operation. We shared this technique with a video presentation.
