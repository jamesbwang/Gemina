  Regular sediment inputs are required for deltas to maintain their surface elevation relative to sea level , which is important for avoiding salinization , erosion , and flooding. However , fluvial sediment inputs to deltas are being threatened by changes in upstream catchments due to climate and land use change and , particularly , reservoir construction. In this research , the global hydrogeomorphic model WBMsed is used to project and contrast ` pristine ' ( no anthropogenic impacts) and ` recent ' historical fluvial sediment delivery to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna , Mahanadi , and Volta deltas. Additionally , 12 potential future scenarios of environmental change comprising combinations of four climate and three socioeconomic pathways , combined with a single construction timeline for future reservoirs , were simulated and analysed. The simulations of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta showed a large decrease in sediment flux over time , regardless of future scenario , from 669 Mt/a in a ` pristine ' world , through 566 Mt/a in the ` recent ' past , to 79-92 Mt/a by the end of the 21st century across the scenarios ( total average decline of 88 %). In contrast , for the Mahanadi delta the simulated sediment delivery increased between the ` pristine ' and ` recent ' past from 23 Mt/a to 40 Mt/a ( +77 %) , and then decreased to 7-25 Mt/a by the end of the 21st century. The Volta delta shows a large decrease in sediment delivery historically , from 8 to 0.3 Mt/a ( 96 %) between the ` pristine ' and ` recent ' past , however over the 21st century the sediment flux changes little and is predicted to vary between 0.2 and 0.4 Mt/a dependent on scenario. For the Volta delta , catchment management short of removing or re-engineering the Volta dam would have little effect , however without careful management of the upstream catchments these deltas may be unable to maintain their current elevation relative to sea level , suggesting increasing salinization , erosion , flood hazards , and adaptation demands.
