  Posaconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole widely used to prevent and treat invasive mycoses in adults. Since it received marketing authorization more than a decade ago , many authors have reported on its off-label use in pediatric patients , despite the fact that the pharmacokinetics , safety , and efficacy in children have not been extensively investigated. Areas covered: We reviewed pediatric studies published between 2010 and 2017 describing the prophylactic and therapeutic use of posaconazole , with special attention to the correlation between oral dose , plasma levels , safety , and effectiveness. We found that posaconazole is well tolerated in children with a low incidence of adverse effects. As in adults , posaconazole absorption is hampered by factors such as high gastric pH , mucositis , and concomitant medications , whereas there is no direct correlation between the daily dose and the trough plasma concentration due to saturable absorption. Expert Commentary: Posaconazole has proved safe and effective in preventing and treating fungal infections in immunocompromised children. A body-weight-based dosing regimen and therapeutic drug monitoring are recommended to optimize posaconazole plasma concentration. Absorption can be improved by high-fat foods or avoiding the use of proton-pump inhibitors. Further pediatric studies are needed especially for the new formulations of posaconazole ( vials and tablets).
