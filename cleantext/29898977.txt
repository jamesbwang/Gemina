  Stomatal movement , critical for photobiosynthesis , respiration<symptom> , and stress responses , is regulated by many factors , among which abscisic acid ( ABA) is critical. Early events of ABA signaling involve Ca2 + influx and an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ( ( Ca2 +) cyt). Positive regulators of this process have been extensively studied , whereas negative regulators are obscure. ABA-induced stomatal closure involves K + flux and vacuolar convolution. How these processes are connected with Ca2 + is not fully understood. We report that pat10-1 , a null mutant of Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana) PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 ( PAT10) , is hypersensitive to ABA-induced stomatal closure and vacuolar convolution. A similar phenotype was observed in cbl2; cbl3 , the double mutant of CBL2 and CBL3 , whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Functional loss of the PAT10-CBL2/ CBL3 system resulted in enhanced Ca2 + influx and ( Ca2 +) cyt elevation. Promoting vacuolar K + accumulation by overexpressing NHX2 suppressed ABA-hypersensitive stomatal closure and vacuolar convolution of the mutants , suggesting that PAT10-CBL2/ CBL3 positively mediates vacuolar K + accumulation. We have identified CBL-interacting protein kinases ( CIPKs) that mediate CBL2/CBL3 signaling during ABA-induced stomatal movement. Functional loss of the PAT10-CBL2/ 3-CIPK9/ 17 system in guard cells enhanced drought tolerance. We propose that the tonoplast CBL-CIPK complexes form a signaling module that negatively regulates ABA signaling during stomatal movement.
