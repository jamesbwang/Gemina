  Parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics ( PaCS-MD) is a conformational sampling method for generating transition pathways between a given reactant and a product. PaCS-MD repeats the following two steps: ( 1) selections of initial structures relevant to transitions and ( 2) their conformational resampling. When selecting the initial structures , several measures are utilized to identify their potential to undergo transitions. In the present study , low-resolution structural data obtained from small angle scattering ( SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy ( EM) are adopted as the measures in PaCS-MD to promote the conformational transitions of proteins , which is defined as SAXS-/ EM-driven targeted PaCS-MD. By selecting the essential structures that have high correlations with the low-resolution structural data , the SAXS-/ EM-driven targeted PaCS-MD identifies a set of transition pathways between the reactant and the product. As a demonstration , the present method successfully predicted the open-closed transition pathway of the lysine- , arginine- , ornithine-binding protein with a ns-order simulation time , indicating that the data-driven PaCS-MD simulation might work to promote the conformational transitions of proteins efficiently.
