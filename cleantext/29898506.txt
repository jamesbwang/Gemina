  Soil erosion , every year imposes extensive damages to human beings by means of reducing soil productivity and filling reservoirs from sedimentation in Ghaemshahr Basin in Mazandaran Province , ( Iran); therefore , identifying prone areas to soil erosion for preventive measures is essential in this basin. In this research , erodibility prioritization of sub-watersheds of Ghaemshahr Basin has done using morphometric parameters analysis and different multi-criteria decision making ( MCDM) models such as simple additive weighing ( SAW) , VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje ( VIKOR) , technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution ( TOPSIS) , and compound factor ( CF). For this purpose , Advanced Space Thermal Emission Radiometer ( ASTER) , a Digital Elevation Model ( DEM) with spatial resolution of 30m used for extraction and analysis of 23 morphometric parameters including basic , linear , shape , and landscape. For validation of the MCDM methods , the indices of percentage of changes and intensity of changes were used. The results of prioritization of sub-watersheds indicated that in TOPSIS and CF models , sub-watershed 30 with 0 and 13.33 scores are located in first rank , respectively , which is known as the most prone sub-watersheds to erosion. Also , results showed that sub-watersheds in terms of susceptibility to erosion , in CF model has an one category namely Low; meanwhile , in TOPSIS and VIKOR models show four classes including low , moderate , high , and very high. In contrast , for SAW model there are three classes of moderate , high , and very high susceptibility. In general , the results showed that morphometric parameters have high efficiency in identification of erosion-prone areas and also VIKOR method has higher predictive accuracy than TOPSIS , SAW , and CF models.
