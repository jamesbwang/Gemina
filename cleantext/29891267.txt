  Cubital tunnel syndrome<disease> ( CuTS) is the second most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. There are considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with treating patients after a failed primary procedure for CuTS. Distinguishing cases of recurrence versus persistence and identifying concomitant pathology can guide treatment. Conditions that mimic CuTS must be carefully ruled out and coexisting dysfunction of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve needs to be addressed. Results of revision procedures are not as reliable as primary procedures for CuTS; however , improvements in pain and paresthesias are noted in approximately 75 % of patients. Nerve wraps represent a promising adjuvant treatment option , but long-term outcome data are lacking. External neurolysis and anterior transposition after failed CuTS procedures are supported by case series; multicenter , prospective randomized trials are needed to guide treatment further and improve outcomes.
