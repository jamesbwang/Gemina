  As emerging noble metal-free co-catalysts , transition metal phosphides have been employed to improve photocatalytic H2 production activity. Herein , the metallicity of CoP , as a representative phosphide , and the Schottky effect between CoP and g-C3N4 are confirmed via theoretical calculations. Then , a 2D/2D structure is designed to enlarge the Schottky effect between the interfaces , for which the apparent quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic H2 evolution is 2.1 times that of corresponding 0D/2D heterojunctions. The morphology , microstructure , chemical composition , and physical nature of pristine CoP , g-C3N4 , and the composites are characterized in order to investigate the dynamic behavior of photo-induced charge carriers between CoP and g-C3N4. Based on the measurements , it is proposed that the efficient electron collecting effect of CoP can be attributed to the superior interfacial contact and Schottky junction between the CoP and g-C3N4 interfaces. Furthermore , the excellent electrical conductivity and low overpotential of CoP make water reduction easier. This work demonstrates that the construction of a 2D/2D structure based on a suitable Fermi level is crucial for enhancing the Schottky effect of transition metal phosphides.
