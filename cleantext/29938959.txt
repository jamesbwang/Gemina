  Liver cancer is a common type of malignant tumor in digestive system. At present , computed tomography ( CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Segmentation of tumor lesions<symptom> based on CT is thus critical in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Due to the limitations of manual segmentation , such as inefficiency and subjectivity , the automatic and accurate segmentation based on advanced computational techniques is becoming more and more popular. In this review , we summarize the research progress of automatic segmentation of liver cancer lesions<symptom> based on CT scans. By comparing and analyzing the results of experiments , this review evaluate various methods objectively , so that researchers in related fields can better understand the current research progress of liver cancer segmentation based on CT scans.
