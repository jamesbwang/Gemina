  Aortopulmonary window ( APW) is rare a congenital heart disease accounting for 0.1 % -0.2 % of all congenital heart defects. The 35 % of the APW has been associated with wide variety of other structural heart diseases such as ventricular septal defect , persistent ductus arteriosus , arch anomalies and coronary artery anomalies. To the best of our knowledge , only six cases of APW with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect has been described in the literature. It resembles the type 1 truncus arteriosus , and differentiation from this condition is important prior to surgical correction. We present a case of 14-year-old girl child; she was diagnosed with APW with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and D transposition of great arteries with the help of echocardiography , cardiac catheterisation and cardiac CT..
