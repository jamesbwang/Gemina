  Painful conditions and sleep disturbances are major public health problems worldwide and one directly affects the other. Sleep loss increases pain prevalence and severity; while pain disturbs sleep. However , the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we asked whether chronic sleep restriction for 6 h daily progressively increases pain sensitivity and if this increase is reversed after two days of free sleep. Also , whether the pronociceptive effect of chronic sleep restriction depends on the periaqueductal grey and on the nucleus accumbens , two key regions involved in the modulation of pain and sleep-wake cycle. We showed that sleep restriction induces a pronociceptive effect characterized by a significant decrease in the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold in rats. Such effect increases progressively from day 3 to day 12 remaining stable thereafter until day 26. Two consecutive days of free sleep were not enough to reverse the effect , not even to attenuate it. This pronociceptive effect depends on the periaqueductal grey and on the nucleus accumbens , since it was prevented by their excitotoxic lesion<symptom>. Complementarily , chronic sleep restriction significantly increased c-Fos protein expression within the periaqueductal grey and the nucleus accumbens and this correlates with the intensity of the pronociceptive effect , suggesting that the greater the neural activity in this regions , the greater the effect. These findings may contribute not only to understand why painful conditions are more prevalent and severe among people who sleep poorly , but also to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent this , increasing the effectiveness of pain management in this population.
