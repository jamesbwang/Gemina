  Biomolecular aggregation is omnipresent in nature and important for metabolic processes or in medical treatment; however , the phenomenon is rather difficult to predict or understand on the basis of computational models. Recently , we found that electronic circular dichroism ( ECD) spectroscopy and closely related resonance Raman optical activity ( RROA) are extremely sensitive to the aggregation mechanism and structure of the astaxanthin dye. In the present study , molecular dynamics ( MD) and quantum chemical ( QC) computations ( ZIndo/S , TDDFT) are used to link the aggregate structure with ECD spectral shapes. Realistic absorption and ECD intensities were obtained and the simulations reproduced many trends observed experimentally , such as the prevalent sign pattern and dependence of the aggregate structure on the solvent type. The computationally cheaper ZIndo/S method provided results very similar to those obtained by TDDFT. In the future , the accuracy of the combined MD/QC methodology of spectra interpretation should be improved to provide more detailed information on astaxanthin aggregates and similar macromolecular systems.
