  Takotsubo syndrome<disease> ( TTS) is an acute cardiac syndrome<disease> characterized by transient systolic left ventricular dysfunction frequently preceded by stressful events. It typically affects postmenopausal women without angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. We report here an uncommon occurrence of secondary TTS in a male with coronary artery disease after exogenous catecholamine administration and pacemaker implantation. This unexpected case suggests that , in such clinical scenario , a TTS diagnosis might be considered even in unsuspected individuals.
