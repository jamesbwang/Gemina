  Kefir is a natural probiotic compound with a long history of health benefits which can improve wound<disease> healing. This study investigated the regeneration potential of kefir in vitro scratch assay and in vivo burn wound<disease> in rat model. Cytotoxicity of different concentrations of kefir was evaluated by colorimetric methylthiazoltetrazolium assay. A scratch wound<disease> experiment was performed to investigate the ability of kefir in reducing the gap of wounds<disease> in a dose-dependent manner , in vitro. The standardized kefir was incorporated into silver sulfadiazine ( SSD) and applied on burn wounds<disease> in vivo , and was compared with the SSD and negative control groups after 7 , 14 , and 28 days of treatment. The wound<disease> sites were then removed for histopathological and morphometric analyses , assessment of interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) , transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) , dry weight , and hydroxyproline contents. Kefir enhanced proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblast ( HDF) cells and 12.50 , 6.25 , and 3.12 μL/mL concentrations showed better effects on the scratch assay. Kefir resulted in reduction of IL-1β and TGF-β1 expression at day 7 compared to the negative control. Kefir also reduced the expression of IL-1β at days 14 and 28 and stimulated bFGF at day 28. It significantly improved the dry matter and hydroxyproline contents in the burn wounds<disease> Kefir also resulted in enhanced angiogenesis and elevated migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and improved fibrous connective tissue formation in the wound<disease> area. The morphometric results indicated significant global contraction values in the kefir-treated wounds<disease> compared to other groups. Taken together , the findings suggest that kefir has considerable ability to accelerate healing of the burn wounds<disease> Therefore , kefir may be a possible option to improve the outcomes of severe burns.
