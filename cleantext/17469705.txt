  Positional asphyxia is a rare cause of sudden death and a difficult diagnosis , based mostly on the circumstances of the incident , along with particular external and internal findings , frequent in asphyxia ( signs of sudden death). In this report , we are describing one case of adult who was found positioned in a way that led to eventual asphyxiation. The final diagnosis of positional asphyxia was determined after the autopsy. In a head-down position , gravitation and mechanical forces lead to an increased pressure on the diaphragm from the weight of the abdominal organs. Abdominal breathing , and later , chest breathing were hindered by the raised diaphragm and the difference between abdominal and breathing pressures. It is known that death from positional asphyxia can emerge in several ways , such as the external breathing suppression when the victim 's torso is compressed or deformed. Therefore , the current criteria for positional asphyxia are based on the obstruction of normal gas exchange caused by the body position , the impossibility to move to another position , and the exclusion of other causes of death. The forensic medical examination must also be started at the scene of the incident.
