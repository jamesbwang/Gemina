  Environmental toxicants , chemical substances produced or introduced into the environment directly by humans or their activities , can act as teratogens during development that negatively impact health. Long-term ramifications of environmental exposures to sublethal doses of teratogens are often unrecognized and unknown. The round worm , Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> , is an emerging model organism to investigate the long-term impacts of environmental teratogens upon health. This chapter describes a toxicant exposure paradigm integrated with phenotyping assays to screen adult worms , and their progeny , for effects on reproduction , growth and development , behavior , and energy
