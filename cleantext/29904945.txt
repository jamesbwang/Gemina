  Nanostructures can improve batteries capacity and cycle life , especially with sulfides electrodes. In this work , a freestanding flexible electrode consisting of MnS nanoparticles embedded onto carbon nanofibers was prepared by electrospinning. The produced hybrid was used as electrode for lithium ion and sodium ion batteries. MnS nanoparticles have a size of about 5 nm and the particles are evenly distributed in the carbon nanofibers. Carbon nanofibers act as electronic conductor and buffer of the volume change while MnS nanoparticles react through rapid electrochemical reaction. As a Li-ion battery anode , this hybrid electrode exhibits specific capacities from 240 mAh g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1 , up to 600 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1.
