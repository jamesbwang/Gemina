  Timeliness and accuracy in the diagnosis of microbial infections are associated with decreased mortality and reduced length of hospitalization , especially for severe , life-threatening infections. A rapid diagnosis also allows for early streamlining of empirical antimicrobial therapies , thus contributing to limit the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight ( MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry ( MS) for routine identification of microbial pathogens has profoundly influenced microbiological diagnostics , and is progressively replacing biochemical identification methods. Compared to currently used identification methods , MALDI-TOF MS has the advantage of identifying bacteria and yeasts directly from colonies grown on culture plates for primary isolation in a few minutes and with considerable material and labor savings. The reliability and accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS in identification of clinically relevant bacteria and yeasts has been demonstrated by several studies showing that the performance of MALDI-TOF MS is comparable or superior to phenotypic methods currently in use in clinical microbiology laboratories , and can be further improved by database updates and analysis software upgrades. Besides microbial identification from isolated colonies , new perspectives are being explored for MALDI-TOF MS , such as identification of pathogens directly from positive blood cultures , sub-species typing , and detection of drug resistance determinants. In this review , we summarize the state of the art in routine identification of microbial pathogens by MALDI-TOF MS , and highlight recent advancements of this technology in special applications , such as strain typing , assessment of drug susceptibility , and detection of virulence factors.
