  Resting energy expenditure ( REE) is linked to obesity , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes ( T2DM). REE and T2DM are inherited traits. Therefore , we investigated the effect of parental T2DM on REE in normoglycemic subjects. Eighty-seven subjects with parental T2DM and 83 subjects without parental T2DM were matched in age , gender , race , BMI , weight and waist circumference. Subjects underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test; REE was determined by indirect calorimetry and body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Statistical analysis was performed using Student 's t-test , analysis of variance and regression analysis. The mean age was 38.8 ± 11.3 years , 57 % were females and 53 % were African-Americans. The mean BMI was 28.5 ± 6.1 kg/m Compared with subjects without parental diabetes , offspring with parental T2DM had lower REE , which was more pronounced in African-Americans. This metabolic alteration could increase the risk of obesity , insulin resistance and dysglycemia.
