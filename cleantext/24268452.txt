  We aim to diagnose scoliosis using a self contained ultrasound device that does not require significant training to operate. The device knows its angle relative to vertical using an embedded inertial measurement unit , and it estimates its angle relative to a vertebrae using a neural network analysis of its ultrasound images. The composition of those angles defines the angle of a vertebrae from vertical. The maximum difference between vertebrae angles collected from a scan of a spine yields the Cobb angle measure that is used to quantify scoliosis severity.
