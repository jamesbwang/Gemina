  This paper studied the rheological , microstructural and 3D printing characteristics of mashed potatoes ( MP) with gums<symptom> of xanthan ( XG) , guar ( GG) , k-carrageenan ( KG) and k-carrageenan- xanthan gum blend ( KG-XG). Addition of gums<symptom> increased the viscosity , storage modulus ( G ') , and loss modulus ( G ″) of MP except XG. Creep results indicated that self-supporting performance followed decreasing order of KG > KG-XG > GG > contorl > XG. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR) results well explained the behavior by enhancing hydrogen bonding and constraining water molecules ' mobility. KG-MP samples possessed good self-supporting performance but with rough surface and lots of defective points. The parts printed using XG-MP were `` fatter '' than target objects but with a smooth surface structure. This probably because the excellent extrudability ( more fluid-like behavior , tanδ 0.185) but with poor self-supporting ability indicated by lower G ' and greater creep strain 0.88 %. The printed objects using KG-XG-MP possessed a smooth surface structure ( visual appearance) , and good printing precision indicated by the lowest dimensional printing deviation for a printed cuboid shape ( 2.19 % , 2.20 % , 2 % for length , width , height direction , respectively). This was probably because the creaminess effect provided by XG render the printed objects a smooth surface structure , while KG provided MP with sufficient mechanical strength ( proper G ' and load bearing capacity) to be capable of self-supporting.
