  Broadband radio-frequency chirped waveforms ( RFCWs) with dynamically tunable parameters are of fundamental interest to many practical applications. Recently , photonic-assisted solutions have been demonstrated to overcome the bandwidth and flexibility constraints of electronic RFCW generation techniques. However , state-of-the-art photonic techniques involve broadband mode-locked lasers , complex dual laser systems , or fast electronics , increasing significantly the complexity and cost of the resulting platforms. Here we demonstrate a novel concept for photonic generation of broadband RFCWs using a simple architecture , involving a single CW laser , a recirculating frequency-shifting loop , and standard low-frequency electronics. All the chirp waveform parameters , namely sign and value of the chirp rate , central frequency and bandwidth , duration and repetition rate , are easily reconfigurable. We report the generation of mutually coherent RF chirps , with bandwidth above 28 GHz , and time-bandwidth product exceeding 1000 , limited by the available detection bandwidth. The capabilities of this simple platform fulfill the stringent requirements for real-world applications.
