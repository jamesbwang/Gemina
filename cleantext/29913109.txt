  Metal-based nanoparticles ( NPs) stimulate innate immunity; however , they have never been demonstrated to be capable of aiding the generation of specific cellular immune responses. Therefore , our objective was to evaluate whether iron oxide-based NPs have adjuvant properties in generating cellular Th1 , Th17 and TCD8 ( Tc1) immune responses. For this purpose , a fusion protein ( CMX) composed of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> antigens was used as a subunit vaccine. Citrate-coated MnFe
