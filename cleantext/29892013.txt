  There is increasing evidence that many risk loci found using genome-wide association studies are molecular quantitative trait loci ( QTLs). Here we introduce a new set of functional annotations based on causal posterior probabilities of fine-mapped molecular cis-QTLs , using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx) and BLUEPRINT consortia. We show that these annotations are more strongly enriched for heritability ( 5.84 × for eQTLs; P = 1.19 × 10
