  Molecular alterations in lichen sclerosus-associated vulvar squamous cell carcinoma ( LS-VSCC) are largely unknown. To determine whether the retinoic acid receptor β ( RARβ) tumor-suppressor gene is involved in the onset and/or progression of LS-VSCC. The case-control study , conducted at University-Hospital of Ferrara , Italy , included 20 LS-VSCC ( mean ( SD) age , 75 ( 3) years) and 20 cancer-associated vulvar LS ( caVLS; mean ( SD) age , 62 ( 11) years) formalin-fixed embedded tissue specimens , 20 cancer-free vulvar LS ( cfVLS) , and 20 normal skin fresh specimens from diagnostic biopsies and women surgically treated for nonmalignant skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , respectively. RARβ gene expression and promoter methylation were investigated in LS-VSCC and caVLS adjacent to VSCC specimens , and in cfVLS and normal skin specimens , as controls , by RT-Q real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) analysis , and sequencing of PCR-amplified bisulfite-treated DNA. c-Jun expression , an RARβ pathway-related gene , was also investigated. RARβ expression , correlation with its promoter methylation and c-Jun expression , and association with onset or progression of LS-VSCC. In LS-VSCC , RARβ messenger RNA was 3.4- , 3.6- , and 4.8-fold lower than in caVLS ( P = .001) , cfVLS ( P = .005) , and normal skin ( P < .001) , respectively. The RARβ mRNA levels were similar in caVLS , cfVLS , and normal skin. The RARβ promoter was hypermethylated in 18 ( 90 %) of 20 LS-VSCC , 11 ( 55 %) of 20 cfVLS , 10 ( 50 %) of 20 caVLS , and 5 ( 25 %) of 20 in the normal skin group. The degree of methylation of RARβ promoter was higher in LS-VSCC , ranging from 5 to 9 ( full promoter methylation) CpGs methylated , than in caVLS ( P = .02) , cfVLS ( P = .03) , or normal skin ( P < .001) , which was up to 5 CpGs methylated. Importantly , 0 of 8 LS-VSCC with 5 to 6 CpGs methylated and 5 ( 63 %) of 8 LS-VSCC with 7 to 8 CpGs methylated were from patients with lymph node metastasis at diagnosis , respectively , whereas there were 2 of 2 ( 100 %) LS-VSCC samples with 9 CpG methylated from patients with lymph node metastasis at diagnosis and subsequent recurrence. In LS-VSCC c-Jun mRNA was 4.3- , 1.4- , and 2.6-fold higher than in caVLS ( P < .001) , cfVLS ( P = .001) , and normal skin ( P < .001) , respectively. The expression of c-Jun was similar in caVLS , cfVLS , and normal skin. Hypermethylation-induced RARβ down-expression was associated with LS-VSCC and correlates with the upregulation of c-Jun. The degree of methylation of RARβ promoter increased with the malignancy of LS-VSCC. Therefore , RARβ gene dysregulation may play a role in progression of LS-VSCC , and RARβ promoter methylation status may be used as a prognostic marker in clinical treatment of patients with LS-VSCC.
