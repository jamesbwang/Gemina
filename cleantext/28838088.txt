  A previous retrospective cohort study established the relationship between perioperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( POAF) and subsequent mortality and stroke. However , the details regarding the cause of death and etiology of stroke remain unclear. The prospective cohort study of surveillance for perioperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> recurrence in major non-cardiac surgery for malignancy ( PREDICT AF RECURRENCE) registry is an ongoing prospective cohort study to elucidate the long-term recurrence rate and the clinical impact of new-onset POAF in the setting of head and neck , non-cardiac thoracic , and abdominal surgery for malignancy. In this study , cardiologists collaborate with a surgical team during the perioperative period , carefully observe the electrocardiogram ( ECG) monitor , and treat arrhythmia as required. Furthermore , patients who develop new-onset POAF are followed up using a long-term Holter ECG monitor , SPIDER FLASH-t AFib Even if patients with malignancy survive by overcoming the disease , they may die from any preventable cardiovascular diseases. In particular , those with POAF may develop cardiogenic stroke in the future. Because details of the natural history of patients with POAF remain unclear , investigating the need to continue anticoagulation therapy for such patients is necessary. This study will provide essential information on the recurrence rate of POAF and new insights into the prediction and treatment of POAF.
