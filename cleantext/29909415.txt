  The involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) has not been fully elucidated. Here , we aimed to identify EMT-related genes associated with TGF-β in ESCC and to clarify the role of these genes in the progression of ESCC. EMT-related genes associated with TGF-β expression were identified in patients with ESCC using microarray analysis and public datasets. The effects of ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 ( UHRF2) expression were analyzed in ESCC cell lines. Cell proliferation and invasion were measured using MTT and invasion assays , respectively. UHRF2 mRNA expression was also analyzed in 75 ESCC specimens to determine the clinical significance of UHRF2 in ESCC. Treatment of ESCC cell lines with TGF-β increased UHRF2 expression. UHRF2 overexpression increased CDH1 ( E-cadherin) expression and decreased invasive capacity. The 75 ESCC specimens were divided into the UHRF2 high-expression group ( n = 61) and the UHRF2 low-expression group ( n = 14). Low UHRF2 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion ( p = 0.034) and was an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis ( p = 0.005). UHRF2 may be a negative regulator of EMT and a novel prognostic biomarker for ESCC.
