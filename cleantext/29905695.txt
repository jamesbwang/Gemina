  Elastography is an attractive technique for quantifying the mechanical properties of biological tissue. Here , we report an elastography method with low-frame-rate laser speckle contrast imaging ( LSCI) using the aliasing effect. This method needs only one excitation source , a low-frame-rate camera , and no synchronization between excitation and acquisition. The accuracy of the elasticity measurement was validated on tissue-mimicking phantoms by comparing the value with the elasticity measured by a high-frame-rate LSCI and by the rheometer. Elastography was also performed on chicken breast in vitro.
