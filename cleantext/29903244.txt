  To obtain the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status for women of child-bearing age aged 18-44 years from rural areas in China Health and Nutrition Survey2010-2012 ( CHNS 2010-2012). We randomly selected the 1520 representative women of childbearing age from the 75 monitoring spots derived in the CNHS 2010-2012. The information of study population were collected using questionnaires and the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was determinedusing the RIA kits. The vitamin D nutritional status was classified by the standards suggested by the America Endocrine Society. Multiple Logistic regression analysis was explored therelationship between vitamin D status with the potential relevant factors. The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 22. 7 ng/m L ranged from 8. 2 to42. 0 ng/m L. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 38. 7 % , insufficiently 39. 5 % and sufficiently 21. 8 %. Multiple Logistic regression analysis showed that nationality , geographical regions and income per capita was the significant. s The nutritional status of vitamin D in women of child bearing-age is not better in the CNHS2010-2012. We suggest that it should be pay more attention on the women of childbearing age for the minority , north China , family income per year between 10000 and 30000 Yuan.
