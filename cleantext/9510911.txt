  Glycosylated lipids ( GLs) are added-value lipid derivatives of great potential. Besides their interesting surface activities that qualify many of them to act as excellent ecological detergents , they have diverse biological activities with promising biomedical and cosmeceutical applications. Glycolipids , especially those of microbial origin , have interesting antimicrobial , anticancer , antiparasitic as well as immunomodulatory activities. Nonetheless , GLs are hardly accessing the market because of their high cost of production. We believe that experience of metabolic engineering ( ME) of microbial lipids for biofuel production can now be harnessed towards a successful synthesis of microbial GLs for biomedical and other applications. This review presents chemical groups of bacterial and fungal GLs , their biological activities , their general biosynthetic pathways and an insight on ME strategies for their production.
