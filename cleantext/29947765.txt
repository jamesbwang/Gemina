  Müllerian inhibiting substance/anti-Müllerian hormone ( MIS/AMH) is produced in the ovarian granulosa<pathogen> cells and it is believed to inhibit ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in women of reproductive age. To investigate the expression of MIS/AMH type II receptor ( MISRII/AMHRII) that binds MIS/AMH in the ovaries of reproductive-age women , to identify the exact targets of MIS/AMH. Laboratory study using human ovarian tissue. University hospital. Tissue samples from 25 patients who had undergone ovarian surgery. The segregation of ovarian granulosa<pathogen> and theca cells by laser microdissection was followed by RT-PCR , analyzing MISRII/AMHRII mRNA expression. Afterward , in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the localization of MISRII/AMHRII mRNA and protein expression. MISRII/AMHRII mRNA expression by RT-PCR , in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry. MISRII/AMHRII were expressed in granulosa<pathogen> and theca cells of preantral and antral follicles. The granulosa<pathogen> cells showed stronger MISRII/AMHRII expression than theca cells. MISRII/AMHRII mRNA staining of granulosa<pathogen> and theca cells in large antral follicles , early atretic follicles and corpus luteum waned , but were still detected weakly , showing higher expression in theca cells than in granulosa<pathogen> cells. However , MISRII/AMHRII protein in granulosa<pathogen> layer of atretic follicle and corpus luteum could not be assessed. Since MISRII/AMHRII is expressed in both granulosa<pathogen> and theca cells , this indicates that MIS/AMH , produced in the granulosa<pathogen> cells , is active in the theca cells as well. MIS/AMH is most likely actively involved not only in the autocrine and endocrine processes , but in the paracrine processes involving theca cells.
