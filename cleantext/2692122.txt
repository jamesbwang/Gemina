  Risk factors , such as the number of pre-existing co-morbidities , the extent of the underlying pathology and the magnitude of the required operation , can not be changed before surgery. It may , however , be possible to improve the cardiopulmonary fitness of the patient with an individualised exercise program. We are performing a randomised controlled trial ( RCT) assessing the impact of High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT) on preoperative cardiopulmonary fitness and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Consecutive eligible patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery are being randomised to HIIT or standard care in a 1:1 ratio. Participants allocated to HIIT will perform 14 exercise sessions on a stationary cycle ergometer , over a period of 4-6 weeks before surgery. The sessions , which are individualised , aim to start with ten repeated 1-min blocks of intense exercise with a target of reaching a heart rate exceeding 90 % of the age predicted maximum , followed by 1 min of lower intensity cycling. As endurance improves , the duration of exercise is increased to achieve five 2-min intervals of high intensity exercise followed by 2 min of lower intensity cycling. Each training session lasts approximately 30 min.
