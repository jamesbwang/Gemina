  MicroRNA-92a-3p ( miR-92a-3p) is a member of the miR-17/ 92 cluster and the cancer-related miR-92 family. miR-92a-3p regulates important transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF1) and inhibits SOCS1 to enhance the anti-apoptotic STAT3/IL6 signaling route. In this study , we examined the putative prognostic value of miR-92a-3p in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). Total RNA , which was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) collected from 88 CLL patients and 36 non-leukemic blood donors , was polyadenylated and reverse-transcribed. miR-92a-3p expression was quantified using an in-house-developed real-time quantitative PCR assay. miR-92a-3p levels were significantly lower in PBMCs of CLL patients. Kaplan-Meier overall survival ( OS) analysis and bootstrap univariate Cox regression showed that high miR-92a-3p expression predicts significantly prolonged OS for CLL patients. Interestingly , miR-92a-3p overexpression retains its favorable prognostic role in CLL patients of intermediate risk or stratified according to established prognostic factors. In conclusion , miR-92a-3p overexpression is a potential independent molecular biomarker of favorable prognosis in CLL.
