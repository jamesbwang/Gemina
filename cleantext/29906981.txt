  On the basis of ( i) particle image velocimetry data of a turbulent boundary layer with large field of view and good spatial resolution and ( ii) a mathematical relation between the energy spectrum and specifically modeled flow structures , we show that the scalings of the streamwise energy spectrum E _ ( 11) ( k _ ( x)) in a wave-number range directly affected by the wall are determined by wall-attached eddies but are not given by the Townsend-Perry attached eddy model 's prediction of these spectra , at least at the Reynolds numbers Re _ ( τ) considered here which are between 10 ^ ( 3) and 10 ^ ( 4). Instead , we find E _ ( 11) ( k _ ( x)) ∼ k _ ( x) ^ ( -1-p) where p varies smoothly with distance to the wall from negative values in the buffer layer to positive values in the inertial layer. The exponent p characterizes the turbulence levels inside wall-attached streaky structures conditional on the length of these structures. A particular consequence is that the skin friction velocity is not sufficient to scale E _ ( 11) ( k _ ( x)) for wave numbers directly affected by the wall.
