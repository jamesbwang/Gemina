  Disturbance of intestinal homeostasis is associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) , and TGF-Î² signaling impairment in mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs) causes murine colitis<disease> with goblet cell depletion. Here , we examined an organoid-MP co-culture system to study the role of MPs in intestinal epithelial differentiation and homeostasis. Intestinal organoids were co-cultured with lamina propria leukocytes and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs) from CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl mice. Organoid-MP adhesive interactions were evaluated by microscopy , RT-PCR , and flow cytometry. Murine colitis<disease> models ( dextran sodium sulphate ( DSS) , CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl , T-cell-transfer) were used for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Anti-E-cadherin antibody treatment or CD11c +- cell-specific CDH1 gene deletion were performed for E-cadherin neutralization or knockout. Colonic biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> were analyzed by flow cytometry. Intestinal organoids co-cultured with CD11c + lamina propria leukocytes or BMDCs from CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl mice showed morphological changes and goblet cell depletion with Notch signal activation , analogous to CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl colitis<disease>. E-cadherin was upregulated in CD11c + MPs , especially CX3CR1 + CCR2 + monocytes , of CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl mice. E-cadherin-mediated BMDC adhesion promoted Notch activation and cystic changes in organoids. Anti-E-cadherin antibody treatment attenuated colitis<disease> in CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl and T-cell-transferred mice. In addition , E-cadherin deletion in CD11c + cells attenuated colitis<disease> in both CD11c-cre Tgfbr2fl/fl and DSS-treated mice. In patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> , E-cadherin expressed by intestinal CD11c + leukocytes was enhanced compared with that in healthy controls. E-cadherin-mediated MP-epithelium adhesion is associated with the development of colitis<disease> , and blocking these adhesions may have therapeutic potential for IBD.
