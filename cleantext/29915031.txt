  Aggregation of transthyretin ( TTR) is the causative agent for TTR cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy amyloidoses. Aggregation is initiated by dissociation of the TTR tetramer into a monomeric intermediate , which self-assembles into amyloid. The coupled multiple-step equilibria and low-concentration , aggregation-prone intermediates are challenging to probe using conventional assays. We report a
