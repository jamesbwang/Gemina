  The ability to disguise and deceive action outcomes was examined by manipulating sports garments. In Experiment 1 , those with higher and lower skill levels in anticipation predicted the throw direction of an opponent who wore a garment designed to disguise kinetic-chain information. Higher skill anticipators were more adversely affected by the disguise garment than the lower skill anticipators , demonstrating that disguise removed the anticipation advantage. In Experiment 2 , using the same occlusion methodology , the effect of deception was examined using 2 garments designed to create visual illusions of motion across the proximal-to-distal sequence of the thrower 's action and compared with a white-garment control. Performances for the deceptive garments were reduced relative to the control garment at the earliest occlusion points for the rightmost targets , but this effect was reversed for the leftmost targets at the earliest occlusion point , suggesting that the visual illusion garments were deceiving participants about motion information from the proximal-to-distal sequence of the action.
