  About one third of ischaemic strokes are classified as embolic strokes of undetermined source ( ESUS). A silent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) may play a pathogenic role in these strokes and P wave dispersion ( PWD) , representing an electrocardiographic ( ECG) predictor for paroxysmal AF , thereby a potential marker of covert cardioembolism , was found to be increased in cryptogenic stroke. Furthermore , current evidence links AF to inflammation<symptom>: inflammatory markers , such as high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) , have been related to the development and persistence of AF , possibly by promoting atrial remodelling. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a relationship between PWD and hsCRP in patients with ESUS exists , in order to highlight a possible role for inflammation<symptom> in the atrial electric remodelling , that predisposes to AF. We enrolled 174 patients ( 91 males , 83 females; mean age 69 ± 13 years) with ESUS. All patients underwent neuroimaging examination , arterial ultrasound examination , echocardiography and ECG. P wave dispersion and hsCRP were measured in all subjects. A significant positive correlation was found between hsCRP and PWD ( Spearman r: 0.35 , p < 0.0001). In patients with high PWD ( > 40 msec; n = 102) , hsCRP was three-fold higher than in patients with normal PWD ( ≤ 40 msec; n = 72) ( 1.57 ± 2.9 vs 0.42 ± 0.4 mg/dl , p = 0.0005). Our results show increased hsCRP levels in cryptogenic stroke patients with high PWD. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that systemic inflammation<symptom> plays a role in a fraction of patients with ESUS , by increasing AF risk via atrial electric remodelling.
