  Attack by commensal microbiota is one component of induction of inflammatory episodes in ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). In UC , the mucus layer is intrinsically devoid of phosphatidylcholine ( PC) resulting in low hydrophobicity which facilitates bacterial invasion. Colonic ectophospholipase-carrying bacterial strains are likely candidates to further thinning the PC mucus barrier and to precipitate inflammatory episodes. To evaluate the effect of phospholipase A As PLA Luminal UDCA-LPE reduced the PLA The inhibition of the bacterial ectophospholipase A
