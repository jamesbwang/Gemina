  The development of well-controlled drug carriers that are stable and highly effective for the delivery of anticancer agents is challenging. Herein , we report a novel pH-controlled drug delivery system , utilizing reducing graphene oxide ( rGO)- polymer self-assembly films as carriers , for the preparation of effective drug nanocomplex. In this system , rGO-polymer carriers were constructed by the alternating assembly of poly-L-lysine ( PLL) and polyaspartic acid ( PASP) around the rGO sheets. Furthermore , the rGO-polymer cores could assemble with negatively charged doxorubicin ( DOX) via electrostatic interactions. The DOX embedding efficiency and the morphology of the nanocomplex could be controlled by the number , concentration of rGO-polymer bilayers and the initial DOX concentration. Importantly , the release of DOX could be regulated by controlling the pH and using a NIR laser. Under acidic conditions , the interactions between the PASP layer and DOX molecules can be broken , resulting in the gradual release of the DOX molecules. Upon NIR irradiation , the release of DOX could be further accelerated and a photothermal effect from rGO induced. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity experiments indicated that the drug nanocomplex possessed effective anti-cancer activity. Thus , we present a useful strategy to prepare pH-responsive drug nanocomplex for combined photothermal and chemical therapy. The nanocomplex can be used as a potential drug delivery system for practical cancer treatment.
