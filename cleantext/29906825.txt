  We present a general dynamic finite-size scaling theory for the quantum dynamics after an abrupt quench , at both continuous and first-order quantum transitions. For continuous transitions , the scaling laws are naturally ruled by the critical exponents and the renormalization-group dimension of the perturbation at the transition. In the case of first-order transitions , it is possible to recover a universal scaling behavior , which is controlled by the size behavior of the energy gap between the lowest-energy levels. We discuss these findings in the framework of the paradigmatic quantum Ising ring , and support the dynamic scaling laws by numerical evidence.
