  This study aimed to determine if carotid arterial tortuosity represents a marker of disease severity in Loeys-Dietz syndrome<disease> ( LDS). Fifty-four 54 LDS patients ( mean age , 17.0 years) who underwent computed tomogram angiography from January 2004 to December 2013 were retrospectively identified. Carotid artery tortuosity index ( CATI) was calculated from computed tomogram angiography. Clinical variables were obtained from the medical records. Relationship between CATI and need for aortic root replacement was evaluated with Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Higher CATI was associated with the need for aortic root replacement ( P < 0.001) in the univariate Cox proportional hazard model. Patients were stratified based on both CATI and aortic root size in Kaplan-Meier analysis , and patients with higher CATI were more likely to require aortic root replacement ( P < 0.001) in both aortic root size strata. Increased carotid artery tortuosity is associated with the need for early aortic root replacement in patients with LDS.
