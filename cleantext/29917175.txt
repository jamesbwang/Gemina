  Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( BIA-ALCL) is a distinct type of T-cell lymphoma , developing around implants , that can occur 2 to 25 years ( median 8 years) post-implantation. Most patients present with a swelling of the breast , which is usually associated with pain and fluid collecting around the implant. Less commonly , a lump in the breast and/or in the axilla can be present. A periprosthetic fluid collection ( > 1 year post-implantation) should be investigated with ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Immunohistochemistry confirms the diagnosis BIA-ALCL with CD30 + and ALK- expression. In most patients with disease localized to the periprosthetic fluid , surgery alone usually is curative. A total capsulectomy and bilateral implant removal should be performed. Before surgical intervention , international recommendations state that a PET-CT scan should be done to exclude disseminated disease. The international profile registry ( www.thepsf.org/profile) collects all confirmed cases.
