  To assess the `` Dedicated Orthopaedic Trauma Operating Room '' ( DOTOR) effect on management and outcomes of open tibia and femur fractures. Retrospective chart review. University Level I Trauma Center. Patients categorized into those managed in the DOTOR versus those managed in a standard on-call operating room ( OCOR). Data collected include patient and injury characteristics , time to debridement , and patient outcomes. A total of 297 patients with 347 open tibia and femur fractures were included; 154 patients ( 174 fractures) were managed in the DOTOR group and 143 patients ( 170 fractures) were managed in the OCOR group. The average time to debridement was significantly longer for DOTOR ( 12.9 hours) versus OCOR ( 5.4 hours). The DOTOR group was 9 times less likely to undergo debridement within 6 hours. The number of patients debrided within 24 hours was similar ( 90 % for DOTOR vs. 96 % OCOR). The rate of primary fracture union was significantly higher in the DOTOR ( 73.2 % vs. 56.6 %). OCOR patients were twice as likely to have an unplanned surgery. Rates of infection , nonunion , and amputation were similar. Despite earlier access to the Operating room for debridement in the OCOR group , there was no difference in the infection rate compared with the DOTOR group. However , patients managed in the DOTOR group were more likely to go on to uncomplicated fracture union and less likely to have an unplanned surgery. Therapeutic Level III.
