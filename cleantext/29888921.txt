  A new pattern for difunctionalization of alkynes via a palladium-catalyzed regio- and stereoselective coupling-addition of propiolates with arylsulfonyl hydrazides is disclosed. The approach enables the synthesis of various highly functionalized ( E)- vinylsulfones in satisfactory yields. Arylsulfonyl hydrazides act as both aryl and sulfonyl sources via selective cleavage of Ar ( C)- S and S-N bonds , which are simultaneously incorporated onto the terminal carbon atom of an alkyne molecule.
