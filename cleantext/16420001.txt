  Multi-tetrazole derivatives with conjugated structures were designed and investigated in this study. Using quantum chemistry methods , the crystal structures , electrostatic potentials ( ESPs) , multicenter bond orders , HOMO-LUMO energy gaps , and detonation properties of the derivatives were calculated. As expected , these molecules with conjugated structures showed low energies of their crystal structures , molecular layering in their crystals , high average ESPs , high multicenter bond order values , and enhanced detonation properties. The derivative 1,2-di ( 1H-tetrazol-5-yl) diazene ( N2) was predicted to have the best density ( 1.87 g/cm
