  Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) precursors have been found extensively in sewage sludge and biosolids-amended soils. The degradation of these precursors are regarded as a significant source of PFOS in the environment. In this study , the accumulation of N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid ( N-EtFOSAA) in the plants of seven species , namely alfalfa , lettuce , maize , mung bean , radish , ryegrass , and soybean from biosolids-amended soil , and the degradation kinetics of N-EtFOSAA in soil-plant microcosms were evaluated over 60 days. N-EtFOSAA was found in the roots of all plant species , while was not in stems and leaves. The root concentration factors of N-EtFOSAA ranged 0.52-1.37 ( pmol/g
