  Incorrect prosthesis size has direct impact on patient outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) procedure. Currently , annular diameter , area or perimeter may be used for prosthesis size selection. The aim was to evaluate whether the use different annular dimensions would result in the selection of different prosthesis sizes , when assessed in the same TAVI-candidate during the same phase of a cardiac cycle. Fifty consecutive TAVI-candidates underwent retrospectively ECG-gated computed tomography angiography ( CTA). Aortic root dimensions were assessed in the 20 % phase of the R-R interval. Annular short diameter , perimeter and area were used to select the prosthesis size , based on the industry recommendations for a self-expandable ( Medtronic CoreValve; MCV) and balloon-expandable ( Edwards Sapien XT Valve; ESV) valve. Complete agreement on selected prosthesis size amongst all three annular dimensions was observed in 62 % ( 31/50; ESV) and 30 % ( 15/50; MCV). Short aortic annulus measurement resulted in a smaller prosthesis size in 20 % ( 10/50; ESV) and in 60 % of cases ( 30/50; MCV) compared to the size suggested by both annular perimeter and area. In 18 % ( 9/50; ESV) and 10 % of cases ( 5/50; MCV) a larger prosthesis would have been selected based on annular perimeter compared to annular diameter and area. Prosthesis size derived from area was always in agreement with at least one other parameter in all cases. Aortic annulus area appears to be the most robust parameter for TAVI-prosthesis size selection , regardless of the specific prosthesis size. Short aortic annulus diameter may underestimate the prosthesis size , while use of annular perimeter may lead to size overestimation in some cases.
