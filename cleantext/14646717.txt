  Revision hip arthroplasty in the setting of periacetabular bone loss presents a significant challenge , as options for restoring bone loss are limited. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 may offer a solution by promoting bone growth to restore bone stock before implant reimplantation. Here we present a case of a patient with a periprosthetic acetabulum fracture , resulting in pelvic discontinuity as the result of significant periacetabular bone loss. Using a staged approach , periacetabular bone stock was nearly entirely reconstituted using recombinant BMPs and allograft , which resulted in stable fixation , but with abundant heterotopic bone formation. Recombinant BMP-2 offers a useful tool for restoring bone stock in complex hip arthroplasty revision cases with periacetabular bone loss; however , caution must be used as overabundant bone growth as heterotopic ossification may result.
