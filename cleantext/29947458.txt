  The psychological status of caregivers of individuals with intellectual disability and psychiatric illness ( PI) is important for effective management. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological status and its relationship with coping styles among these caregivers. Caregivers ( N = 80) of individuals with intellectual disability ( n = 40) and PI ( n = 40) were administered a socio-demographic questionnaire , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress scale and COPE Inventory. Caregivers experienced depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress symptoms. These symptoms were found to be significantly higher among caregivers of individuals with intellectual disability than those with PI. The most common coping style used was religious coping. Use of positive reinterpretation and growth was associated with lower levels of depression<symptom> and stress symptoms. Caregivers ' mental health plays an important role in the quality of care delivery and outcome. Use of appropriate coping styles can reduce the impact of these symptoms.
