  An isothiourea-catalysed Michael addition-annulation process using β-fluoroalkyl-substituted α,β-unsaturated aryl esters and a range of 2-acylbenzazoles is reported for the enantioselective synthesis of dihydropyranone and dihydropyridinone products bearing polyfluorinated stereocenters ( 29 examples , up to 98 % yield , > 99: 1 er). The choice of aryl group of the aryl ester proved essential in determining reaction enantioselectivity and dihydropyranone: dihydropyridinone product selectivity. The aryloxide leaving group is shown to play a number of essential additional roles , operating ( i) as a Brønsted base , circumventing the need for an auxiliary base; and ( ii) as a Lewis base to catalyse the isomerisation of dihydropyranone products into thermodynamically-favoured dihydropyridinones. After optimisation , this isomerisation process was exploited for the selective synthesis of dihydropyridinone products using acylbenzothiazoles , and either dihydropyranone or dihydropyridinone products using acylbenzoxazoles. Finally , the phenol derivative , produced following protonation of the aryloxide , is proposed to act as a Brønsted acid , which promotes an isothiourea-catalysed kinetic resolution of benzoxazole-derived dihydropyranones.
