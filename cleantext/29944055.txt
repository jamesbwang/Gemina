  25- ( OH) vitamin D ( VD) deficiency has been described as potential risk factor for the development of diabetes in many epidemiological studies. 25- ( OH) VD deficiency and insulin resistance associated with this deficiency are common findings in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between 25- ( OH) VD levels and microalbuminuria. The patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged between 40 and 65 years , who were admitted to the diabetes outpatient clinics of our hospital , were evaluated in two different groups. The first group consisted of 119 patients with insufficient 25- ( OH) VD levels ( 10-30 ng/mL) and the second group consisted of 121 patients with 25- ( OH) VD deficiency ( â‰¤ 10 ng/mL). The relationship between 25- ( OH) VD levels and the level of microalbuminuria was evaluated in the two groups. The mean 25- ( OH) VD level was 11.5 ng/mL and the mean HbA1c level was 9.1 %. When the patient groups were evaluated according to 25- ( OH) VD levels , HbA1c values were significantly higher in patients with a 25- ( OH) VD level of 10 ng/mL or lower ( p = .039). 25- ( OH) VD levels were not significantly different between patients with different stages of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( p = .119) , whereas the level of microalbuminuria was significantly different ( p = .030). This study found that the level of microalbuminuria was significantly higher in patients with 25- ( OH) vitamin D deficiency compared to patients with 25- ( OH) VD insufficiency.
