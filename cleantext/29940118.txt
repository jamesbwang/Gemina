  Smart polymers are a valuable platform to protect and control the activity of biological agents over a wide range of conditions , such as low pH , by proper encapsulation. Such conditions are present in olive oil mill wastewater with phenol as one of the most problematic constituents. We show that elastic and pH-responsive diblock copolymer fibers are a suitable carrier for Corynebacterium<pathogen> glutamicum , i.e. , bacteria which are known for their ability to degrade phenol. Free C. glutamicum does not survive low pH conditions and fails to degrade phenol at low pH conditions. Our tea-bag like biohybrid system , where the pH-responsive diblock copolymer acts as a protecting outer shell for the embedded bacteria , allows phenol degradation even at low pH. Utilizing a two-step encapsulation process , planktonic cells were first encapsulated in poly ( vinyl alcohol) to protect the bacteria against the organic solvents used in the second step employing coaxial electrospinning.
