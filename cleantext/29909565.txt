  Oral lichen plans ( OLP) is a potentially malignant inflammatory mucocutaneous disease. CD133 is an investigated surface marker for cancer stem-like cells ( CSCs) that may be involved in tumor initiation in head and neck carcinomas. We compared short-term clinical effectiveness of topical pimecrolimus as selective inflammatory cytokine release inhibitor with betamethasone cream for erosive/atrophic OLP and investigated the influence of this therapy on CD133 expression. Thirty patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups to receive topical pimecrolimus ( group I) or betamethasone ( group II) four times daily for 4 weeks. A marker lesion<symptom> in each patient were assessed at baseline using clinical score ( CS) and visual analog scale ( VAS) then at 1 , 2 , and 4 weeks and after 4 weeks of treatment-free period. CD133 expression was detected in pre- and post-treatment immunostained sections. Both drugs showed a reduction in CS , VAS , and CD133 expressions after treatment termination ( p < 0.001). Pimecrolimus-treated lesions<symptom> showed significant higher 1st week reduction in severity ( 33.1 % ( 22.2)) , pain score ( 57.53 % ( 14.27)) , less recurrence in follow-up period and less CD133 expression by the end of the 1st 4 weeks compared with betamethasone. Pimecrolimus showed earlier clinical response and less recurrence rate compared with standard topical corticosteroid in symptomatic OLP lesions<symptom> , and both treatment reduced CD133-positive CSC population. The study proved the benefits of topical pimecrolimus in early management of painful<symptom> lesions<symptom> of OLP and its ability to inhibit CSCs , suggesting a possible role in reducing risk of malignant transformation.
