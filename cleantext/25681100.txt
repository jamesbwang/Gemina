  Telecare Medical Information System ( TMIS) provides the flexible and convenient e-health care. It helps the patients to gain health monitoring information and provides patients to share their experience wirelessly. Traditional authentication and key agreement ( AKA) protocols in TMIS are mostly considered in same-domain environment. However , future generation network may integrate various of wireless mesh networks under various domain. What 's more , patients heterogeneous cross-domain service has become an inevitable trend. However , there is still no heterogeneous cross-domain authenticated protocol between PKI-domain and IBC-domain in TMIS. In this paper , we propose a heterogeneous cross-domain AKA protocol with symptoms-matching in TMIS ( short for CDAKA). It not only keeps good security features , but also truly provides patients ' anonymity to protect sensitive information from illegal interception. It still provides patients in two different domains to share their experience , broaden their understanding of illness by using their mobile device freely. Besides , it can realize AKA with extremely low computing cost and communication cost. What 's more , it is proved to be secure against known possible attacks under the Elliptic Curve Computable Diffie-Hellman problem ( ECDHP) assumption in the random oracle model. Hence , these features make CDAKA protocol very suitable for mobile application scenarios , where resource is severely constrained and security is particularly concerned.
