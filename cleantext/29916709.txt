  Recently , it has become clear that a range of nanoparticles can be occluded within single crystals to form nanocomposites. Calcite is a much-studied model , but even in this case we have yet to fully understand the details of the nanoscale interactions at the organic-inorganic interface that lead to occlusion. Here , a series of diblock copolymer nanoparticles with well-defined surface chemistries were visualized interacting with a growing calcite surface using in situ atomic force microscopy. These nanoparticles comprise a poly ( benzyl methacrylate) ( PBzMA) core-forming block and a non-ionic poly ( glycerol monomethacrylate) ( Ph-PGMA) , a carboxylic acid-tipped poly ( glycerol monomethacrylate) ( HOOC-PGMA) , or an anionic poly ( methacrylic acid) ( PMAA) stabilizer block. Our results reveal three modes of interaction between the nanoparticles and the calcite surface: ( i) attachment followed by detachment , ( ii) sticking to and `` hovering '' over the surface , allowing steps to pass beneath the immobilized nanoparticle , and ( iii) incorporation of the nanoparticle by the growing crystals. By analyzing the relative contributions of these three types of interactions as a function of nanoparticle surface chemistry , we show that âˆ¼ 85 % of PMAA
