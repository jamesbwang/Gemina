  The pollution of toxic and persistent heavy metals commonly exist in water environment; such multi-component pollutants pose a serious threat to human beings and other organisms. Herein , to make full use of the advantages of both layered double hydroxide ( LDH) and rice husk ash ( RHA) , a novel Mg-Fe-LDH-RHA functional material was synthesized by assembling LDH on the biochar derived from RHA and used as an adsorbent for removal of heavy metal ions including Pb
