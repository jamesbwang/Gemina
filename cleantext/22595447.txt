  New-onset atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NOAF) is a common finding in patients with myocardial infarction ( MI) , but few studies are available regarding the prediction model for its risk estimation. Although Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events ( GRACE) risk score ( RS) has been recognized as an effective tool for the risk evaluation of clinical outcomes in patients with MI , its usefulness in the prediction of post-MI NOAF remains unclear. In this study , we sought to validate the discrimination performance of GRACE RS in the prediction of post-MI NOAF and to make a comparison with that of the CHA A total of 488 patients with STEMI who were admitted to our hospital between May 2015 and October 2016 without a history of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> were retrospectively evaluated in this study. GRACE and CHA Of the 488 eligible patients , 49 ( 10.0 %) developed NOAF during hospitalization. In the overall cohort , the discrimination performance of GRACE RS ( C-statistic: 0.76 , 95 % CI: 0.72-0.80) was significantly better than that of CHA The diagnostic performance of GRACE RS is relatively high as well as better than that of the CHA
