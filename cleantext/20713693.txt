  Cigarette smoke ( CS) induces lung cellular senescence that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). How aging influences cellular senescence and other molecular hallmarks , and increases the risk of CS-induced damage remains unknown. We hypothesized that aging-associated changes in lungs worsen the COPD/emphysema by CS exposure. Younger and older groups of C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic CS for 6 months with respective age-matched air-exposed controls. CS caused a decline in lung function and affected the lung structure of both groups of mice. No alterations were observed in the induction of inflammatory mediators between the air-exposed younger and older controls , but aging increased the severity of CS-induced lung inflammation<symptom>. Aging per se increased lung cellular senescence and significant changes in damage-associated molecular patterns marker S100A8. Gene transcript analysis using the nanoString nCounter showed a significant upregulation of key pro-senescence targets by CS ( Mmp12 , Ccl2 , Cdkn2a , Tert , Wrn , and Bub1b). Aging independently influenced lung function and structure , as well as increased susceptibility to CS-induced inflammation<symptom> in emphysema , but had a negligible effect on cellular senescence. Thus , aging solely does not contribute to the induction of cellular senescence by CS in a mouse model of COPD/emphysema.
