  Structure and dynamics of living matter rely on design principles fundamentally different from concepts of traditional material science. Specialized intracellular filaments in the cytoskeleton permit living systems to divide , migrate , and grow with a high degree of variability and durability. Among the three filament systems , microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments ( IFs) , the physical properties of IFs and their role in cellular mechanics are the least well understood. We use optical trapping of individual vimentin filaments to investigate energy dissipation , strain history dependence , and creep behavior of stretched filaments. By stochastic and numerical modeling , we link our experimental observations to the peculiar molecular architecture of IFs. We find that individual vimentin filaments display tensile memory and are able to dissipate more than 70 % of the input energy. We attribute these phenomena to distinct nonequilibrium folding and unfolding of Î± helices in the vimentin monomers constituting the filaments.
