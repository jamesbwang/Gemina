  Over the past decade , tremendous effort has been made to improve the light-harvesting ability of push-pull porphyrin dyes. Despite notable success achieved in this direction , push-pull porphyrin dyes still suffer from a poor light-harvesting efficiency owing to the lack of absorption between the Soret and Q-bands. To tackle this issue , here we design a series of push-pull porphyrin dyes with anchoring groups either at meso- or β-position using calculations based on first-principles time-dependent density functional theory. In contrast to the common perception , we find that porphyrin dyes bearing an electron-donor at the meso-position and an electron-acceptor at the β-position produce an additional extended band between the Soret and Q-bands appearing at around 500 nm due to S
