  Social media is a useful platform to share health-related information due to its vast reach. This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks , specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction ( ADR) mentions from social media , particularly from Twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging , mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text , as compared to more technical and formal medical reports. Current methods in ADR mention extraction rely on supervised learning methods , which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem. The state-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks , specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN) which is Long-Short-Term-Memory network ( LSTM). Deep neural networks , due to their large number of free parameters rely heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world , it is hard to get large labeled data , mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation. To this end , we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based RNN model , which can leverage unlabeled data also present in abundance on social media. Through experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , achieving state-of-the-art performance in ADR mention extraction. In this study , we tackle the problem of labeled data scarcity for Adverse Drug Reaction mention extraction from social media and propose a novel semi-supervised learning based method which can leverage large unlabeled corpus available in abundance on the web. Through empirical study , we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms fully supervised learning based baseline which relies on large manually annotated corpus for a good performance.
