  Up to 20 % of children with congenital heart disease ( CHD) undergoing cardiac surgery develop neurodevelopmental disabilities ( NDD) , with some studies reporting persistent impairment. Recent large-scale studies have demonstrated shared genetic mechanisms contributing to CHD and NDD. In this study , a targeted approach was applied to assess direct clinical applicability of this information. A gene panel comprising 148 known CHD and/or NDD genes was used to sequence 15 patients with CHD + NDD , 15 patients with CHD , and 15 healthy controls. The number and types of variants between the 3 groups were compared using Poisson log-linear regression , and the SNP-set ( Sequence) Kernel Association Test-Optimized was used to conduct single-gene and gene-pathway burden analyses. A significant increase in rare ( minor allele frequency < 0.01) and novel variants was identified between the CHD + NDD cohort and controls , P < .001 and P = .001 , respectively. There was also a significant increase in rare variants in the CHD cohort compared with controls ( P = .04). Rare variant burden analyses implicated pathways associated with `` neurotransmitters , '' `` axon guidance , '' and those incorporating `` RASopathy '' genes in the development of NDD in CHD patients. These findings suggest that an increase in novel and rare variants in known CHD and/or NDD genes is associated with the development of NDD in patients with CHD. Furthermore , burden analyses point toward rare variant burden specifically in pathways related to brain development and function as contributors to NDD. Although promising variants and pathways were identified , further research , utilizing whole-genome approaches , is required prior to demonstrating clinical utility in this patient group.
