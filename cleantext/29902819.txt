  This case report presents investigations of muscle problems in three male water buffaloes ( 1-2 years) kept extensively ( loose housing , pasture). The bulls were presented because of listlessness<symptom> and increased lying periods. They displayed difficulties to stand up , a stilted gait , and tremor<symptom> in the legs. The determination of the selenium concentration by the measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in whole blood samples ( EDTA) demonstrated selenium deficiency in all three buffaloes. This confirmed the tentative diagnosis of nutritive myodystrophy due to selenium deficiency. Following a single injection of 1500 mg all-rac-alpha-tocopherol acetate and 11 mg sodium selenite , the bulls recovered clinically. The whole blood samples taken subsequently from seven adult water buffaloes on the farm showed selenium deficiency in all animals. Consequently , slow-release multi-trace element boluses were administered once orally- as far as possible- to all adult animals of the herd. After 1 year , a good to very good selenium supply was observed in all these buffaloes , except for one cow , in which bolus application had failed.
