  Background The results of skin and blood allergen testing are not consistently relevant to clinical manifestations in allergic patients. Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between severity of allergic rhinitis and different allergen diagnostic tests in Dermatophagoides species-sensitized patients. Methods Study subjects included 65 rhinitis patients-50 with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ( DP) sensitization ( DP +) and 15 without DP sensitization ( DP-) , and 15 DP + and 37 DP- healthy controls ( HCs) confirmed by allergen skin prick ( SPT) and blood specific immunoglobulin E ( sIgE) tests. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire ( RQLQ) was tested. All subjects underwent DP nasal provocation test ( DP-NPT). Visual analogue scoring ( VAS) of nasal symptoms and nasal airway resistance ( NAR) were measured before and after NPT. Correlations between the 3 allergen tests and score of RQLQ were performed. Results All rhinitis subjects had significantly higher VAS and NAR after DP-NPT than HCs ( P < .01). All DP + rhinitis , 40 % of DP- rhinitis subjects , 13.3 % of DP + HCs and 0 % of DP- HCs had positive DP-NPT. Dose of positive DP-NPT positively correlated with SPT diameter and sIgE level in all tested subjects ( P < .001). Score of RQLQ positively correlated with dose of DP-NPT ( P < .001) , but not with SPT diameter and sIgE level in rhinitis patients. Conclusion Although DP nasal provocation , skin prick wheal size and blood sIgE level correlate with each other , only nasal provocation testing is associated with severity of nasal symptoms. It is suggested that NPT should be performed to verify a clinically relevant allergy.
