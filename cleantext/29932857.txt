  Recombinant human growth hormone ( rHGH) has become a target of abuse in the sporting world. Conversely , sports medicine clinicians may encounter athletes using rHGH to achieve normalcy in the context of growth hormone ( GH) deficiency. Medline and PubMed databases were queried using the following keywords: GH , GH physiology , GH deficiency , acromegaly , GH athlete , GH sports , GH athletic performance , and GH deficiency concussion. Articles focusing on GH physiology , deficiency , excess , and its effects in both deficient and healthy patients were included. Clinical review. Level 3. GH is a naturally occurring hormone with important roles in human physiology. Patients with GH deficiency ( GHD) present variably , and GHD has numerous etiologies. rHGH treatment has substantial therapeutic benefits for patients with GHD. The benefits of rHGH treatment in otherwise-healthy adults are uncertain. GH excess may cause health problems such as acromegaly. Professional , collegiate , and international sports leagues and associations have banned rHGH use to maintain athlete health , safety , and fair play. Athletes misusing GH may face prolonged suspensions from competition. Implementing GH abuse testing is challenging , but new methods , such as the biomarker testing procedure , are being finalized. rHGH is not only an important therapeutic agent for GH-deficient patients but also a target of abuse in competitive athletics. Its benefits in a healthy , adult population are uncertain. A safe exercise and competition plan , developed with a physician knowledgeable of GH use , physiology , and abuse potential , should be of benefit to a longitudinal clinician-patient relationship.
