  Growth and characterization of advanced group IV semiconductor materials with CMOS-compatible applications are demonstrated , both in photonics. The investigated GeSn/SiGeSn heterostructures combine direct bandgap GeSn active layers with indirect gap ternary SiGeSn claddings , a design proven its worth already decades ago in the III-V material system. Different types of double heterostructures and multi-quantum wells ( MQWs) are epitaxially grown with varying well thicknesses and barriers. The retaining high material quality of those complex structures is probed by advanced characterization methods , such as atom probe tomography and dark-field electron holography to extract composition parameters and strain , used further for band structure calculations. Special emphasis is put on the impact of carrier confinement and quantization effects , evaluated by photoluminescence and validated by theoretical calculations. As shown , particularly MQW heterostructures promise the highest potential for efficient next generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ( CMOS)- compatible group IV lasers.
