  The potential for toxic contaminants and nutrient pollution to alter natural cycles of estuarine phytoplankton blooms is well known , yet few studies have examined how these combined stressors affect harmful algal species. Here , a robust testing protocol was developed to enable an ecotoxicological assessment of responses to commonly co-occurring estuarine contaminants by harmful algal bloom species. The population growth and toxicity ( as cell density and hemolytic activity , respectively) of a cultured strain of the toxigenic raphidiophycean , Chattonella subsalsa , were assessed in two experiments ( duration 10 days and 28 days) across a gradient of atrazine concentrations and N :P ratios simulating nutrient-rich versus nutrient-depleted regimes. The response of this large-celled , slowly growing alga to atrazine × nutrients depended on growth phase; atrazine was most inhibitory during early exponential population growth ( day 10) , whereas nutrient regime was a more important influence during later phases of growth ( day 28). Without atrazine , toxicity toward fish was highest in low-P cultures. At atrazine levels > 25 μg L
