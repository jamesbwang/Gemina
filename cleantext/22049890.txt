  Neonatal<pathogen> sepsis<pathogen> , one of the leading causes of mortality in neonatal intensive care units ( NICU) of developing countries like Nepal , is often not extensively studied. In order to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal<pathogen> sepsis<pathogen> , neonatologists should have a keen knowledge of the existing bacteriological flora and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. In this study , we aim to determine the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of culture positive neonatal<pathogen> sepsis<pathogen> in the NICU of a tertiary teaching hospital in Nepal. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all blood culture positive sepsis<pathogen> cases among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Patan Hospital , Nepal between April 15 , 2014 and April 15 , 2017. All neonates with a clinical suspicion of sepsis<pathogen> with a positive blood culture were identified. Patient demographics , clinical details , maternal risk factors , and laboratory data including bacteriological profiles and antimicrobial susceptibilities were recorded and analyzed. Of the 336 neonates admitted in the NICU , 69 ( 20.5 %) had culture-positive sepsis.<pathogen> The majority were early-onset sepsis<pathogen> ( n = 54 , 78.3 %) and were among the preterm babies ( n = 47 , 68.1 %). Most bacterial isolates were gram-negative , predominantly the Klebsiella<pathogen> species ( n = 23 , 33.3 %). Klebsiella<pathogen> showed high resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as; Cefotaxime ( 90.5 %) , Gentamicin ( 75 %) , Ciprofloxacin ( 76.2 %) , Ofloxacin ( 72.2 %) and Chloramphenicol ( 65 %). However , they showed good susceptibility to Carbapenems ( 100 %) , Colistin ( 88.8 %) and Tigecycline ( 81.8 %). Among cultures with gram-positive species , Coagulase-negative Staphylococci ( CONS) ( n = 14 , 20.3 %) predominated. CONS showed high resistance to Oxacillin ( 80 %) , Cefotaxime ( 66.7 %) and Meropenem ( 80 %) but good susceptibility ( 100 %) to Vancomycin and Linezolid. Prevalence of multidrug-resistant strain was 73.9 %. Klebsiella<pathogen> species and CONS were the most common causes of neonatal<pathogen> sepsis<pathogen> in our study. A significant proportion of the isolates were multidrug resistant strains , which pose a great threat to neonatal survival , and thereby , warrant modification of existing empirical therapy. Implementation of effective preventive strategies to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance is urgently needed. We recommend a combination of Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Ofloxacin as the first line therapy and combination of Vancomycin and Meropenem as the second line empirical therapy in our NICU.
