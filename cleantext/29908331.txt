  Improvement of problematic dissolution and solubility properties of a model drug , furosemide , was investigated for poly ( amidoamine) ( PAMAM) dendrimer complexes of the drug. Full and half generation dendrimers with amino and ester terminals respectively , were studied. In vitro release performance of these complexes was investigated at drug loads ranging 5-60 % using simulated gastric fluids. Full generation dendrimers accommodated higher drug loads , outperformed half-generation complexes , and free drug. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated that the dendrimer complexes markedly improved in the bioavailability of the drug compared to the unformulated drug. The G3.0-PAMAM dendrimer complex showed a two-fold increase in C
