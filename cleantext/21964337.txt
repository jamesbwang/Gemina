  The dynamical and chemical characteristics of unusually low Arctic ozone events in 2005 and 2011 have been well-studied. However , the quantitative identification of Arctic ozone sources is lacking. Here , we use tagged ozone tracers in a numerical simulation to quantify the contributions to Arctic lower stratospheric ozone ( ARCLS_O
