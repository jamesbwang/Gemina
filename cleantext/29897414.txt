  Single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq) has enabled studies of tissue composition at unprecedented resolution. However , the application of scRNA-seq to clinical cancer samples has been limited , partly due to a lack of scRNA-seq algorithms that integrate genomic mutation data. To address this , we present. COpy-Number analysis In single-Cell RNA-Sequencing. CONICS is a software tool for mapping gene expression from scRNA-seq to tumor clones and phylogenies , with routines enabling: the quantitation of copy-number alterations in scRNA-seq , robust separation of neoplastic cells from tumor-infiltrating stroma , inter-clone differential-expression analysis , and intra-clone co-expression analysis. CONICS is written in Python and R , and is available from https://github.com/diazlab/CONICS. aaron.diaz@.ucsf.edu. Supplementary data are available from Bioinformatics online.
