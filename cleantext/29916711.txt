  A benchtop stable , bifunctional reagent for the redox-neutral cyclopropanation of olefins has been developed. Triethylammonium bis ( catecholato) iodomethylsilicate can be readily prepared on multigram scale. Using this reagent in combination with an organic photocatalyst and visible light , cyclopropanation of an array of olefins , including trifluoromethyl- and pinacolatoboryl-substituted alkenes , can be accomplished in a matter of hours. The reaction is highly tolerant of traditionally reactive functional groups ( carboxylic acids , basic heterocycles , alkyl halides , etc.) and permits the chemoselective cyclopropanation of polyolefinated compounds. Mechanistic interrogation revealed that the reaction proceeds via a rapid anionic 3- exo- tet ring closure , a pathway consistent with experimental and computational data.
