  Adolescents and young adults ( AYAs) form a unique group of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). They differ in terms of disease biology , psychosocial challenges , survival , and in other important respects from children as well as from middle-aged and older adults. AYAs may be treated using pediatric protocols developed in trials composed primarily of younger patients , or using adult protocols developed in trials composed primarily of older patients. After reviewing the distinguishing characteristics of AYAs with AML , we compare and contrast the chemotherapy approaches and argue that neither the pediatric nor adult approaches may be ideally suited for AYAs and the development of AYA-specific approaches merits further consideration. We finish by putting forth ideas for future research to optimize chemotherapy treatment of AYAs with AML.
