  Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs) expressed on the cell plasma membrane are ligand-gated ion channels mediating fast synaptic transmission , regulating neurotransmitter and cytokine release and supporting the viability of many cell types. The nAChRs expressed in mitochondria regulate the release of pro-apoptotic factors , like cytochrome
