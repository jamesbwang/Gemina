  The current work is an attempt to illustrate the importance of using passive soil gas as an innovative investigation technique in the assessment of soil and groundwater pollutions that emanates from volatile hydrocarbon activities in newly emerging countries. Bazian Oil Refinery as one of the largest refinery in Iraqi Kurdistan Region produces 40,000 barrels a day and provides a wide range of petroleum products for daily consumption. The types and scale of different process that happen in this industrial site have led to concerns with regard to its impact on both the soil and groundwater the vicinity of the factory. The researcher conducted a combined sampling design with a dual-phased extraction procedure for soil vapor and groundwater samples in order to assess the susceptibility of the subsurface to pollution with hydrocarbon. The aims were to characterize potential source ( s) , map the areal extent of the site which is at risk to be affected with the identified9 hydrocarbon compounds and vapor. A collection kit from Beacon Environmental Service was used to collect a total number of 50 passive soil vapors in the first step of work. To extrapolate results , five shallow boring for soils and six for water sampling were carefully observed. The selection of the sampling points was based on the results revealed by the PSG survey that showed significant quantities of analyzed organic hydrocarbon for a follow-up investigation. The matrices were analyzed by ALS Laboratory to target more than 40 VOCs and SVOCs. The plan was to make the mass to concentration tie-in for the selected analyzed compounds ( Benzene , Toluene , and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons) from the PSG in mass ( nanograms) with both the soil and water samples in concentration. The results revealed that the PSG technique is unique in identifying the source and extent of soil and groundwater pollutions plume.
