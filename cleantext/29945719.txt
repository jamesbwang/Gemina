  Alzheimer 's disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among elderly persons. Overt accumulation and aggregation of the amyloid β peptide ( Aβ) is thought to be the initial causative factor for Alzheimer 's disease. Aβ is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 ( BACE1) is the initial and rate-limiting protease for the generation of Aβ. Therefore , inhibiting BACE1 is considered one of the most promising therapeutic approaches for potential treatment of Alzheimer 's disease. Currently , several drugs blocking this enzyme ( BACE inhibitors) are being evaluated in clinical trials. However , high-dosage BACE-inhibitor treatment interferes with structural and functional synaptic plasticity in mice. These adverse side effects may mask the therapeutic benefit of lowering the Aβ concentration. In this review , we focus on the consequences of BACE inhibition-mediated synaptic deficits and the potential clinical implications.
