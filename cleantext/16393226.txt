  The development of colorectal cancer in long-standing Crohn 's disease ( CD) patients has become a major complication. Therapeutic guidelines for CD-associated cancer ( CDAC) have already been established in Western countries; however , specific guidelines are not currently available in Japan. Surveillance of the residual intestine for cancer screening is important for long-standing CD patients. The present case report describes the occurrence of rectal carcinoma in a patient with a 25-year history of CD. A 37-year-old male with a 17-year history of CD underwent semi-emergent subtotal colectomy and ileostomy for bowel obstruction secondary to the transverse colon stenosis , and multiple severe stenosis and inflammation<symptom>. Postoperatively , the patient resumed pharmacological treatment and underwent follow-up colonoscopies at ~ 1-2-year intervals. Despite continued pharmacological treatment , inflammation<symptom> continued in the residual rectum. A total of 8 years following the primary operation , colonoscopy revealed inflammatory polyposis at the remnant rectum , which was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. The interval between the last colonoscopy was 16 months. The patient then underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection , and remained without recurrence for 12 months following resection. Thus , in long-standing CD patients , annual colonoscopy of the residual intestine may be considered for cancer screening , and specific surveillance guidelines for CDAC should be established.
