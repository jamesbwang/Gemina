  Despite intense attention from biomedical and chemical researchers , there are few approved treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) , with only riluzole ( Rilutek) and edaravone ( Radicava) currently available to patients. Moreover , the mechanistic basis of the activity of these drugs is currently not well-defined , limiting the ability to design new medicines for ALS. This Letter describes the synthesis of triazole-containing riluzole analogues , and their testing in a novel neuroprotective assay. Seven compounds were identified as having neuroprotective activity , with two compounds having similar activity to riluzole.
