  A one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy intervention targeting worry significantly reduces both worry and persecutory delusions ( Freeman et al. , 2015). To adapt this intervention for group delivery and conduct a feasibility trial within routine clinical practice. Thirteen participants were randomized to a weekly 8-session worry intervention group ( n = 7) or wait-list control ( n = 6). All but one participant completed measures at all time points. Participants attended an average of six therapy sessions. Recruitment , retention and therapy uptake were feasible. Observed treatment effects were in the expected direction , but may be diluted compared with one-to-one interventions.
