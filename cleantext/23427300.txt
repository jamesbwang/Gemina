  Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) studies have demonstrated digit somatotopy in primary somatosensory cortex ( SI) , and even shown that at high spatial resolution it is possible to resolve within-digit somatotopy. However , fMRI studies have failed to resolve the spatial organisation of digit representations in secondary somatosensory cortex ( SII). One of the major limitations of high spatial resolution fMRI studies of the somatosensory system has been the long acquisition time needed to acquire slices spanning both SI and SII. Here , we exploit the increased blood oxygenation level dependent contrast of ultra-high-field ( 7 Tesla) fMRI and the use of multiband imaging to study the topographic organisation in SI and SII with high spatial resolution at the individual subject level.
