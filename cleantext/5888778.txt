  We present a lab-in-the-field experiment to demonstrate how individual behavior in the lab predicts their ability to identify phishing attempts. Using the business and finance staff members from a large public university in the U.S. , we find that participants who are intolerant of risk , more curious , and less trusting commit significantly more errors when evaluating interfaces. We also replicate prior results on demographic correlates of phishing vulnerability , including age , gender , and education level. Our results suggest that behavioral characteristics such as intolerance of risk , curiosity , and trust can be used to predict individual ability to identify phishing interfaces.
