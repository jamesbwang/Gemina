  Thermal-equilibrated finite classical lattices are considered as a minimal model of the systems showing an interplay between low-energy collective fluctuations and single-site degrees of freedom. Standard local field approach , as well as classical limit of the bosonic DMFT method , do not provide a satisfactory description of Ising and Heisenberg small lattices subjected to an external polarizing field. We show that a dramatic improvement can be achieved within a simple approach , in which the local field appears to be a fluctuating quantity related to the low-energy degree ( s) of freedom.
