  Preclinical repeated-dose toxicity and efficiency studies developed by our group suggest the potential of FITOPROT in treating mucositis. This serious limiting side effect is observed at a rate of 40-100 % in patients under antineoplastic therapy and despite different palliative measures and therapeutic agents have been investigated , still no therapy was completely successful. Therefore , this study aimed to establish the safety and recommended phase II dose of FITOPROT for the prevention and treatment of chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis ( OM) in patients with head and neck cancer. Twenty healthy adult participants were randomized into two groups that received pre-established concentrations of the collutory: group 1 ( FITOPROT A- mucoadhesive formulation containing 10 mg/mL of curcuminoids extract plus 20 % v/v of Bidens pilosa L. extract) and group 2 ( FITOPROT B- mucoadhesive formulation containing 20 mg/mL of curcuminoids extract , plus 40 % v/v of Bidens pilosa L. extract). Participants rinsed their mouths<disease> with FITOPROT , three times daily , for ten consecutive days. No participant experienced toxicity or unacceptable discomfort and/or adverse reactions ( CTCAE v5 .0) , with laboratory and clinical parameters under normal conditions. Side effects observed were low intensity and temporary mucosa/dental surface pigmentation ( n = 7) and tooth sensitivity ( n = 4) , which disappeared after formulation use ceased. No significant cellular genotoxic effects were observed ( p > 0.05) , and micronuclei frequencies were not changed ( p > 0.05). Biochemical assays reveled no altered levels of myeloperoxidase ( p = 0.2268) , malondialdehyde ( p = 0.1188) nor nitric oxide ( p = 0.5709) concentration , and no significant difference were found in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( p > 0.05). Thus , FITOPROT demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in both tested doses and is suitable for evaluation in a phase II trial as treatment against OM.
