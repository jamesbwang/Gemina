  Junior physiotherapists require satisfactory clinical skills to work effectively within the acute hospital setting for service quality and consistency. To investigate the effects of stream-specific clinical training on junior physiotherapist self-efficacy , self-rated confidence , and self-rated ability to work independently during weekend shifts. Prospective cohort study. Eighteen junior physiotherapists. Physiotherapists undertook 8 h of stream-specific education in: pediatrics , women 's health , neuro-medical , musculoskeletal , cardiorespiratory , and critical care over 8 weeks. Learning objectives were evaluated using a self-efficacy ( 0-100) scale and self-rated confidence was measured with a 4-point Likert scale ( not confident to independent). Self-rated ability to independently work weekend shifts was measured dichotomously ( yes/no). Participants completed an average of three stream-specific programs in the study period. Post-training , mean improvement in self-efficacy across objectives ranged from 2.9 ( 95 % CI -8.7 to 14.5) to 43.3 ( 95 % CI 4.8-81.8) points , p < 0.05 for 80 % of objectives. Self-rated confidence scores improved for 45.6 % of stream-specific learning objectives; 52.8 % were unchanged and 1.7 % reported a decrease in confidence. Self-rated ability to work stream-specific weekend shifts increased from 56-70 % , but no stream achieved a significant increase in staff able to independently work weekend shifts ( p range 0.10 to 1.0). A stream-specific education program increased junior physiotherapists ' self-efficacy and self-rated confidence but not perceived ability to work independently on weekends. Results were non-randomized and actual practice change was not assessed. Future studies could investigate different educational structures in a blinded , randomized manner on clinical practice change.
