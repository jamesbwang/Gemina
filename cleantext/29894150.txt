  In this work , a bistable polymer framework liquid crystal ( PFLC) thin film by thermal curing of epoxy monomers with two different thiols , a traditional flexible-structure thiol and a novel original rigid-structure thiol , has been successfully fabricated , combining a novel mixed morphology of polymer matrix and cholesteric liquid crystals with negative dielectric anisotropy. The polymer framework morphology has been formed by curing two types of epoxy monomers with two types of thiols , and the liquid crystals tend to be focal conic textures with large size domains at the initial state in the PFLC film so that it has a moderate light transmissivity at this state between the transparent state and the opaque state. Thus , the devices based on PFLC films can be switched reversibly between the transparent state and the opaque state by alternative electric field. In addition , the states can be sustained after the electric field is removed. The bistable memory effect comes from the anchoring effects of the polymer frameworks with a novel morphology in the microdomains of the PFLCs. Therefore , the optimized bistable PFLC film keeps its initial state without external electric field and any other energy consumption for a long time after altering the state by applying an instant electric field. The special polymer frameworks in the bistable PFLC films endow the films with excellent electro-optical properties and mechanical properties. The devices are energy-efficient and cost-saving and have great potential applications in energy-efficient reflective displays , electronic papers , writing tablets , and smart windows.
