  Flooding severely limits plant growth even for some aquatic plants. Although much work has been done on submergence response of some important crop plants , little is known about the response mechanism of aquatic plants , i.e. lotus ( Nelumbo nucifera). In this study , we investigated the genome-wide regulation lotus genes in response to submergence stress by high-throughput mRNA sequencing. A total of 4002 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) in lotus upon submergence stress. Among them , 1976 genes were up-regulated and 2026 down-regulated. Functional annotation of these genes by Gene ontology ( GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that they were mainly involved in processes of oxidation-reduction , abiotic stimuli , cellular metabolism and small molecule metabolism. Based on these data , previous work and quantitative RT-PCR ( RT-qPCR) validation , we constructed a cooperative regulation network involved in several important DEGs in regards to the antioxidant system , disease resistance , hypoxia resistance and morphological adaptation. Further work confirmed that several innate immunity genes were induced during submergence and might confer higher resistance to lotus rot disease. In conclusion , these results provide useful information on molecular mechanisms underlying lotus responses to submergence stress.
