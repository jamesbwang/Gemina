  Acteoside has been reported to have antioxidant and neuroprotective effect , which is a promising therapeutic way in prevention and treatment of Parkinson 's disease. The present study was aimed to understand the neuroprotective effect of acteoside and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA)- induced neural damage in zebrafish model was used to study the protective effect of acteoside on Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Locomotion behavioral test showed that acteoside could prevent 6-OHDA-stimulated movement disorders. Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) whole-mount immunostaining analysis showed that acteoside could prevent 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron death. In addition , pretreatment with acteoside could upregulate antioxidative enzymes by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in zebrafish. Meanwhile , acteoside was found to be distributed in the brain after intraperitoneal injection into the adult zebrafish , indicating that this compound could penetrate the blood-brain-barrier ( BBB). This study demonstrated that acteoside could penetrate BBB and have potential therapeutic value for PD by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and attenuating the oxidative stress.
