  Zeolitic-imidazole frameworks ( ZIFs) , as novel porous materials , are attracting much attention in several fields due to their special advantages such as large specific surface area , versatile porosity and well-connected networks. Here , we develop a porous ZIF-derived catalytic thin film , which was coated on the conducting glass as a counter electrode ( CE) to substitute costly platinum for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells ( QDSSCs). A ZIF layer is first prepared by coating ZIF-67 powders on the conducting glass , followed by the careful calcination treatments in sulfur vapour ( sulfuration) or nitrogen gas ( carbonization). The structure and morphologies of the derived porous film are characterized by the measurements of XRD , SEM and BET , and the electrochemical properties in the polysulfide solution are evaluated by the measurements of Tafel curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. The derived porous film is used as a CE to fabricate QDSSC with CdSe quantum dot-sensitized TiO
