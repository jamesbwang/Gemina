  A new triterpenoid saponin named esculentoside U ( 1) , along with the five known compounds , was isolated and characterized from the roots of Phytolacca acinosa , a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatoid activities. The structure of the new saponin was elucidated as 3-O- ( β-D-glucopyranosyl- ( 1 → 4))- β-D-xylopyranosyl) -2 , 23-dihydroxyolean-11 , 13 ( 18)- diene-28 , 29-dioic acid 29-methyl ester ( 1). The assignment of all NMR signals of 1 was performed by means of 2D-NMR experiments.
