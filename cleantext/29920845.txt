  Cancer patients can experience work-specific cognitive symptoms post return to work. The study aims to ( 1) describe the course of work-specific cognitive symptoms in the first 18 months post return to work and ( 2) examine the associations of work characteristics , fatigue<symptom> and depressive symptoms with work-specific cognitive symptoms over time. This study used data from the 18-month longitudinal `` Work Life after Cancer '' cohort. The Cognitive Symptom Checklist-Work Dutch Version ( CSC-W DV) was used to measure work-specific cognitive symptoms. Linear mixed models were performed to examine the course of work-specific cognitive symptoms during 18-month follow-up; linear regression analyses with generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations over time. Working cancer patients examined with different cancer types were included ( n = 378). Work-specific cognitive symptoms were stable over 18 months. At baseline , cancer patients reported more working memory symptoms ( M = 32.0; CI , 30.0-34.0) compared with executive function symptoms ( M = 19.3; CI , 17.6-20.9). Cancer patients holding a job with both manual and nonmanual tasks reported less work-specific cognitive symptoms ( unstandardized regression coefficient b = -4.80; CI , -7.76 to -1.83) over time , compared with cancer patients with a nonmanual job. Over time , higher depressive symptoms were related to experiencing more overall work-specific cognitive symptoms ( b = 1.27; CI , 1.00-1.55) and a higher fatigue<symptom> score was related to more working memory symptoms ( b = 0.13; CI , 0.04-0.23). Job type should be considered when looking at work-specific cognitive symptoms over time in working cancer patients. To reduce work-specific cognitive symptoms , interventions targeted at fatigue<symptom> and depressive symptoms might be promising.
