  In recent years , large-scale genomic studies have expanded our knowledge regarding genomic drivers in tumors of the central nervous system. While histopathologic analysis of brain tumors remains the primary method for tumor classification , the clinical utility of molecular and genomic testing to support and/or complement tumor classification continues to expand. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and provides clinicians with objective data to facilitate discussions regarding prognosis and treatment decisions , including selection of clinical trials. Ensuring accurate diagnoses is fundamental to the management of brain tumor patients. However , given the morphologic overlap among primary brain tumors , genomic data can be used to help distinguish tumor lineage. In its clearest form , we have embraced the concept of an integrated diagnosis , which combines traditional histopathology findings with molecular and genomic data. Patient prognosis varies significantly based on a tumor 's genomic profile. For neuro-oncology patients , outcome studies linking diagnoses with genomic profiles show significant differences based on tumor biomarkers such as IDH1/2 , H3F3A , BRAF , and CDKN2A and TERT status. Therefore , easy access to reliable genomic data is important in understanding a patient 's disease and developing a clinical strategy wherein targeted molecular or immune therapies can be incorporated into the discussion.
