  An 80-year-old male presented with a history of a hard right parotid<symptom> mass that had gradually increased in size , with subsequent facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed. The cytologic specimens contained a substantial number of sheet-like clusters or small groups of a mixture of plasmacytoid , oval to spindled , or large epithelioid cells having hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei , abundant cytoplasm with occasional inclusion body-like materials , and prominent nucleoli , in a relatively clear background. We first interpreted it as a carcinoma , suggestive of myoepithelial differentiation. Radical parotidectomy was performed , and a gross examination of the neoplasm revealed a non-capsulated and ill-defined tumor lesion<symptom> , with a grayish or yellowish cut surface , associated with fat invasion. On a microscopic examination , the tumor was predominantly composed of the solid proliferation of atypical cells including a mixture of oval to spindled , plasmacytoid , or epithelioid cells , often arranged in a trabecular and reticular growth pattern with patchy eosinophilic hyalinized stroma. Immunohistochemistry showed that the carcinoma cells were specifically positive for p63 , cytokeratins , and vimentin. Finally , electron microscopy demonstrated that their phenotype was consistent with a myoepithelial origin containing many bundles of variably thin actin filaments. Therefore , we finally made a diagnosis of myoepithelial carcinoma , defined as the malignant counterpart of benign myoepithelioma. We should be aware that owing to its characteristic cytological features , cytopathologists may be able to make a correct diagnosis of myoepithelial carcinoma , based on multiple and adequate samplings.
