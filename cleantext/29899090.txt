  Influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen and a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Nucleoprotein ( NP) is an abundant IAV<pathogen> protein essential for multiple steps of viral life cycle. Our recent proteomic study of the IAV-host interaction network found that the tripartite motif containing 41 ( TRIM41) , a ubiquitin E3 ligase , interacted with NP. However , the role of TRIM41 in IAV<pathogen> infection is unknown. Here , we report that TRIM41 interacts with NP through its SPRY domain. Furthermore , TRIM41 is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells and overexpression of TRIM41 inhibits IAV<pathogen> infection. Conversely , RNA interference ( RNAi) and knockout of TRIM41 increase host susceptibility to IAV<pathogen> infection. As a ubiquitin E3 ligase , TRIM41 ubiquitinates NP
