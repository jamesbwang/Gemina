  The current standard of care for glioblastoma ( GBM) constitutes maximal safe surgical resection , followed by fractionated radiation and temozolomide. This treatment regimen is logistically burdensome , and in a healthcare system in which access to care is variable , there may be patients with worsened outcomes due to inadequate access to optimal treatment. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with GBM in 2006-2014. Patients were grouped according to insurance status: private insurance , Medicare , Medicaid , or uninsured. Treatments provided ( surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy) were compared between groups in univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. A total of 61,614 patients were analyzed. Compared to private insurance , the odds of surgery for Medicaid and uninsured patients were 0.72 ( 95 % C.I. 0.66-0.79) and 0.77 ( 95 % C.I. 0.69-0.87) , respectively ( p < .001). The multivariable odds of receiving radiotherapy were 0.91 ( 95 % C.I. 0.86-0.96) , 0.62 ( 95 % C.I. 0.57-0.68) and 0.47 ( 95 % C.I. 0.43-0.52) for Medicare , Medicaid , and uninsured patients , respectively ( all p < .001). In addition , the odds of receiving chemotherapy were 0.94 ( 95 % C.I. 0.89-0.99) , 0.53 ( 95 % C.I. 0.49-0.57) , and 0.41 ( 95 % C.I. 0.38-0.46) for Medicare , Medicaid , and uninsured patients , respectively ( all p < .001). Insurance status and type of insurance coverage appears to impact treatments rendered for GBM , independent of other variables. Furthermore , we find that such differential access to care significantly impacts survival. Ensuring adequate access to care for all patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is critical to optimize survival , especially as therapies continue to advance.
