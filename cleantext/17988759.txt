  Research devoted to investigating the relationship between elevation and seed size in alpine plants gives contradictory results. Some studies document a positive correlation between seed size and elevation , whereas in others a negative correlation is reported. We propose a novel approach to the problem by looking at the whole strategy of seed production , including seed number , and by focusing on a range of environmental variables. In the Tatra Mountains ( southern Poland) , we selected 73 sites at which seeds of six widely occurring mountain<disease> herbaceous species were collected. Each site was characterized by 13 parameters that included climatic and physicochemical soil variables. For each parameter , residuals from a linear regression against elevation were calculated and the residuals were used in a factor analysis. The obtained factors , together with elevation , were used as independent variables in a multiple regression analysis. Elevation affected seed size in four species: in two species the correlation was positive , and in two others it was negative. In three species seed number was related to elevation , and the correlation was negative in all cases. Our results indicate that elevation-dependence of seed production is specific to the species and reflects different resource allocation strategies. Diverse correlations of plant characteristics with elevation may also result from area-specific patterns , because different mountain<disease> ranges may exhibit different correlations between elevation and environmental factors. Only by attaining a reproductive allocation perspective and thorough assessment of environmental factors , a full understanding of elevational variation in seed size is possible.
