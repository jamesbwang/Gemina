  Mechanical ventilation with O Determine if apoptosis and lung growth arrest evoked by MV-O 5d-old mice underwent MV with air or 40 % O MV with air or 40 % O EGFR-Klf4 is a novel pro-survival signaling pathway in lung that MV disrupts. Elafin preserves pEGFR-Klf4 signaling and inhibits apoptosis , thereby enabling lung growth during MV. Our animal and human data together beg the question: would elastase inhibition prevent BPD in high-risk infants exposed to MV-O
