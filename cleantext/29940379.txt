  The development of an intraparenchymal cyst<symptom> following deep brain stimulation ( DBS) surgery is an uncommon complication that lacks a clearly-defined management strategy. The pathophysiology is not known and may be related to peri-electrode edema<symptom> or cerebrospinal fluid tracking. Previous case reports have described various therapies for symptomatic cysts<symptom> including hardware removal or conservative therapy with steroids. We present a male patient with bilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus for management of essential tremor<symptom> , who developed a cystic cavitation at the left electrode tip and was followed without treatment. This patient developed dysarthria<symptom> , gait impairment and unilateral motor deficits 3 months after surgery. Peri-electrode edema<symptom> was initially identified , eventually coalescing into a cystic cavitation at the electrode tip. Cystic regression and symptomatic improvement were observed without any surgical or medical intervention , with full cyst<symptom> resolution by 17 months. Only 15 additional cases have been reported in the literature , although the true incidence may be underreported due to varying practices in obtaining post-operative scans. Cysts<symptom> were identified in symptomatic patients on average at 6.2 months after surgery. All symptomatic cysts<symptom> were treated with hardware removal or steroid therapy. Observation alone may be sufficient when a DBS-associated cyst<symptom> is identified. More reports are needed to characterize this rare complication.
