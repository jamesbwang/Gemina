  Ventilator-induced lung injury develops from interactions between the lung parenchyma and applied mechanical power. In acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> , the lung is smaller size with an inhomogeneous structure. The same mechanical force applied on a reduced parenchyma would produce volutrauma; the concentration of mechanical forces at inhomogeneous interfaces produces atelectrauma. Higher positive end-expiratory pressures favor volutrauma and reduce atelectrauma; lower values do the opposite. Volutrauma and atelectrauma harms and benefits , however , seem to be equivalent at 5 to 15 cm H
