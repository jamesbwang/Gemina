  In this study , a convenient , sensitive , rapid and simple method was developed on microfluidic chip which was integrated with on-line complexing and laser-induced fluorescence detection. A rhodamine derivative ( RD) was developed as a fluorescent chemosensor for Hg ( II). It exhibited high selective recognition toward Hg ( II) over other examined metal ions in water samples. Under the optimized conditions , the response was linearly proportional to the concentration of Hg ( II) in the range of 0-70 μM with a detection limit of 0.031 μM. Satisfactory repeatability and reproducibility were achieved , with a relative standard deviation ( RSD) of 6.62 %. The established method was successfully applied for the determination of Hg ( II) in environmental water samples ( surface water , tap water , and waste water). Recoveries obtained for the determination of Hg ( II) in spiking samples ranged from 85 % to 103 %.
