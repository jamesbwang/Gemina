  Studies have described the experiences of racial microaggressions in everyday life and on college campuses , yet prior research has not explored how microaggressions and microaffirmations are experienced by students who are first in their family to attend college. This qualitative investigation of 296 open-ended survey responses described the lived experiences of first-generation college students at a large , public , predominately White institution. Students experienced microaggressions in the form microinsults , microassaults , and microinvalidations , and microaffirmations in the form of microsupports , microcompliments , and microvalidations on campus. Study implications include the development and implementation of regular positive and intentional communications by faculty , staff , and peers on college campuses. ( PsycINFO Database Record
