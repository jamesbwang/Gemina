  Binge drinking appears to be a risk factor , facilitator , and method of suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury for some American Indian ( AI) youth. We examined characteristics , patterns , and motivations for binge use among AI adolescents ( N = 69; 10-19 years-old) who recently engaged in binge drinking. The majority used alcohol alone ( 53.7 %) or a combination of alcohol and marijuana ( 31.3 %) for their binge event. Gender differences emerged with boys more severely affected than girls. Forty-seven percent reported lifetime suicidal thoughts. This study represents one of the first in-depth examinations of substance use and related behaviors among AI adolescents who have engaged in recent binge use.
