  The development of high-performance thermal management materials to dissipate excessive heat both in plane and through plane is of special interest to maintain efficient operation and prolong the life of electronic devices. Herein , we designed and constructed a graphene-based composite film , which contains chiral liquid crystals ( cellulose nanocrystals , CNCs) inside graphene oxide ( GO). The composite film was prepared by annealing and compacting of self-assembled GO-CNC , which contains chiral smectic liquid crystal structures. The helical arranged nanorods of carbonized CNC act as in-plane connections , which bridge neighboring graphene sheets. More interestingly , the chiral structures also act as through-plane connections , which bridge the upper and lower graphene layers. As a result , the graphene-based composite film shows extraordinary thermal conductivity , in both in-plane ( 1820.4 W m
