  Soils are a major reservoir of semivolatile organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) , and exert a control on their atmospheric occurrence. We present here an assessment of the atmospheric occurrence and seasonality of soil/snow-air partitioning and exchange of PCBs , PAHs , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB) , and hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs) in the arctic city Troms√∏ , northern Norway. The fugacities of the organic pollutants in soils and snow were determined using a soil fugacity sampler by equilibrating the air concentrations with those in the surface soil/snow. The concentrations in soils did not show a significant seasonality. Conversely , the ambient air concentrations and the soil ( or snow) fugacity showed a clear seasonality for PCBs , HCH , HCB and some PAHs , related to temperature. Fugacities in soil/snow were correlated with those in the ambient gas phase , suggesting a close seasonal air-soil/snow coupling. Generally , there was a net deposition or close to equilibrium conditions during the winter , which contrasts with the net volatilization observed during the warmer periods. The chemicals with lower octanol-air partition coefficients showed a larger tendency for being volatilized and thus remobilized from this coastal arctic environment. Conversely , the more hydrophobic compounds were close to air-soil/snow equilibrium or showed a net deposition.
