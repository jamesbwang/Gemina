  This work describes a new method for the determination of organic compounds in solid samples based on the equilibrium desorption of the analytes in an aqueous phase followed by stir bar sorptive-dispersive microextraction ( SBSDME). Sand samples , contaminated with UV filters due to bathing and recreational activities , were dispersed in an aqueous medium by using a coated stir bar with CoFe
