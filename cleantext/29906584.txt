  Automatic text summarization offers an efficient solution to access the ever-growing amounts of both scientific and clinical literature in the biomedical domain by summarizing the source documents while maintaining their most informative contents. In this paper , we propose a novel graph-based summarization method that takes advantage of the domain-specific knowledge and a well-established data mining technique called frequent itemset mining. Our summarizer exploits the Unified Medical Language System ( UMLS) to construct a concept-based model of the source document and mapping the document to the concepts. Then , it discovers frequent itemsets to take the correlations among multiple concepts into account. The method uses these correlations to propose a similarity function based on which a represented graph is constructed. The summarizer then employs a minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithm to discover various subthemes of the document. Eventually , it generates the final summary by selecting the most informative and relative sentences from all subthemes within the text. We perform an automatic evaluation over a large number of summaries using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation ( ROUGE) metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed summarization system outperforms various baselines and benchmark approaches. The carried out research suggests that the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and frequent itemset mining equips the summarization system in a better way to address the informativeness measurement of the sentences. Moreover , clustering the graph nodes ( sentences) can enable the summarizer to target different main subthemes of a source document efficiently. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of the summarization systems in the biomedical domain.
