  Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome<disease> characterized by the development of multiple nervous system tumors. This disorder is also called multiple inherited schwannomas , meningiomas , and ependymomas syndrome<disease>. In this report , we discuss the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in a 17-year-old patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 , who had extensive cranial nerves involvement ( 3rd-12th cranial nerves) along with spinal involvement. It is very rare to find tumors affect nearly all cranial nerves ( namely 3rd-12th nerves) , and their association with meningiomas and intramedullary spinal cord tumors in the same patient.
