  The distinctive cell walls of mycobacteria are characteristic features of these bacteria. Individual cell wall components influence diverse mycobacterial phenotypes , such as colony morphology , virulence and stress resistance. To investigate the role of the hypothetical protein Rv2387 , we constructed a Mycobacterium<pathogen> smegmatis<pathogen> strain that heterologously expressed this ORF<pathogen> , and we observed that the M.<pathogen> smegmatis<pathogen> strain expressing Rv2387 exhibited altered colony morphology and cell wall lipid composition , leading to a marked decrease in the resistance against acidic conditions. This study demonstrates that due to its impact on cell wall remodeling , Rv2387 might play an important role in mycobacterial physiology.
