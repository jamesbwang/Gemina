  Longitudinal , well phenotyped , population-based cohort studies offer unique research opportunities in the context of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) , including GWAS for new-onset ( incident) cardiovascular disease ( CVD) events , the assessment of gene x lifestyle interactions , and evaluating the incremental predictive utility of genetic information in apparently healthy individuals. Furthermore , comprehensively phenotyped community-dwelling samples have contributed to GWAS of numerous traits that reflect normal organ function ( e.g. , cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic function) and for many traits along the CVD continuum ( e.g. , risk factors , circulating biomarkers , and subclinical disease traits). These GWAS have heretofore identified many genetic loci implicated in normal organ function and different stages of the CVD continuum. Finally , population-based cohort studies have made important contributions to Mendelian Randomization analyses , a statistical approach that uses genetic information to assess observed associations between cardiovascular traits and clinical CVD outcomes for potential causality.
