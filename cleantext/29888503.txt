  As tumour protein 53 ( p53) isoforms have tumour-promoting , migration , and inflammatory properties , this study investigated whether p53 isoforms contributed to glioblastoma progression. The expression levels of full-length TP53α ( TAp53α) and six TP53 isoforms were quantitated by RT-qPCR in 89 glioblastomas and correlated with TP53 mutation status , tumour-associated macrophage content , and various immune cell markers. Elevated levels of Δ133p53β mRNA characterised glioblastomas with increased CD163-positive macrophages and wild-type TP53. In situ-based analyses found Δ133p53β expression localised to malignant cells in areas with increased hypoxia , and in cells with the monocyte chemoattractant protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 ( CCL2) expressed. Tumours with increased Δ133p53β had increased numbers of cells positive for macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor ( CSF1R) and programmed death ligand 1 ( PDL1). In addition , cells expressing a murine ` mimic ' of Δ133p53 ( Δ122p53) were resistant to temozolomide treatment and oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that elevated Δ133p53β is an alternative pathway to TP53 mutation in glioblastoma that aids tumour progression by promoting an immunosuppressive and chemoresistant environment. Adding Δ133p53β to a TP53 signature along with TP53 mutation status will better predict treatment resistance in glioblastoma. © 2018 The Authors.
