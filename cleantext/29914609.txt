  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a heterogeneous condition that can differ in its clinical manifestation , structural changes and response to treatment. To identify subgroups of COPD with distinct phenotypes , evaluate the distribution of phenotypes in four related regions and calculate the 1-year change in lung function and quality of life according to subgroup. Using clinical characteristics , we performed factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis in a cohort of 1676 COPD patients from 13 Asian cities. We compared the 1-year change in forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1) , modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale score , St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ) score and exacerbations according to subgroup derived from cluster analysis. Factor analysis revealed that body mass index , Charlson comorbidity index , SGRQ total score and FEV1 were principal factors. Using these four factors , cluster analysis identified three distinct subgroups with differing disease severity and symptoms. Among the three subgroups , patients in subgroup 2 ( severe disease and more symptoms) had the most frequent exacerbations , most rapid FEV1 decline and greatest decline in SGRQ total score. Three subgroups with differing severities and symptoms were identified in Asian COPD subjects.
