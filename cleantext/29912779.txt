  In this study , perioperative and short-term postoperative results of totally robotic versus totally laparoscopic rectal resections for cancer were investigated in a comparative manner by considering risk factors including obesity , male sex , and neoadjuvant treatment. In addition to overall comparison , the impact of sex , obesity ( body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m) , and neoadjuvant treatment was assessed in patients who had a total mesorectal excision ( TME). Operative time was longer in the robotic group ( P < 0.001). In obese patients who underwent TME , the mean length of hospital stay was shorter ( 7 ± 2 vs. 9 ± 4 d , P = 0.01) , and the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was higher ( 30 ± 19 vs. 23 ± 10 , P = 0.02) in the robotic group. Totally robotic and totally laparoscopic surgery appears to be providing similar outcomes in patients undergoing rectal resections for cancer. Selective use of a robot may have a role for improving postoperative outcomes in some challenging cases including obese patients undergoing TME.
