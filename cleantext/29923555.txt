  The particle tracking analysis ( PTA) method has been widely used to determine the size of nanoparticles from their Brownian motion , using the Stokes-Einstein assumption. However , the size distribution obtained by PTA is broader than the true distribution because of the uncertainties in determining the diffusion coefficients , and a correction of such a broadening effect is essential to obtain reliable results. In order to transform the apparent broadened size distribution from the PTA method to the true size distribution , we begin by approximating the true size distribution as a gamma distribution determined by a shape parameter and a scale parameter , and then we perform a hybrid analysis based on the maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian parameter inference that accounts for the uncertainties in determining the diffusion coefficients. To examine the accuracy of our analysis , we compared the size distributions of polystyrene-latex spherical nanoparticles obtained by this transformation process , dynamic light scattering , and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation with multi-angle light scattering ( AF4-MALS). The transformed size distribution resulting from applying our Brownian motion correction to apparent PTA data agrees well with that obtained from AF4-MALS , indicating the success of the correction in obtaining the true nanoparticle size distribution.
