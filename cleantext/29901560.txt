  Health-related quality of life ( HRQL) improved progressively during therapy and beyond in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ( DFCI) 95-01 protocol. This study aimed to validate that trajectory in a successor study ( DFCI 00-01) and to compare the HRQL of patients in the 2 studies. Children aged above 5 years were assessed during each phase of treatment ( N = 4) and 2 years after completion of therapy. Health status and HRQL were measured using Health Utilities Index ( HUI) instruments , HUI2 and HUI3. Quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) were calculated and compared with the general population , and patients treated on DFCI 95-01. Over 5 intervals and 758 HUI assessments , mean HRQL increased progressively from remission induction to the time after treatment ( P < 0.001). During intensification , high-risk patients had lower HRQL than standard-risk patients ( P < 0.001). During remission induction , patients on DFCI 95-01 had lower HRQL than patients on DFCI 00-01. Patients on DFCI 00-01 had ~ 0.2 and 0.3 fewer QALYs than controls , measured by HUI2 and HUI3 , respectively. QALYs for DFCI 00-01 patients during treatment were similar to those for DFCI 95-01 patients. The trajectory of improvement in HRQL during the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> in children was confirmed.
