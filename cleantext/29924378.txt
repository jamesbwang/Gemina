  The plasma-derived atherogenic index ( AIP) is associated with an increasing risk for cardiovascular diseases. Whether an increased AIP may predict the complexity of percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) of chronic total occlusion ( CTO) , according to available research , has never been investigated before. 317 patients were included prospectively and treated with PCI for at least one CTO between 2012 and 2017. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) and triglycerides ( TG) plasma levels were measured 24 h before PCI. All patients were stratified into tertiles of AIP ( defined as 0.11 , 0.11-0.21 , > 0.21) based on their TG/HDL-C ( AIP) levels. Mean AIP of all patients undergoing CTO-PCI was 0.53 ± 0.29. The majority of patients were male ( 82.6 %) , and mean age was 61 ± 10.4 years. Increased AIP > 0.21 was associated with longer occlusion length ( statistical trend p = 0.082) and stent routes ( p = 0.022) and with a higher number of implanted stents ( n > 4) ( statistical trend p = 0.072). Success rates were similar in all AIP categories ( p = 0.461). In-hospital PCI-related complications were rare and not statistically different ( p = 0.852). This study demonstrates for the first time that an increased AIP may predict the complexity of CTO-PCI and additionally may help to improve planning and quality of CTO-PCI.
