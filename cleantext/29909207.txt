  It is important to differentiate low grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( MPNSTs) from benign nerve sheath tumors as MPNSTs may require a more aggressive treatment strategy during and after initial resection. Loss of expression of the trimethyl Histone H3 at the Lys27 position ( H3K27-me3) has recently been described in MPNSTs , and may help distinguish this tumor from pathologic mimics. A 43-year-old woman presented with symptoms of radiculopathy and a history of pelvic radiation for cervical cancer 7 years prior. Imaging and surgical pathology were initially consistent with a L5 schwannoma , including spindle morphology without mitoses and retained S100 expression. After an aggressive recurrence 11 months later , pathology was consistent with high grade MPNST including heightened mitotic activity and loss of S100 expression. After the identification of MPNST , H3K27M me3 immunostaining was applied to both the initial and recurrent pathological specimens. The initial specimen demonstrated patchy loss of H3K27M me3 expression , more consistent with low grade MPNST than schwannoma. This case highlights the role of H3K27M me3 immunostaining to help differentiate MPNSTs that may mimic more benign nerve sheath tumors , especially in patients who have a history of radiation to the region in question.
