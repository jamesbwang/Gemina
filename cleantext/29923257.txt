  I estimate the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals , taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. Based on a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and high-priced medicines in public hospitals , I use a two-way fixed effects model that controls for hospitals ' medicine-specific bargaining power and medicine-specific price trends. I find that group purchasing slightly reduces the overall prices of medicines but has no impact on the prices of medicines that have no alternative on the market. On the contrary , prices of medicines in oligopoly markets are extensively impacted.
