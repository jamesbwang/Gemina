  Amount of pressure exerting on orthodontic brackets during bonding can create different thickness of adhesive and affect shear bonding strength ( SBS) in different adhesive systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different force magnitudes for placement of brackets on SBS. In an SBS increased with an increase in force. No increase in Transbond XT SBS happened after 400 grams. In addition , Transbond XT had the lowest bond strength among three adhesives ( The force applied on bracket during bonding influences the SBS. In order to have higher bond strength , application of heavy force would be advisable. It is also recommended that constant forces be applied for bracket bonding in future studies.
