  The direct ancestor of the DNA-protein world of today is considered to have been an RNA-peptide world , in which peptides were co-factors of RNA-mediated catalysis and replication. Evidence for these ancestral peptides , from which folded proteins evolved , can be derived even today from regions of local sequence similarity within globally dissimilar folds. One of these is the 45-residue motif common to both folds of the hnRNP K homology ( KH) domain. In a survey of KH domains , we found a third fold that contains the KH motif at its core. This corresponds to the Small Domain ( SD) of bacterial Ribonucleases G/E and , like type I and type II KH domains , it can not be related to the others by a single genetic event , providing further support for the KH motif as an ancestral peptide predating folded proteins.
