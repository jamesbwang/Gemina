  Despite the fact that an InGaN/GaN superlattice ( SL) is useful for enhancing the performance of a GaN-based light-emitting diode ( LED) , its role in improving the efficiency of green LEDs remains an open question. Here , we investigate the influence of a V-pits-embedded InGaN/GaN SL on optical and electrical properties of GaN-based green LEDs. We recorded a sequence of light emission properties of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells ( MQWs) grown on a 0- and 24-pair InGaN/GaN SL by using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) in combination with a room temperature cathodoluminescence ( CL) measurement , which demonstrated the presence of a potential barrier formed by the V-pits around threading dislocations ( TDs). We find that an increase in V-pit diameter would lead to the increase of V-pit potential barrier height. Our experimental data suggest that a V-pits-embedded , 24-pair InGaN/GaN SL can effectively suppress the lateral diffusion of carriers into non-recombination centers. As a result , the external quantum efficiency ( EQE) of green LEDs is improved by 29.6 % at an injection current of 20 mA after implementing the V-pits-embedded InGaN/GaN SL layer. In addition , a lower reverse leakage current was achieved with larger V-pits.
