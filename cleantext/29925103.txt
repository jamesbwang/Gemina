  The NexGen legacy posterior stabilized ( LPS) prosthesis was introduced in 1997 after many design changes to its predecessor , the Insall-Burstein II prosthesis. However , there have been no reported long-term studies on the performance of this implant. Prospectively , collected data from a local database comprising primary total knee replacements ( TKRs) with LPS between 1997 and 2002 was analyzed. All implants were fixed with cement. Patients were followed up at 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 years , with patient satisfaction , range of movement , and Knee Society score ( KSS) assessed. A total of 621 primary TKRs were analyzed with an average follow-up of 11.25 years ( 9.15-14.55). The mean age was 69.53 years. The mean KSS was 88.97 and mean flexion increased from 88.3 to 103.5 degrees at 10 years. Kaplan-Meier 's analysis revealed a survivorship of 96.5 % with revision for any reason as the end point and 98.9 % if aseptic loosening was the reason for revision at 14 years. This study revealed excellent mid- to long-term results with the NexGen LPS prosthesis.
