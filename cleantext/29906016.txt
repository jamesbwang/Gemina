  Google + sets itself apart from other social media platforms through a number of unique features , including search engine optimization services and high user satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of dermatological entities on Google +. Searches were conducted to locate any Google + accounts associated with the most popular dermatology journals , dermatological patient-centered organizations , and professional dermatology-related organizations on social media. Additionally , `` dermatology Google + '' was searched via Google , and Google + profiles retrieved in the first page of results were assessed. Four of the five active Google + profiles identified in the first page of Google search results were run by private dermatology practices. Only one of the 13 searched journals was active on Google +. Twenty-six of the 34 patient-centered and professional organizations had Google + accounts , but only seven of these accounts were active in the last year. Therefore , unlike some private practices , the majority of dermatology journals and organizations have yet to take advantage of the exclusive opportunities offered by Google + to expand their audiences and bolster their overall online presence.
