  In recent years , with the popularization of low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT) and high-resolution CT ( HRCT) , the discovery rate of early-staged non-small cell lung cancer has been on the rise , and more thoracic surgeons have explored more reasonable resection scope. Clinical studies have demonstrated that there is a lower rate of local tumor recurrence in patients with negative lung margins compared with positive ones. Therefore , it is of great clinical significance to ensure the negative margin during sublobar resection for early-staged lung cancer. This paper will focus on this area..
