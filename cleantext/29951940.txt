  Is medicalization always harmful? When does medicine overstep its proper boundaries? The aim of this article is to outline the pragmatic criteria for distinguishing between medicalization and over-medicalization. The consequences of considering a phenomenon to be a medical problem may take radically different forms depending on whether the problem in question is correctly or incorrectly perceived as a medical issue. Neither indiscriminate acceptance of medicalization of subsequent areas of human existence , nor criticizing new medicalization cases just because they are medicalization can be justified. The article: ( i) identifies various consequences of both well-founded medicalization and over-medicalization; ( ii) demonstrates that the issue of defining appropriate limits of medicine can not be solved by creating an optimum model of health; ( iii) proposes four guiding questions to help distinguish medicalization from over-medicalization. The article should foster a normative analysis of the phenomenon of medicalization and contribute to the bioethical reflection on the boundaries of medicine.
