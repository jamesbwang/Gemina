  The longitudinal structure of the environmental and phytoplankton variables was investigated in the Ebro River ( NE Spain) , which is heavily affected by water abstraction and regulation. A first exploration indicated that the phytoplankton community did not resist the impact of reservoirs and barely recovered downstream of them. The spatial analysis showed that the responses of the phytoplankton and environmental variables were not uniform. The two set of variables revealed spatial variability discontinuities and river fragmentation upstream and downstream from the reservoirs. Reservoirs caused the replacement of spatially heterogeneous habitats by homogeneous spatially distributed water bodies , these new environmental conditions downstream benefiting the opportunist and cosmopolitan algal taxa. The application of a spatial auto-regression model to algal biomass ( chlorophyll-a) permitted to capture the relevance and contribution of extra-local influences in the river ecosystem.
