  The chemical treatment of cancer started with the realization that DNA damaging agents such as mustard gas present notable antitumoural properties. Consequently , early drug development focused on genotoxic chemicals , some of which are still widely used in the clinic. However , the efficacy of such therapies is often limited by the side effects of these drugs on healthy cells. A refinement to this approach is to use compounds that can exploit the presence of DNA damage in cancer cells. Given that replication stress ( RS) is a major source of genomic instability in cancer , targeting the RS-response kinase ataxia<symptom> telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein ( ATR) has emerged as a promising alternative. With ATR inhibitors now entering clinical trials , we here revisit the biology behind this strategy and discuss potential biomarkers that could be used for a better selection of patients who respond to therapy.
