  Females with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) have higher in-hospital and short-term mortality rates compared with males in China , suggesting that a sex disparity exists. The age of onset of STEMI is ahead of time and tends to be younger. However , there are relatively little data on the significance of sex on prognosis for long-term outcomes for adult patients with STEMI after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) in China. This study sought to analyze the sex differences in 30-day , 1-year , and long-term net adverse clinical events ( NACEs) in Chinese adult patients with STEMI after PCI. This study retrospectively analyzed 1920 consecutive STEMI patients ( age ≤ 60 years) treated with PCI from January 01 , 2006 , to December 31 , 2012. A propensity score analysis between males and females was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and comorbidities. The primary endpoint was the incidence of 3-year NACE. Survival curves were constructed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared by log-rank tests between the two groups. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model for 3-year NACE. Compared with males , females had higher risk profiles associated with old age , longer prehospital delay at the onset of STEMI , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and chronic kidney disease , and a higher Killip class ( ≥ 3) , with more multivessel diseases ( P < 0.05). The female group had a higher levels of low-density lipoprotein ( 2.72 ( 2.27 , 3.29) vs. 2.53 ( 2.12 , 3.00) , P < 0.001) , high-density lipoprotein ( 1.43 ( 1.23 , 1.71) vs. 1.36 ( 1.11 , 1.63) , P = 0.003) , total cholesterol ( 4.98 ± 1.10 vs. 4.70 ± 1.15 , t = -3.508 , P < 0.001) , and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( 103.12 ± 22.22 vs. 87.55 ± 18.03 , t = -11.834 , P < 0.001) than the male group. In the propensity-matched analysis , being female was associated with a higher risk for 3-year NACE and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events compared with males. In the multivariate model , female gender ( hazard ratio ( HR): 2.557 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.415-4.620 , P = 0.002) , hypertension ( HR: 2.017 , 95 % CI: 1.138-3.576 , P = 0.016) , and family history of coronary heart disease ( HR: 2.256 , 95 % CI: 1.115-4.566 , P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for NACE. The number of stents ( HR: 0.625 , 95 % CI: 0.437-0.894 , P = 0.010) was independent protective factors of NACE. Females with STEMI undergoing PCI have a significantly higher risk for 3-year NACE compared with males in this population. Sex differences appear to be a risk factor and present diagnostic challenges for clinicians.
