  Freezing nitrogen ethanol composite ( FNEC) showed effective cryoablative ability for bone tumor ex vivo and in vivo comparable to liquid nitrogen ( LN). We therefore wished to compare the radiant cooling damage of the surrounding tissue between FNEC and LN. The evaluation of the radiant cooling damage was demonstrated human bone xenograft transplantation ( HXT) in a mouse model. Characterizations and quantifications of the damaging effects on morphologic features and apoptosis of the cryoablative surrounding bone tissue , muscle and epidermal layer of skin were compared. The radiant cooled damaging effects including epidermal rupture , hair follicle atrophy , dermis and subcutaneous crystal vacuolation of skin were significantly greater in LN than FNEC. Muscular apoptosis , structural shrinkage and bone cellular apoptosis were supposedly 15 % -33 % destroying degrees of LN more than FNEC. We concluded that FNEC is an innovative cryogenic material , and it could cause less cryoablative damage to surrounding normal tissue than LN. The findings might support the safety of FNEC being applied in clinical cryoablation therapy.
