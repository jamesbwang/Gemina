  To assess the role of SPECT/CT in the evaluation of knee pain as well as comparing bone scintigraphy ( BS) , SPECT and SPECT/CT , and assessing the incremental value of SPECT/CT. BS , SPECT and SPECT/CT of patients with knee pain ( 39 patients , 65 knees , 105 lesions<symptom>) were directly compared for lesion<symptom> detection , localisation and characterisation using lesion-based , knee-based and patient-based analyses in this retrospective study. Lesion<symptom> detection: BS ( 91.4 %) , SPECT ( 100 %) and SPECT/CT ( 100 %). SPECT and SPECT/CT detected significantly more lesions<symptom> than BS ( p < 0.05). Lesion<symptom> localisation: BS ( 38.5-41.7 %) , SPECT ( 74.4-83.3 %) and SPECT/CT ( 100 %). SPECT localised significantly more lesions<symptom> than BS; SPECT/CT localised significantly more lesions<symptom> than BS and SPECT ( p < 0.01). Lesion<symptom> characterisation: BS ( 23.0-52.1 %) , SPECT ( 30.8-56.2 %) and SPECT/CT ( 92.3-96.9 %). SPECT/CT characterised significantly more lesions<symptom> than BS and SPECT ( p < 0.01). Characterisation of non-arthropathy lesions<symptom>: BS ( 6.25 %) , SPECT ( 12.5 %) and SPECT/CT ( 93.75 %). SPECT/CT characterised significantly more non-arthropathy lesions<symptom> than BS and SPECT ( p < 0.01). BS and SPECT detected 0 % while SPECT/CT detected 100 % of the causative/contributing/associated conditions that co-existed with osteoarthritis. Therefore SPECT/CT detected not just osteoarthritis but also the causative/contributing/associated conditions. SPECT/CT added significant incremental value to BS and SPECT irrespective of whether evaluation was lesion-based , knee-based or patient-based. SPECT/CT represents a viable alternative to MRI , and addition of SPECT/CT to BS and SPECT should be considered in the evaluation of knee pain.
