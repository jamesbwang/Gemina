  Light pollution has emerged as a pervasive component of land development over the past century. Several detrimental impacts of this anthropogenic influence have been identified in night shift workers , laboratory rodents , and a plethora of wildlife species. Circadian , or daily , patterns are interrupted by the presence of light at night and have the capacity to alter rhythmic physiological or behavioral characteristics. Indeed , biorhythm disruption can lead to metabolic , reproductive , and immunological dysfunction depending on the intensity , timing , duration and wavelength of light exposure. Light pollution , in many forms and by many pathways , is thus apt to affect the nature of host-pathogen interactions. However , no research has yet investigated this possibility. The goal of this manuscript is to outline how dim light at night ( dLAN) , a relevant and common form of light pollution , may affect disease dynamics by interrupting circadian rhythms and regulation of immune responses as well as opportunities for host-parasite interactions and subsequent transmission risk including spillover into humans. We close by proposing some promising interventions including alternative lighting methods or vector control efforts.
