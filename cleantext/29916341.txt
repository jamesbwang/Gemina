  The increased accessibility of soft-tissue data through diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( diceCT) enables comparative biologists to increase the taxonomic breadth of their studies with museum specimens. However , it is still unclear how soft-tissue measurements from preserved specimens reflect values from freshly collected specimens and whether diceCT preparation may affect these measurements. Here , we document and evaluate the accuracy of diceCT in museum specimens based on the soft-tissue reconstructions of brains and eyes of five bats. Based on proxies , both brains and eyes were roughly 60 % of the estimated original sizes when first imaged. However , these structures did not further shrink significantly over a 4-week staining interval , and 1 week in 2.5 % iodine-based solution yielded sufficient contrast for differentiating among soft-tissues. Compared to six `` fresh '' bat specimens imaged shortly after field collection ( not fixed in ethanol) , the museum specimens had significantly lower relative volumes of the eyes and brains. Variation in field preparation techniques and conditions , and long-term storage in ethanol may be the primary causes of shrinkage in museum specimens rather than diceCT staining methodology. Identifying reliable tissue-specific correction factors to adjust for the shrinkage now documented in museum specimens requires future work with larger samples.
