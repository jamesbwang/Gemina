  The article reports a wet milling process , where the planetary ball mill was combined with pearl milling technology to reach nanosize range of meloxicam ( Mel; 100-500 nm). The main purpose was to increase the dissolution rate and extent of a poorly water-soluble Mel as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug as well as to study its permeability across cultured intestinal epithelial cell layers. Viscosity of milled dispersion and particle size distribution and zeta potential of Mel were investigated and differential scanning calorimeter and X-ray powder diffractometer were used to analyse the structure of the suspended Mel. Finally in vitro dissolution test and in vitro cell culture studies were made. It was found that the ratio of predispersion and pearls 1:1 ( w/w) resulted in the most effective grinding system ( 200-fold particle size reduction in one step) with optimized process parameters , 437 rpm and 43 min. Nanosuspension ( 1 % Mel and 0.5 % poly ( vinyl alcohol)) as an intermediate product showed a stable system with 2 weeks of holding time. This optimized nanosuspension enhanced the penetration of Mel across cultured intestinal epithelial cell layers without toxic effects. The dissolution rate of Mel from the poly ( vinyl alcohol) stabilized nanosuspension justified its applicability in the design of innovative per oral dosage form ( capsule) in order to ensure/give a rapid analgesia.
