  This study aimed to present a modified laparoscopic keyhole parastomal hernia repair technique with in situ re-ostomy and show its safety and feasibility at a mid-term follow-up. The technique begins with adhesiolysis during laparoscopy. An annular incision is made between the skin and stomal mucosa. Then , after all adhesions of the stomal bowel and its mesentery are separated from the hernial sac , the stomal bowel is delivered through the keyhole mesh. The mesh is then stitched to the stomal bowel and placed intraperitoneally. The hernial ring is narrowed , and the mesh is further stitched to the hernial ring and stomal tube. After the mesh is fixed , the redundant stomal bowel is shortened , and a new in situ stoma is matured in the conventional way. Altogether , 65 consecutive patients underwent successful hernia repair via a modified laparoscopic keyhole with in situ re-ostomy. Two of the patients had recurrent parastomal hernias. No mortalities occurred during the perioperative period. Morbidities included two cases of seroma and three of ileus , all of which were cured with conservative treatment. In addition , one case of intestinal perforation was rescued by intestinal resection and enteroenterostomy. Median follow-up was 29 months ( range 3-60 months). No complications of mesh-related infection or patch erosion were noted during the follow-up. Modified laparoscopic keyhole parastomal hernia repair with in situ re-ostomy is a safe procedure with a low recurrence rate at the mid-term follow-up.
