  Metabolomics is one of the latest `` omics '' technology concerned with the high-throughput identification and quantification of metabolites , the final products of cellular processes. The revealed data provide an instantaneous snapshot of an organism 's metabolic pathways , which can be used to explain its phenotype or physiology. On the other hand , Drosophila has shown its power in studying metabolism and related diseases. At this stage , we have the state-of-the-art knowledge in place: a potential candidate to study cellular metabolism ( Drosophila melanogaster) and a powerful methodology for metabolic network decipherer ( metabolomics). Yet missing is advanced metabolomics technologies like isotope-assisted metabolomics optimized for Drosophila. In this chapter , we will discuss on the current status and future perspectives in technologies and applications of Drosophila metabolomics.
