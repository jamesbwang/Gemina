  Gut microbiota play an essential role in an organism 's health. The fecal metabolite profiling content reflects these microbiota-mediated physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> in various organisms , including fish. Therefore , metabolomics analysis of fish feces should provide insight into the dynamics linking physiology and gut microbiota. However , metabolites are often unstable in aquatic environments , making fecal metabolites difficult to examine in fish. In this study , a novel method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) was developed and optimized for the preparation of metabolomics samples from the feces of the marine fish , red sea bream ( Pagrus major). The preparation methodology was optimized , focusing on rinsing frequency and rinsing solvent. Feces ( collected within 4 h of excretion) were rinsed three times with sterilized 2.5 % NaCl solution or 3.0 % artificial seawater ( ASW). Among the 86 metabolites identified in the NaCl-rinsed samples , 57 showed superior recovery to that in ASW-rinsed samples , indicating that NaCl is a better rinsing solvent , particularly for amino acids , organic acids , and fatty acids. To evaluate rinsing frequency , fecal samples were rinsed with NaCl solution 0 , 1 , 3 , or 5 times. The results indicate that three or more rinses enabled robust and stable detection of metabolites encapsulated within the solid fecal residue. Furthermore , these data suggest that rinsing is unnecessary when studying sugars , amino acids , and sterols , again highlighting the need for appropriate rinsing solvent and frequency. This study provides further insight into the use of fecal samples to evaluate and promote fish health during farming and supports the application of this and similar analyses to study the effects of environmental fluctuations and/or contamination.
