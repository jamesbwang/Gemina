  An aluminum gallium indium arsenic ( AlGaInAs) material system is indispensable as the active layer of diode lasers emitting at 1310 or 1550 nm , which are used in optical fiber communications. However , the course of the high-temperature instability of a quantum well structure , which is closely related to the diffusion of indium atoms , is still not clear due to the system & rsquo; s complexity. The diffusion process of indium atoms was simulated by thermal treatment , and the changes in the optical and structural properties of an AlGaInAs quantum well are investigated in this paper. Compressive strained Al
