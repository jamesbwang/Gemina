  H-NS family proteins encoded on the chromosome of Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> KT2440 ( TurA and TurB) and the IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1 ( Pmr) commonly have an N-terminal dimerization/oligomerization domain constituted by a central and a terminal dimerization sites. To clarify the dimerization manner at the central dimerization sites of the three homologs , we performed chemical cross-linking analyses with protein variants inactivated at the terminal dimerization site. Comparison of the hetero-dimer ratios among them suggested stronger affinities between the central dimerization sites of TurA and TurB monomers than between TurA and Pmr or TurB and Pmr. Furthermore , analyses of the interaction between truncated TurB containing only a functional terminal dimerization site and full-length proteins suggested that TurB exhibited higher affinities for oligomer complex formation with TurB itself and TurA but not Pmr. Altogether , we revealed stronger interaction between the N-terminal domains of TurA and TurB than between either of them and Pmr.
