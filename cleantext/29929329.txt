  Wastewater is now considered to be a vital reusable source of water reuse and saving energy. However , current wastewater has multiple limitations such as high energy costs , large quantities of residuals being generated and lacking in potential resources. Recently , great attention has been paid to microbial fuel cells ( MFCs) due to their mild operating conditions where a variety of biodegradable substrates can serve as fuel. MFCs can be used in wastewater treatment facilities to break down organic matter , and they have also been analysed for application as a biosensor such as a sensor for biological oxygen which demands monitoring. MFCs represent an innovation technology solution that is simple and rapid. Despite the advantages of this technology , there are still practical barriers to consider including low electricity production , current instability , high internal resistance and costly materials used. Thus , many problems must be overcome and doing this requires a more detailed analysis of energy production , consumption , and application. Currently , real-world applications of MFCs are limited due to their low power density level of only several thousand mW/m
