  Brugada syndrome<disease> ( SBr) is an arrhythmic condition characterized by ST-T segment abnormalities in the right precordial leads associated with a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Local data regarding the clinical characteristics of patients with a typical electrocardiographic ( ECG) pattern undergoing electrophysiological study are scarce. To evaluate patients with an ECG pattern suggestive of SBr referred for electrophysiological evaluation in a specialized center. Cohort study of patients referred for electrophysiological study because of an ECG pattern compatible with SBr between January 1998 and March 2017. Of the 5506 procedures , 35 ( 0.64 %) were for SBr investigation , 25 of which ( 71.42 %) were performed in men. The mean age was 43.89 ± 13.1 years. The ECG patterns were as follows: type I , 22 ( 62.85 %); type II , 12 ( 34.30 %); and type III , 1 ( 2.85 %). Twenty-three patients ( 65.7 %) were asymptomatic , 6 ( 17.14 %) had palpitations , 5 ( 14.3 %) had syncope , and 3 ( 8.6 %) had a family history of sudden death. Electrophysiological study induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 16 cases ( 45.7 %) , the mean ventricular refractory period being 228 ± 36 ms. Ajmaline/ procainamide was used in 11 cases ( 31.4 %) , changing the ECG pattern to type I in 7 ( 63.6 %). Sixteen cases ( 45.7 %) received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD). In a mean 5-year follow-up , 1 of the 16 patients ( 6.25 %) with ICD had appropriate therapy for ventricular fibrillation. There was no death. Other arrhythmias occurred in 4 ( 11.4 %) cases. Most patients are men , and a type I ECG pattern is the main indication for electrophysiological study. Class IA drugs have a high ECG conversion rate. The ICD event rate was 6 %.
