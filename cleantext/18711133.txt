  Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have key functions during breast cancer development. Considering the complexity of IncRNAs regulatory network , the identification of novel and functional lncRNAs associated with breast cancer is thus very important. By using Agilent LncRNA Human Gene Expression Microarray , we identified a number of lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in breast cancer compared to their corresponding adjacent tissues. According to the microarray , the expression of p10247 , henceforth named as lncRNA-BCHE ( standing for lncRNA high expressed in breast cancer) , was found to be uniformly higher in all the five breast cancer tissues tested , and this was further confirmed in 56 breast cancer tissues by real-time RT-PCR. The function of lncRNA-BCHE in breast cancer cells was tested by knockdown and over-expression experiments in vitro. We also analyzed the public cohorts of breast cancer patients on the Kaplan Meier plotter platform. Clinical analysis revealed that the expression of lncRNA-BCHE was significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Our data indicate that lncRNA-BCHE regulates the growth , migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition , we found that these functions are mediated , at least in part , by the regulation of integrin subunit beta 1 ( ITGB1) levels. The expression of ITGB1 serves as a negative prognostic factor and metastasis risk predictor in breast cancer , irrespective of subtype and therapeutic regimen. In summary , our results suggest that lncRNA-BCHE is an oncogenic lncRNA enhancing the growth and metastatic potential of breast cancer cells , and a potential predictor of breast cancer metastatic progression.
