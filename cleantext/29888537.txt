  According to one important set of theories , different domains of immorality are linked to different discrete emotions-panculturally. Violations against the community elicit contempt , whereas violations against an individual elicit anger. To test this theory , American , Indian and Japanese participants ( N = 480) indicated contempt and anger reactions ( with verbal rating and face selection) to both the types of immorality. To remedy method problems in previous research , community and autonomy violations were created for the same story-frame , by varying the target to be either the community or an individual. Community and autonomy violations did not differ significantly in the emotion elicited: overall , both types of violations elicited more anger than contempt ( and more negative emotion of any kind than positive emotion). By verbal rating , Americans and Indians reported more anger than contempt for both types of violation , whereas Japanese reported more contempt than anger for both types. By face selection , the three cultural groups selected anger more than contempt for both types of violation. The results speak against defining distinct domains of morality by their association with distinct emotions.
