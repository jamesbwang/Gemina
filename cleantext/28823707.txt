  Pontocerebellar hypoplasia ( PCH) describes a rare , heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders mainly with a prenatal onset. Patients have severe hypoplasia or atrophy of cerebellum and pons , with variable involvement of supratentorial structures , motor and cognitive impairments. Based on distinct clinical features and genetic causes , current classification comprises 11 types of PCH. In this review we describe the clinical , neuroradiological and genetic characteristics of the different PCH subtypes , summarize the differential diagnosis and reflect on potential disease mechanisms in PCH. Seventeen PCH-related genes are now listed in the OMIM database , most of them have a function in RNA processing or translation. It is unknown why defects in these apparently ubiquitous processes result in a brain-specific phenotype. Many new PCH related genes and phenotypes have been described due to the appliance of next generation sequencing techniques. By including such a broad range of phenotypes , including non-degenerative and postnatal onset disorders , the current classification gives rise to confusion<symptom>. Despite the discovery of new pathways involved in PCH , treatment is still symptomatic. However , correct diagnosis of PCH is important to provide suitable care and counseling regarding prognosis , and offer appropriate ( prenatal) genetic testing to families.
