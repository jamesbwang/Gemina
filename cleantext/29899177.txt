  Spontaneous rupture of the thoracic aorta is rare. We present a 76-year-old man who developed spontaneous rupture of the aortic arch associated with massive periaortic hematoma and hypovolemic shock<symptom>. Because the site of rupture could not be identified , emergency hybrid endovascular aortic repair to shield a long segment of the aorta was performed according to the extent and density of periaortic hematoma on axial CT scans. His blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> improved just after deployment of the endograft. Rapid diagnosis by CT and prompt control of aortic hemorrhage<symptom> by endografting salvaged this patient. Three-dimensional ( 3D) volume-rendered CT images are useful for identifying the site of aortic rupture , but may not be available in an emergency.
