  Visual electrophysiology measurements are important for ophthalmic diagnostic testing. Electrodes with combined optical transparency and softness are highly desirable , and sometimes indispensable for many ocular electrophysiology measurements. Here we report the fabrication of soft graphene contact lens electrodes ( GRACEs) with broad-spectrum optical transparency , and their application in conformal , full-cornea recording of electroretinography ( ERG) from cynomolgus monkeys. The GRACEs give higher signal amplitude than conventional ERG electrodes in recordings of various full-field ERG responses. High-quality topographic mapping of multifocal ERG under simultaneous fundus monitoring is realized. A conformal and tight interface between the GRACEs and cornea is revealed. Neither corneal irritation nor abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> of the animals is observed after ERG measurements with GRACEs. Furthermore , spatially resolved ERG recordings on rabbits with graphene multi-electrode array reveal a stronger signal at the central cornea than the periphery. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of the graphene-based electrodes for in vivo visual electrophysiology studies.
