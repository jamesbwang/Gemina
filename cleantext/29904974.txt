  Antibodies to glycine receptors ( GlyR-Abs) were first defined in progressive encephalopathy with rigidity and myoclonus ( PERM) but were subsequently identified in other clinical presentations. Our aim was to assess the clinical associations of all patients identified with GlyR-Abs in Queensland , Australia , between April 2014 and May 2017 and to compare these to cases reported in the literature. A literature review identified the clinical features of all published GlyR-Ab-positive cases through online databases. A case series was undertaken via collection of clinical information from all patients diagnosed or known to immunology , pathology or neurological services in Queensland during the study period of 3 years. In all , 187 GlyR-Ab-positive cases were identified in the literature. The majority ( 47.6 %) had PERM , 22.4 % had epilepsy , but the remaining 30 % included mixed phenotypes consisting of cerebellar ataxia<symptom> , movement disorders , demyelination and encephalitis/cognitive dysfunction. By contrast , in our series of 14 cases , eight had clinical presentations consistent with seizures<symptom> and epilepsy and only three cases had classical features of PERM. There was one case each of global fatiguable weakness<symptom> with sustained clonus , laryngeal dystonia and movement disorder with hemiballismus and tics. The rate of response to immune therapy was similar in all groups. Antibodies to glycine receptors are linked to a spectrum of neurological disease. The results of the literature review and our case series suggest a greater relationship between GlyR-Abs and epilepsy than previously reported.
