  The aim is to report 1-year outcomes of the Supporting Teens Problem Solving ( STePS) study , a randomized controlled trial comparing a distress and depression<symptom> prevention program with a diabetes education program for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. With 264 adolescents in two locations ( Chicago and San Francisco Bay Area) , a randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the Penn Resilience Program for type 1 diabetes ( PRP T1D) to Advanced Diabetes Education. Interventions lasted 4.5 months , and assessments were conducted at baseline , and 4.5 , 8 , 12 , and 16 months. Outcomes of interest were diabetes distress ( DD) , depressive symptoms , resilience , diabetes self-management , and glycemic control. Latent growth curve modeling was used to test between-group differences over time. Results indicate that there was acceptable randomization and exposure to interventions , and that exposure to PRP T1D was associated with substantial reductions in DD. In addition , stable glycemic control , resilience characteristics , and depressive symptoms were observed 1 year post-treatment. Diabetes management deteriorated in both groups. Intervening before symptoms of psychological distress start can prevent the development of the DD commonly seen in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The STePS program represents a promising prevention program , and future reports on 2- and 3-year outcomes will explore benefits over longer periods of time.
