  To get insights into the functions of metallothionein ( MT) in plant response to multiple stresses , expressions of 10 rice MT genes ( OsMTs) and 7 Arabidopsis MT genes ( AtMTs) were comprehensively analyzed under combined heavy metal and salt stress. OsMT1a , OsMT1b , OsMT1c , OsMT1g , and OsMT2a were increased by different heavy metals. Notably , ABA remarkably increased OsMT4 up to 80-fold. Combined salt and heavy metals ( Cd , Pb , Cu) synergistically increased OsMT1a , OsMT1c , and OsMT1g , whereas combined salt and H
