  Procedures of limited clinical value require pre-authorisation in the National Health Service , of which rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty are two such operations. This study surveyed clinical commissioning groups within England to document the variable eligibility criteria for rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty. In February 2016 , a letter was sent to 209 clinical commissioning groups requesting their rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty commissioning criteria. A total of 200 clinical commissioning groups responded. Although 89.5 per cent allow septorhinoplasty in the presence of nasal obstruction , further criteria , such as documented health problems resulting from nasal blockage , severe functional impairment or a specific percentage of blockage , must be shown for septorhinoplasty to be authorised by most of the clinical commissioning groups. There is great variation within individual clinical commissioning groups in England regarding the criteria for septorhinoplasty and rhinoplasty. Some criteria seem not to be clinically relevant and difficult to demonstrate. It is recommended that the guidelines are reviewed and harmonised nationally in future revisions.
