  This study investigated if object control relates to children 's game play competence , and examined these competencies as correlates of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness. Game play ( Game Performance Assessment Instrument) , object control ( The Test Gross Motor Development-3) , moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( Accelerometry) , and cardiorespiratory fitness ( 20-metre shuttle) assessments were completed for 107 children ( 57 % Female , 43 % Male) aged 9-12 years ( M 10.53 , SD 0.65). Two-level regression of object control on game play competence , and object control and game play competence on physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness assessed associations. Object control competence was positively associated with game play competence ( Std. B = 0.25 , t ( 104.77) = 2.38 , p = 0.001). Game play competence ( Std. B = 0.33 , t ( 99.81) = 5.21 , p < 0.000) was more strongly associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than object control competence ( Std. B = 0.20 , t ( 106.93) = 2.96 , p = 0.003). Likewise , game competence ( Std. B = 0.39 , t ( 104.41) = 4.36 , p < 0.000) was more strongly associated with cardiorespiratory fitness than object control competence ( Std. B = 0.22 , t ( 106.69) = 2.63 , p = 0.002). Object control and game competence are both important as correlates of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in children.
