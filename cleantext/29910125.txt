  Pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs) represent the most promising clinical source for regenerative medicine. However , given the cellular heterogeneity within cultivation and safety concerns , the development of specific and efficient tools to isolate a pure population and eliminate all residual undifferentiated PSCs from differentiated derivatives is a prerequisite for clinical applications. In this study , we raised a monoclonal antibody and identified its target antigen as desmoglein-2 ( DSG2). DSG2 co-localized with human PSC ( hPSC)- specific cell surface markers , and its expression was rapidly downregulated upon differentiation. The depletion of DSG2 markedly decreased hPSC proliferation and pluripotency marker expression. In addition , DSG2-negative population in hPSCs exhibited a notable suppression in embryonic body and teratoma formation. The actions of DSG2 in regulating the self-renewal and pluripotency of hPSCs were predominantly exerted through the regulation of Î²-catenin/Slug-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our results demonstrate that DSG2 is a valuable PSC surface marker that is essential for the maintenance of PSC self-renewal.
