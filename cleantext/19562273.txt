  The study aimed to determine the prevalence of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant School-going children of age group of 5-15 years were identified and selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two nasal swabs were collected from each child as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and transported to laboratory. Swabs were cultured on mannitol salt agar and 5 % blood agar and incubated for 18-24 h at 37 °C. Identification was done as per routine laboratory protocol. Detection of MRSA was done through cefoxitin 30 μg discs and D-zone test. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Out of 300 children , 140 ( 46.67 %) were found to be nasal carriage for With the risk involved in transmission of infection , steps for identifying the carriers and its eradication should be carried out. Rational use of antibiotics should be given preference too.
