  Massively parallel sequencing is transforming forensic work by allowing various useful forensic markers , such as STRPs and SNPs , to be multiplexed providing information on ancestry , individual and familial identification , phenotypes for eye/hair/skin pigmentation , and the deconvolution of mixtures. Microhaplotypes also become feasible with massively parallel sequencing , these are DNA segments ( smaller than 300 nucleotides) that are selected to contain multiple SNPs unambiguously defining three or more haplotype alleles occurring at common frequencies. The physical extent of a microhaplotype can thus be covered by a single sequence read making these loci phase-known codominant genetic systems. Such microhaplotypes supply significantly more information than a single SNP can. Our efforts to develop useful sets of microhaplotypes have already identified 182 such loci that we have studied on a large number of human populations from around the world. We present various analyses on 83 populations in our ongoing study for a subset of the best microhaplotypes currently available illustrating their characteristics and potential utility for ancestry , identification , and mixture deconvolution.
