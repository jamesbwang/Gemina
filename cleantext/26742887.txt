  This retrospective study of cat admissions to RSPCA Queensland shelters describes changes associated with improved outcomes ending in live release in 2016 compared to 2011. There were 13,911 cat admissions in 2011 and 13,220 in 2016 , with approximately 50 % in both years admitted as strays from the general public or council contracts. In contrast , owner surrenders halved from 30 % to 15 % of admissions. Percentages of admissions ending in euthanasia decreased from 58 % to 15 %. Only 5 % of cat admissions were reclaimed in each of these years , but the percentage rehomed increased from 34 % to 74 % , of which 61 % of the increase was contributed by in-shelter adoptions and 39 % from non-shelter sites , predominately retail partnerships. The percentage temporarily fostered until rehoming doubled. In 2011 , euthanasias were most common for medical ( 32 % of all euthanasias) , behavioral ( 36 %) and age/shelter number ( 30 %) reasons , whereas in 2016 , 69 % of euthanasias were for medical reasons. The number of young kittens euthanized decreased from 1116 in 2011 to 22 in 2016. The number of cats classified as feral and euthanized decreased from 1178 to 132 , in association with increased time for assessment of behavior and increased use of behavior modification programs and foster care. We attribute the improved cat outcomes to strategies that increased adoptions and reduced euthanasia of young kittens and poorly socialized cats , including foster programs. To achieve further decreases in euthanasia , strategies to decrease intake would be highly beneficial , such as those targeted to reduce stray cat admissions.
