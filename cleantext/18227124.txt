  A comprehensive search on electronic databases was conducted to identify all eligible studies of TNF-α polymorphisms and knee osteoarthritis ( OA). Eight studies on TNF-α -308 G > A and three on TNF-α -238 G > A polymorphism were identified. Overall , the pooled ORs indicated that neither TNF-α -238 G > A nor -238 G > A polymorphism was associated with knee OA risk. Similarly , in the stratified analysis by ethnicity , no significant association was found. This meta-analysis results inconsistent with the previous meta-analyses showed that the TNF-α -308 G > A and -238 G > A polymorphisms may not be associated with the susceptibility to knee OA.
