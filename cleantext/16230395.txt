  Cancer stem cells are cellular subpopulations in tumor , which are highly tumorigenic and drug resistant due to their adaptive molecular mechanism. In the recent years , these cells have attracted researchers ' focus because of their unique properties which makes them biologically well evolved than other proliferating tumor cells. We have studied the presence of cancer stem cells in colorectal cancer ( CRC) and its surgical margins. We report for the first time the presence of drug-resistant cells in distal resection margins in CRC and showed that a closer distal margin of less than 2 cm could have higher possibility of drug-resistant cells to spread.
