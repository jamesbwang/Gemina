  Mycosis<disease> fungoides is the most ubiquitous form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Diagnosis is arduous , as early phases often resemble common inflammatory dermatoses. The principal histologic features of MF include medium to large-sized cerebriform mononuclear cells in single or small clusters in the epidermis. Treatment modalities are prodigious and relapses are common. The authors present a case of a 69-year-old man with mycosis<disease> fungoides , followed by a review of diagnostic modalities and phototherapeutic interventions for patients with this condition. According to literature reports , monochromatic excimer light therapy is the most advantageous and well-tolerated phototherapy modality for patients with early patch stage mycosis fungoides.
