  A pulsatile hemodynamic analysis was carried out in the right coronary arterial ( RCA) tree of control and RV hypertrophy ( RVH) hearts. The shape of flow and wall shear stress ( WSS) waves was hypothesized to be maintained throughout the RCA tree in RVH ( i.e. , similar patterns of normalized flow and WSS waves in vessels of various sizes). Consequently , we reconstructed the entire RCA tree down to the first capillary bifurcation of control and RVH hearts based on measured morphometric data. A Womersley-type model was used to compute the flow and WSS waves in the tree. The hemodynamic parameters obtained from experimental measurements were incorporated into the numerical model. Given an increased number of arterioles , the mean and amplitude of flow waves at the inlet of RCA tree in RVH was found to be two times larger than that in control , but no significant differences (
