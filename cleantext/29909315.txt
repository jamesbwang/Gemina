  Since 2010 , Bisphenol A ( BPA) , an endocrine disruptor has been restricted and replaced by analogues like Bisphenol S ( BPS). However , little is known about BPS effects and growing concern have suspected the `` BPA-free '' Label. Several recent studies suggest that BPS is associated with increased risk of diabetes and obesity. However , the underlying mechanisms remain unidentified. The current study investigates investigate BPS effects on hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating feeding behavior , either orexigenic or anorexigenic in Swiss Albino mice. We also studied the effect of BPS on the apelinergic system ( apelin/apelin receptor ( APJ)) as an original physiological system with pleiotropic actions. Bisphenol S at 25 , 50 , 100 Âµg/kg was administered to mice in water drink for 10 weeks started after weaning. Our results showed that BPS exposure alters orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptide ( AgRP) regulating feeding behavior but not anorexigenic neuropeptides ( POMC , CART). Such orexigenic alterations may underlay appetite<symptom> disorders leading to a concomitant food intake and body<symptom> weight gain increase. In addition , data show that BPS affects the hypothalamic apelinergic system. We found a significant decrease in APJ mRNA but not in apelin expression. Based on hypothalamic APJ distribution , we suggested a potent specific physiological alteration of this receptor in mediating neuroendocrine responses in hypothalamus. Thus , our findings provide that BPS exposure could contribute to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders.
