  Narrowband ultraviolet B ( NB-UVB) treatment for psoriasis is considered expensive. However , existing data are based on estimates and do not consider indirect cost savings. To define the actual costs of NB-UVB incurred by the service provider , as well as treatment-associated cost savings. We performed data linkage of ( i) comprehensive treatment records and ( ii) prescribing data for all NB-UVB treatment episodes spanning 6 years in a population of 420 000. We minimized data fluctuation by compiling data from four independent treatment sites , and using drug prescriptions unrelated to psoriasis as a negative control. National Health Service Tayside spent an average of # 257 per NB-UVB treatment course ( mean 257 Â± 63 , range 150-286 , across four independent treatment sites) , contrasting sharply with the estimate of # 1882 used by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The cost of topical treatments averaged # 128 per patient in the 12 months prior to NB-UVB , accounting for 42 % of the overall drug costs incurred by these patients. This was reduced by 40 % to # 53 per patient over the 12-month period following NB-UVB treatment , while psoriasis-unrelated drug prescription remained unchanged , suggesting disease-specific effects of NB-UVB. The data were not due to site-specific factors , as confirmed by highly similar results observed between treatment sites operated by distinct staff. Finally , we detail all staff hours directly and indirectly involved in treatment , allowing direct translation of cost into other healthcare systems. NB-UVB is a low-cost treatment; cost figures currently used in health technology appraisals are an overestimate based on the data presented here. Creating or extending access to NB-UVB is likely to offer additional savings by delaying or avoiding costly third-line treatments for many patients.
