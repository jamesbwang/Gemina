  The purpose of this video article is to show sonographic anatomy at the shoulder joint relevant to impingement and to describe the diagnostic techniques that can be used to diagnose this condition. The article contains several video clips depicting both the normal and pathologic appearances of the bursa during dynamic assessment. The technique for guided injection at this location with sonographic guidance will be covered as well as pitfalls for reporting impingement. Dynamic ultrasound assessment of the shoulder is a useful adjunct to clinical assessment in the evaluation and diagnosis of impingement.
