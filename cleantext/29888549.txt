  In response to infestation with larvae of the Guatemalan tuber moth ( Tecia solanivora) , some Solanum tuberosum ( potato) varieties exhibit an overcompensation response , whereby the total dry mass of uninfested tubers is increased. Here , we describe early responses , within the first few days , of T. solanivora feeding , in the Colombian potato variety Pastusa Suprema. Non-targeted metabolite profiling showed significant secondary metabolism changes in T. solanivora-infested tubers , but not in uninfested systemic tubers. In contrast , changes in primary metabolism were greater in uninfested systemic tubers than in the infested tubers , with a notable 80 % decline in systemic tuber sucrose levels within one day of T. solanivora infestation. This suggested either decreased sucrose transport from the leaves or increased sink strength , i.e. more rapid sucrose to starch conversion in the tubers. Increased , sucrose synthesis was indicated by higher rubicso activase and lower starch synthase gene expression in the leaves of infested plants. Elevated sink strength was demonstrated by 45 % more total starch deposition in systemic tubers of T. solanivora-infested plants compared to uninfested control plants. Thus , rather than investing in increased defense of uninfested tubers , Pastusa Suprema promotes deposition of photoassimilates in the form of starch as a response to T. solanivora infestation.
