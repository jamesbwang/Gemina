  In this study , three different methods for high quality solid fuel production were tested and compared experimentally. Oil palm empty fruit bunches , mesocarp fibers , palm kernel shells and rubber seeds shells were treated using thermal ( TC) , hydrothermal ( HTC) and vapothermal ( VTC) carbonization. All thermochemical methods were accomplished by using a custom made batch-type reactor. Utilization of novel single reactor equipped with suspended internal container provided efficient operation since both steam generator and raw materials were placed inside the same reactor. Highest energy densification was achieved by VTC process followed by TC and HTC processes. The heating value enhancement in VTC and TC was achieved by the increase in fixed carbon content and reduction in volatile matter. The formation of the spherical components in HTC hydrochar which gave a sharp peak at 340 Â°C in the DTG curves was suggested as the reason that led to the increment in energy content.
