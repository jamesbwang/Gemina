  The self-priming synthesis of multiply modified DNA by the extension of repeating unit duplex `` oligoseeds '' provides a source of versatile DNA. Sterically-demanding nucleotides 5-Br-dUTP , 7 deaza 7 I dATP , 6-S-dGTP , 5-I-dCTP as well as 5- ( octadiynyl)- dCTP were incorporated into two extending oligoseeds; ( GATC) 5/ ( GATC) 5 and ( A4G) 4/ ( CT4) 4. The products contained modifications on one or both strands of DNA , demonstrating their recognition by the polymerase as both template ( reading) and substrate ( writing). Nucleobase modifications that lie in the major groove were reliably read and written by the polymerase during the extension reaction , even when bulky or in contiguous sequences. Repeat sequence DNA over 500 bp long , bearing four different modified units were produced by this method. The number , position and type of modification , as well as the overall length of the DNA can be controlled to yield designer DNA that offers sequence-determined sites for further chemical adaptations , targeted small molecule binding studies , or sensing and sequencing applications.
