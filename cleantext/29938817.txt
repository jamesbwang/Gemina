  In this paper , we develop a general Bayesian clinical trial design methodology , tailored for time-to-event trials with a cured fraction in scenarios where a previously completed clinical trial is available to inform the design and analysis of the new trial. Our methodology provides a conceptually appealing and computationally feasible framework that allows one to construct a fixed , maximally informative prior a priori while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for the new trial so that the design has high power and reasonable type I error control from a Bayesian perspective. This strategy is particularly well suited for scenarios where adaptive borrowing approaches are not practical due to the nature of the trial , complexity of the model , or the source of the prior information. Control of a Bayesian type I error rate offers a sensible balance<symptom> between wanting to use high-quality information in the design and analysis of future trials while still controlling type I errors in an equitable way. Moreover , sample size determination based on our Bayesian view of power can lead to a more adequately sized trial by virtue of taking into account all the uncertainty in the treatment effect. We demonstrate our methodology by designing a cancer clinical trial in high-risk melanoma.
