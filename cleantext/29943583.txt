  The myoelectrical activity of the ovine gallbladder has not been fully recognised. Five rams were fitted with six small intestinal and three gallbladder electrodes and a strain gauge force transducer was mounted near the gallbladder fundic electrode. In two series of successive experiments , the electromyographical and mechanical recordings were recorded over a period of 5-7 hours. The occurrence of the slow waves in the small bowel was regular , unlike those in the gallbladder. In the gallbladder infundibulum , the specific pattern , called the long spike burst pattern ( LSBP) , was observed. It comprised usually one or two parts of prolonged duration. The first part resembled the classical ( short lasting) spike burst in the small bowel , and its amplitude was lower than that of the second part. The spike burst frequency of the second part was 2-3 times lower than that of the first part. During phase 1-like and phase 2a-like activities , the intensity of the gallbladder LSBP was reduced while enhanced after feeding. In fasted rams , the duration of a specific pattern , observed in the gallbladder infundibulum , was longer than in non-fasted animals and its amplitude was low. Similar events were recorded in the gallbladder corpus , but the specific pattern was shorter and irregular. In the gallbladder fundus , mostly irregular short spike bursts were recorded. It is concluded that in sheep , specific types of the long-lasting groups of spikes occur in the upper gallbladder areas exhibiting myoelectrical regional variability. The character of an LSBP depends on feeding conditions.
