  Repeated administration of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence , which is characterized as a behavioral state of compulsive drug seeking and a high rate of relapse even after periods of abstinence. However , few studies have been dedicated to characterization of the long-term alterations in heroin-dependent patients ( HDPs). Herein , we examined the peripheral blood from 810 HDPs versus 500 healthy controls ( HCs) according to the inclusion criteria. Compared with the control group , significant decreases of albumin , triglyceride , and total cholesterol levels were identified in HDPs ( P < 0.001) versus HCs coupled with an insignificant decrease in BMI. Meanwhile , RNA-sequencing analyses were performed on blood of 16 long-term HDPs and 25 HCs. The results showed that the TNFÎ± signaling pathway and hematopoiesis related genes were inhibited in HDPs. We further compared the transcriptome data to those of SCA2 and posttraumatic stress disorder patients , identified neurodegenerative diseases related genes were commonly up-regulated in coupled with biological processes `` vesicle transport '' , `` mitochondria '' and `` splicing ''. Genes in the categories of `` protein ubiquitination '' were down-regulated indicating potential biochemical alterations shared by all three comparative to their controls. In summary , this is a leading study performing a series of through investigations and using delicate approaches. Results from this study would benefit the study of drug addiction overall and link long-term heroin abuse to neurodegenerative diseases.
