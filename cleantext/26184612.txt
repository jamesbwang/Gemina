  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is a newer alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Clinical trials have investigated TAVR 's safety and effectiveness. Cerebral embolization is a common complication leading to stroke after TAVR and SAVR; different cerebral protection methods have been studied to prevent this. This paper evaluates the rate of post-procedural stroke rates between TAVR and SAVR and investigates the effect of cerebral protective methods on the stroke risk post-TAVR. Publications on TAVR and SAVR were found using specific criteria on PubMed. The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 1 ( PARTNER 1) and PARTNER 2 , the Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention ( NOTION) , and Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( SURTAVI) trials compared the incidence of complications between TAVR and SAVR.
