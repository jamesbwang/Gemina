The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and awareness of dental implants as a treatment choice in patients visiting a dental college situated in Mangalore , Karnataka , India. A questionnaire consisting of 13 close-ended questions was used to assess the level of knowledge and awareness among patients visiting prosthodontics outpatient department regarding dental implants as a treatment option for replacing missing teeth. A total of 242 participants were interviewed to collect the required data. Chi-square test was used to study the association between demographic variables and awareness about implantation. Only 17.8 % of the population with missing teeth knew about dental implants as a treatment choice. For 69.8 % of the population , the source of information regarding prosthetic options was through friends and relatives , and for 28.1 % , it was from dentists. Awareness percentage was significantly higher among males ( P = 0.024) and among those whose education level was graduation and above ( P < 0.001). This study showed that knowledge and awareness regarding dental implants was disturbingly low. The patients had a very minimal and superficial knowledge regarding prosthetic options.
