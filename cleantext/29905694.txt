  We report a continuous-wave ( cw) , intracavity , singly resonant optical parametric oscillator ( ICSRO) based on an Yb: KYW laser pumped by a single-mode laser diode ( LD). Pumping the ICSRO by a low-noise single-mode LD , combined with the reduced heat generation due to the lower quantum defect of the Yb: KYW laser system , effectively eliminated the onset of relaxation oscillations , which have been a long-standing problem in previous multimode-LD-pumped ICSROs , and resulted in a cw ICSRO being operated free of relaxation oscillations. At an LD power of 515 mW , the generated idler power was 21 mW at âˆ¼ 3500 nm. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of a single-mode-LD-pumped ICSRO.
