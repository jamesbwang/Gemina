  Two new cyclohexanone derivatives , nectriatones A-B ( 1-2) , and one new natural product , nectriatone C ( 3) , together with three known phenolic sesquiterpene derivatives ( 4-6) , were isolated from the culture of Nectria<pathogen> sp.. B-13 obtained from high-latitude soil of the Arctic. The structures of all compounds were unambiguously elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis , as well as by comparison with the literature. These compounds were evaluated in cytotoxic and antibacterial activities. Compounds 1-6 showed cytotoxicities against SW1990 , HCT-116 , MCF-7 , and K562 cells , with IC
