  The objective for this study was to combine drinking characteristics and two subjective measures , drinker identity and alcohol-related quality of life , i.e. , negative impact of alcohol on quality of life , to determine relevant profiles for indicated prevention programs. In particular , we hypothesized that different profiles of students with high level of alcohol consumption exist when exploring subjectivity. We performed an online survey among 16,930 students. We collected sociodemographics and environmental data , including alcohol-related quality of life , drinker identity , and drinking characteristics. We performed a hierarchical clustering on principal components. We described all variables in each cluster and explored between clusters differences by Kruskal-Wallis tests. We identified five clusters as regarding drinker identity , drinking characteristics , and alcohol-related quality of life. Among these five clusters , three clusters presented high drinking characteristics. A very vulnerable cluster showed high level of alcohol consumption , impact on quality of life and on academic results , and strong drinker identity. An egodystonic cluster showed high level of consumption , mild impact on quality of life and on academic results , but low drinker identity. A cluster seemed short-term super-adapted in heavy drinking environment , showing high level of alcohol consumption and drinker identity , but low impact on quality of life and on academic results ( all between clusters p values < 0.001 with Kruskal-Wallis tests). The subjective experience of students from these clusters was significantly different ( p value < 0.001) , and could explain some inadequacy of certain prevention strategies , considering binge drinker student as a homogeneous group. Prospective studies are needed to explore changes over time of these clusters.
