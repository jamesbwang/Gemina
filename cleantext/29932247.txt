  Huperzine A ( HupA) , derived from Huperzia Serrata , has exhibited a variety of biological actions , in particular neuroprotective effect. However , the protective activities of HupA on murine embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 cells after X-rays radiation have not been fully elucidated. Herein , HupA treatment dramatically promoted cell viability , abated a G0/G1 peak accumulation , and ameliorated increase of cell apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells after X-rays radiation. Simultaneously , HupA notably enhanced activities of anti-oxidant enzymes , inhibited activity of lipid peroxide , and efficiently eliminated production of reactive oxygen species in NIH3T3 cells after X-rays radiation. Dose-dependent increase of antioxidant genes by HupA were associated with up-regulated Nrf2 and down-regulated Keap-1 expression , which was confirmed by increasing nuclear accumulation , and inhibiting of degradation of Nrf2. Notably , augmented luciferase activity of ARE may explained Nrf2/ARE-mediated signaling pathways behind HupA protective properties. Moreover , expression of Nrf2 HupA-mediated was significant attenuated by AKT inhibitor ( LY294002) , p38 MAPK inhibitor ( SB202190) and ERK inhibitor ( PD98059). Besides , HupA-mediated cell viability , and ROS production were dramatically bated by LY294002 , SB202190 , and PD98059. Taken together , HupA effectively ameliorated X-rays radiation-induced damage Nrf2-ARE-mediated transcriptional response via activation AKT , p38 , and ERK signaling in NIH3T3 cells.
