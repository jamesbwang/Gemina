  Complete mitochondrial genomics is an effective tool for studying the demographic history of human populations , but there is still a deficit of mitogenomic data in European populations. In this paper , we present results of study of variability of 80 complete mitochondrial genomes in two Hungarian populations from eastern part of Hungary ( Szeged and Debrecen areas). The genetic diversity of Hungarian mitogenomes is remarkably high , reaching 99.9 % in a combined sample. According to the analysis of molecular variance ( AMOVA) , European populations showed a low , but statistically significant level of between-population differentiation ( Fst = 0.61 % , p = 0) , and two Hungarian populations demonstrate lack of between-population differences. Phylogeographic analysis allowed us to identify 71 different mtDNA sub-clades in Hungarians , sixteen of which are novel. Analysis of ancestry-informative mtDNA sub-clades revealed a complex genetic structure associated with the genetic impact of populations from different parts of Eurasia , though the contribution from European populations is the most pronounced. At least 8 % of ancestry-informative haplotypes found in Hungarians demonstrate similarity with East and West<disease> Slavic populations ( sub-clades H1c23a , H2a1c1 , J2b1a6 , T2b25a1 , U4a2e , K1c1j , and I1a1c) , while the influence of Siberian populations is not so noticeable ( sub-clades A12a , C4a1a , and probably U4b1a4).
