  Zinc molybdate ( ZnMoO â‚„) was prepared by thermal decomposition of an oxalate complex under a controlled temperature of 500 & deg; C. Analyses of the oxalate complex were carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA). On the other hand , analyses of the synthesized zinc molybdate were carried out by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique ( BET). The efficiency of the synthesized catalyst was tested with the reduction reaction of 3-nitrophenol ( 3-NP) , and was also applied as a sorbent for methylene blue dye ( MB) in aqueous solutions. The catalytic test of zinc molybdate shows a very high activity. The concentration reduction progress and adsorption of the dye were followed by an ultraviolet-visible ( UV-vis) spectrophotometer.
