  CLL is an aging-associated neoplasm with median age at diagnosis > 65 years. Little is known about safety and efficacy of FC/FCR regimens in elderly CLL patients with multiple comorbidities. We retrospectively revised medical records of 90 patients treated with FC/FCR regimens in our clinic. Data on demographic and biological characteristics , comorbidities , response to therapy , and treatment-associated adverse events were analyzed. Compared to FC , FCR yielded higher rates of OR ( 93.6 vs. 81.4 % , p = .109) and CR ( 72.3 vs. 46.5 % , p = .018). This translated in longer EFS ( median 52 vs. 19 months , p = < .001) and OS ( median 89 vs. 45 months , p = .001). Elderly patients ( â‰¥ 65 years) had more comorbidities and higher median CIRS-G score ( 7 vs. 4 , p < .001). However , no association was found between CIRS-G score and survival. Decreased renal function was associated with dismal prognosis in patients treated with FCR.
