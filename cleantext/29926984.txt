  Interleukin-18-137G/ C , -607 G/T polymorphisms play multiple roles in various cancers. However , studies focused on its involvement in breast cancer remain controversial , and no study has taken the interaction between interleukin-18 ( IL-18) gene polymorphism and body mass index ( BMI) , menopause into consideration. The study investigated the association between IL-18-137 , -607 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer and a possible interaction between the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) and BMI , menopause in Chinese Han woman. A total of 488 participants , including 178 patients with breast cancer , 150 patients with benign breast disease and 160 healthy controls were recruited for this study. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)- direct sequencing technology was used to identify the genotypes. 137 G/C genotype can decrease the risk of breast cancer ( OR = 0.54 , 95 % CI: 0.31-0.93; P = .025). In benign group , subjects with G/C genotype of IL-18-137G/ C polymorphism had a 1.89-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer ( 95 % CI = 1.05-3.41; P = .032). Among postmenopausal subjects , people with G/T genotype of IL-18-607 polymorphism had a 7.97-fold increased risk of lymph node metastasis compared with those with T/T homozygotes ( 95 % CI = 1.95-32.65; P = .0045). Among Overweight and obese patients with breast cancer ( BMI â‰¥ 24) , people with G/T genotype of IL-18-607 polymorphism had a 5.45-fold increased risk of lymph node metastasis compared with those with T/T homozygotes ( 95 % CI = 1.74-17.06; P = .034). IL-18-137 G/C genotype may be a protective factor for healthy group , but a risk factor for benign group. IL-18-607 G/T genotype have an interaction with menopausal and BMI. The synergetic effect can further increase the risk of lymph node metastasis for breast cancer patients.
