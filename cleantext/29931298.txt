  Radiofrequency energy systems are popular options in the treatment of skin laxity and wrinkles. Fractional radiofrequency devices ( FRF) have increased the efficacy and safety. Thermo-contraction system ( TC) is also a novel technology which can promote a marked lifting effect. This trial was done to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination treatment using FRF system and TC for facial skin rejuvenation. Fifteen female volunteers ( mean age , 47.07 Â± 8.83 years) received three FRF and six TC bipolar treatments in 3 weeks. Assessment methods included wrinkle grading by independent investigator using Glogau wrinkle scoring , objective measurement of depth , area and volume of right nasolabial fold ( using the VisioFace CSI software) , thickness and echo-density of dermis ( using high frequency ultrasound) , and measurement of the skin biophysical parameters before and 3 months after last treatment. Histological assessment was also performed on 5 volunteer participants. The clinical evaluation showed a significant improvement in Glogau wrinkle scoring after 3 months ( p-value , 0.041). The area and volume of nasolabial folds were also significantly reduced ( p-values , 0.026 and 0.031 , respectively). Skin ultrasound showed a significant increase in echo-density of dermis , which was confirmed by histological findings of an increase in dermal collagen content. Adverse reactions were all transient and mild in severity and subjects were `` moderately satisfied '' with the treatment ( Likert scale , 3.6 out of 5). The results of this trial showed that a combination therapy by FRF and TC bipolar systems is efficient and safe for facial skin rejuvenation.
