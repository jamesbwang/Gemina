  Giant hiatal hernia is characterized by the presence of more than 1/3 of the stomach in the chest , through the diaphragmatic hiatus , with or without other intra-abdominal organs. It is a rare pathology , representing the 5-10 % of all hiatal hernias. The advent of laparoscopic surgery led to new surgical techniques , which include the simple reduction with the excision of the hernial sac and the execution of a posterior hiatoplasty , with or without mesh , and the execution of a Collis-Nissen gatroplasty in case of short esophagus. We followed 24 cases of giant hiatal hernia with more than 1/3 stomach located in the chest , analyzing the results reached by the miniinvasive procedure , and the long-term pathophysiologic results of the disease. Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair results in less postoperative pain compared with the open approach. The smaller incisions of minimally-invasive surgery are less likely to be complicated by incisional hernias and wound<disease> infection<disease> Postoperative respiratory complications are reduced. Results from multiple studies are similar , with shorter hospital stay and less morbidity resulting from the minimally invasive approach.
