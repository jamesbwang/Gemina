  The `` Bioénergétique et Ingénierie des Protéines ( BIP) '' laboratory , CNRS ( France) , organized its first French workshop on molecular chaperone proteins and protein folding in November 2017. The goal of this workshop was to gather scientists working in France on chaperone proteins and protein folding. This initiative was a great success with excellent talks and fruitful discussions. The highlights were on the description of unexpected functions and post-translational regulation of known molecular chaperones ( such as Hsp90 , Hsp33 , SecB , GroEL) and on state-of-the-art methods to tackle questions related to this theme , including Cryo-electron microscopy , Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR) , Electron Paramagnetic Resonance ( EPR) , simulation and modeling. We expect to organize a second workshop in two years that will include more scientists working in France in the chaperone field.
