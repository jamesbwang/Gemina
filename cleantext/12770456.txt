  Mating causes many changes in physiology , behavior , and gene expression in a wide range of organisms. These changes are predicted to be sex specific , influenced by the divergent reproductive roles of the sexes. In female insects , mating is associated with an increase in egg production which requires high levels of nutritional input with direct consequences for the physiological needs of individual females. Consequently , females alter their nutritional acquisition in line with the physiological demands imposed by mating. Although much is known about the female mating-induced nutritional response , far less is known about changes in males. In addition , it is unknown whether variation between genotypes translates into variation in dietary behavioral responses. Here we examine mating-induced shifts in male and female dietary preferences across genotypes of
