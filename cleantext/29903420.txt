  Numerous state health departments ( SHDs) have validated central line-associated bloodstream infection ( CLABSI) data , and results from these studies provide important insights into the accuracy of CLABSI reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN) and remediable shortcomings in adherence to the CLABSI definition and criteria. State CLABSI validation results were obtained from peer-reviewed publications , reports on SHD Web sites , and via personal communications with the SHD health care-associated infections coordinator. Data accuracy measures included pooled mean sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value. Total CLABSI error rate was computed as the proportion of mismatches among total records reviewed. When available , reasons for CLABSI misclassification reported by SHDs were reviewed. At least 23 SHDs that have completed CLABSI validations indicated sensitivity ( pooled mean , 82.9 %) , specificity ( pooled mean , 98.5 %) , positive predictive value ( pooled mean , 94.1 %) , and negative predictive value ( pooled mean , 95.9 %) of CLABSI reporting. The pooled error rate of CLABSI reporting was 4.4 %. Reasons for CLABSI misclassification included incorrect secondary bloodstream infection attribution , misapplication of CLABSI definition , missed case finding , applying clinical over surveillance definitions , misapplication of laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection 2 definition , and misapplication of general NHSN definitions. CLABSI underreporting remains a major concern; validations conducted by SHDs provide an important impetus for improved reporting. SHDs are uniquely positioned to engage facilities in collaborative validation reviews that allow transparency , education , and relationship building.
