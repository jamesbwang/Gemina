  Subglottic hemangioma is a rare benign tumor in children. It causes an obstruction of the upper airway and can be life-threatening. Several therapeutic options have been used in the literature , including surgery. Currently , the treatment is essentially based on propranolol. We report the case of a 2-month-old female infant hospitalized for severe obstructive dyspnea<symptom> secondary to a subglottic hemangioma. Diagnosis was confirmed by laryngoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The child underwent a tracheotomy and was treated with propranolol. The progression was favorable with regression of the subglottic hemangioma and improvement of laryngotracheal airway obstruction.
