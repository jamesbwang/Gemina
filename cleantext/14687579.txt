  ArDock ( ardock.ibcp.fr) is a structural bioinformatics web server for the prediction and the visualization of potential interaction regions at protein surfaces. ArDock ranks the surface residues of a protein according to their tendency to form interfaces in a set of predefined docking experiments between the query protein and a set of arbitrary protein probes. The ArDock methodology is derived from large scale cross-docking studies where it was observed that randomly chosen proteins tend to dock in a non-random way at protein surfaces. The method predicts interaction site of the protein , or alternate interfaces in the case of proteins with multiple interaction modes. The server takes a protein structure as input and computes a score for each surface residue. Its output focuses on the interactive visualization of results and on interoperability with other services.
