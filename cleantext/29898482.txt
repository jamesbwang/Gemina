  Ultrasonography of the canine ovary is a non-invasive examination procedure , which is an important part of the gynaecological examination. For the correct visualisation of the canine ovary , practical experience as well as the correct equipment are important. This article describes the technical requirements , the examination procedure and the appearance of the physiological ovary. The examination can be performed on both a recumbent and standing dog. To find the ovaries , the kidneys can be used as a reference point. The exact size of the ovaries is dependent on the body mass of the dog and the oestrous cycle stage. Particularly in the follicle phase , the detection of the ovaries is facilitated by the functional bodies. Follicles appear as anechoic round structures , which reach a maximum diameter of 6-9 mm. Corpora lutea appear hypoechogenic and protrude over the ovarian surface. In anoestrus , the ovaries are small and of medium echogenicity.
