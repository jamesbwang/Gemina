  Following productive infection , Bovine herpesvirus-1 ( BoHV-1) establishes latency in sensory neurons. Like other Î±-herpesviruses , expression of BoHV-1 Immediate Early ( IE) genes are regulated by an enhancer complex containing the viral IE activator VP16 , the cellular transcription factor Oct-1 , and transcriptional coactivator HCF-1 that is assembled on an IE enhancer core element ( TAATGARAT). Expression of the IE transcription unit that encodes the viral IE activators bICP0 and bICP4 may also be induced by the activated glucocorticoid receptor via two Glucocorticoid Response Elements ( GREs) located upstream of the enhancer core. Strikingly , lytic infection and reactivation from latency are consistently enhanced by glucocorticoid treatment
