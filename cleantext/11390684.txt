  Phosphopantetheinyl transferases ( PPTases) are a superfamily of essential enzymes required for the synthetic processes of many compounds including fatty acid , polyketide , and nonribosomal peptide metabolites. These enzymes activate carrier proteins in specific biosynthetic pathways via the transfer of a phosphopantetheinyl moiety to a serine residue in the conserved motif of carrier proteins. Since many
