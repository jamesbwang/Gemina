  Periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI) is a potentially deadly complication of total joint arthroplasty. This study was designed to address how the incidence of PJI and outcome of treatment , including mortality , are changing in the population over time. Primary total hip arthroplasty ( THA) and total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) patients with PJI from the 100 % Medicare inpatient data set ( 2005-2015) were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models for risk of PJI after THA/TKA ( accounting for competing risks) or risk of all-cause mortality after PJI were adjusted for patient and clinical factors , with year included as a covariate to test for time trends. The unadjusted 1-year and 5-year risk of PJI was 0.69 % and 1.09 % for THA and 0.74 % and 1.38 % for TKA , respectively. After adjustment , PJI risk did not change significantly by year for THA ( P = .63) or TKA ( P = .96). The unadjusted 1-year and 5-year overall survival after PJI diagnosis was 88.7 % and 67.2 % for THA and 91.7 % and 71.7 % for TKA , respectively. After adjustment , the risk of mortality after PJI decreased significantly by year for THA ( hazard ratio = 0.97; P < .001) and TKA ( hazard ratio = 0.97; P < .001). Despite recent clinical focus on preventing PJI , we are unable to detect substantial decline in the risk of PJI over time , although mortality after PJI has declined. Because PJI risk appears not to be changing over time , the incidence of PJI is anticipated to scale up proportionately with the demand for THA and TKA , which is projected to increase substantially in the coming decade.
