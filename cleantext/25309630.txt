  Testicular germ cell cancer in a metastatic state is curable with a cisplatin-based first line chemotherapy. However , 10-15 % of these patients are resistant to first line chemotherapy and are thus left with only palliative options. Immunotherapies and inhibition of angiogenesis used in multiple types of cancer; however , the molecular context of angiogenesis and immune checkpoints in the development and progression of testicular cancers is still unknown. Therefore , the present study performed tissue micro array based analysis of 84 patients with immunohistochemistry of programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) , programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2) of testicular cancer and corresponding normal appearing testis tissue , matching the results with clinical data. The results demonstrated that PD-L1 was significantly upregulated in testicular tumors and that PD-1 positive cells significantly infiltrated the testicular tumor when compared with normal testicular tissue. VEGFR2 was significantly upregulated in testicular cancer. It was indicated that PD-1 expressing cytotoxic cells may require pathologic tumor vessels to pass the blood-testis-barrier in order to migrate into the tumor. Notably , when matching the clinical data for PD-1 , PD-L1 and VEGFR2 there were no differences in expression in the different International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group stages of non-seminoma. These data suggested that the anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 immunotherapy and the anti-angiogenic therapy , sequentially or in combination , may be a promising option in the treatment of testicular cancer.
