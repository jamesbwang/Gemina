  The approach to identifying a genetic cause in patients with cerebellar disorders relies on history , examination , consultation , and testing , combined with specialized expertise because they are rare and genetically diverse. Cerebellar disorders can be caused by a variety of DNA alterations including single-nucleotide changes , small insertions or deletions , larger copy number variants , and nucleotide repeat expansions , exhibiting autosomal-recessive , autosomal-dominant ( inherited and de novo) , X-linked , and mitochondrial modes of inheritance. Imaging findings and a variety of neurologic and nonneurologic clinical features can help direct genetic testing and choose the most appropriate strategy. Clinical and genetic diagnoses are complementary , each providing distinct information for the care of the patient. In this chapter , we provide an overview of inheritance modes for different cerebellar disorders and the variety of genetic testing and tools that are currently available to reach a genetic diagnosis , including conventional and next-generation sequencing , classic , molecular and virtual cytogenetics , testing for repeat expansions , and other techniques. Practical examples are presented in both the text and accompanying vignettes.
