  Na-ion batteries are promising alternatives to Li-ion systems for electrochemical energy storage because of the higher natural abundance and widespread distribution of Na compared to Li. High capacity anode materials , such as phosphorus , have been explored to realize Na-ion battery technologies that offer comparable performances to their Li-ion counterparts. While P anodes provide unparalleled capacities , the mechanism of sodiation and desodiation is not well-understood , limiting further optimization. Here , we use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to provide molecular-level insight into the ( de) sodiation pathways in black P anodes for sodium-ion batteries. A determination of the P binding in these materials was achieved by comparing to structure models created via species swapping , ab initio random structure searching , and a genetic algorithm. During sodiation , analysis of
