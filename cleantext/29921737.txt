  Reported survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 23 weeks ' gestation are based on the infants admitted to NICUs. In this study , we aim to describe the association between clinical characteristics and admission to NICU at 23 , 24 and 25 weeks ' gestation. Cohort data from 2 national databases enabled comparison of the clinical characteristics all Australian births and all NICU admissions during 2010-2013 at 23 , 24 , and 25 weeks ' gestation. NICU admission occurred in 15 % of all births at 23 weeks , in comparison with 49 % at 24 weeks and 64 % at 25 weeks. At 23 weeks , live-born infants were less likely to be admitted to NICU with birth weight < 500 g compared with > 500 g ( 13 % vs 43 % , In the Australian population , admission to the NICU is more likely to be influenced by birth weight and sex at 23 weeks ' gestation when compared with 24 and 25 weeks ' gestation. Survival outcomes at 23 weeks may be affected by less active perinatal care. Uncertainty exists regarding the generalizability of current data regarding survival and developmental potential of live-born 23-week infants.
