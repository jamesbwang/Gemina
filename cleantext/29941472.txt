  The European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine European Biological Variation Study ( EuBIVAS) has been established to deliver rigorously determined data describing biological variation ( BV) of clinically important measurands. Here , EuBIVAS-based BV estimates of serum electrolytes , lipids , urea , uric acid , total protein , total bilirubin , direct bilirubin , and glucose , as well as their associated analytical performance specifications ( APSs) , are presented. Samples were drawn from 91 healthy individuals ( 38 male , 53 female; age range , 21-69 years) for 10 consecutive weeks at 6 European laboratories. Samples were stored at -80 Â°C before duplicate analysis of all samples on an ADVIA 2400 ( Siemens Healthineers). Outlier and homogeneity analyses were performed , followed by CV-ANOVA on trend-corrected data , when relevant , to determine BV estimates with CIs. The within-subject BV ( CV The EuBIVAS , which is fully compliant with the recently published Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist , has produced well-characterized , high-quality BV estimates utilizing a stringent experimental protocol. These new reference data deliver revised and more exacting APS and reference change values for commonly used clinically important measurands , thus having direct relevance to diagnostics manufacturers , service providers , clinical users , and ultimately patients.
