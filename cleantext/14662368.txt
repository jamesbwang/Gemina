  Coherence between electromyographic ( EMG) signals is often used to infer the common synaptic input to populations of motor neurons. This analysis , however , may be limited due to the filtering effect of the motor unit action potential waveforms. This study investigated the ability of surface EMG-EMG coherence to predict common synaptic input to motor neurons. Surface and intramuscular EMG were recorded from two locations of the tibialis anterior muscle during steady ankle dorsiflexions at 5 and 10 % of the maximal force in 10 healthy individuals. The intramuscular EMG signals were decomposed to identify single motor unit spike trains. For each trial , the strength of the common input in different frequency bands was estimated from the coherence between two cumulative spike trains , generated from sets of single motor unit spike trains ( reference measure). These coherence values were compared with those obtained from the coherence between the surface EMG signals ( raw , rectified , and high-passed filtered at 250 Hz before rectification) using linear regression. Overall , the high-pass filtering of the EMG prior to rectification did not substantially change the results with respect to rectification only. For both signals , the correlation of EMG coherence with motor unit coherence was strong at 5 % MVC (
