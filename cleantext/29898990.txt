  The blockade of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and PD-1 is being exploited therapeutically in several types of malignancies. Here , we aimed to understand the contribution of the genetics of lung cancer ( LC) to the ability of tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance checkpoints. Over 150 primary non-small cell lung cancers , including pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas , were tested for the levels of HLA-I complex , PD-L1 , tumor-infiltrating CD8 + lymphocytes and alterations in main LC genes. Correlations were validated in cancer cell lines using appropriate treatments to activate or inhibit selected pathways. We also performed RNA sequencing to assess changes in gene expression after these treatments Results: MET-oncogenic activation tended to associate with positive PD-L1 immunostaining , whereas STK11 mutations were correlated with negative immunostaining. In MET-altered cancer cells , MET triggered a transcriptional increase of PD-L1 that was independent of the IFNγ-mediated JAK/STAT pathway. The activation of MET also up-regulated other immunosuppressive genes ( PDCD1LG2 and SOCS1) , and transcripts involved in angiogenesis ( VEGFA and NRP1) and in cell proliferation. We also report recurrent inactivating mutations in JAK2 that co-occur with alterations in MET and STK11 , which prevented the induction of immunoresponse-related genes following treatment with IFNγ. We show that MET activation promotes the expression of several negative checkpoint regulators of the immunoresponse , including PD-L1. In addition , we report inactivation of JAK2 in LC cells that prevented the response to IFNγ. These alterations are likely to facilitate tumor growth by enabling immune tolerance and may affect the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
