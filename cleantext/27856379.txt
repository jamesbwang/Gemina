  Data provenance is a technique that describes the history of digital objects. In health data settings , it can be used to deliver auditability and transparency , and to achieve trust in a software system. However , implementing data provenance in analytics software at an enterprise level presents a different set of challenges from the research environments where data provenance was originally devised. In this paper , the challenges of reporting provenance information to the user is presented. Provenance captured from analytics software can be large and complex and visualizing a series of tasks over a long period can be overwhelming even for a domain expert , requiring visual aggregation mechanisms that fit with complex human cognitive activities involved in the process. This research studied how provenance-based reporting can be integrated into a health data analytics software , using the example of Atmolytics visual reporting tool.
