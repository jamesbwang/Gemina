  Although recent work has focused on characterizing quantitative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) markers that may predict outcome among patients with cervical degenerative conditions , little is known about their reliability. Measurement and reporting of these markers is time-consuming and nonstandardized , preventing routine use in clinical care. We retrospectively analyzed cervical MRI among subjects prospectively enrolled in a health outcomes study of elective surgery for degenerative cervical spine conditions. Two radiologists independently reviewed MRI for presence or absence and length of cord signal change , level of worst cord compression , axial anteroposterior ( AP) and lateral spinal cord diameter , midsagittal AP diameter , and kyphosis. Interobserver reliability was compared using kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC). Inclusion criteria were met by 209 patients who had MRI available for review. Most patients were female ( 58 %) and middle-aged ( mean age 51 years) , and 54 % had a diagnosis of myelopathy. Reliability was fair for cord signal change on T1 ( κ = 0.33) and good on T2 ( κ = 0.74) images. Among patients with T2 change ( n = 22) , reliability for signal change length was good ( ICC = 0.67). For level of worst compression , reliability was good ( κ = 0.79). For AP cord diameter , reliability was very good ( ICC = 0.82; T2/midsagittal) and good ( ICC = 0.66; T2/axial). Reliability was moderate for lateral cord diameter ( ICC = 0.55; T2/axial) and good for kyphosis ( κ = 0.76). Good and very good reliability observed in measuring T2-weighted spinal cord signal change , level of worst compression , AP cord diameter , and kyphosis support use of these markers in standardized reporting , which could be incorporated into routine clinical use.
