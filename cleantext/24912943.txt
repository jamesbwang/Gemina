  The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of coordinated and comprehensive care within a medical home among children with special health care needs ( CSHCN). The latest version of the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs ( NS-CSHCN) employed a national random-digit-dial sample whereby US households were screened , resulting in 40,242 eligible respondents. Logistic regression analyses were performed modeling the probability of coordinated , comprehensive care in a medical home based on shared decision-making and other factors. A total of 29,845 cases were selected for inclusion in the model. Of these , 17,390 cases ( 58.3 %) met the criteria for coordinated , comprehensive care in a medical home. Access to a community-based service systems had the greatest positive impact on coordinated , comprehensive care in a medical home. Adequate insurance coverage and being White/Caucasian were also positively associated with the dependent variable. Shared decision-making was reported by 72 % of respondents and had a negative , but relatively negligible impact on coordinated , comprehensive care in a medical home. Increasing age , non-traditional family structures , urban residence , and public insurance were more influential , and negatively impacted the dependent variable. Providers and their respective organizations should seek to expand and improve health and support services at the community level.
