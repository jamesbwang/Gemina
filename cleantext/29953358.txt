  Ganoderma lucidum is known to exert many health benefits including effects to improve oxygen utilization. Therefore , this study was designed to evaluate the role of a hydroalcoholic G. lucidum extract in providing tolerance to HT22 cells grown under hypoxic conditions. HT22 cells were exposed to 0.5 % O2 in the presence or absence of the extract for 24 hours. At the end of the exposure period , we performed cell viability assays , cell cycle analysis , and biochemical and protein expression studies. The extract-treated cells revealed less cell death , minimized caspase 3 and reactive oxygen species levels , and relieved G0/G1 cell cycle arrest compared with hypoxic cells cultured without the extract. Further , extract-treated cells showed improved expression of Nrf2 , heme oxygenase 1 , and metallothionein and stabilized levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Moreover , lower levels of nuclear factor-κB and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor a were evident in extract-treated cells. Overall , the G. lucidum extract reduced hypoxia-induced cell death and augmented transcription factors ( HIF-1α and Nrf2) , conferring tolerance to hypoxia.
