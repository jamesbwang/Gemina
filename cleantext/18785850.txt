  The number of new cases of emerging fungal infections has increased considerably in recent years , mainly due to the large number of immunocompromised individuals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of emerging fungi<pathogen> to fluconazole , itraconazole and amphotericin B by disk diffusion method. In 2015 , 82 emerging fungi<pathogen> were evaluated in IPB-LACEN/RS and 13 ( 15.8 %) were resistant: 10/52 were from superficial mycoses and 3/30 from systemic mycoses. The data from the study point to the need for permanent vigilance regarding the careful evaluation in the prescription and clinical and laboratory follow-up of patients affected by fungal infections.
