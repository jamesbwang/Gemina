  Despite the remarkable burden of dysphagia<symptom> , appropriate multidisciplinary management is lacking in Iran and patients are often deprived of effective treatments. Obtaining a full understanding of knowledge , attitude and practice ( KAP) of healthcare providers is necessary to determine the gaps in improvement of the quality of care for dysphagic patients. A questionnaire was designed covering demographic information and the parameters of KAP. Face and content validity were determined. Test-retest reliability confirmed that the questionnaire scores are stable over time ( r = 0.77 , p value < 0.01). Participants were healthcare providers employed in university-affiliated hospitals in three major cities of Iran; Tehran , Shiraz and Mashhad. In total , 312 healthcare professionals completed our survey. The majority ( 96.8 %) were familiar with the term `` dysphagia<symptom> or swallowing disorders ''. Most of the participants believed their profession ( 88.5 %) , as well as other disciplines ( 92.3 %) can play an important role in the management of dysphagia<symptom>; and this problem should be recognized in a multidisciplinary manner ( 96.2 %). Also , 60.9 % had encountered a patient with dysphagia<symptom>. 52.2 % had used at least one assessment method , while 49.9 % had applied at least one treatment method. However , very few participants were familiar with a standard test for screening and assessment of dysphagia<symptom> ( 11.9 %). 74.7 % were willing to participate in a workshop on dysphagia<symptom>. As the main pitfalls of care lie in diagnosis and treatment expertise , the policy of hospitals should prioritize educating and updating the skills of healthcare professionals , encourage multidisciplinary teamwork , establishing clear guidelines and facilitate access to advanced tools.
