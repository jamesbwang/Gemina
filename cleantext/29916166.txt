  RNA in situ hybridization techniques are an important tool for the study of gene expression patterns in freshwater planarians. Here I describe a RNA in situ hybridization method on histological paraffin sections of planarian tissue. This protocol allows the visualization of gene expression at cellular or subcellular resolution. Following paraffin-embedding and sectioning of planarians , the resulting sections are hybridized with hapten-labeled RNA probes. Subsequent immunological probe detection is carried out with either chromogenic or fluorescent development. This protocol can be performed alone , or in combination with other immunodetection techniques , and represents a useful alternative to whole-mount protocols more commonly used in the community.
