  Poor<symptom> treatment engagement is an enduring problem in the care of patients with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that targeted cognitive training ( TCT) improves cognition and functional outcomes , but this time-consuming intervention might reduce patients ' engagement in other treatment activities when implemented in real-world settings. This is especially true of residential care programs which encourage patients to engage in group therapies , self-care , and a wide variety of structured social , work , and other rehabilitation activities. This study aimed to determine whether TCT negatively impacts engagement in other psychosocial treatments. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited from a community-based residential care program and randomized to one of two intervention arms: treatment as usual ( TAU; n = 22) or TAU augmented with TCT ( n = 24). Psychosocial treatment engagement was tracked over 20 weeks. Treatment groups did not significantly differ on baseline variables or psychosocial treatment engagement in the 5 weeks prior to randomization. TCT had a positive effect on engagement ( β = 0.112 , p = 0.003) , but there was no treatment-by-time interaction ( β = -0.029 , p = 0.672). Participants in TCT engaged in an average of 1.34 additional group therapies , 0.58 additional activities of daily living , and 0.84 additional rehabilitation activities per week in comparison to TAU participants. Baseline cognition was also a significant predictor of psychosocial treatment engagement. Overall , results suggest that TCT can be implemented in real-world settings without negatively impacting engagement in other psychosocial treatments. Additional studies are needed to determine what role nonspecific factors play in the positive impact of TCT.
