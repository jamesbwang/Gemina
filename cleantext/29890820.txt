  The capacity of differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs) , which include both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells , into cardiomyocytes ( CMs) in vitro provides an unlimited resource for human CMs for a wide range of applications such as cell based cardiac repair , cardiac drug toxicology screening , and human cardiac disease modeling. However , their applicability is significantly limited by immature phenotypes. It has been well known that currently available CMs derived from hPSCs ( hPSC-CMs) represent immature embryonic or fetal stage CMs and are functionally and structurally different from mature human CMs. To overcome this critical issue , several new approaches aiming to generate more mature hPSC-CMs have been developed. This review describes recent approaches to generate more mature hPSC-CMs including their scientific principles , advantages , and limitations.
