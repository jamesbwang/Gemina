  In mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , electron transfer from NADH or succinate to oxygen by a series of large protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane ( complexes I-IV) is coupled to the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient , the energy of which is utilized by complex V to generate ATP. In Euglena gracilis<pathogen> , a non-parasitic secondary green alga related to trypanosomes , these respiratory complexes totalize more than 40 Euglenozoa-specific subunits along with about 50 classical subunits described in other eukaryotes. In the present study the Euglena proton-pumping complexes I , III , and IV were purified from isolated mitochondria by a two-steps liquid chromatography approach. Their atypical subunit composition was further resolved and confirmed using a three-steps PAGE analysis coupled to mass spectrometry identification of peptides. The purified complexes were also observed by electron microscopy followed by single-particle analysis. Even if the overall structures of the three oxidases are similar to the structure of canonical enzymes ( e.g. from mammals) , additional atypical domains were observed in complexes I and IV: an extra domain located at the tip of the peripheral arm of complex I and a `` helmet-like '' domain on the top of the cytochrome c binding region in complex IV.
