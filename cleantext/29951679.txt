  Oligomeric and protofibrillar aggregates that are populated along the pathway of amyloid fibril formation appear generally to be more toxic than the mature fibrillar state. In particular , α-synuclein , the protein associated with Parkinson 's disease , forms kinetically trapped protofibrils in the presence of lipid vesicles. Here , we show that lipid-induced α-synuclein protofibrils can convert rapidly to mature fibrils at higher temperatures. Furthermore , we find that β-synuclein , generally considered less aggregation prone than α-synuclein , forms protofibrils at higher temperatures. These findings highlight the importance of energy barriers in controlling the de novo formation and conversion of amyloid fibrils.
