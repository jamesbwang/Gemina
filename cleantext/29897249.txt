  Since the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 analog comprises semaglutide co-formulated with an absorption enhancer , sodium N- ( 8- ( 2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino) caprylate , which induces a transient , localized increase in gastric pH , we have investigated whether a proton pump inhibitor affects the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide. A single-center , randomized , open-label , parallel-group trial investigated pharmacokinetic interactions of oral semaglutide with omeprazole ( 40 mg once-daily) in 54 healthy subjects. Primary endpoints were area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 h for semaglutide ( AUC Exposure of semaglutide appeared to be slightly increased , although not statistically significantly , with oral semaglutide plus omeprazole versus oral semaglutide alone ( AUC There was a slight non-statistically significant increase in semaglutide exposure when oral semaglutide was administered with omeprazole , but this is not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment is likely to be required.
