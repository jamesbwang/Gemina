  To characterize treatment delays in oropharyngeal<disease> cancer treated with radiation in a national sample , identify factors associated with delays , and associate treatment delays with survival. We included adults in the National Cancer Database treated for oropharyngeal<disease> cancer with primary radiation or chemoradiation 2010-2013. We characterized diagnosis-to-treatment initiation , radiation treatment duration , and diagnosis-to-treatment end intervals as medians. We examined delays for association with patient , tumor , and treatment characteristics and with overall survival with multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression , respectively. 4089 patients were included; 12 % received radiation alone and 88 % chemoradiation. The incidence of human papilloma virus-associated tumors was 64 %. Median durations of diagnosis-to-treatment initiation , radiation duration , and diagnosis-to-treatment end were 35 , 50 , and 87 days , respectively. Human papilloma virus-positive tumors were linked to decreased delays in radiation treatment duration and diagnosis-to-treatment end ( OR = 0.72 ( 0.60-0.85) , p < 0.001 and OR = 0.79 ( 0.66-0.95) , p = 0.010 , respectively). Delays in radiation treatment duration and diagnosis-to-treatment end were negatively associated with overall survival ( HR = 1.23 ( 1.03-1.47) , p = 0.024 and 1.24 ( 1.04-1.48) , p = 0.017 , respectively). When examined separately , radiation duration remained associated with decreased overall survival in patients with human papilloma virus-negative ( HR = 1.29 ( 1.03-1.63) , p = 0.030) but not human papilloma virus-positive tumors ( HR = 1.17 ( 0.89-1.54) , p = 0.257). These median durations can serve as national benchmarks. Diagnosis-to-treatment end interval is associated with overall survival in all patients , and radiation treatment duration in patients with human papilloma virus-negative tumors. These intervals could be considered quality indicators for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation.
