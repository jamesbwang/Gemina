  Why are we so slow in choosing the lesser of 2 evils? We considered whether such slowing relates to uncertainty about the value of these options , which arises from the tendency to avoid them during learning , and whether such slowing relates to frontosubthalamic inhibitory control mechanisms. In total , 49 participants performed a reinforcement-learning task and a stop-signal task while fMRI was recorded. A reinforcement-learning model was used to quantify learning strategies. Individual differences in lose-lose slowing related to information uncertainty due to sampling , and independently , to less efficient response inhibition in the stop-signal task. Neuroimaging analysis revealed an analogous dissociation: subthalamic nucleus ( STN) BOLD activity related to variability in stopping latencies , whereas weaker frontosubthalamic connectivity related to slowing and information sampling. Across tasks , fast inhibitors increased STN activity for successfully canceled responses in the stop task , but decreased activity for lose-lose choices. These data support the notion that fronto-STN communication implements a rapid but transient brake on response execution , and that slowing due to decision uncertainty could result from an inefficient release of this `` hold your horses '' mechanism.
