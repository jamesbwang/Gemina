  The aim of the current study was to assess the serum levels of trace minerals/heavy metals in COPD patients with and without pulmonary hypertension ( PH) and to investigate their correlations to demographic , clinical , and biochemical variables. This cross-sectional study was performed in Van Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty between April 2013 and July 2013. Cases were allocated into three groups: Group 1 consisted of severe COPD patients; Group 2 was made up of COPD patients with PH; and healthy controls constituted Group 3. Demographic , radiological , and biochemical variables , as well as the serum levels of trace minerals and heavy metals , were noted and compared in these three groups. COPD patients were older and had higher rates of smoking habit , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension compared to the control group. Carotid intima-media thickness was increased bilaterally , and serum levels of Co , Cu , and Fe were higher in COPD patients. Left carotid intima-media thickness was increased , and serum levels of Cd , Co , and Fe were found to be higher in COPD cases with PH compared to COPD patients without PH. Our results show that serum levels of trace minerals and heavy metals may be altered in COPD and PH.
