  The purpose was to compare the airway response to sprint interval exercise ( SIE) and continuous exercise ( CE) in active adults with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIBC) , and to compare ventilatory and oxygen delivery responses between adults with and without EIBC. Adults with EIBC ( n = 8 , 22.3 ± 3.0 years) and adults without EIBC ( n = 8 , 22.3 ± 3.0 years) completed a SIE ( 4 × 30 s sprints separated by 4.5 min of active recovery) and CE ( 20 min at 65 % peak power output) session. Lung function was assessed at baseline , during exercise , and up to 20 min post-exercise. Ventilatory parameters and tissue saturation index ( TSI) were recorded continuously throughout the sessions. The decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s was similar following SIE ( -8.6 ± 12.6 %) and CE ( -9.0 ± 9.3 %) in adults with EIBC. There were no significant differences in any of the ventilatory parameters or in TSI during SIE or CE between those with and without EIBC. These findings suggest that SIE and CE affect airway responsiveness to a similar extent. Future research using a lower intensity CE protocol in an inactive sample of adults with EIBC is needed.
