  Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) is a neuro-developmental disorder related to internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as somatic complaints and disorders. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of headache<symptom> subtypes , epilepsy , atopic disorders , motion sickness and recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> among children and adolescents with ADHD and their parents. In a multi-center , cross-sectional , familial association study using case-control design , treatment na√Øve children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age diagnosed with ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria as well as age- and gender-matched healthy controls and their parents were evaluated by a neurologist and analyzed accordingly. 117 children and adolescents with ADHD and 111 controls were included. Headache<symptom> disorder diagnosis was common for both patients and healthy controls ( 59.0 % vs. 37.8 %) , with a significantly elevated rate in the ADHD group ( p = 0.002). Migraine was found in 26.0 % of ADHD patients and 9.9 % of healthy controls. Tension headache<symptom> was found in 32.4 % of ADHD patients and 27.9 % of healthy controls. Headache<symptom> diagnosis was also found to be significantly more common in mothers of children with ADHD than control group mothers ( 90.5 % vs. 36.6 % , p < 0.001). Headache<symptom> diagnoses and specifically migraines were significantly more common among children with ADHD and their mothers , while recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> was elevated in both parents and ADHD patients. Migraine is an important part of ADHD comorbidity , not only for children but also for mothers. Motion sickness may be reduced among families of ADHD probands.
