  Stigma and discrimination remains a barrier to uptake of HIV/AIDS counselling and treatment as well as effective HIV<pathogen> reduction programmes. Despite ethnic diversity of Nigeria , studies on determinants of HIV<pathogen> stigma incorporating the ethnic dimension are very few. This paper provides empirical explanation of the ethnic dimension of determinant of HIV<pathogen> stigma and discrimination in Nigeria. Nationally representative data from Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey 2013 ( Individual recode) was analysed to explore ethnic differentials and homogeneity in the determinants of HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination among women in multi-ethnic Nigeria. Result shows that determinants of HIV<pathogen> stigma and discrimination varies by ethnicity in Nigeria. Significant ethnic differentials in HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination by Secondary school education exist among Hausa and Igbo respectively ( OR = 0.79; CI: 1.49-2.28 and OR = 1.62; CI: 1.18-2.23 , p < 0.05). Wealth status significantly influenced HIIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination among Hausa , Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups ( p < 0.05). Knowledge of HIV/AIDS was significantly associated with lower odds of discriminating attitudes among the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups ( OR = 0.45; CI: 0.30-0.67 and OR = 0.36; CI: 0.16-0.83 , p < 0.05). Identifying ethnic differential and homogeneity in predictors of HIV/AIDS stigma is key to reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence in Nigeria and countries with similar settings.
