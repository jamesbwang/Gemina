  When a bioactive molecule is taken into cells by endocytosis , it is sometimes unable to escape from the lysosomes , resulting in inefficient drug release. We prepared pH-responsive polyion complex ( PIC) vesicles that collapse under acidic conditions such as those inside a lysosome. Furthermore , under acidic conditions , cationic polymer was released from the PIC vesicles to break the lysosome membranes<symptom>. Diblock copolymers ( P
