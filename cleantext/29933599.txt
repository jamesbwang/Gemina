  The objective of this study was to establish a novel method for rapid detection of six glucocorticoids ( prednisone , prednisone acetate , prednisolone , hydrocortisone , hydrocortisone acetate , and dexamethasone) added illegally in dietary supplements simultaneously by combining thin layer chromatography ( TLC) with spot-concentrated Raman scattering ( SCRS). The doping ingredients were separated by TLC , and viewed and located with UV light ( 254 nm) , enriched by chromatography , then Raman spectra were directly detected by a Raman Imagine microscope with 780 nm laser source. This method had complementary advantages of TLC and Raman spectroscopy , which enhanced the specificity of the test results. The limit of detection ( LOD) of the reference substances were 4 μg , 4 μg , 4 μg , 6 μg , 6 μg , and 4 μg , respectively. The method was used to study the six glucocorticoids added illegally in five dietary supplements. Fake drugs had been detected. The study showed that the TLC-SCRS method is simple , rapid , specific , sensitive , and reliable. The method could be used for effective separation and detection of six chemical components used in dietary supplement products , and would have good prospects for on-site qualitative screening of dietary supplement products for adulterants.
