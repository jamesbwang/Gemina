  Anthropological investigations have confirmed many times over , through multiple fields of research the critical role of consumption of animal source foods ( ASF) including meat in the evolution of our species. As early as four million years ago , our early bipedal hominin ancestors were scavenging ASFs as evidenced by cut marks on animal bone remains , stable isotope composition of these hominin remains and numerous other lines of evidence from physiological and paleo-anthropological domains. This ASF intake marked a transition from a largely forest<disease> dwelling frugivorous lifestyle to a more open rangeland existence and resulted in numerous adaptations , including a rapidly increasing brain size and altered gut structure. Details of the various fields of anthropological evidence are discussed , followed by a summary of the health implications of meat consumption in the modern world , including issues around saturated fat and omega-3 fatty acid intake and discussion of the critical nutrients ASFs supply , with particular emphasis on brain function.
