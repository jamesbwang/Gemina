  Thogoto<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( THOV) , a tick-borne arbovirus not previously reported in East Asia , was recently isolated from Haemaphysalis<pathogen> longicornis in Kyoto , Japan. In this study , we investigated the vector competence of H. longicornis ticks for a Japanese isolate of the Thogoto<pathogen> virus<pathogen> using anal pore microinjection and experimental virus acquisition. Our results showed that anal pore microinjection can readily infect adult ticks , and THOV-infected ticks can successfully transmit the virus to mice. Blood feeding was also critical in the distribution of the virus in tick organs , most especially in the salivary glands. Furthermore , co-feeding between an infected adult and na√Øve nymphs can also produce infected molted adults that can horizontally transmit THOV to mice. Altogether , our results suggest that H. longicornis is a competent vector for the Japanese THOV isolate and could be the primary tick vector of the virus in Japan.
