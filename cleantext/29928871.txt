  During orthodontic treatment , binding teeth , may change the topographically organized representation of teeth in the cerebral cortex. To test the hypothesis that experimental tooth movement ( ETM) changes the somatotopy of an individual tooth arrangement in the somatosensory cortex , we examined the spatiotemporal features of cortical excitatory propagation in response to mechanical stimulation of the maxillary incisor or molar using optical imaging in late adolescent rats without or with ETM. The ETM models consisted of 1d , 3d , and 7d ETM in which a closed-coil spring was ligated between the maxillary first molar and incisors. In controls , incisor and molar mechanical stimulation evoked excitation in the rostral and dorsocaudal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1) , respectively. In addition , the secondary somatosensory cortex and insular oral region ( S2/IOR) were also activated. Incisor stimulation-induced excitatory regions in S1 of 3d and 7d ETM shifted without changing the maximum excitatory area or peak amplitude; the incisor stimulation-responding region moved toward the dorsocaudal region , which responded to molar stimulation in the control. This shift in excitatory region was not observed in 1d ETM. One day after removal of the coil spring that was attached for 6 d , the excitatory region shift in S1 was recovered to the control region. On the other hand , 1d ETM exhibited facilitation of the excitatory area and peak amplitude upon molar stimulation , and the facilitation of excitatory propagation disappeared in 3d and 7d ETM. These results may explain the clinical finding that abnormal<symptom> sensation<symptom> temporally occurs during orthodontic treatment. ( 249/250 words).
