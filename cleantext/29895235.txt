  Study Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Background Two-dimensional ( 2D) analysis is commonly used to quantify frontal plane kinematics of the trunk and lower extremity; however , there are conflicting results regarding the reliability and validity of these measurements. Objective To synthesize the current literature to determine if 2D analysis is a reliable and valid method of measuring frontal plane kinematics of the trunk and lower extremity during squatting , landing and cutting tasks. Methods MEDLINE , CINAHL , EMBASE , Scopus and SportDISCUS databases were searched from inception until March 2017. We included 16 studies that evaluated the reliability and/or validity of 2D measurements of frontal plane trunk and/or lower extremity kinematics when compared to three-dimensional ( 3D) measurements during any of the following tasks: squatting , landing or cutting. Results Intra-rater reliability ( intra-day and inter-day) and inter-rater reliability of the 2D video measurements varied from moderate to excellent. In terms of validity there was poor agreement between the 2D and 3D methods with no correlation between 2D knee frontal plane projection angle ( FPPA) and 3D knee frontal plane angles ( r = 0.127 , p = 0.094) for the single leg squat but with moderate to good relationship ( r = 0.619 , p = 0.0001) for the landing task. Conclusion Two-dimensional video analysis of frontal plane trunk and lower extremity kinematics is reliable , but this appears to be dependent on the task and the type of reliability evaluated. The current evidence does not support the use of 2D video analysis for measuring trunk and lower extremity frontal plane kinematics when accurate measures are required.
