  School-going children are documenting the increasing incidence of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP). Compared to adults , the prevalence of hypertension ( HT) is low among children , but high BP among them can lead to HT in their adult life. The aim of was to study the risk factors and correlates of high BP among school-going children. A cross-sectional study was carried out for 1 1/2 years among 892 randomly selected school children of 6 Correlation and linear regression analysis were done for continuous variables. For dichotomous variables , mean and standard deviation were calculated and Higher age group , being male , and obesity were found to be significantly associated with elevated systolic BP ( SBP) and elevated diastolic BP ( DBP). Family history of diabetes and HT was significantly associated with elevated DBP. On linear regression analysis , the studied factors explained 30 % variation in SBP and only 12 % variation in DBP. Weight and body mass index explained the maximum variation in both SBP and DBP. Overweight or obesity , being male , family history of HT , and increasing age were important risk factors of elevated BP.
