  To assess the effect of psychotropic drugs on fetal behavior using four-dimensional ( 4D) ultrasound in the third trimester of pregnancy. Fetal behavior was assessed using Kurjak 's antenatal neurodevelopmental test ( KANET) using 4D ultrasound between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Thirty healthy ( control group) and 10 psychotropic-drug-administered pregnant ( case group) women were studied. The total value of the KANET score and values of each parameter ( eight parameters) were compared between the two groups. The total KANET score was normal ( except for one fetus in the case group: total score of 9) in both groups , and there was no significant difference in the total KANET score. When individual KANET parameters were compared , no significant differences were noted in any of the eight parameters. Our results showed that there is no difference in fetal behavior between fetuses of normal pregnant women and those of psychotropic-drug-administered pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. These results suggest that psychotropic drugs may not affect fetal behavioral development in utero. However , the data and their interpretation in the present study should be taken with some degree of caution because of the small number of subjects studied. Further studies involving a larger sample size are needed to assess the effect of psychotropic drugs on fetal neurobehavior during pregnancy.
