  Much current understanding of brown adipocyte development comes from in-vitro cell models. Serum type may affect the behavior of cultured cells and thus conclusions drawn. Here , we investigate effects of serum type ( `` fetal bovine '' versus `` newborn calf '') on responses to differentiation inducers ( the PPARÎ³ agonist rosiglitazone or the neurotransmitter norepinephrine) in cultured primary brown adipocytes. Lipid storage was enhanced by fetal versus newborn serum. However , molecular adipose conversion ( Pparg2 and Fabp4 expression) was not affected by serum type. Rosiglitazone-induced ( 7-days) expression of thermogenic genes ( i.e. Ucp1 , Pgc1a , Dio2 and Elovl3) was not systematically affected by serum type. However , importantly , acute ( 2 h) norepinephrine-induced thermogenic gene expression was overall markedly higher ( and adipose genes somewhat lower) in cells cultured in newborn serum. Thus , newborn serum promotes thermogenic competence , and the use of fetal serum in brown adipocyte cultures ( as is often routine) counteracts adequate differentiation. Agents that counteract this inhibition may therefore confoundingly be ascribed genuine thermogenic competence-inducing properties.
