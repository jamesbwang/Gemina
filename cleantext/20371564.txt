  ( Purpose) The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of scapula movement on neck alignment and the muscles in patients with forward head posture<symptom> , who has the structural changes around the neck caused from the forward head posture<symptom> , when scapular stabilization exercise is applied. ( Subjects and Methods) A sample of 30 patients with forward head posture<symptom> were recruited and participated in an intervention for 30 minutes a day , three times per week for 4 weeks. Fifteen patients were assigned to the scapular stabilization exercise group and the remaining 15 were assigned to the neck stabilization exercise group. Before the intervention , the craniovertebral angle ( CVA) , cranial rotation angle ( CRA) , and muscle activity of the muscles around the neck were measured. Four weeks later , these 3 factors were re-measured and analyzed. ( Results) Within-group changes in CVA and CRA were observed in both groups and were statistically significant. Only the CVA group had a statistically significant between-group differences. Within-group changes in muscular activity were significant differences in all groups. Between groups , the lower back trapezius and serratus anterior showed statistically significant differences. ( Conclusion) Scapular stabilization brought about improvement in posture<symptom> through activation of the neck<symptom> muscles , the lower trapezius , and the serratus anterior. Therefore , the intervention has a positive effect on neck alignment by reducing the compensatory movements of the muscles involved in forward head posture<symptom>. Structural changes are observed.
