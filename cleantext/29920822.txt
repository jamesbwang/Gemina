  This scoping review collated evidence of the pharmaceutical care needs of people with sensory<symptom> loss<symptom> ( SL). Electronic databases were searched with no limit on year of publication: Medline ( 1946); Embase; Cinahl ( 1979); and Web of Science ( 1985). Search terms included the following: pharmacy; sight/hearing/dual impairment. Studies were included if they involved people with SL requiring pharmaceutical care and/or pharmacists/pharmacy support staff providing pharmaceutical care for people with SL. All study designs were eligible. This was a scoping review , and as such , the quality of studies was not formally evaluated. Eleven studies were included. People with SL had lower levels of medication knowledge than their peers without SL. People with SL were identified as being at higher risk of iatrogenic harm than people without SL. Communication was a barrier to the provision of pharmaceutical care for people with hearing loss , with pharmacists relying on the provision of written information. The prevalence of SL increases with age , yet only two studies included older people. No studies involved family or carers of people with SL , people with dual loss or people with SL receiving polypharmacy. There is a paucity of data regarding the pharmaceutical care needs of people with SL. Unmet pharmaceutical care needs put people with SL at increased risk of harm from their medicines. A detailed understanding of the needs of people with SL is required which will inform future delivery of pharmaceutical care for this vulnerable population.
