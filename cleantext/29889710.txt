  Enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS) has rapidly gained popularity in a variety of surgical subspecialities. A large body of literature suggests that ERAS leads to superior outcomes , improved patient satisfaction , reduced length of hospital stay , and cost benefits , without affecting rates of readmission after surgery. These patterns have been described for patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty ( TKA); however , adoption of ERAS to orthopedic surgery has lagged behind other surgical disciplines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , in partnership with the American College of Surgeons and the Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute ( AI) for Patient Safety and Quality , has developed the Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery. The program comprises a national effort to incorporate best practice in perioperative care and improve patient safety , for over 750 hospitals and multiple procedures over the next 5 years , including orthopedic surgery. We have conducted a full evidence review of anesthetic interventions to derive anesthesiology-related components of an evidence-based ERAS pathway for TKA. A PubMed search was performed for each protocol component , focusing on the highest levels of evidence in the literature. Search findings are summarized in narrative format. Anesthesiology components of care were identified and evaluated across the pre- , intra- , and postoperative phases. A summary of the best available evidence , together with recommendations for inclusion in ERAS protocols for TKA , is provided. There is extensive evidence in the literature , and from society guidelines to support the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery goals for TKA.
