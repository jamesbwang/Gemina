  Introduction Enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS) is associated with reduced length of stay ( LOS) and improved outcomes in colorectal surgery. It is unclear whether ERAS can be safely implemented in elderly patients undergoing complex colorectal resections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ERAS in patients of all ages undergoing colorectal surgery. Methods A prospective database of a consecutive series of patients undergoing colorectal resections with ERAS between August 2012 and December 2014 was evaluated. Patients were divided into four age groups. Outcomes studied were compliance with ERAS elements , LOS , morbidity and mortality. Results Of the 294 patients in the study cohort , 79 were < 60 years , 81 were 60-69 years , 86 were 70-79 years and 48 were â‰¥ 80 years of age. There was no significant difference between age groups in compliance with ERAS elements. Age was not predictive of delayed discharge ( LOS > 6 days) or morbidity. Factors that were predictive of delayed discharge on multivariate analysis were open surgery ( odds ratio ( OR): 2.23 , p = 0.003) , conversion to open surgery ( OR: 3.23 , p = 0.017) , stoma formation ( OR: 2.10 , p = 0.019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( OR: 4.12 , p = 0.038). Factors predictive of morbidity on multivariate analysis comprised conversion to open surgery ( OR: 7.72 , p = 0.004) , high creatinine ( OR: 1.03 per unit increase in creatinine , p = 0.008) and stoma education ( OR: 0.31 , p = 0.030). Conclusions ERAS can be successfully implemented in older patients. There was equal compliance with the ERAS programme across the four age groups and no significant effect of age on LOS or morbidity.
