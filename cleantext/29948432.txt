  This study aimed to evaluate the performance of EQ-5D data mapped from SF-12 in terms of estimating cost effectiveness in cost-utility analysis ( CUA). The comparability of SF-6D ( derived from SF-12) was also assessed. Incremental quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs) were calculated based on two Markov models assessing the cost effectiveness of haemodialysis ( HD) and peritoneal dialysis ( PD) using utility values based on EQ-5D-5L , EQ-5D using three direct-mapping algorithms and two response-mapping algorithms ( mEQ-5D) , and SF-6D. Bootstrap method was used to estimate the 95 % confidence interval ( percentile method) of incremental QALYs and ICERs with 1000 replications for the utilities. In both models , compared to the observed EQ-5D values , mEQ-5D values expressed much lower incremental QALYs ( range- 14.9 to- 33.2 %) and much higher ICERs ( range 17.5 to 49.7 %). SF-6D also estimated lower incremental QALYs (- 29.0 and- 14.9 %) and higher ICERs ( 40.9 and 17.5 %) than did the observed EQ-5D. The 95 % confidence interval of incremental QALYs and ICERs confirmed the lower incremental QALYs and higher ICERs estimated using mEQ-5D and SF-6D. Compared to observed EQ-5D , EQ-5D mapped from SF-12 and SF-6D would under-estimate the QALYs gained in cost-utility analysis and thus lead to higher ICERs. It would be more sensible to conduct CUA studies using directly collected EQ-5D data and to designate one single preference-based measure as reference case in a jurisdiction to achieve consistency in healthcare decision-making.
