  Vascularized adipose tissue models are highly demanded as alternative to existing animal models to elucidate the mechanisms of widespread diseases , screen for new drugs or asses corresponding safety levels. Standardly used animal-derived sera therein , are associated to ethical concerns , the risk of contaminations and many uncertainties in their composition and impact on cells. Therefore their use should be completely omitted. In this study we developed a serum-free , defined co-culture medium and implemented it to set up an adipocyte-endothelial cell ( EC) co-culture model. Human adipose-derived stem cells were differentiated under defined conditions ( diffASCs) and , like human microvascular ECs ( mvECs) , cultured in a developed defined co-culture medium in mono- , indirect or direct co-culture for 14 days. The developed defined co-culture medium was superior to compared mono-culture media and facilitated the functional maintenance and maturation of diffASCs including perilipin A expression , lipid accumulation and glycerol and leptin release. The medium equally allowed mvEC maintenance , confirmed by the expression of CD31 and vWF and acLDL uptake. Thereby mvECs showed a strong dependency on EC-specific factors. Additionally the development of vascular structures by mvECs was facilitated when directly co-cultured with diffASCs. The completely defined co-culture system allows for the serum-free setup of adipocyte/EC co-cultures and thereby represents a valuable and ethically acceptable tool for the setup of vascularized adipose tissue models.
