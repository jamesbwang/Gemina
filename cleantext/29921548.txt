  This manuscript highlights a new ANSM ( French security agency for food & drug) approved method of ECP in order to render ECP easier and more secure for children and adults , with shorter time of procedure and lower final volume of cells ( 100 ml) and lower injected 8-MOP. This modified procedure is appropriately called `` a Low Volume ECP ( LV-ECP) ''.
