  Cyber-Physical Systems are experiencing a paradigm shift in which processing has been relocated to the distributed sensing layer and is no longer performed in a centralized manner. This approach , usually referred to as Edge Computing , demands the use of hardware platforms that are able to manage the steadily increasing requirements in computing performance , while keeping energy efficiency and the adaptability imposed by the interaction with the physical world. In this context , SRAM-based FPGAs and their inherent run-time reconfigurability , when coupled with smart power management strategies , are a suitable solution. However , they usually fail in user accessibility and ease of development. In this paper , an integrated framework to develop FPGA-based high-performance embedded systems for Edge Computing in Cyber-Physical Systems is presented. This framework provides a hardware-based processing architecture , an automated toolchain , and a runtime to transparently generate and manage reconfigurable systems from high-level system descriptions without additional user intervention. Moreover , it provides users with support for dynamically adapting the available computing resources to switch the working point of the architecture in a solution space defined by computing performance , energy consumption and fault tolerance. Results show that it is indeed possible to explore this solution space at run time and prove that the proposed framework is a competitive alternative to software-based edge computing platforms , being able to provide not only faster solutions , but also higher energy efficiency for computing-intensive algorithms with significant levels of data-level parallelism.
