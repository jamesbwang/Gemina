  Primary cutaneous lymphomas comprise a group of lymphatic malignancies that occur primarily in the skin. They represent the second most common form of extranodal non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and are characterized by heterogeneous clinical , histological , immunological , and molecular features. The most common type is mycosis fungoides and its leukemic variant , SÃ©zary syndrome<disease>. Both diseases are considered T-helper cell type 2 ( Th2) diseases. Not only the tumor cells but also the tumor microenvironment can promote Th2 differentiation , which is beneficial for the tumor cells because a Th1 environment enhances antitumor immune responses. This Th2-dominant milieu also underlies the infectious susceptibility of the patients. Many components , such as tumor-associated macrophages , cancer-associated fibroblasts , and dendritic cells , as well as humoral factors , such as chemokines and cytokines , establish the tumor microenvironment and can modify tumor cell migration and proliferation. Multiagent chemotherapy often induces immunosuppression , resulting in an increased risk of serious infection and poor tolerance. Therefore , overtreatment should be avoided for these types of lymphomas. Interferons have been shown to increase the time to next treatment to a greater degree than has chemotherapy. The pathogenesis and prognosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL) differ markedly among the subtypes. In some aggressive subtypes of CTCLs , such as primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous CD8
