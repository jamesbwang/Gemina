  Au-Cu2-xS Janus nanostructures with a shape-controlled semiconductor part are successfully built. The key parameters for controlling the morphology of Cu2-xS in Au-Cu2-xS are demonstrated. Coupled local surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR) properties in these Au-Cu2-xS NCs give them potential for application in polymer solar cells ( PSCs) as an efficient dopant.
