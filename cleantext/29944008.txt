  To compare the overall survival of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients who received alectinib with those who received ceritinib. Two treatment arms ( alectinib ( n = 183) and ceritinib ( n = 67)) were extracted from clinical trials and an electronic health record database , respectively. Propensity scores were applied to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression were conducted. After propensity score adjustment , baseline characteristics were balanced. Alectinib had a prolonged median overall survival ( alectinib = 24.3 months and ceritinib = 15.6 months) and lower risk of death ( hazard ratio: 0.65; 95 % CI: 0.48-0.88). Alectinib was associated with prolonged overall survival versus ceritinib , which is consistent with efficacy evidence from clinical trials.
