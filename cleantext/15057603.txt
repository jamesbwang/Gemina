  The second most common epithelial tumor of the ovary is the mucinous tumors , and it constitutes about 8-10 % of all ovarian tumors. The recurrence of mucinous cystadenoma is very rare after complete excision. Few cases have been reported. The case presented had initial surgery for adenxal mass diagnosed as mucinous tumor , performed by laparotomy and was followed up. After recurrence , the patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation and bilateral ovarian cystectomy was performed as a fertility preservation for the patient young age. The histopathological diagnosis was mucinous cystadenoma , the same as the initial one. Management in young patients is challenging , especially in the case of recurrence. Follow-up of these patients is very important and transvaginal ultrasound seems to be currently the most effective diagnostic tool for the follow-up of young patients treated with cystectomy for benign mucinous cystadenomas. Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended after completing family size or reaching age of 35 for fear of progression or incompliance.
