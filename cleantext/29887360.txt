  Knee arthroplasty does not always require extensive long-term follow-up. If knee range of motion ( ROM) could be assessed reliably by patients , some follow-up visits might be replaced by patient-reported outcome measures , and this additional information could be reported directly to registers. We developed and tested the validity and reliability of a simple scale for patients to self-report their passive knee ROM. Through an iterative process , we created a 2-item scale with 11 illustrations of knee motion in 15 ° increments. The validity and reliability was tested in knee osteoarthritis and arthroplasty patients at different treatment stages , many with poor ROM. Patient estimates were compared to passive goniometer measurements performed blindly by a physiotherapist and a junior orthopedic surgeon. The mean difference between 100 patients ' ( 70.9 years) estimates and goniometer measurements was -0.7 ° ( standard deviation , 12.3 °) for flexion and 1.1 ° ( standard deviation , 11.6 °) for extension , both not significant. Correlation was 0.79 and 0.63 , and kappa values at retest were 0.84 and 0.66. For flexion < 110 ° , sensitivity of patient estimates was 88 % and specificity was 88 %. For a limit of 100 ° , values were 95 % and 81 %. For extension deficits > 10 ° , sensitivity was 78 % and specificity 70 %. Values were 100 % and 66 % for a 15 ° limit. The Copenhagen Knee ROM Scale is a patient-friendly and feasible alternative to passive ROM measurement for registers , research , and selected clinical use. This scale appears reliable and valid compared to reports of similar tools , and patient estimates are better correlated to goniometer measurements.
