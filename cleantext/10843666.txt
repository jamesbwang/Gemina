  Macrophages play a key role in peripheral nerve repair and demonstrate complex phenotypes that are highly dependent on microenvironmental cues. We determined temporal changes in macrophage gene expression over time using RNA sequencing after fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS) macrophage populations from injured peripheral nerve. We identified key upstream regulators and dominant pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis and confirmed these changes with NanoString technology. We then investigate the effects of extreme polarizers of macrophage phenotype ( IL4 and IFNγ) on nerve regeneration. We determined macrophage gene expression in vivo at the site of peripheral nerve injury with NanoString technology , and assessed recovery from sciatic nerve injury by cranial tibial muscle weights and retrograde labeling motor neurons in mice with deletion of IL4 or IFNγ receptors. We demonstrate that IL4R and IFNγR deletions provide complementary responses to polarization , and alter expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and axonal extension , but do not influence recovery from peripheral nerve transection at 8 weeks after repair. Overall , this study provides a framework to evaluate the phenotype of macrophages over time , and provides a broader and more precise assessment of gene expression changes than has previously been commonly used. This data suggests ways in which polarization may be modulated to improve repair.
