  To assess the incidence of violations to the National Resident Matching Program ( NRMP) Code of Conduct during the Urology Match. We sent a survey to all 285 applicants to a single urology program during 2017 Match cycle; the questions pertained to illegal interview questions , post-interview communication , second-look qualifications , and the applicant 's perceived impact of these factors. At total of 166 responses were obtained ( response rate 58 %). Ninety-six ( 58 %) applicants received follow-up communication from at least one program , the majority from multiple programs. Of those who received post-interview communication , 13 % reported verbal communication , and 19 % felt misled by communication to believe they had a higher chance of matching at a program. Fifty ( 30 %) respondents did a second-look visit , and 44 % reported feeling obligated to do so in order to match. Finally , 141/166 ( 85 %) of applicants reported being asked illegal questions regarding personal life , rank list , and/or other interviews. Female applicants reported being asked illegal questions significantly more frequently than male applicants ( P < 0.01). During the 2017 Urology Match , a high proportion of applicants experienced violations of the NRMP Code of Conduct. Violations included illegal questions , post-interview written and verbal communication , and pressure to do second-look visits. These findings corroborate numerous anecdotal reports , and may provide the groundwork to improve the fairness of the residency application process for the future.
