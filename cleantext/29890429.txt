  The objective of this study was to compare conception rates of female beef cattle inseminated at a fixed-time with either conventional ( CON) or SexedUltra ™ sex-sorted ( SU) semen. Treatments included CON or SU with two sires represented within each treatment. Cows ( n = 316) and heifers ( n = 78) from six locations were randomly assigned treatment. Ovulation was synchronized in all females using the industry-standard 7-d CO-Synch + controlled internal drug release ( CIDR) protocol ( 100 μg GnRH + CIDR ( 1.38 g progesterone) on d 0 , 25 mg PGF2α at CIDR removal on d 7 , and 100 μg GnRH on d 10 , 54 h ( heifers) or 60 h ( cows) after CIDR removal). Estrotect ™ estrous detection aids were applied at CIDR removal and patch activation was recorded at insemination. Animals were assumed estrual if greater than 50 % of the patch coating was removed. The results from this study indicated no main effects of treatment ( P = 0.82) , sire ( P = 0.64) , or age ( P = 0.8) on AI conception rates. Additionally , there were not significant interactions between sire and treatment ( P = 0.19) or age and treatment ( P = 0.29). There was however , a significant ( P = 0.0005) effect of estrous expression on conception rates. Conception rate for estrual females ( 62.8 %) was greater ( p = 0.0001) than non-estrual females ( 38.7 %) at FTAI regardless of treatment. Furthermore , the conception rates were similar ( P = 0.61) between conventional ( 61.9 %) and sex-sorted semen ( 63.8 %) when estrus was expressed prior to FTAI. Larger studies are warranted to determine appropriate timing of insemination with sex-sorted semen in FTAI protocols to maximize pregnancy potential.
