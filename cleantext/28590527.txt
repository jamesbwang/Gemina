  Typically , refractory high-entropy alloys ( RHEAs) , comprising a two-phase ordered B2 + BCC microstructure , exhibit extraordinarily high yield strengths , but poor ductility at room temperature , limiting their engineering application. The poor ductility is attributed to the continuous matrix being the ordered B2 phase in these alloys. This paper presents a novel approach to microstructural engineering of RHEAs to form an `` inverted '' BCC + B2 microstructure with discrete B2 precipitates dispersed within a continuous BCC matrix , resulting in improved room temperature compressive ductility , while maintaining high yield strength at both room and elevated temperature.
