  To investigate the effect of the number of removed lymph nodes ( RLNs) on outcomes in patients with node-positive vulvar squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC). This population-based retrospective study included vulvar SCC patients recorded on the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results database , who received surgery and lymphadenectomy. Cox regression proportional hazards were used for multivariate analysis. The number of RLNs was examined as a 4-level categorical variable based on quartiles. In total , 703 patients were identified. Patients with a higher RLN count had a significantly higher number of positive lymph nodes. The 3-year cause-specific survival ( CSS) rates were 48.9 , 65.9 , 73.1 , and 67.3 % in patients with 1-6 , 7-10 , 11-16 , and 17-45 RLNs , respectively ( The removal of more than six lymph nodes improves vulvar SCC outcomes in patients with node-positive disease.
