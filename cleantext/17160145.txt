  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is one of the most affected neurodegenerative diseases in the world. Deregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5) is believed to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases including PD. p25 is a cleavage peptide of p35 , a physiologic activator of Cdk5. p25 combines to Cdk5 and leads to the hyperactivity of Cdk5 , which in turn hyperphosphorylates downstream substrates and leads to neuroinflammation and apoptosis of neurons. Previously , we have demonstrated that adeno-associated virus serotype-9 ( AAV9) mediated Cdk5 inhibitory peptide ( CIP) inhibits the activity of Cdk5/p25 complex and alleviates pathologic and behavioral changes in Alzheimer 's disease mouse model. In this study , we evaluated whether AAV9-CIP protected dopaminergic ( DA) neurons in 1-methyl-4-phe-nyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-probenecid ( MPTP/p) induced PD mouse model. The data showed that administration of AAV9-CIP by intracerebroventricular injection 1 week before MPTP/p exposure protected loss of DA neurons in substantia nigra compact of the model mice. Importantly , AAV9-CIP also alleviated the motor and anxiety-like symptoms of the disease animals. In summary , AAV9 mediated CIP might be a potential intervention for PD.
