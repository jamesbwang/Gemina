  Clustering methods may be useful in epidemiology to better characterize exposures and account for their multidimensional aspects. In this context , application of clustering models allowing for highly dependent variables is of particular interest. We aimed to characterize patterns of domestic exposure to cleaning products using a novel clustering model allowing for highly dependent variables. To identify domestic cleaning patterns in a large population of French women , we used a mixture model of dependency blocks. This novel approach specifically models within-class dependencies , and is an alternative to the latent class model , which assumes conditional independence. Analyses were conducted in 19,398 participants of the E3N study ( women aged 61-88 years) who completed a questionnaire regarding household cleaning habits. Seven classes were identified , which differed with the frequency of cleaning tasks ( e.g. , dusting/sweeping/hoovering) and use of specific products ( e.g. , bleach , sprays). The model also grouped the variables into conditionally independent blocks , providing a summary of the main dependencies among the variables. The mixture model of dependency blocks , a useful alternative to the latent class model , may have broader application in epidemiology , in particular , in the context of exposome research and growing need for data-reduction methods.
