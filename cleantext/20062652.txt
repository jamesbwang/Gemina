  As elongated styloid process is one of the causes of recurrent oropharyngeal<disease> pain and carotid nerve plexus compression called Eagle 's syndrome<disease> and this length is not similar in different communities , the aim of the current study is to determine average length of styloid process by paranasal multidetector computed tomography. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study about 393 patients who underwent paranasal MDCT scan for trauma in Radiology Department without pathologic finding. Styloid length from temporal bone junction to tip of the process was measured using Workstation software. Demographic data including age , sex , and height were gathered from the patients ' records , and patients were questioned about symptoms of Eagle 's syndrome<disease> before trauma. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 with the methods of Two-hundred and sixteen males and 177 females underwent MDCT. The length of right , left , and mean length of both sides were 25.4 ± 7.3 , 25.2 ± 7.8 , 25.3 ± 7.1 , respectively. The mean length of both sides ' process was more among male that was statistically significant ( The mean length of styloid process was 25.3 ± 7.1 that was in accordance with some studies and different from others. Styloid process length is higher in males. The length of styloid process is in association with height and number of symptoms as well.
