  A novel AnammoxDeNOx process was designed to simultaneously remove NOx in flue gas and ammonium wastewater , with the aim of exploring the possibility of using NO as a long-term and stable electron acceptor for anammox bacteria. The performance of the AnammoxDeNOx process indicated a NOx removal efficiency from simulated flue gas ( including CO
