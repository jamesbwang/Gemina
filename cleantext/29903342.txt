  The rhythm of factors involved in luteal regression is crucial in determining the physiological duration of the oestrous cycle. Given the role of tumour necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α in luteal function and circadian regulation and that most of the effects of TNF-α are mediated by p55 TNF receptor ( TNFRp55) , the aims of the present study were to analyse the following during the luteal regression phase in the ovary of mice: ( 1) whether the pattern of expression of progesterone ( P4) and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of P4 is circadian and endogenous ( the rhythm persists in constant conditions , ( i.e. , constant darkness) with a period of about 24 hours); ( 2) circadian oscillations in clock gene expression; ( 3) whether there are daily variations in the expression of key genes involved in apoptosis and antioxidant mechanisms; and ( 4) the consequences of TNFRp55 deficiency. P4 was found to oscillate circadianally following endogenous rhythms of clock factors. Of note , TNFRp55 deficiency modified the circadian oscillation in P4 concentrations and its enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of P4 , probably as a consequence of changes in the circadian oscillations of brain and muscle ARNT-Like protein 1 ( Bmal1) and Cryptochrome 1 ( Cry1). Furthermore , TNFRp55 deficiency modified the circadian rhythms of apoptosis genes , as well as antioxidant enzymes and peroxidation levels in the ovary in dioestrus. The findings of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that dysregulation of TNF-α signalling may be a potential cause for altered circadian and menstrual cycling in some gynaecological diseases.
