  The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between body mass index ( BMI) and the depth of tissue overlying the epidural space. Secondary objectives examined the association between BMI and ( 1) radiation dose exposure and ( 2) fluoroscopic screening time during transforaminal nerve block ( TFNB) injections. This is a retrospective cohort study including patients aged â‰¥ 16 years who underwent unilateral single-level TFNB in a single centre over a 28-month period , by a single spinal orthopaedic surgeon. Demographic data , BMI ( kg/m depth of epidural space. ( 1) radiation dose exposure , ( 2) fluoroscopic screening time. Descriptive statistics for study participants ' demographics are presented. Spearman 's rank ( r) coefficient and linear regression analysis was performed examining the association between BMI and the outcome measures. A total of 362 patients met inclusion criteria; n = 45 patients were excluded due to incomplete data , final analysis included 317 patients. Mean age was 62.6 years ( IQR 53-74). Male: female ratio was 37.9 % ( n = 120): 62.1 % ( n = 197). Mean BMI was 26.9 kg/m This study has demonstrated a significant association between increasing BMI and increased depth of the epidural space. Furthermore , significant associations between increasing BMI , radiation dose exposure and fluoroscopy screening time have been identified. BMI may represent a modifiable risk factor with a view to decreasing patient exposure to medical ionised radiation.
