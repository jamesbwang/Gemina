  Estimation of the risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia ( IPMN) of the pancreas is a clinical challenge. Several routinely used clinical factors form the basis of the current consensus guidelines. This study aimed to determine the predictive values of the most commonly assessed risk factors. A meta-analysis of individual risk factors of malignancy in IPMN was performed. Contingency tables were derived from these data , and sensitivity , specificity , negative and positive predictive values , and diagnostic odds ratios ( DOR) were determined. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic ( HSROC) curves for each factor were calculated and the respective area under the curve ( AUC) was assessed. A total of 3443 studies were screened initially. Analysis of recent literature revealed 60 studies with 13 relevant risk factors including clinical , serological and radiological parameters. The largest area under the HSROC curve was found for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 0 路 84) and jaundice/raised bilirubin level ( 0 路 80) , followed by increased carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA) ( 0 路 79) or carbohydrate antigen ( CA) 19-9 ( 0 路 78) levels. The most sensitive factors were patient age ( 71 per cent) and mural nodules<symptom> ( 65 per cent) , and jaundice/raised bilirubin level ( 97 per cent) and increased CEA level ( 95 per cent) were most specific. None of the analysed factors reached a positive or negative level of prediction beyond 90 per cent. None of the established criteria safely distinguishes malignant from non-malignant
