  For patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , there is an inverse relation between body mass index ( BMI) and mortality , sometimes called the obesity-paradox. However , the relationship might be either U- or J-shaped and might differ between patients with reduced ( HFrEF) or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ( HFpEF). We sought to investigate this further in a dose-response meta-analysis of published studies. PubMed and Embase from June 1980 to April 2017 were searched for prospective cohort studies evaluating associations between BMI and all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF ( LVEF < 40 %) or HFpEF ( LVEF â‰¥ 50 %). Summary estimated effect sizes were obtained by using a random-effects model. Potential non-linear relationships were evaluated by using random-effects restricted cubic spline models. Ten studies were identified that included 96,424 patients of whom 59,263 had HFpEF ( mean age 68 years of whom 38 % were women) and 37,161 had HFrEF ( mean age 60 years of whom 17 % were women). For patients with HFpEF , the summary hazard ratio ( HR) for all-cause mortality was: 0.93 ( 95 % CI 0.89-0.97) per 5 units increase in BMI ( I For patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , the relation between BMI and mortality is U-shaped with a similar nadir of risk for HFpEF and HFrEF at a BMI of 32-33 kg/m
