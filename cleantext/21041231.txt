  In this study , we bring a life course approach to work-family research and ask how work-home spillover changes as men and women move through different parenting stages. We use two waves of the Mid-Life in the United States Study ( MIDUS I and II , 1996-2004 , N = 1,319) and estimate change-score models to document the association between five parenting transitions ( becoming a parent , starting to parent a school-aged child , an adolescent , young adult , or adult child) and changes in both positive and negative work-to-home ( WHS) and home-to-work ( HWS) spillover , testing for gender differences in these associations. We find that moving through parenting stages is related to within-person changes in reports of work-home spillover , and that mothers and fathers encounter changes in spillover at different points in the life course. Our findings detail how transitions through parenthood produce a gendered life course , and speaks to the need for policies to support working parents throughout the life course.
