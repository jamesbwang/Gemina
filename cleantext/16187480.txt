  BACKGROUND Chemoradiotherapy ( CRT) is widely accepted and is considered a standard treatment , particularly for unresectable and inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC). However , the optimal use of the combined modalities of chemotherapy ( CT) and radiotherapy ( RT) remains controversial. In addition , no consensus has been reached regarding the exact efficacy of consolidation chemotherapy ( CCT) and the most appropriate radiotherapy dose. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical data from 262 ESCC patients treated with CRT ( n = 165) or RT alone ( n = 97) were collected and reviewed. The long-term outcomes were analyzed , and treatment related acute toxicity reactions were compared. RESULTS The 1-year , 3-year , and 5-year overall survival ( OS) rates were 75.3 % , 35.6 % , and 25.3 % , respectively , for the CRT group and 61.5 % , 26.7 % , and 17.6 % for the RT-alone group ( P = 0.015). The concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT) and sequential chemoradiotherapy ( SCRT) groups exhibited similar survival outcomes ( for OS , P = 0.568; for progression-free survival ( PFS ,) P = 0.145). CCT after CCRT did not influence OS ( P = 0.236) but was associated with a more favorable PFS ( P = 0.020). In addition , high-dose of 60-65 Gy tended to prolong OS compared with low-dose ( < 60 Gy) or excessive-dose ( > 65 Gy). The incidence of adverse reactions , such as esophagitis and leukopenia<symptom> , in the CRT group were significantly higher than in the RT-alone group ( P = 0.019 , P = 0.001 , respectively) , and no significant difference was observed between patients treated with CCRT and CCT after CCRT. CONCLUSIONS Treating non-surgical ESCC patients with CCRT conferred a significant survival benefit compared with RT alone. CCT after CCRT prolongs PFS but does not increase acute toxicity. High-dose ( 60-65 Gy) CCRT could generate more favorable survival outcomes.
