  Factors associated with plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were studied in adult subjects without diabetes from Cotonou in Benin ( West-Africa). Seventy ( 70) men and 45 women were included in the study. Anthropometric variables were measured and a venous blood sample was drawn from each subject , after an overnight fasting period , for measurement of plasma glucose , insulin , leptin , and adiponectin levels. HOMA-IR was determined to assess insulin resistance. Adiponectin and leptin levels were higher in women than in men ( with adiponectin 18.48 ± 12.77 vs. 7.8 ± 10.39 μg/mL , P < 0.0001 , and leptin 30.77 ± 19.16 vs. 8.66 ± 8.24 ng/mL , P < 0.0001). Fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR were also higher in the females. Hyperleptinemia was observed in 66,96 % of subjects and hypoadiponectinemia was present in 44.35 % of subjects. In both men and women , leptin correlated with age ( r = 0.2; P = 0.02) , BMI ( r = 0.572; P < 0.0001) , waist circumference ( r = 0.534; P < 0.0001) , fasting insulin ( r = 0.461; P < 0.001) , and HOMA-IR ( r = 0.430; P < 0.0001). No significant correlation was observed for adiponectin levels with these variables. Only in women , adiponectin was inversely correlated with fasting glucose ( r = -0.423; P < 0.004). These data confirm previous descriptions of leptin but suggest that variations in factors determining serum adiponectin levels observed between ethnicities could also been seen between populations from the same ethnicity.
