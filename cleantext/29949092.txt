  We wanted to assess the awareness of the nursing staff to therapeutic communications on improving the welcoming experience of patients in the operating room for outpatient surgery. This was a single centre prospective impact study performed in an outpatient surgery clinic. In a first phase , a questionnaire was administered by the anesthetist nurse upon arrival of the patient to assess the patient 's comfort ( NRSc) and satisfaction on a simple numeric scale , and calculate a negative communication score ( ` NC '). In the second phase , the awareness of the nursing staff on therapeutic communication was emphasized on listening , empathy and the use of positive wording , using educational videos. In the third phase , after the staff awareness-raising period , the questionnaire was repeated. Quantitative variables ( primary outcome criterion made of the number of patients with a NC score ≥ 5 , NRSc , satisfaction) , and qualitative variables before and after the awareness raising phase to therapeutic communications were compared. A total of 234 patients were included ( 109 before and 125 after). Following the staff awareness session to therapeutic communication , the NC score ≥ 5 decreased significantly from 20 % to 6 % as well as the median NRSc ( P This preliminary study shows a mild improvement of the patients ' comfort and satisfaction after therapeutic communication. A controlled randomized trial is needed to confirm those results.
