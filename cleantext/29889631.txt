  OBJECTIVE To substantiate current AVMA guidelines for immersion euthanasia of goldfish ( Carassius auratus) with tricaine methanesulfonate ( TMS) , determine whether immersion in propofol at 5 times its immersion anesthesia concentration for 30 minutes is sufficient for euthanasia of goldfish , and quantify the duration of myocardial contraction following immersion of goldfish in TMS and decapitation. DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS 36 healthy , adult goldfish. PROCEDURES Goldfish were randomly assigned to be immersed in 1 of 6 test solution treatments ( n = 6/treatment): TMS ( 500 mg/L) for 15 minutes followed by placement in anesthetic agent-free water ( T15W) , placement out of water ( T15A) , or decapitation ( T15D); TMS ( 1,000 mg/L) for 15 minutes followed by placement in anesthetic agent-free water ( T15XW); TMS ( 500 mg/L) for 30 minutes followed by placement in anesthetic agent-free water ( T30W); or propofol ( 25 mg/L) for 30 minutes followed by placement in anesthetic agent-free water ( P30W). Any fish that resumed operculation in group T15A was returned to anesthetic agent-free water. Times from onset of immersion to induction of anesthesia , cessation and resumption of operculation , and recovery ( T15W , T15A , T15XW , T30W , P30W) or cessation of Doppler ultrasounds ( T15D) were recorded. RESULTS Overall , 5 of 6 , 6 of 6 , 6 of 6 , 6 of 6 , and 5 of 6 fish survived in the T15W , T15A , T15XW , T30W , and P30W groups , respectively. Median time to cessation of Doppler ultrasounds in group T15D was 77.5 minutes ( range , 30 to 240 minutes). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Timed immersion in test solutions ( TMS at 500 mg/L or 1,000 mg/L or propofol at 25 mg/L) resulted in death in only 7 % ( 2/30) of immersed goldfish. Myocardial contractions continued for up to 4 hours in decapitated goldfish.
