  As job stress is associated with various diseases and psychiatric conditions , we aimed to estimate the job stress-attributable burden of disease in Korea based on the concept of disability-adjusted life years ( DALY). We selected ischemic heart disease ( IHD) , stroke , major depressive disorder ( MDD) , and suicide as health outcomes from job stress , because of the ease of access to data estimating burdens and of important meaning of them in Korean occupational background. Our findings demonstrated that approximately 21 % of Korean workers were exposed to high job strain , which was attributable for approximately 6.7 % of IHDs , 6.9 % of strokes , 13.6 % of MDDs , and 4 % of suicides. In terms of job stress-attributable DALY , the burdens of disease per 100,000 people were 38 for IHD , 72 for stroke , 168 for MDDs , and 44 for suicides. The present findings suggested that one-fifth of Korean workers were suffering from high job strain. Although the figures may not be accurate due to several assumptions , job stress is an important risk factor for health in working environment in Korea.
