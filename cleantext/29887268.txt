  The aim of this study was to describe the drug dispensing of maintenance immunosuppression treatment in 2014 for patients who received a kidney transplant in 2012 , based on the data of the French national health insurance and to compare those results with the information collected in the national database for kidney recipients. For each patient , are considered all drugs dispensing with their dates of issue , the molecules and their presentations ( number of pills and dosage). Among 2463 transplanted adults in 2012 , 73 % have received tacrolimus monohydrate , 59 % mycophenolate mofetil , 54 % prednisone and 20 % cyclosporin in 2014. The daily doses but not the number of tablets per day declined with age. The most frequent association was tacrolimus monohydrate-mycophenolate mofetil-steroids in 34 % of the cases. The use of mTOR inhibitors , rare generally ( 7 %) , is more common in patients aged 66-85 years. Associations did not differ significantly according to diabetic status , for patients with a kidney from an elderly donor or according to the number of mismatch. The daily doses estimated from the deliverance in pharmacy are respectively similar , understated and over-estimate for tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin compared to the national database. This study confirms the difficulty of apprehending drug consumption based only on dispensing in pharmacies or punctual recording even if it allows a fairly comprehensive view of French practices.
