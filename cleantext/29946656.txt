  Preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD); however , it is unclear to what extent this association can be explained by shared genetic and environmental risk factors and whether gestational age at birth is similarly related to inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and to the same extent in boys and girls. To investigate the association between gestational age at birth and symptoms of ADHD in preschool and school-age children after adjusting for unmeasured genetic and environmental risk factors. In this prospective , population-based cohort study , pregnant women were recruited from across Norway from January 1 , 1999 , through December 31 , 2008. Results of a conventional cohort design were compared with results from a sibling-comparison design ( adjusting for genetic and environmental factors shared within families) using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data analysis was performed from October 1 , 2017 , through March 16 , 2018. Analyses compared children and siblings discordant for gestational age group: early preterm ( delivery at gestational weeks 22-33) , late preterm ( delivery at gestational weeks 34-36) , early term ( delivery at gestational weeks 37-38) , delivery at gestational week 39 , reference group ( delivery at gestational week 40) , delivery at gestational week 41 , and late term ( delivery after gestational week 41). Maternally reported symptoms of ADHD in children at 5 years of age and symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity at 8 years of age. Covariates included child and pregnancy characteristics associated with the week of delivery and the outcomes. A total of 113227 children ( 55187 ( 48.7 %) female; 31708 ( 28.0 %) born at gestational week 40) , including 33081 siblings ( 16014 female ( 48.4 %); 9705 ( 29.3 %) born at gestational week 40) , were included in the study. Children born early preterm were rated with more symptoms of ADHD , inattention , and hyperactivity/impulsivity than term-born children. After adjusting for unmeasured genetic and environmental factors , children born early preterm had a mean score that was 0.24 SD ( 95 % CI , 0.14-0.34) higher on ADHD symptom tests , 0.33 SD ( 95 % CI , 0.24-0.42) higher on inattention tests , and 0.23 SD ( 95 % CI , 0.14-0.32) higher on hyperactivity/impulsivity tests compared with children born at gestational week 40. Sex moderated the association of gestational age with preschool ADHD symptoms , and the association appeared to be strongest among girls. Early preterm girls scored a mean of 0.8 SD ( 95 % CI , 0.12-1.46; P = .02) higher compared with their term-born sisters. After accounting for unmeasured genetic and environmental factors , early preterm birth was associated with a higher level of ADHD symptoms in preschool children. Early premature birth was associated with inattentive but not hyperactive symptoms in 8-year-old children. This study demonstrates the importance of differentiating between inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and stratifying on sex in the study of childhood ADHD.
