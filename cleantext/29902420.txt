  Intracellular delivery of nucleic acids is one of the critical steps in the transfections. Prior findings demonstrated various strategies including membrane fusion , endosomal escape for the efficient cytoplasmic delivery. In our continuing efforts to improve the nucleic acids transfections , we harnessed cell permeable properties of Tomatidine ( T) , a steroidal alkaloid abundantly found in green tomatoes for maximizing intracellular delivery of lipoplexes. We doped Tomatidine into liposomes of cationic lipid with amide linker ( A) from our lipid library. Six liposomal formulations ( AT) of Lipid A ( 1 mM) with varying concentrations of Tomatidine ( 0-1 mM) were prepared and evaluated for their transfection efficacies. Owing to its signature characteristic of cell membrane permeability , Tomatidine modulated endocytosis process , enhanced the intracellular delivery of the lipoplexes , and in turn increased the transfection efficacy of cationic liposomes. Our findings provide ` proof of concept ' for enhancing transfections in gene delivery applications with Tomatidine in cationic liposomal formulations. These findings can be further applied in lipid mediated gene therapy and drug delivery applications.
