  Bee viral ecology is a fascinating emerging area of research: viruses exert a range of effects on their hosts , exacerbate impacts of other environmental stressors , and , importantly , are readily shared across multiple bee species in a community. However , our understanding of bee viral communities is limited , as it is primarily derived from studies of North American and European Apis mellifera populations. Here , we examined viruses in populations of A. mellifera and 11 other bee species from 9 countries , across 4 continents and Oceania. We developed a novel pipeline to rapidly and inexpensively screen for bee viruses. This pipeline includes purification of encapsulated RNA/DNA viruses , sequence-independent amplification , high throughput sequencing , integrated assembly of contigs , and filtering to identify contigs specifically corresponding to viral sequences. We identified sequences for ( +) ssRNA , (-) ssRNA , dsRNA , and ssDNA<pathogen> viruses. Overall , we found 127 contigs corresponding to novel viruses ( i.e. previously not observed in bees) , with 27 represented by > 0.1 % of the reads in a given sample , and 7 contained an RdRp or replicase sequence which could be used for robust phylogenetic analysis. This study provides a sequence-independent pipeline for viral metagenomics analysis , and greatly expands our understanding of the diversity of viruses found in bee communities.
