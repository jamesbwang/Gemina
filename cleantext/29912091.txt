  Gastrointestinal duplication cysts<symptom> are rare congenital malformations , with esophageal and gastric duplication cysts<symptom> being among the rarest. We report an 8-week-old female who presented to the emergency department with failure to thrive and was subsequently found to have multiple gastric and esophageal duplication cysts<symptom> that had ruptured intrathoracically and intra-abdominally. We describe the diagnosis and management of this patient who underwent successful resection of 4 gastrointestinal duplication cysts<symptom>. This report emphasizes the unexpected , and sometimes relatively benign , presentations of gastrointestinal duplication cysts<symptom>. To our knowledge , this is the first reported occurrence of multiple duplication cysts<symptom> that independently ruptured thoracically and abdominally.
