  Successful eradication schemes for bovine tuberculosis<disease> ( bTB) have been implemented in a number of European and other countries over the last 50 years. However , the islands of Britain and Ireland remain a significant aberration to this trend , with the recent exception of Scotland. Why have eradication schemes failed within these countries , while apparently similar programs have been successful elsewhere? While significant socio-economic and political factors have been discussed elsewhere as key determinants of disease eradication , here we review some of the potential ecological and epidemiological constraints that are present in these islands relative to other parts of Europe. We argue that the convergence of these potential factors may interact additively to diminish the potential of the present control programs to achieve eradication. Issues identified include heterogeneity of diagnostic testing approaches , the presence of an abundant wildlife reservoir of infection and the challenge of sustainably managing this risk effectively; the nature , size , density and network structure of cattle farming; potential effects of
