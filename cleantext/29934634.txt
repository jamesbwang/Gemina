  The purpose of this study is to explore the differences in ocular symptoms and signs between Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<symptom> ( SS) and non-SS aqueous-deficient dry<symptom> eye ( ADDE) patients. Twenty-two eyes of 22 SS patients ( Group 1) and 22 eyes of 22 non-SS ADDE patients ( Group 2) were enrolled. The evaluated variables included the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness ( SPEED) , the Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI) , tear meniscus height , first and average non-invasive keratographic breakup time ( fNIKBUT and avNIKBUT) , Schirmer I test , lipid layer thickness ( LLT) , meibomian gland expressibility , Marx line , corneal staining , conjunctival congestion<symptom> , incomplete blinking , and meibomian gland dropout using two novel , non-invasive instruments , the Keratograph and LipiView II. Ocular signs of the NIKBUT ( fNIKBUT: 3.8 ( 2.7 , 5.2) s and 6.3 ( 3.7 , 8.9) s , P = 0.024; avNIKBUT: 5.4 ( 4.5 , 8.9) s and 7.6 ( 5.8 , 13.7) s , P = 0.041) , meibomian gland dropout of the upper eyelid ( 35.5 % ( 29.1 % , 54.8 %) and 21.9 % ( 16.7 % , 24.9 %) , P = 0.000) , and corneal staining ( P = 0.050) were more severe but were associated with less severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , i.e. , a lower SPEED score ( P = 0.001) , in SS subjects than in non-SS subjects. SS patients exhibit more severe meibomian gland destruction of the upper eyelid than non-SS patients. Meibomian gland dysfunction is another key cause of SS-associated dry<symptom> eye.
