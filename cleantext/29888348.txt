  Luminescent silver clusters ( AgCLs) stabilized inside partially Ag exchanged Na LTA zeolites show a remarkable reversible on-off switching of their green-yellowish luminescence that is easily tuned by a hydration and dehydration<symptom> cycle , making them very promising materials for sensing applications. We have used a unique combination of photoluminescence ( PL) , UV-visible-NIR Diffuse Reflectance ( DRS) , X-ray absorption fine structure ( XAFS) , Fourier Transform-Infrared ( FTIR) and electron spin resonance ( ESR) spectroscopies to unravel the atomic-scale structural changes responsible for the reversible optical behavior of the confined AgCLs in LTA zeolites. Water coordinated , diamagnetic , tetrahedral AgCLs ( Ag4 ( H2O) 4) 2 + with Ag atoms positioned along the axis of the sodalite six-membered rings are at the origin of the broad and intense green-yellowish luminescence in the hydrated sample. Upon dehydration<symptom> , luminescent ( Ag4 ( H2O) 4) 2 + clusters are transformed into non-luminescent ( dark) , diamagnetic , octahedral AgCLs ( Ag6 ( OF) 14) 2 + with Ag atoms interacting strongly with zeolite framework oxygen ( OF) of the sodalite four-membered rings. This highly responsive on-off switching reveals that besides quantum confinement and molecular-size , coordinated water and framework oxygen ligands strongly affect the organization of AgCLs valence electrons and play a crucial role in the opto-structural properties of AgCLs.
