  In recent years , small animal image-guided irradiators have been widely utilized in preclinical studies involving rodent models. However , the dosimetry commissioning of such equipment involving kilovoltage small-field dosimetry has not received as much interest as the megavoltage small-field dosimetry used clinically. To date , a paucity of measured kilovoltage beam data , especially for field sizes less than 3 mm , can be found in the literature. For improvement of rodent treatments in the future , this work aims to provide comprehensive and accurate beam data for the small animal radiation research platform ( SARRP , Xstrahl) using EBT3 Gafchromic films and Monte Carlo calculation , with submillimeter resolution and accuracy. This work includes three primary tasks: ( 1) establish an optimized film measurement protocol for small field dosimetry of kilovoltage photon beam. ( 2) Acquire dosimetric data including ( a) depth dose curves from the surface to 6 cm depth ( b) beam profiles , ( c) penumbra , ( d) cone factors and ( e) 2D dose distribution. These tasks were undertaken for a 220 kVp photon beam with five different small field widths and 33 cm source to surface distance ( 0.5 mm and 1 mm circular fields , 3 Ã— 3 mm
