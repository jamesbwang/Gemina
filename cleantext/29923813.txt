  Autonomic dysreflexia is a potentially lethal condition experienced by spinal cord injury ( SCI) patients. It has a wide range of causes , most of which are genitourinary in nature. However , there has been no documented case of primary bladder cancer as a trigger for recurrent autonomic dysreflexia. We present a case of a 51-year-old spinal cord injury patient with multiple presentations of autonomic dysreflexia. Work up revealed locally invasive bladder cancer , and following definitive surgery , his symptoms were alleviated. In SCI patients with recurrent AD , comprehensive work up with involvement of a specialized Urologist is required as AD may be the only presenting symptom of a serious underlying medical condition.
