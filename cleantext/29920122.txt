  Mexico 's indigenous communities continue to experience higher levels of mortality and poorer access to health care services than non-indigenous regions , a pattern that is repeated across the globe. We conducted a two-year ethnographic study of pregnancies and childbirth in an indigenous Wix√°rika community to explore the structural causes of this excess mortality. In the process we also identified major differences between official infant mortality rates , and the numbers of infants born to women in our sample who did not survive. We interviewed 67 women during pregnancy and followed-up after the birth of their child. At baseline , socio-demographic data was collected as well as information regarding birthing intentions. In depth-interviews and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 62 of these women after the birth of their child , using a checklist of questions. Women were asked about choices regarding , and experiences of childbirth. Of the 62 women we interviewed at follow-up 33 gave birth at home without skilled attendance and five gave birth completely alone in their homes. Five neonates died during labour or the perinatal period. Concerns about human resources , the structure of service delivery and unwanted interventions during childbirth all appear to contribute to the low institutional childbirth rate. Our data also suggests a low rate of death registration , with the custom of burying infants where they die. This excess mortality , occurring in the context of unnecessary lone and unassisted childbirth are structurally generated forms of violence.
