  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD) is characterized by the growth of renal cysts<symptom> that ultimately destroy kidney function. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes cause ADPKD. Their protein products , polycystin-1 ( PC1) and polycystin-2 ( PC2) have been proposed to form a calcium-permeable receptor-channel complex; however the mechanisms by which they function are almost completely unknown. Most mutations in PKD1 are truncating loss-of-function mutations or affect protein biogenesis , trafficking or stability and reveal very little about the intrinsic biochemical properties or cellular functions of PC1. An ADPKD patient mutation ( L4132Δ or ΔL) , resulting in a single amino acid deletion in a putative G-protein binding region of the PC1 C-terminal cytosolic tail , was found to significantly decrease PC1-stimulated , G-protein-dependent signaling in transient transfection assays. Pkd1ΔL/ΔL mice were embryo-lethal suggesting that ΔL is a functionally null mutation. Kidney-specific Pkd1ΔL/cond mice were born but developed severe , postnatal cystic disease. PC1ΔL protein expression levels and maturation were comparable to those of wild type PC1 , and PC1ΔL protein showed cell surface localization. Expression of PC1ΔL and PC2 complexes in transfected CHO cells failed to support PC2 channel activity , suggesting that the role of PC1 is to activate G-protein signaling to regulate the PC1/PC2 calcium channel.
