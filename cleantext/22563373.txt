  Farrerol has been proved to have an anti-inflammatory effect. However , the effects of farrerol on mastitis<symptom> have not been investigated. This study was aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of farrerol in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced mouse mastitis<symptom> and LPS-induced inflammatory response of mouse mammary epithelial cells ( mMECs). In vivo , LPS were injected to the tetrad pair of nipples for establishing mouse mastitis<symptom> , and then tested the effect of farrerol on histopathological changes , inflammatory response and activation degree of protein kinase B ( AKT) , nuclear factor-kappa B p65 ( NF- & kappa; B p65) , p38 , extracellular regulated protein kinase ( ERK1/2). In vitro , the mMECs were incubated by farrerol for 1 h following by stimulating with LPS , and then the inflammatory response and the related signaling pathways were detected. The in vivo results found that farrerol could improve pathological injury of mammary gland , attenuate the activity of myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the phosphorylation of AKT , NF- & kappa; B p65 , p38 and ERK1/2. The in vitro results also found farrerol inhibited inflammatory response and the related signaling pathways. Collectively , this study revealed that farrerol inhibits the further development of LPS-induced mastitis<symptom> by inhibiting inflammatory response via down regulating phosphorylation of AKT , NF- & kappa; B p65 , p38 , and ERK1/2. These findings suggest that farrerol may be used as an anti-inflammatory drug for
