  Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is among the most notorious types of breast cancer , the treatment of which does not give consistent results due to the absence of the three receptors ( estrogen receptor ( ER) , progesterone receptor ( PR) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) as well as high amount of molecular variability. Drug resistance also contributes to treatment unresponsiveness. We studied differentially expressed genes , their biological roles , as well as pathways from RNA-Seq datasets of two different TNBC drug-resistant cell lines of Basal B subtype SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 treated with drugs JQ1 and Dexamethasone , respectively , to elucidate the mechanism of drug resistance. RNA sequencing ( RNA-Seq) data analysis was done using edgeR which is an efficient program for determining the most significant Differentially Expressed Genes ( DEGs) , Gene Ontology ( GO) terms , and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathways. iPathway analysis was further used to obtain validated results using analysis that takes into consideration type , function , and interactions of genes in the pathway. The significant similarities and differences throw light into the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC , giving clues into the aspects that can be focused to overcome drug resistance. From this study , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway appeared to be a key factor in TNBC drug resistance.
