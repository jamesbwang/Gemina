  Microcystins ( MCs) , produced by cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic water , are common toxic metabolites and a potential threat to human health. However , the mechanism of MC photodegradation by photosensitizers in raw water remains unclear. In photodegradation and quenching experiments , this study investigates the photosensitized degradation of microcystin-LR ( MC-LR) by fulvic acid ( FA , a kind of dissolved organic matter with natural photosensitizing properties) under ultraviolet ( UV) light irradiation. The photodegradation mechanisms of FA are also explored. The photodegradation process of MC-LR by FA was consistent with second-order reaction kinetics. The degradation rate of MC-LR in FA decreased from 80 % to 55 % as the pH increased from 3 to 9 , because the binding ability of FA to MC-LR reduces as the pH increases. Given that FA can both inhibit and promote MC-LR degradation depending on its concentration , the optimum initial FA concentration for degrading MC-LR was determined as 9.86 mgC Â· L
