  Causative mutations can not be identified in the majority of Asian patients with suspected maturity-onset diabetes of the young ( MODY). To elucidate the genetic basis of Japanese patients with MODY-like diabetes and gain insight into the etiology of patients without mutations in the major MODY genes. A total of 263 Japanese patients with early-onset , non-obese , MODY-like diabetes mellitus referred to Osaka City General Hospital for diagnosis. Mutational analysis of the four major MODY genes ( GCK , HNF1A , HNF4A , HNF1B) by Sanger sequencing. Mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were further analyzed for clinical features. Mutations were identified in 103 ( 39.2 %) patients; 57 mutations in GCK; 29 , HNF1A; 7 , HNF4A; and 10 , HNF1B. Contrary to conventional diagnostic criteria , 18.4 % of mutation-positive patients did not have affected parents and 8.2 % were in the overweight range ( body mass index ( BMI) > 85th percentile). HOMA-IR at diagnosis was elevated ( > 2) in 15 of 66 ( 22.7 %) mutation-positive patients. Compared with mutation-positive patients , mutation-negative patients were significantly older ( P = 0.003) , and had higher BMI percentile at diagnosis ( P = 0.0006). Interestingly , maternal inheritance of diabetes was significantly more common in mutation-negative patients ( P = 0.0332) and these patients had significantly higher BMI percentile as compared with mutation-negative patients with paternal inheritance ( P = 0.0106). Contrary to the conventional diagnostic criteria , de novo diabetes , overweight , and insulin-resistance are common in Japanese patients with mutation-positive MODY. A significant fraction of mutation-negative patients had features of early-onset type 2 diabetes common in Japanese , and non-Mendelian inheritance needs to be considered for these patients.
