  We report an air-stable nickel ( ii)- thiolato PNN pincer complex ( ( PNN) NiII ( SC6H4Me)) + ( MeC6H4SO3)- ( PNN = 2- ( ( di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl-6-diethylaminomethyl) pyridine)) which is capable of reducing protons at an overpotential of 0.54 V at low acid concentrations. The proton reduction can be catalysed using weak or strong acids such as acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid respectively. In contrast , the chloro and nitrate derivatives of the nickel pincer complex behave as poorer catalysts. A mechanism accounting for the role of the ligand in proton reduction is also briefly outlined.
