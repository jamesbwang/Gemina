  Most eukaryotic genes express alternative polyadenylation ( APA) isoforms with different 3 ` UTR lengths , production of which is influenced by cellular conditions. Here , we show that arsenic stress elicits global shortening of 3 ` UTRs through preferential usage of proximal polyadenylation sites during stress and enhanced degradation of long 3 ` UTR isoforms during recovery. We demonstrate that RNA-binding protein TIA1 preferentially interacts with alternative 3 ` UTR sequences through U-rich motifs , correlating with stress granule association and mRNA decay of long 3 ` UTR isoforms. By contrast , genes with shortened 3 ` UTRs due to stress-induced APA can evade mRNA clearance and maintain transcript abundance post stress. Furthermore , we show that stress causes distinct 3 ` UTR size changes in proliferating and differentiated cells , highlighting its context-specific impacts on the 3 ` UTR landscape. Together , our data reveal a global , 3 ` UTR-based mRNA stability control in stressed cells and indicate that APA can function as an adaptive mechanism to preserve mRNAs in response to stress.
