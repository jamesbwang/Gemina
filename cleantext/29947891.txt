  Survivin is a well-established target in experimental cancer therapy. While hardly expressed in normal tissues , it is over-expressed in most human tumors , including colorectal cancer ( CRC). Different compartmentalization of Survivin enables its multiple functions as a key controller of cell division , apoptosis , stress-induced signaling and also of migration and metastasis. Because of the lack of its enzymatic activity , this oncoprotein is considered to be undruggable. Nevertheless , small-molecule interfacial inhibitors interfering with its dimerization and/or disrupting the Survivin-Ran protein complex were shown to be potent drugs causing Survivin proteasomal degradation and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Based on our results with different CRC cell lines , we show that the Survivin inhibitor LLP3 might be effective as mono-therapy in the subgroup of p53-proficient and also some p53-mutated tumors , independent of mismatch repair status. When combined with irinotecan , expression of the tumor suppressor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis factor 1 ( XAF1) plays a decisive role for sensitization of CRC cells to this first-line drug , however , only in the p53-mutated background. The combination treatment with IT should be avoided in p53-proficient tumors independent of XAF1 expression , since no sensitization to or even protection against moderate-toxic concentrations of IT might occur.
