  Growing demands for potable water have led to extensive reliance on waterways in tropical megacities. Attempts to manage these waterways in an environmentally sustainable way generally lack an understanding of microbial processes and how they are influenced by urban factors , such as land use and rain. Here , we describe the composition and functional potential of benthic microbial communities from an urban waterway network and analyze the effects of land use and rain perturbations on these communities. With a sequence depth of 3 billion reads from 48 samples , these metagenomes represent nearly full coverage of microbial communities. The predominant taxa in these waterways were
