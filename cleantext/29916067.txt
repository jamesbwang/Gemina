  Vacuolar trafficking plays a vital role in plant growth and development. In this chapter , we describe a powerful technique for the evaluation of vacuolar protein trafficking , which is designated as GREEN<symptom> FLUORESCENT SEED. Based on vacuole-targeted green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis seeds , this method enables the nondestructive isolation of mutant seeds defective in vacuolar trafficking and their visual characterization.
