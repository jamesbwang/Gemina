  Investigate the use of a postoperative continuous adductor canal block ( cACB) after epidural analgesia to decreases opioid consumption and improve visual analog scale ( VAS) scores compared to a sham catheter. Double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. Inpatient setting in tertiary care teaching hospital with outpatient follow-up. One-hundred and sixty-five subjects ( cACB n = 82 and sham catheter n = 83) with end-stage degenerative joint disease undergoing elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Patients were block randomized to receive a cACB or sham catheter. An epidural catheter was placed preoperatively and discontinued on postoperative day 1. Patients then received a cACB with bupivacaine or sham catheter which remained for the duration of the hospitalization. Primary outcome was total opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes included VAS scores , knee range of motion ( ROM) , ambulation distance , and WOMAC scores. Seventy patients completed the study ( cACB n = 38 and sham catheter n = 32). Compared to sham catheter , in the first 20 h after placement of a cACB , patients used 22.5 mg less opioid ( 95 % CI: -43.1 to -1.94 mg , P = 0.03). VAS score area under the curve decreased 7.8 mm ( 95 % CI: -15.5- -0.058 mm , P = 0.04) with a cACB. At 3-week follow-up , WOMAC scores were significantly improved with the cACB with a mean difference of 8.72 ( 95 % CI: -17.3 to -0.11 , P = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes on postoperative day 2. Paired outcomes at 6 weeks compared to baseline ROM , showed significant improvement in knee ROM with a cACB ( mean difference 11.77 ° , 95 % CI: 3.1-20.5 ° , P = 0.01). A postoperative cACB after total knee arthroplasty significantly reduces total opioid consumption and pain scores compared to sham catheter. Ambulatory ability was not affected and patients recovered function earlier. ClinicalTrials.govNCT02121392.
