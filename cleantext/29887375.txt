  Mammalian chromosomes are partitioned into A/B compartments and topologically associated domains ( TADs). The inactive X ( Xi) chromosome , however , adopts a distinct conformation without evident compartments or TADs. Here , through exploration of an architectural protein , structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes hinge domain containing 1 ( SMCHD1) , we probe how the Xi is reconfigured during X chromosome inactivation. A/B compartments are first fused into `` S1 '' and `` S2 '' compartments , coinciding with Xist spreading into gene-rich domains. SMCHD1 then binds S1/S2 compartments and merges them to create a compartment-less architecture. Contrary to current views , TADs remain on the Xi but in an attenuated state. Ablating SMCHD1 results in a persistent S1/S2 organization and strengthening of TADs. Furthermore , loss of SMCHD1 causes regional defects in Xist spreading and erosion of heterochromatic silencing. We present a stepwise model for Xi folding , where SMCHD1 attenuates a hidden layer of Xi architecture to facilitate Xist spreading.
