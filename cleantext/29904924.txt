  Actin binding LIM 1 ( abLIM1) is a cytoskeletal actin-binding protein that has been implicated in interactions between actin filaments and cytoplasmic targets. Previous biochemical and cytochemical studies have shown that abLIM1 interacts and co-localizes with F-actin in the retina and muscle. However , whether abLIM1 regulates osteoclast differentiation has not yet been elucidated. In this study , we examined the role of abLIM1 in osteoclast differentiation and function. We found that abLIM1 expression was upregulated during receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL)- induced osteoclast differentiation , and that a novel transcript of abLIM1 was exclusively expressed in osteoclasts. Overexpression of abLIM1 in the murine monocytic cell line , RAW-D suppressed osteoclast differentiation and decreased expression of several osteoclast-marker genes. By contrast , small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of abLIM1 enhanced the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and markedly increased the expression of the osteoclast-marker genes. Mechanistically , abLIM1 regulated the localization of tubulin , migration , and fusion in osteoclasts. Thus , these results indicate that abLIM1 negatively controls osteoclast differentiation by regulating cell migration and fusion mediated via actin formation.
