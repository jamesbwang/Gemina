  Hemifacial microsomia ( HFM) is a frequently encountered congenital malformation syndrome<disease> involving both hard and soft tissue. Various surgical methods have been described to correct the deformities of HFM in the literature. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy for HFM with the assistance of virtual surgical planning ( VSP) and 3-dimensionally printed surgical templates. From January 2010 to January 2016 , a total of 46 patients were referred to the study. Different surgical procedures under the guidance of VSP and 3-dimensionally printed surgical templates combined with orthodontic treatment were used to correct the deformities. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing the differences of affected-side ramus height , occlusal cant degrees and chin point deviation between the preoperative VSP and postoperative surgical results. Satisfactory facial contour and occlusion were achieved with the combination of orthognathic and orthodontic treatment. Postoperative examination results showed that VSP was accurately transferred into actual surgery. The difference between the preoperative design and the postoperative outcome was not statistically significant. VSP and 3-dimensionally printed surgical templates serve as a reliable method and show great value in improving the accuracy and efficacy of surgical treatment of HFM.
