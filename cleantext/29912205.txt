  Mass spectrometry ( MS)- based integrated metaproteomic , metabolomic , and lipidomic ( multi-omic) studies are transforming our ability to understand and characterize microbial communities in environmental and biological systems. These measurements are even enabling enhanced analyses of complex soil microbial communities , which are the most complex microbial systems known to date. Multi-omic analyses , however , do have sample preparation challenges , since separate extractions are typically needed for each omic study , thereby greatly amplifying the preparation time and amount of sample required. To address this limitation , a 3-in-1 method for the simultaneous extraction of metabolites , proteins , and lipids ( MPLEx) from the same soil sample was created by adapting a solvent-based approach. This MPLEx protocol has proven to be both simple and robust for many sample types , even when utilized for limited quantities of complex soil samples. The MPLEx method also greatly enabled the rapid multi-omic measurements needed to gain a better understanding of the members of each microbial community , while evaluating the changes taking place upon biological and environmental perturbations.
