  Dolutegravir ( DTG) , a second-generation integrase inhibitor , is an effective treatment for HIV<pathogen> but its safety and efficacy are not well-established in pregnancy. Here , we assess maternal and infant outcomes of mother-infant pairs using DTG containing regimens during pregnancy. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of pregnant women with HIV<pathogen> on DTG from two urban clinics in the United States , 2015-2018. Maternal outcomes included viral suppression ( viral load of < 20 copies/ml prior to delivery) , development of resistance , and tolerability to DTG. Infant outcomes included preterm delivery ( birth at < 37 weeks) , small for gestational age ( SGA , weight < 10th percentile) , infant HIV<pathogen> status at birth , birth defect ( s) , and Apgar scores. We performed a trend analysis to assess DTG use over time. A total of 66 women used DTG during pregnancy and the proportion on DTG increased each year: in 2015 , 8 % ( 5/60) of women were on DTG , versus 22 % ( 15/67) in 2016 , 42 % ( 30/71) in 2017 , and 59 % ( 16/27) in 2018 ( p < 0.05). Among women who delivered ( n = 57) , 77.2 % were undetectable at delivery. There were no drug resistance and no reported side effects during pregnancy. Infants had a mean APGAR score of 8 ( SD 1.5) at 1 minute and 9 ( SD 0.8) at 5 minutes; 31.6 % were born prematurely and 15.8 % were SGA , and 2 infants had a birth defect. No cases of HIV<pathogen> transmission occurred. Our findings suggest that DTG can be an effective treatment during pregnancy. Infant outcomes ( preterm deliveries and birth defects) need to be investigated in larger studies.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
