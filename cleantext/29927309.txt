  The resilience has become the main trend of the left-behind children 's ( LBC) mental health research. To evaluate the resilience status of Chinese LBC in rural areas , a meta-analysis was performed. Relevant studies were identified using electronic databases from 1990 to 2017. Pooled weighted mean difference ( WMD) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) were calculated with fixed and random effects models. A total of 14 cross-sectional studies with 9777 individuals were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed there was significant difference in the aspects of family support and RSCA ( Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents) total score between LBC and non-left-behind children ( NLBC). After stratification subgroup , significant difference in RSCA total score was also found in subgroup with sample size ≥ 700 and target population ( LBC) between LBC and NLBC. In addition , there was no significant difference in resilience of male and female among LBC ( P > 0.05). We also found RSCA total score of LBC whose one parents migratingwere higher than both parents ( P < 0.05) and the time of parental migration ( ≤ 2 years) were higher than others ( > 2 years). In conclusion , more attention should be paid to the LBC , especially both parents migrating or parental migration ( > 2 years).
