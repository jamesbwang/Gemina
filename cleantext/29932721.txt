  We report the first results on a direct search for a new 16.7 MeV boson ( X) which could explain the anomalous excess of e ^ ( +) e ^ (-) pairs observed in the excited ^ ( 8) Be ^ ( *) nucleus decays. Because of its coupling to electrons , the X could be produced in the bremsstrahlung reaction e ^ (-) Z → e ^ (-) ZX by a 100 GeV e ^ (-) beam incident on an active target in the NA64 experiment at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and observed through the subsequent decay into a e ^ ( +) e ^ (-) pair. With 5.4 × 10 ^ ( 10) electrons on target , no evidence for such decays was found , allowing us to set first limits on the X-e ^ (-) coupling in the range 1.3 × 10 ^ ( -4) ≲ ε _ ( e) ≲ 4.2 × 10 ^ ( -4) excluding part of the allowed parameter space. We also set new bounds on the mixing strength of photons with dark photons ( A ^ ( ')) from nonobservation of the decay A ^ ( ') → e ^ ( +) e ^ (-) of the bremsstrahlung A ^ ( ') with a mass ≲ 23 MeV.
