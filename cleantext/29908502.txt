  Determining sources of heavy metals in soils , sediments and groundwater is important for understanding their fate and transport and mitigating human and environmental exposures. Artificially imported fill , natural sediments and groundwater from 240 ha of reclaimed land at Fishermans Bend in Australia , were analysed for heavy metals and other parameters to determine the relative contributions from different possible sources. Fishermans Bend is Australia 's largest urban re-development project , however , complicated land-use history , geology , and multiple contamination sources pose challenges to successful re-development. We developed a method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater using statistical categorisation of the data , analysis of soil leaching values and fill/sediment XRF profiling. The method identified two major sources of heavy metals in groundwater: 1. Point sources from local or up-gradient groundwater contaminated by industrial activities and/or legacy landfills; and 2. contaminated fill , where leaching of Cu , Mn , Pb and Zn was observed. Across the precinct , metals were most commonly sourced from a combination of these sources; however , eight locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from fill leaching , and 23 locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from impacted groundwater. Concentrations of heavy metals in groundwater ranged from 0.0001 to 0.003 mg/L ( Cd) , 0.001-0.1 mg/L ( Cr) , 0.001-0.2 mg/L ( Cu) , 0.001-0.5 mg/L ( Ni) , 0.001-0.01 mg/L ( Pb) , and 0.005-1.2 mg/L ( Zn). Our method can determine the likely contribution of different metal sources to groundwater , helping inform more detailed contamination assessments and precinct-wide management and remediation strategies.
