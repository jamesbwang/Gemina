  The aim of this discursive paper was to explore the development of co-production and service user involvement in UK university-based mental health research and to offer practical recommendations for practitioners co-producing research with service users and survivors , informed by an overview of the key literature on co-production in mental health and from a critical reflection on applied research through the medium of a case study. The paper is co-written by a mental health nurse academic and a service user/survivor researcher academic. The authors argue that the implications of co-production for mental health research remain underexplored , but that both the practitioner and service user/survivor researcher experience and perspective of co-production in research can provide practical reflections to inform developing research practice. The theories and values of emancipatory research can provide a framework from which both practitioners and service users can work together on a research project , in a way that requires reflection on process and power dynamics. The authors conclude that whilst co-produced investigations can offer unique opportunities for advancing emancipatory and applied research in mental health , practitioner researchers need to be more radical in their consideration of power in the research process.
