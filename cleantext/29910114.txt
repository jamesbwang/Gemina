  Latent tuberculosis<disease> infection diagnosis and treatment is a strategic priority for eliminating tuberculosis<disease> in the U.S.. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the short-course regimen of 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine administered by directly observed therapy. However , longer-duration regimens remain the most widely prescribed latent tuberculosis<disease> infection treatments. Limitation on adoption of 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine in the U.S. might be because of patients ' preference for self-administered therapy , providers ' lack of familiarity with 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine , or lack of resources to support directly observed therapy. This review examines the most recent evidence regarding 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine 's effectiveness , safety , and treatment completion when directly compared with other latent tuberculosis<disease> infection regimens primarily comprising 9-month isoniazid treatment. Using Community Guide methodology , reviewers identified , evaluated , and summarized available evidence published during January 2006-June 2017. Analysis of the data was completed in 2017. The analysis included 15 unique studies. Three-month isoniazid-rifapentine was determined to be equal to other latent tuberculosis<disease> infection regimens in effectiveness ( OR = 0.89 , 95 % CI = 0.46 , 1.70) , and has higher treatment completion ( 87.5 % , 95 % CI = 83.2 % , 91.3 %) compared with other latent tuberculosis<disease> infection regimens ( 65.9 % , 95 % CI = 53.5 % , 77.3 %). Three-month isoniazid-rifapentine was associated with similar risk to other latent tuberculosis<disease> infection regimens for adverse events ( relative risk = 0.59 , 95 % CI = 0.23 , 1.52); discontinuing treatment because of adverse events ( relative risk = 0.48 , 95 % CI = 0.17 , 1.34); and death ( relative risk = 0.79 , 95 % CI = 0.56 , 1.11). The 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine regimen is as safe and effective as other recommended latent tuberculosis<disease> infection regimens and achieves significantly higher treatment completion rates.
