  The neuropathological hallmark of the C9orf72 intronic hexanucleotide expansion in frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) is the presence of small ubiquitin/p62-positive and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa ( TDP-43)- negative cytoplasmic inclusions<disease> in several brain areas. The identification of this histopathological signature is highly predictive of an underlying mutation. In this study , we screened 1800 cases of the Barcelona IDIBAPS Brain Bank , independently of the clinical and final neuropathological diagnosis of the brain donor , for the presence of ubiquitin/p62-positive inclusions<disease> in the cerebellum ( UPPI). Positive cases were also stained for dipeptide repeats. We identified a total of 21 donors with UPPI and in all of them the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion was genetically confirmed. Most donors had an FTLD or to a lesser extent ALS clinico-pathological phenotype. However , 3 cases had been previously classified as having clinically and neuropathologically Lewy body disease. Other co-existing pathologies , especially of the PART-type , were also frequently encountered. This study highlights the importance of the evaluation of ubiquitin/p62-positive cytoplasmic inclusions<disease> in all neurodegenerative diseases as a good screening method for the detection of C9orf72 expansion mutation , since this mutation is not rare and can overlap with other neurodegenerative entities.
