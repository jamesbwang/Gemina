  Î±-Terpineol ( TP) is present in a wide range of essential oils of the genus Eucalyptus , with recognized potential for a range of biological effects , such as analgesic. Hence , our study aimed to investigate the effect of TP on cancer pain induced by sarcoma<disease> 180 in Swiss mice. Our results showed that TP reduced significantly mechanical hyperalgesia and spontaneous and palpation-induced nociception , improved paw use without reducing tumor growth and grip strength. Importantly , no evident biochemical and hematological toxicity was oberved. Furthermore , TP increased the tissue antioxidant capacity due to ferric-reducing antioxidant power ( FRAP) and glutathione ( GSH). TP also reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) immunocontent in the tumors. Molecular docking estimated that TP binds within the same range of iNOS regions ( other iNOS inhibitors) , such as N-Nitroarginine methyl ester ( L-NAME). These data provide strong evidence that TP may be an interesting candidate for the development of new safe analgesic drugs that are effective for cancer pain control.
