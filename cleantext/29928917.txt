  Various nanoflowers are synthesized as supports for different methods of enzyme immobilization; however , the activities of these immobilized enzymes are limited because of their confinement in the nanoflowers. In order to increase the performance of nanoflowers , in this study , different protein-phosphate hybrid nanostructures were successfully synthesized and further enhanced by carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) under the same conditions. Only Cu
