  Determination of the potential effect of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) on erectile function in Egyptian men and description of the sociodemographic characteristics of these men. A cohort of 615 patients presenting to urology department aged between 30 and 75 years were prospectively assessed and divided into two groups. Group I ( n = 325) diagnosed with MetS and mean age of 56.07 ± 8.51 years. Group II ( n = 290) subjects with no MetS and mean age 54.97 ± 8.14 years. Patients filled the IIEF questionnaire , medical , personal history , and BMI data were tabulated. Metabolic syndrome<disease> was determined when three or more of the five risk factors were present according to the NCEP. In Group I ( 79.4 %) of the patients had erectile dysfunction ( ED). Of these , 20.3 % had mild , 22.5 % had moderate , and 36.6 % had severe ED and 30 % of patients without MetS had ED. Of these , 17.2 % had mild , 5.9 % had moderate , and 6.9 % had severe ED ( p < .001; odds ratio 5.549; 95 % CI 3.101-9.928). Patients with metabolic syndrome<disease> had lower IIEF-EF domain scores. Logistic regression analysis revealed that DM , dyslipidemia , age , and HTN were the most important criteria for ED in the MetS group ( p < .01). While in the group without MetS , DM , HTN , HDL , and age were the most important risk factors ( p < .01) , and TG and BMI were less important. MetS is a potential risk factor for ED in Egyptian men. Patients with MetS should be questioned about ED. The diabetic patients are most risky for ED.
