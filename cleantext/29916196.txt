  To investigate changes in sedation practice during 2012-2015 , using a large health claims database , for catheter ablation ( CA) , gastrointestinal endoscopic examination ( EE) , and surgery ( ES) after dexmedetomidine ( DEX) was approved for procedural sedation in 2013. We assessed the trends of sedative utilization , sedative-analgesic combinations , and , additionally , incidence of complications from 2012 to 2015. Using the database provided by Medical Data Vision Co. , Ltd. ( Tokyo , Japan) , annual utilization proportions of the sedatives and sedative-analgesic combinations and occurrence of complications were calculated in patients with a record of local anesthesia and CA , EE , and/or ES but without general anesthesia used on the same day. The sedatives studied were DEX , propofol ( PF) , midazolam ( MDZ) , diazepam , flunitrazepam , thiamylal ( TIA) , thiopental ( TIO) , and ketamine. DEX was used most often for CA , followed by PF. From 2012 to 2015 , the proportion of DEX increased from 30 to 36 % , and that of PF slightly decreased from 29 to 27 %. The order of utilization proportions did not change for EE or ES. The use of benzodiazepines , particularly MDZ , predominated. The top five sedative-analgesic combination patterns changed during the study period for CA , but not for EE or ES. The most common complications with CA , EE , and ES were bradycardia<symptom> , nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> , and respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> , respectively. There were no changes in the complications ' trends for the procedures. The approved use of DEX for procedural sedation resulted in changes for CA , but not for EE or ES. The complication trends did not change.
