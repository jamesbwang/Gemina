  Most studies show that marriage conveys a survival advantage. Whether this is valid also for stroke patients is unclear. Results of studies have been inconsistent and conflicting. We studied 1-week and 1-month stroke case-fatality in relation to marital status ( married , unmarried , divorced , and widowed) in all patients admitted to hospital for incident stroke in Denmark during 2003-2012. We used information from Danish registries on stroke merged to information on age , sex , marital status , stroke severity , stroke subtype , socioeconomic status , cardiovascular risk profile , and causes of death. We studied deaths due to the index stroke within the first week and month after stroke. Multivariate Cox regression models were applied to estimate cause-specific hazards and relative risks. We included 60507 patients with an incident stroke of which 51.19 % were married , 9.47 % were unmarried , 13.29 % were divorced , and 26.05 % were widowers. Death within the first week and first month was caused by stroke in 2110 ( 3.5 %) and 3423 ( 5.7 %) patients , respectively. Compared to married stroke patients , 1-week/1-month case-fatality ( by stroke) was lower for the unmarried ( HR ( hazard ratio): 0.69/ 0.74) , divorced ( HR: 0.69/ 0.72) , and widowed ( HR: 0.80/ 0.74) men and the unmarried ( HR: 0.84/ 0.86) , divorced ( HR: 0.82/ 0.80) , and widowed ( HR: 0.87/ 0.88) women with stroke. One-week and one-month case-fatality by stroke was lower among the unmarried , divorced , and widowed than among the married stroke patients. Selection by so-called mortality displacement linked to shorter life expectancy among divorced , widowed , and singles may explain our findings.
