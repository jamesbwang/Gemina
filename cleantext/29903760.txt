  The stimulation of erythrocyte formation increases the demand for iron by the bone<disease> marrow and this in turn may affect the levels of circulating diferric transferrin. As this molecule influences the production of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin , we hypothesised that erythropoiesis-driven changes in diferric transferrin levels could contribute to the decrease in hepcidin observed following erythropoietin administration. To examine this , we treated mice with erythropoietin and examined diferric transferrin at various time points up to 18 hours. We also investigated the effect of altering diferric transferrin levels on erythropoietin-induced inhibition of
