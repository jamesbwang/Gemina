  Sensory feedback is a critical aspect of motor control rehabilitation following paralysis or amputation. Current human studies have demonstrated the ability to deliver some of this sensory information via brain-machine interfaces , although further testing is needed to understand the stimulation parameters effect on sensation. Here , we report a systematic evaluation of somatosensory restoration in humans , using cortical stimulation with subdural mini-electrocorticography ( mini-ECoG) grids. Nine epilepsy patients undergoing implantation of cortical electrodes for seizure<symptom> localization were also implanted with a subdural 64-channel mini-ECoG grid over the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1). We mapped the somatotopic location and size of receptive fields evoked by stimulation of individual channels of the mini-ECoG grid. We determined the effects on perception by varying stimulus parameters of pulse width , current amplitude , and frequency. Finally , a target localization task was used to demonstrate the use of artificial sensation in a behavioral task. We found a replicable somatotopic representation of the hand on the mini-ECoG grid across most subjects during electrical stimulation. The stimulus-evoked sensations were usually of artificial quality , but in some cases were more natural and of a cutaneous or proprioceptive nature. Increases in pulse width , current strength and frequency generally produced similar quality sensations at the same somatotopic location , but with a perception of increased intensity. The subjects produced near perfect performance when using the evoked sensory information in target acquisition tasks. These findings indicate that electrical stimulation of somatosensory cortex through mini-ECoG grids has considerable potential for restoring useful sensation to patients with paralysis and amputation.
