  Pre-eclampsia constitutes a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia susceptibility is believed to be associated with altered lipid profiles and abnormal lipid metabolism via lipid peroxidation that leads to endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of maternal blood lipid and apolipoprotein levels with pre-eclampsia in a large-scale study. Using data from a large case-control study ( 1366 cases of pre-eclampsia and 1741 normotensive controls) , the association between the distributions of eight lipid fractions and pre-eclampsia risk was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models. Pre-eclampsia was defined as blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria<symptom> ≥ 300 mg/24 h ( > 1 + dipstick). Sub-group analyses were conducted for early ( < 34 weeks) and late ( ≥ 37 weeks) pre-eclampsia , estimating the effect of 1 standard deviation increase in log-transformed lipid fraction levels in adjusted multinomial regression models. After adjustment for potential confounders , concentrations of triglycerides , apolipoprotein E ( ApoE) and the relationship between apolipoprotein B and A1 ( ApoB/ApoA1) showed the strongest associations with pre-eclampsia , particularly for those cases with an early onset. Higher levels of triglycerides , ApoE and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Further studies that allow for a causal inference are needed to confirm or refute the aetiological role of blood lipids in pre-eclampsia.
