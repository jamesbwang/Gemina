  An `` Inter-Arm Difference '' ( IAD) in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) is defined as a variation in systolic BP of > 10 mmHg. Various studies conducted in different population show that there are wide variations in the prevalence of IAD , which ranges from 5 % to 46 %. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of IAD in BP among adults and its association with risk factors. This community-based cross-sectional study was carried out among urban adults in Kancheepuram district. The study sample size of 1634 was calculated , and simple random sampling method was used. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 16. Prevalence of IAD in BP was calculated using percentages , and statistical significance was tested to look for an association. This study shows that 26.2 % were at moderate risk for vascular events with IAD in systolic BP of 10-15 mmHg and 17.3 % were at high risk with IAD > 15 mmHg. About 14.2 % had diastolic BP difference of 10-15 mmHg indicative of moderate risk and 6.1 % had a difference of > 15 mmHg indicative of high risk for vascular events. The statistical significant association was found between IAD in systolic BP and risk factors such as hypertension , smoking , alcoholism , and between IAD in diastolic BP with overweight/obesity ( This study outcome shows that the prevalence of IAD in BP is on the higher side. Hence , specific guidelines should be brought in to practice for measuring BP in both arms to detect IAD in every health-care settings.
