  Enzymatic liquefaction ( EL) ensures fast extraction and enhanced recovery of bioactives from red capsicum along with reduced degradation of these compounds remained in the pomace. Hence , red capsicum pomace obtained as byproduct after EL was freeze dried to produce capsicum pomace powder ( CP). CP had almost 80 % of bioactives ( total carotenoids 91.23 ± 2.35 mg/100 g) and antioxidant activity ( DPPH 1.61 ± 0.12 µmol TE/g) compared to fresh pomace. CP was further used to develop muffins. Different concentrations ( 2-10 %) of CP were mixed in wheat flour for preparation of muffins. Wheat flour was fortified with CP at different levels ( 2-10 %) and subsequently , effect of CP fortification on height , texture , bioactives and sensory quality of muffins was observed. CP fortification improved the quality in terms of color , flavor and texture. During storage , hardness values ( 34.42-32.56 N) showed decreasing trend with increase in CP content. Overall , 6 % CP fortification was found most acceptable without causing significant change in porosity and crust uniformity of fortified muffins. Thus , present study demonstrated that fortification of muffins with 6 % CP as functional ingredient offers an opportunity to develop quality muffins with enhanced antioxidant activity ( DPPH 13.04 ± 0.02 µmol TE/g) and total carotenoids ( 3.46 ± 2.41 mg/100 g).
