  Dual MAPK pathway inhibition ( dMAPKi) with BRAF and MEK inhibitors improves survival in BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma , but the efficacy of dMAPKi in non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the responsiveness of class II ( enhanced kinase activity , dimerization dependent) BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. Tumors from patients with BRAF WT , V600E ( class I) and L597S ( class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate patient-derived-xenografts ( PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines with class IIa ( activation segment) or IIb ( p-loop) mutations and compared these to wild-type or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with BRAFi ( vemurafenib , dabrafenib , encorafenib , LY3009120) , MEKi ( cobimetinib , trametinib , binimetinib) or the combination. We identified two patients with BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. BRAFi impaired MAPK signalling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations , and prolonged survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. Class II BRAF mutant melanoma are growth inhibited by dMAPKi. Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in two patients with class II BRAF mutant melanoma. This data provides rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.
