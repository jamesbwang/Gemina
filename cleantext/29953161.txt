  A series of Fe-doped ZnS ( Fex-ZnS) photocatalysts were synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Fex-ZnS microspheres were characterized by different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Fe doping did not obviously change the morphology and crystallinity of ZnS , but effectively broadened the light response range into the visible-light region. Degradation of p-nitrophenol ( PNP) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the Fex-ZnS catalysts under visible light irradiation with the addition of H2O2 to facilitate photo-Fenton-like reactions. The highest PNP removal rate of 83.8 % after 180 min of irradiation was achieved under the optimal conditions , including a doping ratio of 6 % , a H2O2 concentration of 3 mmol L-1 and a catalyst dosage of 0.8 g L-1. The effects of aqueous/solid mass transfer and intraparticle mass transfer limitations on the PNP degradation reactions were analyzed , indicating that the variations of catalyst size caused by different Fe doping ratios did not affect the photocatalytic reactions in this study. The PNP removal mechanism of the Fex-ZnS photocatalyst with H2O2 addition under visible light irradiation was proposed.
