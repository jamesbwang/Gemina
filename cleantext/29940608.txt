  To reveal the particular aspects of the tumor microenvironment of malignant melanomas , a systematic review including 34 representative papers was performed. The review took into account the aspects related the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-related epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) versus mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET) of keratinocytes , fibroblasts and melanoma cells , as possible tools for understanding genesis and evolution of malignant melanoma. The possible reversible features of EMT and the role of tumor microenvironment in the metastatic process were also analyzed. A particular issue was related on the cancer stem cells that include melanocyte stem cells ( McSCs) and multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( MSCs). As the McSCs embryological development in mouse is not similar to human development , the role of stem cells in genesis and development of human melanoma should be proved in human melanoma cells only. For further development of targeted therapy , a better understanding of melanomagenesis pathways and its microenvironment particularities is necessary.
