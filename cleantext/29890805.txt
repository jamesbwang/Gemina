  To investigate the clinical effect of drilling columnar autogenous iliac bone graft and analyze the effect of bone grafting on postoperative complications in donor site. From March 2014 to October 2016 , 68 patients with autogenous iliac bone graft were retrospectively analyzed , and divided into drilling group and osteotomy group , 34 patients in each group. In drilling group , there were 24 males and 10 females with an average age of ( 40.06 ± 5.60) years old ranging from 23 to 53 years old; in osteotomy group , there were 26 males and 18 females with an average age of ( 39.32 ± 6.44) ranging from 22 to 56 years old. The operative time of bone extraction , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in donor area , healing time of donor site and postoperative donor site complications were observed and compared between the two groups. VAS score was used to evaluate the pain of donor site in different periods after operation. All patients were followed up for 12 to 24 months , with an average of 16.9 months in drilling group and 17.1 months in osteotomy groups. The bone healing structure was displayed in the recipient area in two groups , the effect of autogenous iliac bone grafting was good. There was no significant difference in operative time between two groups ( When bone graft is no need to have large pieces of special shape or more cortical bone iliac , it is simple to operate and less complications postoperative by drilling type columnar autogenous iliac bone graft. What 's more , it has the obvious advantages of promote healing , improve patient quality of life compared with traditional osteotomy.
