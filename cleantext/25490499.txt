  We demonstrate a high-speed terahertz ( THz) waveform measurement system for intense THz light with a scan rate of 100 Hz. To realize the high scan rate , a loudspeaker vibrating at 50 Hz is employed to scan the delay time between THz light and electro-optic sampling light. Because the fast scan system requires a high data sampling rate , we develop an Yb-doped fiber laser with a repetition rate of 100 kHz optimized for effective THz light generation with the output electric field of 1 kV/cm. The present system drastically reduces the measurement time of the THz waveform from several minutes to 10 ms.
