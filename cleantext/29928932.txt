  Increasing data suggests that chronic inflammation<symptom> has an essential role on development of muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and progression of sarcopenia in aging population. The aim of the present study was to compare Neutrophil Lymphocyte<symptom> Ratio ( NLR) levels in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic individuals and to present the correlation between NLR and other inflammatory markers. A total of 105 subjects with sarcopenia ( male/female: 54/51 , mean age 72.8 ± 7.3) and 314 subjects as non-sarcopenic ( male/female: 125/189 , mean age 71.44 ± 5.4) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People criteria. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed to participants. Complete blood count , biomarkers of inflammation<symptom> ( C-reactive protein ( CRP) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR)) of all patients were measured. NLR levels were found to be higher in the sarcopenic group ( 2.52 ± 1.30 vs 2.21 ± 0.93 , p < 0.013 , respectively). Compared to non-sarcopenic participants white blood cell ( WBC) , ESR and CRP levels were also higher in sarcopenic group. There was a positive correlation between CRP , WBC , total body fat ratio and NLR ( r: 0.433 , p < 0.001; r: 0.237 , p: 0.022; r: 0.339 , p < 0.001 , respectively). A strong negative correlation was identified between fat free mass and NLR levels in sarcopenic individuals ( r: -0.755 , p < 0.001). The result of the logistic regression analysis depicted that NLR is an independent predictor for sarcopenia ( OR = 1.31; 95 % CI = 1.06-1.62 , p: 0.013). Increased NLR levels may indicate that inflammation<symptom> may have a significant role in development of sarcopenia in the elderly population.
