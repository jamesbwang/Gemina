  Point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests show great promise for providing accurate , timely results in low-infrastructure healthcare settings and at home. The design space for these tests is limited by a variety of possible background reactions , which often originate from relatively weak promiscuous activities of the enzymes used for nucleic acid amplification. When this background signal is amplified alongside the signal of the intended biomarker , the dynamic range of the test can be severely compromised. Therefore , a detailed knowledge of potential side reactions arising from enzyme promiscuity can improve rational design of point-of-care molecular diagnostic tests. Towards this end , we report a previously unknown synergistic reaction between T7 RNA polymerase and
