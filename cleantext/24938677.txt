  Open fractures of the lower extremity are the most common open long bone injuries , yet their management remains a topic of debate.This article discusses the basic tenets of management and the subsequent impact on clinical outcome. These include the rationale for initial debridement , antimicrobial cover , addressing the soft-tissue injury and definitive skeletal management.The classification of injury severity continues to be a useful tool in guiding treatment and predicting outcome and prognosis. The Gustilo-Anderson classification continues to be the mainstay , but the adoption of severity scores such as the Ganga Hospital score may provide additional predictive utility.Recent literature has challenged the perceived need for rapid debridement within 6 hours and the rationale for prolonged antibiotic therapy in the open fracture. The choice of definitive treatment must be decided against known efficacy and injury severity/type. Recent data demonstrate better outcomes with internal fixation methods in most open tibial fractures , but external fixation continues to be an appropriate choice in more severe injuries. The incidence of infection and non-union has decreased with new treatment approaches but continues to be a source of significant morbidity and mortality.Assessment of functional outcome using various measures has been prevalent in the literature , but there is limited consensus regarding the best measures to be used.
