  In this study , paradigms that test whether human infants make social attributions to simple moving shapes were adapted for use with bottlenose dolphins. The dolphins observed animated displays in which a target oval would falter while moving upward , and then either a `` prosocial '' oval would enter and help or caress it or an `` antisocial '' oval would enter and hinder or hit it. In subsequent displays involving all three shapes , when the pro- and antisocial ovals moved offscreen in opposite directions , the dolphins reliably predicted-based on anticipatory head turns when the target briefly moved behind an occluder-that the target oval would follow the prosocial one. When the roles of the pro- and antisocial ovals were reversed toward a new target , the animals ' continued success suggests that such attributions may be dyad specific. Some of the dolphins also directed high arousal behaviors toward these displays , further supporting that they were socially interpreted.
