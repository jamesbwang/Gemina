  Recently , alterations of maternal lipid metabolism were shown to associate with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM). However , detailed plasma lipid profiles and their relevance for placenta and fetal metabolism are currently not understood. Maternal and placental lipid profiles were characterized in GDM and normal glucose tolerant ( NGT) women. Inflammatory gene expression was compared in placentas and primary term trophoblasts between both groups. Additionally , trophoblasts were stimulated with non-esterified fatty acids ( NEFA) , and effects on gene expression were quantified. Finally , placental macrophage content and cord blood concentrations of inflammatory parameters and NEFA were compared between GDM and NGT women with similar BMI. Palmitate and stearate were elevated in both maternal plasma and placental tissue of GDM women. Placental GDM-associated elevations of IL6 , IL8 , and TLR2 expression were reflected in trophoblasts derived from GDM women. Stimulation of primary trophoblasts with palmitate led to increased mRNA expression and protein release of the cytokine IL6 and the chemokine IL8. In line with this , elevated amounts of CD68-positive cells were quantified in placental tissue of GDM women. No GDM-associated elevation of a range of inflammatory parameters and NEFA in cord blood of NGT vs GDM neonates was found. GDM , independently of BMI , alters the maternal plasma NEFA and the placental lipid profile. GDM is associated with trophoblast and whole-placenta lipoinflammation that , however , does not go along with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines or NEFA in neonatal cord blood.
