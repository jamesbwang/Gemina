  Cystoventriculostomy is a surgical treatment for arachnoid cysts<symptom>. We present a case using a neuroendovascular stent to maintain ostomy patency. A 6 1/2- year-old male with symptomatic arachnoid cyst<symptom> underwent endoscopic fenestration and Wingspan stent insertion. Neuroendovascular stent placement may be an adjunct to maintain patency in cystoventriculostomy.
