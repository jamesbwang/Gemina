  This study aimed to determine current mobility and walking management by physiotherapists of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG) surgery , the clinical milestones expected and physiotherapists ' perception of the severity of pain experienced by patients after surgery. Cross sectional study using a questionnaire. All hospitals in Australia and New Zealand that perform cardiac surgery ( n = 54) were invited to complete a questionnaire. Forty-one questionnaires were returned and analysed ( response rate 76 %). Walking distance was a clinical milestone after CABG surgery. Walking and transferring patients from bed to chair required the most time of physiotherapists during one treatment session. Physiotherapists perceived that patients experienced most pain on day one after surgery ( mean ( SD)) visual analogue scale ( VAS) 41 ( 16) mm and this reduced by day four to VAS 15 ( 10) mm. Patients ' pain was perceived to be significantly higher after physiotherapy sessions compared with before ( p < 0.01). Thirty-seven respondents ( 90 %) believed that patients ' pain was well managed for physiotherapy treatments. A majority of the respondents ( 68 %) believed that pain was not a limiting factor in the distance patients walked in a physiotherapy session and most ( 90 %) believed that general fatigue<symptom> limited walk distance. This research provides current mobility and walking management by physiotherapists of patients undergoing CABG surgery in Australia and New Zealand.
