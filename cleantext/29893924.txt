  Age at first calving ( AFC) is characterized as a censored trait due to missing values provided by recording mistakes and nonoccurrence or delay in calving communication. In this context , we aimed to compare several statistical methods for genetic evaluation of AFC in Guzer√° beef cattle under a Bayesian approach. Seven different methods were used for this purpose. The traditional linear mixed model ( LM) , which considers only uncensored records; the LM with simulated records ( SM) , which is based on data augmentation framework; the penalty method , in which a constant of 21 d was added to censored records; the bivariate threshold-linear method considering ( TLcens) or not ( TLmiss) censored information; and the piecewise Weibull proportional hazards model considering ( PWPHcens) or not ( PWPH) censored records. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.19 ( TLcens) to 0.28 ( SM) in nonsurvival approaches; and 0.40 and 0.46 to PWPH and PWPHcens methods , respectively. In general , breeding values correlations between different methods and the percentage of selected bulls in common indicated reranking , with these correlation ranging from -0.28 ( between SM and PWPH) to 0.99 ( between TLmiss and LM). The traditional LM , which considers only uncensored records , should be preferred due to its robustness and simplicity. Based on cross-validation analyses , we conclude that the TLmiss could be also a suitable alternative for breeding value prediction , and censored methods did not improve the analysis.
