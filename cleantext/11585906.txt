  The Drosophila nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein ( NSD) gene encodes the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian NSD family members that are important in many aspects of development and disease in humans. In this study , we observed that overexpression of Drosophila NSD in imaginal discs induces organ atrophy. Thus , to gain an understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the gene , we analyzed the NSD promoter region. First , we identified the presence of three putative DNA replication-related element ( DRE) sequences in its promoter region , where DRE-binding factor ( DREF) could bind for transcriptional activation. In the experiments with the fly GAL4-UAS system , we demonstrated that overexpressed DREF increased the endogenous NSD transcription. To confirm the role of DREF as a transcriptional activator on the NSD expression , we generated a series of luciferase reporter gene constructs containing deleted portions of the 5 '- flanking regions as well as point mutations in the putative DRE sites. When transiently transfected into S2 cells , the deletion construct containing no DRE sites showed dramatic decrease in the NSD promoter activity , but only two sites near the transcriptional start site were important. Furthermore , we verified the direct interaction of DREF with the two positively cis-acting sequences on the NSD promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together , these results demonstrated that NSD is one of the downstream targets of the DRE/DREF pathway that is associated with various cellular processes in Drosophila , indicating that our findings may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms in complex disorders associated with NSD family members in humans.
