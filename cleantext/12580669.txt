  Monitoring tests are commonly used to assess weightlifter & rsquo; s preparedness for competition. Although various monitoring tests have been used , it is not clear which test is the strongest indicator of weightlifting performance. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to ( 1) determine the relationships between vertical jump , isometric mid-thigh pull ( IMTP) and weightlifting performance; and ( 2) compare vertical jumps to IMTP as monitoring tests of weightlifting performance in a large cohort of male and female weightlifters. Fifty-two competitive weightlifters ( 31 males , 21 females) participated in squat and countermovement jump testing ( SJ , CMJ) , and IMTP testing performed on force plates. All laboratory testing data was correlated to a recent competition where the athletes had attempted to peak. Squat jump height ( SJH) was the strongest correlate for men and women with the Sinclair Total ( Although CMJ and IMTP are still considered strong indicators of weightlifting performance , SJH appears to be the most indicative measure of weightlifting performance across a wide-range of performance levels. Thus , SJH can be used as a reliable measure to monitor weightlifting performance in male and female weightlifters.
