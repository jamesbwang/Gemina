  Intratumor heterogeneity ( ITH) detection remains a challenge in modern oncology because it can have a direct impact on the success of new therapies. Anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 immunotherapy is an emerging treatment modality that is showing great promise for clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( CCRCC) patients with advanced disease. Patient selection for such therapy relies upon the immunohistochemical detection of PD-1/ PD-L1 , however the degree of ITH for these markers among tumor cells and/or inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates remains unknown. Therefore , we analyzed PD-L1 ( SP-142) expression in the tumor inflammatory cells of 22 CCRCC cases with the aim to define the pattern of PD-L1 expression , and to compare the reliability of current tumor sampling protocols ( RS) with a multisite tumor sampling strategy ( MSTS). While the RS protocol identified 5/22 ( 22.7 %) of cases that were positive for PD-L1 expression , MSTS identified 10/22 ( 45.45 %) of cases. This suggests that RS may miss a proportion of CCRCC patients that might benefit from immunotherapy. In addition , MSTS demonstrated that positive and negative regions of PD-L1 expression are very variable within each tumor.
