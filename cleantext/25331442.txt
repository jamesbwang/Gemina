  Recent studies have shown that cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) contribute to invasive and metastatic abilities of ovarian cancer ( OC) cells. In the present study , we attempted to identify the role of CAF- and EMT-related proteins in OCs , including serous carcinoma , mucinous carcinoma , endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma using an immunohistochemical approach. The following CAF-related markers were used: CD10 , podoplanin , fibroblast activating protein ( FAP) , platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFRα) , PDGFRβ , S100A4 and α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA). In addition , the following EMT-related markers were investigated: Slug , TWIST1 and ZEB1We performed hierarchical cluster analysis to group the samples according to their scoring. Subgroup 1 was characterized by high expression of CD10 , podoplanin , α-SMA , Slug and ZEB1 , whereas subgroup 2 was closely associated with high expression of podoplanin , PDGFRα , PDGFRβ , α-SMA , and Slug. In addition , marked expression of CD10 was observed in subgroup 3. High expression of α-SMA was a distinctive feature in subgroup 4 , and expression of podoplanin and α-SMA characterized subgroup 5. Each subgroup was correlated with a histological type. The fact that different histological types were associated with different subgroups suggests the presence of distinct and heterogeneous subpopulations of CAFs in OC.
