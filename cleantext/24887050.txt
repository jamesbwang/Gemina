  The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical effects of arthroscopic surgery with open surgery for grade II gluteal muscle contracture ( GMC) in adults and to discuss the indication and technique for arthroscopic GMC release. The clinical data of 113 adult patients with grade II GMC between 2011 and 2016 was retrospectively collected. Among these patients , 72 patients received open surgery and 41 received arthroscopic surgeryy. The 2 groups were compared in terms of surgical duration , incision size , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , hospital stay , analgesic dose and ranking of postoperative functions and effects. Mean surgical duration was significantly greater in the arthroscopic surgery group ( P < 0.001). Mean incision size , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , hospital stay and analgesic dose were significantly lower in the arthroscopic surgery group compared with the open surgery group ( P < 0.001). There was no significant difference observed regarding the ranking of functions and effects between the two groups. These results suggest that existing untreated patients with GMC having low-severity ( grade II) contractures of limited area are suitable for arthroscopic surgery. The advantages of arthroscopic GMC release include limited surgical trauma , a small incision , low<symptom> blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and fewer surgical complications.
