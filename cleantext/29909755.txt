  Mitochondria are targeted for degradation by mitophagy , a selective form of autophagy. In Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , mitophagy is dependent on the autophagy receptor , Atg32 , an outer mitochondrial membrane protein. Once activated , Atg32 recruits the autophagy machinery to mitochondria , facilitating mitochondrial capture in phagophores , the precursors to autophagosomes. However , the mechanism of Atg32 activation remains poorly understood. To investigate this crucial step in mitophagy regulation , we examined the structure of Atg32. We have identified a structured domain in Atg32 that is essential for the initiation of mitophagy , as it is required for the proteolysis of the C-terminal domain of Atg32 and the subsequent recruitment of Atg11. The solution structure of this domain was determined by NMR spectroscopy , revealing that Atg32 contains a previously undescribed pseudo-receiver ( PsR) domain. Our data suggests that the PsR domain of Atg32 regulates Atg32 activation and the initiation of mitophagy.
