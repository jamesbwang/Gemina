  In order to figure out the effect of ultrasound treatments ( UT) on the tenderizing pathway of goose meat , breast muscles of 32 Eastern<disease> Zhejiang White Geese were treated with different ultrasound powers ( the control , 300 and 600 W) at 40 kHz for 30 min. Shear force , cooking loss , myofibrillar fraction index ( MFI) , particle size , morphological analysis of actin filaments and the levels of F-actin and G-actin were investigated during 168 h storage. Results showed that 600 W group had the lowest shear force and cooking loss at 24 , 48 , 96 and 168 h among treatments , while 300 W UT decreased shear force and cooking loss compared to the control. UT increased MFI and induced myofibrillar small particles ( D3 ,2) by disrupting actin filaments for myofibril and transforming of F-actin to G-actin compared to the control. We concluded that UT tenderized goose meat by fragmenting actin filaments and myofibrillar fraction.
