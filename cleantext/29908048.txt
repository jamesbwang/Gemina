  We confirm that alteration of a neuron structure can induce abnormalities in signal propagation for nervous systems , as observed in brain damage. Here , we investigate the effects of geometrical changes and damage of a neuron structure in 2 scaled nerve bundle models , made of myelinated nerve fibers or unmyelinated nerve fibers. We propose a 3D finite element model of nerve bundles , combining a real-time full electromechanical coupling , a modulated threshold for spiking activation , and independent alteration of the electrical properties for each fiber. With the inclusion of plasticity , we then simulate mechanical compression and tension to induce damage at the membrane of a nerve bundle made of 4 fibers. We examine the resulting changes in strain and neural activity by considering in turn the cases of intact and traumatized nerve membranes<symptom>. Our results show lower strain and lower electrophysiological impairments in unmyelinated fibers than in myelinated fibers , higher deformation levels in larger bundles , and higher electrophysiological impairments in smaller bundles. We conclude that the insulation sheath of myelin constricts the membrane deformation and scatters plastic strains within the bundle , that larger bundles deform more than small bundles , and that small fibers tolerate a higher level of elongation before mechanical failure.
