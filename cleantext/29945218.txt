  Mindfulness in health care professionals ( HCPs) is often discussed as a tool for improving patient care outcomes , yet there has not been a critical evaluation of the evidence , despite a growing body of research on mindfulness-based interventions ( MBIs). Numerous mechanisms exist by which mindfulness in HCPs may have an effect on patient care , and the field lacks an integrated model to guide future investigations into how MBIs may exert effects. The primary goals of this integrative review are to evaluate the evidence for the impact of MBIs in HCPs on patient care outcomes and to propose a causal model to guide future research. Databases were systematically searched for eligible studies investigating either an MBI or a measure of dispositional mindfulness in HCPs on patient care outcomes. Studies were critically evaluated using a previously developed tool. Twenty-six studies were identified ( N = 1,277) , which provide strong support for effects of mindfulness on HCP-reported patient care. Moderate support was found for patient safety , patient treatment outcomes , and patient-centered care. There was overall weak evidence to support a relationship between HCP-mindfulness on patient satisfaction. Mindfulness in HCPs may be related to several aspects of patient care.
