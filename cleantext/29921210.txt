  Given the growing use of off-label in pediatric practice , there is a growing interest on pharmacovigilance programs monitoring the occurrence of adverse drug reactions related to off-label drug prescription in childhood. The results of a one-year program of pharmacovigilance issued in the Sicilian Region , Italy , are herein presented. The study involved 6 pediatric and neonatal centres and prospectively reviewed the prescriptions of 5,060 patients , who were stratified for age ( newborn , infant , children , adolescents). A total of 14,916 prescriptions were issued for 5,060 patients. Among them , 454 patients ( 8.97 %) received at least one off-label drug. Among the off-label treated patients , 255 ( 56.2 %) were newborns. Anti-infectives drugs were the most frequent off-label used drugs , followed by drugs for alimentary tract and metabolism and drugs for blood or blood forming organs. Ninety adverse drug reactions were recorded ( 1.78 % of the total patients). They occurred after an off-label prescription in 33 out of 90 ( 36.7 %) , while those occurring after an on-label prescription were 57 ( 63.3 %). Patients treated with an off-label drug had a significantly higher risk of adverse drug reactions ( 7.3 % vs 1.2 %; p < 0.01). The present study indicates that children admitted to neonatal intensive care units are likely to receive an off-label medication; children who receive an off-label medication are usually more likely to be treated with more medication than the others; adverse drug reactions occur in patients admitted in neonatal intensive care and pediatrics units are more frequently with off-label than with on-label drugs.
