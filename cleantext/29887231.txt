  Taiwan 's single health insurer introduced a medication record exchange platform , the PharmaCloud program , in 2013. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the medication record inquiry rate on medication duplication among patients with diabetes. A retrospective pre-post design with a comparison group was conducted using nationwide health insurance claim data of diabetic patients from 2013 to 2014. Patients whose medication record inquiry rate fell within the upper 25th percentile were classified as the high-inquiry group , and the others as the low-inquiry group. The dependent variables were the likelihood of receiving duplicated medication and the overlapped medication days of the study subjects. Generalized estimation equations with difference-in-difference analysis were calculated to examine the net effect of the PharmaCloud inquiry rate for a matched sub-sample. In total , 106,508 patients with diabetes were randomly selected. From 2013 to 2014 , the medication duplication rate was reduced 7.76 percentile ( 54.12 % -46.36 %) for the high-inquiry group and 9.58 percentile ( 63.72 % -54.14 %) for the low-inquiry group; the average medication overlap periods were shortened 4.36 days ( 8.49-4.13) and 6.29 days ( 11.28-4.99) , respectively. The regression models showed patients in the high-inquiry group were more likely to receive duplicated medication ( OR = 1.11 , 95 % C.I. = 1.07-1.16) and with longer overlapped days ( 7.53 % , P = 0.0081) after the program. The medication record sharing program has reduced medication duplication among diabetes patients. However , higher inquiry rate did not lead to greater reduction in medication duplication; the overall effect might be due to enhanced internal control via prescription alert system in hospitals rather physician 's review of the records.
