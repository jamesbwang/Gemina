  Chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 ( CCT) is a molecular chaperone consisting of eight distinct protein subunits , that when oligomeric is essential for the folding of newly synthesized tubulin and actin. In addition to folding , CCT activity includes functions of individual subunits in their monomeric form. For example , when CCTδ monomer levels are increased in cultured mammalian cells , numerous cell surface protrusions are formed from retraction fibres , indicating that an underlying function for the CCTδ monomer exists. Here , using a yeast two-hybrid screen we identify the dynactin complex component p150
