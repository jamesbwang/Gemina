  The neuropeptide oxytocin plays an evolutionarily conserved role in mammalian social behavior. Despite striking effects on animal social behavior after intracerebroventricular drug delivery , this delivery mode is impractical in humans. Intranasal oxytocin delivery provides a noninvasive alternative to increase central oxytocin activity , and has shown promise as a treatment for psychiatric illnesses. Intranasal oxytocin delivery is purported to increase central oxytocin concentrations via channels surrounding trigeminal and olfactory nerve fibers , which may facilitate increased activity at central oxytocin receptors. This report outlines the evidence for intranasal oxytocin delivery increasing central concentrations or activity , identifies current knowledge gaps and highlights future research opportunities. Recent efforts to enhance intranasal oxytocin delivery via improved intranasal delivery technology and dose-ranging studies are discussed.
