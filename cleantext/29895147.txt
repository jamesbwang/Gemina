  Spiromamakone A is a racemic natural product having a naphthyl acetal group on a spiro ( 4,4) nonadiene skeleton. Its total synthesis was achieved by double oxa-Michael addition of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene to 2- ( 1-bromoalkylidene) -4-isopropoxy-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione , which was prepared by palladium ( II)- catalyzed ring expansion of 4- ( 1-alkynyl) -4-hydroxy-3-isopropoxy-2-cyclobuten-1-one , and a subsequent intramolecular aldol reaction. The synthesis using optically active intermediates enabled identification of the racemization step of spiromamakone A and revealed that spiromamakone A and spiropreussione A are identical; the latter had been reported as a constitutional isomer of the other.
