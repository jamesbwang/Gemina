  Ventricular retraining and arterial switch have been described in late-presenting transposition of the great arteries ( TGA) in older infants who were unable to undergo neonatal arterial switch operation ( ASO) and late survivors of atrial switch with systemic right ventricular dysfunction. There are little data available on patients presenting between these 2 groups. This study aims to review the early and mid-term outcomes of the management of late-presenting TGA with an unprepared left ventricle ( LV) by a 2-stage arterial switch. The demographic , procedural and outcome data were obtained for all children who underwent LV retraining for late-presenting TGA between 2005 and 2017 at our institution. The primary outcomes were early mortality and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) after arterial switch. Twenty patients were included during the study period , with a median age of 12 months ( range 6 weeks-3.3 years). The median time of LV retraining was 48 ( range 8-170) days. Indexed LV mass increased from 34 ± 19 g/m2 before LV retraining to 106 ± 85 g/m2 before arterial switch. There was 1 death ( 5 %) after LV retraining. Three patients required ECMO support after arterial switch ( 15 %) despite retraining. During follow-up , there was 1 late death , no late reinterventions or reoperations , and all surviving patients had normal or near-normal LV function at late follow-up. LV retraining resulted in an increase in LV mass and enabled a 2-stage arterial switch to be carried out with acceptable early and mid-term outcomes. Two-stage arterial switch is a reasonable option for late-presenting TGA. A long-term follow-up is required to assess late LV function after preparation.
