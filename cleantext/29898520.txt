  Understanding the relationship between urban land structure and land surface temperatures ( LST) is important for mitigating the urban heat island<disease> ( UHI). This paper explores this relationship within central Beijing , an area located within the 2nd Ring Road. The urban variables include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI) , the Normalized Difference Build-up Index ( NDBI) , the area of building footprints , the area of main roads , the area of water bodies and a gravity index for parks that account for both park size and distance. The data are captured over 8 grids of square cells ( 30 m , 60 m , 90 m , 120 m , 150 m , 180 m , 210 m , 240 m). The research involves: ( 1) estimating land surface temperatures using Landsat 8 satellite imagery , ( 2) building the database of urban variables , and ( 3) conducting regression analyses. The results show that ( 1) all the variables impact surface temperatures , ( 2) spatial regressions are necessary to capture neighboring effects , and ( 3) higher-order polynomial functions are more suitable for capturing the effects of NDVI and NDBI.
