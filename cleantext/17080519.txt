  The objective of this study was to determine the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome<disease> in adults with a history of juvenile arthritis<disease> ( JA). Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES) , we compared the characteristics of respondents with arthritis<disease> ( JA vs rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA)) to those of the control group without arthritis<disease>. We used logistic regression analyses , controlling for age , race , and gender , to determine the ORs for metabolic syndrome<disease>. Obesity was increased in the JA group with 67 % respondents having body mass index â‰¥ 30 kg/m Adults with a history of JA have a significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome<disease> compared to those without arthritis<disease>. These findings are important because metabolic syndrome<disease> has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in other populations.
