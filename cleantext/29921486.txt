  To compare the utility and limitation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS) and arterial spin labeling ( ASL) in the differentiation between mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , plus stroke-like episodes ( MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) , a retrospective review of 17 MELAS and 26 AIS patients were performed. In all patients both MRS and ASL scans were performed within 1 week after admission. Demographic , clinical , laboratory and MR imaging data were reviewed and compared between the two groups. Compared with AIS , MELAS patients had a younger age of onset , a longer disease duration , a higher occurrence of epilepsy attack , occipital and parietal lesions<symptom> , and dilated cerebral arteries ( P < 0.05). In all MELAS patients lactate peak and hyperperfusion of the lesion<symptom> was revealed. However in AIS lactate peak was observed in only 69.2 % and hyperperfusion was observed in only 34.6 % ischemic lesions<symptom> ( P < 0.05). Choline/Creatine ratios and Lactate/Creatine ratios were higher in AIS , while in MELAS cerebral blood flow and lesion-normal perfusion ratio was much higher ( P < 0.05). No correlations was found between metabolite ratios and perfusion parameters in either group ( P > 0.05). Area under curve ( AUC) of perfusion for the differentiation between MELAS and AIS was 0.958 ( P < 0.001). The cut-off value was 2.075 , with a sensitivity of 88.2 % and a specificity of 96.2 %. AUC of Lactate/Creatine ratio was 0.469 ( P = 0.737). Utility of MRS is limited in the differentiation between MELAS and AIS , while MR perfusion profiles are much more sensitive and specific.
