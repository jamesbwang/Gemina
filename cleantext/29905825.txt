  Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) receptor agonists have been efficacious for the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to their ability to reduce weight and attenuate hyperglycemia. However , the activity of GLP-1R-directed strategies is sub-maximal , and the only potent , sustainable treatment for metabolic dysfunction is bariatric surgery , necessitating the development of novel therapeutics. GLP-1 is structurally related to glucagon and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP) , allowing for the development of intermixed , unimolecular peptides with activity at each of their respective receptors. In this review , we discuss the range of tissue targets and added benefits afforded by the inclusion of each of GIP and glucagon. We discuss considerations for the development of sequence intermixed dual- and tri-agonists , highlighting the importance of evaluating balanced signaling at the targeted receptors. Several multi-receptor agonist peptides have been developed and evaluated , and the key pre-clinical and clinical findings are reviewed in detail. The biological activity of these multi-receptor agonists are founded in the success of GLP-1-directed strategies; by including GIP and glucagon components these multi-receptor agonists are thought to enhance GLP-1 's activities by broadening the tissue targets and synergizing at tissues that express multiple receptors , such at the brain and pancreatic islet Î² cells. The development and utility of balanced , unimolecular multi-receptor agonists provides both a useful tool for querying the actions of incretins and glucagon during metabolic disease , as well as providing a novel drug class to treat type 2 diabetes with unprecedented efficacy.
