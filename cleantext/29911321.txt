  Fractional ablative resurfacing is frequently used for treating atrophic and acne scars as well as for the early improvement of scars after surgery. No evidence-based clinical data on improving the appearance of skin grafts by fractional CO The primary outcome parameter was the adaptation of the skin graft to the surrounding skin 2 , 6 , and 12 months after the second laser treatment. Secondary outcome parameters were melanin variation , skin roughness , resizing of the skin graft , and patient satisfaction with cosmetic results. The randomized half of the skin graft was treated with the fractional CO Adaptation to the surrounding skin was significantly improved after laser therapy. The mean investigator ratings showed poor adaptation to the surrounding skin before the first treatment ( treatment: 2.24 ± 1.00; control group: 1.95 ± 1.27; P < .001; n = 26) but significant improvement at the follow-up visits ( 8 weeks: treatment: 6.38 ± 1.47; control group 5.29 ± 1.27; P < .001; 6 months: treatment: 7.31 ± 1.24; control group 6.04 ± 0.91; 12 months: treatment: 7.6 ± 1.26; control group: 6.57 ± 1.02; n = 26). After fractional ablative laser treatment , appearance of the skin grafts was significantly improved for all time points. Profilometric analysis showed significantly reduced skin roughness 1 year after laser treatment compared to control ( P = .003). Pigmentary irregularities were improved. Melanin distribution was significantly more uniform 1 year after laser treatment compared to control ( P = .034). Patients were reasonably satisfied with both sides of the skin graft before treatment but more satisfied with the laser-treated side at the other time points ( P < .001). Adaptation of the skin graft to the surrounding skin was significantly improved after ablative fractional skin resurfacing. Skin roughness and melanin variation were also improved. Patient satisfaction with the appearance of the skin graft was significantly higher after graft resurfacing. Thus , this treatment modality can be recommended for patients wishing to improve the appearance of their skin graft. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals , Inc..
