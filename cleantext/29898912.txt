  Biliary cystic disease is a rare entity. Twenty-five per cent of cases are diagnosed during adulthood and only a few reports have described this condition during pregnancy , where it represents a therapeutic challenge for both obstetricians and surgeons with regard to the risks it entails for the patient and the fetus.Definitive management is surgical resection , as cysts<symptom> may progress to malignancy if untreated. During pregnancy , resection is generally deferred to after delivery , especially in the context of suspected cholangitis.A 19-year-old young woman with no previous prenatal control , presented to the emergency department on her 32nd week of gestation with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and jaundice. A giant Todani I biliary cyst<symptom> was observed on imaging along with dilation of the proximal biliary tree suggesting acute cholangitis. Fetal compromise prompted immediate delivery after which percutaneous biliary drainage was performed. Following recovery , the cyst<symptom> was surgically resected.
