  Chronic mucus hyper-secretion ( CMH) contributes to the morbidity and mortality of asthma and remains uncontrolled by current therapies in the subset of patients with severe , steroid resistant disease. Altered cross-talk between airway epithelium and airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs) , driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β , provides a potential mechanism that influences CMH.This study investigated mechanisms underlying CMH by comparing IL-1β-induced gene expression profiles between asthma and control-derived ASMCs and the subsequent paracrine influence on airway epithelial mucus production
