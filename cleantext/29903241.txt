  To evaluate nutritional status of vitamin A ( VA) among Chinese rural fertile women in 2010-2012. A multi-stage stratified sampling and population proportional stratified random sampling method was used and the participants of rural fertile women who were 18-44 years old and had completed personal information data during the 2010-2012 National Nutrition and Health Survey were included ( n = 1279). The level of serum retinol , rate of VA marginal deficiency anddeficiency among the fertile women were analyzed. In 2010-2012 , the P50 ( P25-P75) level of serum retinol was 1. 63 ( 1. 28-2. 10) μmol/L for Chinese rural fertile women , 1. 60 ( 1. 25-2. 05) μmol/L for fertile women from ordinary rural area and1. 70 ( 1. 32-2. 17) μmol/L for fertile women from poverty rural area. The level of serum retinol of fertile women from poverty rural area was statistically higher than that of ordinary rural area ( P = 0. 007). The rate of VA marginal deficiency and deficiency among the Chinese rural fertile women was 9. 46 % and 3. 05 % , respectively. The rate of VA marginal deficiency and deficiency among the fertile women from ordinary rural area and poverty rural area was 9. 82 % , 4. 13 % , 9. 03 % and 1. 74 % , respectively. The rate of VA deficiency among the fertile women from ordinary rural was statistically higher than that of poverty rural ( P = 0. 013) , but no statistically differences in the rate of VA marginal deficiency were found ( P > 0. 05). Moreover , the statistically differences of rate of VA marginal deficiency and deficiency were also observed in the different regions and educational level ( only VA deficiency). There were no statistically differences of VA marginal deficiency and deficiency were found in the other variables. The different extent of VA deficiency still present and more popular for the VA marginal deficiency among Chinese fertile women.
