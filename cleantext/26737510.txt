  Human brain function depends on directed interactions between multiple areas that evolve in the subsecond range. Time-varying multivariate autoregressive ( tvMVAR) modeling has been proposed as a way to help quantify directed functional connectivity strengths with high temporal resolution. While several tvMVAR approaches are currently available , there is a lack of unbiased systematic comparative analyses of their performance and of their sensitivity to parameter choices. Here , we critically compare four recursive tvMVAR algorithms and assess their performance while systematically varying adaptation coefficients , model order , and signal sampling rate. We also compared two ways of exploiting repeated observations: single-trial modeling followed by averaging , and multi-trial modeling where one tvMVAR model is fitted across all trials. Results from numerical simulations and from benchmark EEG recordings showed that: i) across a broad range of model orders all algorithms correctly reproduced patterns of interactions; ii) signal downsampling degraded connectivity estimation accuracy for most algorithms , although in some cases downsampling was shown to reduce variability in the estimates by lowering the number of parameters in the model; iii) single-trial modeling followed by averaging showed optimal performance with larger adaptation coefficients than previously suggested , and showed slower adaptation speeds than multi-trial modeling. Overall , our findings identify strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of existing tvMVAR approaches and provide practical recommendations for their application to modeling dynamic directed interactions from electrophysiological signals.
