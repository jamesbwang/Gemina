  Results of a study of contraindicated concomitant medication use among recipients of preferred antiretroviral therapy ( ART) regimens are reported. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate concomitant medication use in a cohort of previously treatment-naive , human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)- infected U.S. patients prescribed preferred ART regimens during the period April 2014-March 2015. Data were obtained from a proprietary longitudinal prescription database; elements retrieved included age , sex , and prescription data. The outcome of interest was the frequency of drug-drug interactions ( DDIs) associated with concomitant use of contraindicated medications. Data on 25,919 unique treatment-naive patients who used a preferred ART regimen were collected. Overall , there were 384 instances in which a contraindicated medication was dispensed for concurrent use with a recommended ART regimen. Rates of contraindicated concomitant medication use differed significantly by ART regimen; the highest rate ( 3.2 %) was for darunavir plus ritonavir plus emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( DRV plus RTV plus FTC/TDF) , followed by elvitegravir-cobicistat-emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( EVG/c/FTC/ TDF) ( 2.8 %). The highest frequencies of DDIs were associated with ART regimens that included a pharmacoenhancing agent: DRV plus RTV plus FTC/TDF ( 3.2 %) and EVG/c/FTC/ TDF ( 2.8 %). In a large population of treatment-naive HIV-infected patients , ART regimens that contained a pharmacoenhancing agent were involved most frequently in contraindicated medication-related DDIs. All of the DDIs could have been avoided by using therapeutic alternatives within the same class not associated with a DDI.
