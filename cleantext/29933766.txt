  Various anesthetic protocols are used in laboratory swine , each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Partial intravenous anesthetic techniques ( PIVA) help minimize dose-dependent cardiopulmonary effects of inhalant drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the cardiopulmonary effects of a PIVA in laboratory swine. In a prospective , nonrandomized clinical study , 8 healthy juvenile Landrace-White pigs were premedicated with azaperone ( 0.20 ± 0.20 mg/kg IM) , dexmedetomidine ( 0.02 ± 0.002 mg/kg IM) , and alfaxalone ( 2.0 ± 0.20 mg/kg IM) , and anesthesia was induced with intravenous alfaxalone. Anesthesia was maintained by using constant-rate infusion of dexmedetomidine ( 2 μg/kg/h) and alfaxalone ( 25 μg/kg/min) in combination with isoflurane. After the fraction of expired isoflurane was adjusted to 1.1 % to 1.5 % , respiratory rate , heart rate , systemic and pulmonary arterial pressure , central venous pressure , cardiac output , bispectral index , systemic vascular resistance , and arterial and mixed venous blood gases were recorded every 10 min for 60 min. Statistical analysis consisted of repeated-measures one-way ANOVA. Significant decreases occurred in heart rate , pulmonary mean arterial pressure , pulmonary diastolic pressure , partial pressure of arterial oxygen , partial pressure of venous oxygen; significant increases occurred in respiratory rate , minute volume index , diastolic arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , systemic vascular resistance , and arterial pH over time. We consider that the observed statistically significant cardiopulmonary changes were clinically important and that the PIVA protocol provided hemodynamic and respiratory stability for short-term anesthesia of laboratory swine.
