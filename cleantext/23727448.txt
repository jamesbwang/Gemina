  We investigated the effectiveness of one education course to lower the severity of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms among breast cancer ( BC) patients during radiotherapy ( RT). All 290 one-sided BC patients were evenly randomized into intervention or control arm. `` Intervention '' patient was additionally provided with one three-hour course on psychological stresses and management skills. Changes of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> score and their 3-level severity category ( ` normal ' , ` borderline ' and ` abnormal ' scored 0-7 , 8-10 and 11-21 , respectively) from HADS questionnaire over RT were evaluated by multivariable linear and ordinal logistic regressions. Response rates were 94 and 100 % by `` intervention '' and `` control '' arm , respectively. Means of score changes by `` intervention '' and `` control '' ( n = 145) were + 0.59 ( SD = 2.47) and + 0.11 ( SD = 2.55) for anxiety<symptom> and + 0.81 ( SD = 2.81) and + 0.45 ( SD = 2.77) for depression<symptom> scores , respectively. ` Abnormal ' anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> patients were 4.1 and 6.9 % at baseline and 4.8 and 6.9 % at end of RT at ` control ' arm; those rates were 6.6 and 7.4 % , and 8.8 and 10.3 % at ` intervention ' arm , respectively. Both changes on anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> measurements between two arms were all insignificant ( p > 0.20). One education course did not reduce the score and severity of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms over RT period.
