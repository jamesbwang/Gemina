  The aim of this study was to assess knife castration and knife castration + branding in 2-mo old calves , and the effect of a single dose of s.c. meloxicam at mitigating pain indicators. Seventy-one Angus crossbred bull calves ( 128 ± 18.5 kg of BW) were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design where main factors included procedure: sham ( control calves , CT; n = 23) , knife ( KN; n = 24) or knife + branding ( BK; n = 24) and medication: single s.c. administration of lactated ringer solution ( NM; n = 35) or a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg of s.c. meloxicam ( M; n = 36). Physiological samples were collected at T0 , 60 , 90 , 120 and 180 min and on d 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 after procedure , while behavioral observations were evaluated at 2 to 4 h and 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 days after procedure. A procedure × time effect ( P < 0.01) was observed for cortisol , where KN and BK calves had greater ( P ≤ 0.01) cortisol concentrations than CT calves 60 min after the procedure , while BK calves had the greatest ( P < 0.05) cortisol concentrations , followed by KN calves and by CT calves 90 , 120 and 180 min after the procedure. A procedure × time effect ( P = 0.01) was observed for tail flicks , where KN and BK calves had a greater ( P < 0.05) number of tail flicks than CT calves on d 1 and 3 , while BK calves had the greatest number of tail flicks , followed by KN calves , and then by CT calves on d 2. Haptoglobin had a procedure × medication × time interaction ( P = 0.05) , where BK-NM calves had greater haptoglobin concentrations than BK-M , KN-M and CT calves on d 1 and 3 , while BK-NM and KN-NM calves had greater haptoglobin concentrations than BK-M , KN-M and CT calves on d 2 after the procedure. Lying duration and tail flicks had a medication effect ( P = 0.04; P < 0.01) where M calves had greater ( P < 0.05) lying duration and lower ( P < 0.05) number of tail flicks than NM calves 2 to 4 h after procedure. No medication effects ( P > 0.10) were observed for salivary cortisol , substance P and scrotal temperature min after the procedure or for cortisol , substance P , serum amyloid A , stride length or behavioral observations on d after the procedure. Overall , BK calves presented greater physiological and behavioral indicators of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> than KN calves , suggesting that the combination of knife castration + branding was more painful. Meloxicam administered s.c. was effective at reducing physiological and behavioral indicators of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> associated with knife castration and knife castration + branding.
