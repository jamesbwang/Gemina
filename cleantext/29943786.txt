  A key challenge of chemotherapy in clinical treatments is multidrug resistance ( MDR) , which mainly arises from drug efflux-induced tumor cell survival. Thus , it is necessary to provide biocompatible chemotherapeutics to improve drug accumulation in MDR cells. Herein , two clinical small molecular drugs , celastrol ( CST) and doxorubicin ( DOX) , were self-assembled into carrier-free and biocompatible nanoparticles ( CST/DOX NPs) via a simple and green precipitation method for synergistic combination chemotherapy to overcome DOX resistance. These spherical CST/DOX NPs can improve the water-solubility of CST , reduce the dosage of DOX , and therefore significantly enhance cellular drug accumulation by activating heat shock<symptom> factor 1 ( HSF-1) and inhibiting NF-ÎºB to depress P-gp expression , which results in apoptosis and autophagy of DOX resistant cells through the ROS/JNK signaling pathway. Finally , synergistic combination chemotherapy was attained in both MCF-7/ MDR cells and 3D multicellular tumor spheroids. Thus , CST/DOX NPs provide an alternative for overcoming drug resistance in future clinical applications.
