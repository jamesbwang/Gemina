  Immunization of pregnant women against seasonal influenza<disease> remains limited in low- and lower-middle-income countries despite being recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO). The WHO/PATH Maternal Influenza<disease> Immunization Project was created to identify and address obstacles to delivering influenza<disease> vaccines to pregnant women in low resource setting. To gain a better understanding of potential demand from this target group , we developed a model simulating pregnant women populations eligible for vaccination during antenatal care ( ANC) services in all low- and lower-middle-income countries. We assessed potential vaccine demand in the context of both seasonal and year-round vaccination strategies and identified the ways that immunization programs may be affected by availability gaps in supply linked to current vaccine production cycles and shelf life duration. Results of our analysis , which includes 54 eligible countries in 2015 for New Vaccine Support from Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance , suggest the demand for influenza<disease> vaccines could be 7.7 to 16.0 million doses in 2020 , and 27.0 to 61.7 million doses by 2029. If current trends in production capacity and actual production of seasonal influenza<disease> vaccines were to continue , global vaccine supply would be sufficient to meet this additional demand-although a majority of countries would face implementation issues linked to timing of supply.
