  Using an extended definition of sexuality , this mixed-methods study builds on existing research into adolescents ' emergent sexual development by longitudinally examining adolescents ' sexual behavior trajectories ( i.e. , from less to more intimate sexual behavior). Over a 2-year period , 45 adolescents ( M age = 15.9 years) reported on their sexual behavior using questionnaires and on their everyday expressions of sexuality in the form of semi-structured diaries. Cluster analysis using the questionnaire data identified three sexual behavior trajectories: a non-sexually active trajectory ( meaning no or minor sexual behavior) ( n = 29) , a gradually sexually active trajectory ( meaning step-by-step sexual behavior development) ( n = 12) , and a fast sexually active trajectory ( meaning rapid sexual behavior development) ( n = 4). Qualitative analysis using diaries revealed the following themes: romantic versus sex-related topics , desires , uncertainties , and references to the social context. In general , all adolescents reported more about romantic aspects of sexuality ( than about sexual acts) in the diaries , regardless of their sexual behavior trajectory. Sexually active adolescents ( i.e. , gradual and fast) were more concerned with sexuality in their diaries , especially more with the physical aspects of sexuality , than non-active adolescents. Gradual adolescents experienced more desires about physical sexual contact and reported fewer references to their social network than non-active and fast adolescents. The findings suggest that sexual education that discusses the internal experiences of sexuality , such as feelings and thoughts , particularly the romantic aspects , may help adolescents process their preferences for different sexual and romantic acts and may contribute to healthy sexual development.
