  The CD/DVDs used as radon ( 222Rn) and thoron ( 220Rn) detectors can provide a sufficiently sensitive and cost-efficient option for passive radiation monitoring in underground mines. This note presents results of measurements made under real environmental conditions by CD/DVDs. Comparison with conventional diffusion chambers was made and good correspondence was observed. Correlation between 222Rn and 220Rn was studied by CD/DVDs and no signs for any correlation were observed. Dedicated study in a mine gallery showed that CD/DVDs can be successfully used for the purposes of ventilation diagnostics by identifying sources of air contaminated with radon.
