  Hierarchically dual-mesoporous TiO2 microspheres have been synthesized via a solvothermal process in the presence of 1-butyl-3-methylmidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( ( BMIm) ( BF4)) and diethylenetriamine ( DETA) as co-templates. Secondary mesostructured defects in the hierarchical TiO2 microspheres produce the oxygen vacancies , which not only significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity on degrading methyl blue ( over 1.7 times to P25) and acetone ( over 2.9 times of P25) , but which also are beneficial for lithium storage. Moreover , we propose a mechanism to obtain a better understanding of the role of dual mesoporosity of TiO2 microspheres for enhancing the molecular diffusion , ion transportation and electron transformation.
