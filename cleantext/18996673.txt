  Isolated dissection of the celiac artery ( IDCA) is one of isolated visceral artery dissection , which can occur alone , and can also be complicated with superior mesenteric artery dissection and splenic artery pseudoaneurysm. This disease is very rare in clinic. The exact pathogenesis of IDCA remains unknown. At present , no consensus has yet been reached on the best treatment strategy for this rare disease. In the present study , the clinical data of one IDCA patient diagnosed and treated in our hospital was retrospectively analyzed , and related literatures were reviewed , in order to improve the understanding of the disease. The patient was a 49-year-old male , who was admitted in our hospital because of `` pain of subxyphoid area for one month ''. One month before , the patient presented with persistent pain in the subxyphoid area after he had a cold , on paroxysmal exacerbation occurred. After taking `` stomach drug '' , the subjective symptoms eased slightly , but the disease attacked again two hours later. The patient was diagnosed with `` isolated dissection of the celiac artery '' by enhanced CT.. The patient was interventionally treated with bare stent implantation. The symptom of the patient disappeared after interventional therapy. In the present study , the clinical symptoms and treatment process of one patient with IDCA were described. The clinical symptoms of IDCA are often atypical , and its incidence is extremely low , therefore it is extremely easily misdiagnosed. The definite diagnosis depends on imaging examination. Interventional therapy is the first choice for treating this disease due to its advantages of small trauma and good curative effect.
