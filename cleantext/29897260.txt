  As a life-span theory of personality that is supported by more than 40 years of empirical research , attachment theory and associated measures have contributed immensely to our understanding of emotion regulation , social dynamics , and behavior. Nevertheless , little attention has been given to how attachment dynamics influence relationships at work or the extent to which adult attachment patterns are mirrored in leaders ' perceptions and behaviors toward their direct reports. Moreover , attachment measures that use romantic relationships as their referent might not be appropriate for use in organizational settings with executive clients. Thus , a measure that directly references direct reports and that could be put to use in organizational contexts is needed. The two studies reported here supported the two-factor orthogonal structure of such a measure and results from a sample of Fortune 500 executives reveal that leader attachment relates in theoretically consistent ways with general adult attachment , the Big Five , emotional intelligence , and critical thinking. Results are discussed in terms of integrating attachment measures into organizational personality assessment to inform work with organizational clients.
