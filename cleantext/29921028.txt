  Aerogels assembled from colloidal metal or semiconductor nanocrystals ( NCs) feature large surface area , ultralow density , and high porosity , thus rendering them attractive in various applications , such as catalysis , sensors , energy storage , and electronic devices. Morphological and structural modification of the aerogel backbones while maintaining the aerogel properties enables a second stage of the aerogel research , which is defined as hierarchical aerogels. Different from the conventional aerogels with nanowire-like backbones , those hierarchical aerogels are generally comprised of at least two levels of architectures , i.e. , an interconnected porous structure on the macroscale and a specially designed configuration at local backbones at the nanoscale. This combination `` locks in '' the inherent properties of the NCs , so that the beneficial genes obtained by nanoengineering are retained in the resulting monolithic hierarchical aerogels. Herein , groundbreaking advances in the design , synthesis , and physicochemical properties of the hierarchical aerogels are reviewed and organized in three sections: i) pure metallic hierarchical aerogels , ii) semiconductor hierarchical aerogels , and iii) metal/semiconductor hybrid hierarchical aerogels. This report aims to define and demonstrate the concept , potential , and challenges of the hierarchical aerogels , thereby providing a perspective on the further development of these materials.
