  Standard tensile tests of materials are usually performed on freestanding specimens. However , such requirement is difficult to implement when the materials of interest are of nanoscopic dimensions due to problems related to their handling and manipulation. In the present paper , a new device is presented for tensile testing of thin nanomaterials , which allows tests to be carried out on specimens initially deposited onto a macroscopic pre-notched substrate. On loading , however , no substrate effects are introduced , allowing the films to be freely stretched. The results obtained from a variety of thin metal or polymeric films are very promising for the further development of this technique as a standard method for nanomaterial mechanical testing.
