  Since 2007 , 2 doses of varicella vaccine have been routinely recommended , with a catch-up second dose recommended for those who received only 1 prior dose. To examine varicella vaccination coverage with 2 or more doses and the proportions of adolescents with evidence of immunity to varicella ( â‰¥ 2 doses of vaccine or varicella history) during 2007-2014. To assess timing of second-dose receipt , factors associated with 2 or more vaccine doses , and missed second-dose opportunities during 2014. We used data from the 2007-2014 National Immunization Survey-Teen ( NIS-Teen) , which collects information on adolescents aged 13 to 17 years in the United States. From 2007 to 2014 , varicella vaccination coverage with 2 or more doses increased from 8.3 % to 66.9 % in 13- to 15-year-olds and from 3.6 % to 56.7 % in 16- to 17-year-olds. The proportions with evidence of immunity also increased from 68.0 % to 84.1 % ( 13- to 15-year-olds) and 78.6 % to 83.4 % ( 16- to 17-year-olds). In 2014 , 13.4 % of 13- to 15-year-olds and 3.2 % of 16- to 17-year-olds had received their second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Factors most significantly associated with lower coverage with 2 or more doses were not having an 11- to 12-year well-child visit , not receiving an adolescent vaccine , and residence in a state with no 2-dose immunization school entry requirement. Seventy-seven percent of 1-dose vaccinated adolescents had 1 or more missed opportunities to receive their second dose; if were they not missed , 2-dose coverage would have increased from 79.5 % to 94.8 %. Levels of varicella vaccination coverage with 2 or more doses and the proportion of adolescents with evidence of immunity increased from 2007 to 2014 , though 16 % lacked evidence of immunity in 2014. Although catch-up campaigns have succeeded , missed vaccination opportunities persist.
