  The storage of soil organic carbon ( SOC) should improve soil fertility. Conventional determination of SOC is expensive and tedious. Visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy is a practical and cost-effective approach that has been successfully used SOC concentration. Soil spectral inversion model could quickly and efficiently determine SOC content. This paper presents a study dealing with SOC estimation through the combination of soil spectroscopy and stepwise multiple linear regression ( SMLR) , partial least squares regression ( PLSR) , principal component regression ( PCR). Spectral measurements for 106 soil samples were acquired using an ASD FieldSpec 4 standard-res spectroradiometer ( 350-2500 nm). Six types of transformations and three regression methods were applied to build for the quantification of different parent materials development soil. The results show that ( 1) the basaltic volcanic clastics development of SOC spectral response bands located in 500 nm , 800 nm; Trachyte spectral response of the soil quality , and the volcanic clastics development at 405 nm , 465 nm , 575 nm , 1105 nm. ( 2) Basaltic volcanic debris soil development , first deviation of maximum correlation coefficient is 0.8898; thick surface soil of the development of rocky volcanic debris from bottom reflectivity logarithm of first deviation of maximum correlation coefficient is 0.9029. ( 3) Soil organic matter content of basaltic volcanic clastics development optimal prediction model based on spectral reflectance inverse logarithms of first deviation of SMLR.
