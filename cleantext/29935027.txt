  A novel and selective tyrosine functionalization strategy through SuFEx ( sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry is presented. In this approach , free tyrosine ( Tyr) reacts selectively with aryl fluorosulfate in the presence of various nucleophilic amino acid residues in bio-tolerable conditions. Chemoselectivity of this unique SuFEx reaction was confirmed in amino acid , peptide , and protein conjugations. The functions of peptides and proteins were well-preserved as demonstrated from the Tyr-specific modification of cell-penetrating peptide and erythropoietin. This method is well-suited for residue-specific modification of native proteins , and thus would expand the versatility of bio-conjugation in protein chemistry.
