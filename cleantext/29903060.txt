  Generally , nitric oxide ( NO) is an important multi-functional cardioprotective soluble gas molecule. However , it may be detrimental when in excessive levels or combined with O2- a kind of reactive oxygen species ( ROS)- to form ONOO-. The latter will rapidly decompose to highly reactive oxidant components. ROS will be abundantly produced during the ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) procedure. Therefore , an NO donor coupled with another antioxidant would be a more promising strategy for I/R treatment. In this study , we report on a novel self-assembly supramolecular hydrogel capable of constantly releasing both NO and curcumin ( Cur) simultaneously , and we found that the combinational treatment of Cur and NO from the gel could efficiently reduce I/R injuries. The underlining mechanism revealed that the hydrogel could reduce the ROS level and thus inhibit the expression of the ROS-associated p38 MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Moreover , the hydrogel also significantly suppressed over-stimulated autophagy and apoptosis during I/R treatment which was responsible for mediating severe post-ischemia myocardial cell death. The results indicated that our supramolecular hydrogel was a promising biomaterial for the treatment of myocardial I/R injuries.
