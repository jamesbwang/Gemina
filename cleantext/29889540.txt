  In this study , pinning and depinning of the contact line during droplet evaporation on the rough surfaces with randomly distributed structures is theoretically analyzed and numerically investigated. A fast Fourier transformation ( FFT) method is used to generate the rough surfaces , whose skewness ( Sk) , kurtosis ( K) , and root-mean-square ( Rq) are obtained from real surfaces. A thermal multiphase LB model is proposed to simulate the isothermal pinning and depinning processes. The evaporation processes are recorded with the variations in contact angle , contact radius , and drop shape. It is found that the drops sitting on rough surfaces show different behavior from those on smoother surfaces. The former shows a pinned contact line during almost the whole lifetime. By contrast , the latter experiences a stick-slip-jump behavior until the drop disappears. At mesoscopic scale , the pinning of the contact line is actually a slow motion rather than a complete immobilization at the sharp edges. The dynamic equilibrium is achieved by the self-adjustment of the contact line according to each edge.
