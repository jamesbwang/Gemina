  To identify predictors of successful cervical ripening using double-balloon catheter ( DBC) for labor induction among women with previous cesarean delivery ( PCD) and unfavorable cervix at term. The present prospective observational study was conducted among women who underwent cervical ripening with DBC at a French tertiary care hospital between January 1 , 2014 , and December 31 , 2017. Inclusion criteria were PCD; singleton term fetus; cephalic presentation; and unfavorable cervix ( Bishop score < 6). Indications for DBC were gestational diabetes mellitus , intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy , pre-eclampsia , prolonged pregnancy , fetal growth restriction , or prenatal suspicion of macrosomia. The primary outcome was Bishop score of at least six after DBC removal. Among the 105 patients included , the initial Bishop score was 2.5 ± 1.5; successful cervical ripening occurred among 74 ( 70.5 %) women; and vaginal delivery occurred among 46 ( 43.8 %). The mean time from DBC insertion to delivery was 19.3 ± 6.7 hours. No adverse events were observed. Predictors of successful cervical ripening were initial Bishop score of at least three ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) 12.74 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.78-58.47); PCD during labor ( aOR 4.38 , 95 % CI 1.10-17.45); and internal cervical os open ( aOR 4.94 , 95 % CI 1.44-17.01). Several factors were found to predict successful cervical ripening using DBC.
