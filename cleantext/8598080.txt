  This review aims to assess the synergistic use of coronary artery calcium ( CAC) scanning and stress-rest SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI) for the workup of patients with suspected coronary artery disease ( CAD). The CAC score bears a proportional relationship to both the frequency of obstructive CAD and inducible ischemia. Consequently , the test can be used to improve the Bayesian assessment of pre-test CAD likelihood and assist in triaging patients for stress testing. The CAC score and MPI findings are synergistic for predicting cardiac risk , which increases for patients with abnormal MPI studies who also have CAC abnormality. CAC scanning also improves the diagnostic sensitivity of SPECT-MPI by identifying normal SPECT-MPI patients with subclinical atherosclerosis. Finally , CAC scanning helps improve the interpretation of borderline SPECT-MPI scan abnormalities. Combined , these findings indicate a clear benefit for incorporating CAC scanning into the diagnostic workup of patients who are candidates for the evaluation of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> symptoms<symptom> by SPECT-MPI.
