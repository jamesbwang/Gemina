  To perform radiology-pathology correlation of the inchworm sign on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) in patients with endometrial cancer. Consecutive patients ( 345) with histopathologically proven endometrial cancer who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , including DWI images , and hysterectomy were included in the present study. The inchworm sign was defined as a hypointense stalk between hyperintense endometrial cancer and hypointense myometrium on DWI images. A genitourinary pathologist reviewed the resected specimen at the site of the inchworm sign. The inchworm sign on DWI images was observed in 32 ( 9.3 %) patients. On T2-weighted images , areas of hypointense stalk on DWI images showed hypointensity in 31 ( 97 %) patients and hyperintensity in one ( 3 %). Among them , the depth of myometrial invasion at histopathology was superficial ( < 50 % myometrial invasion) in 28 ( 87.5 %) patients and deep ( â‰¥ 50 % myometrial invasion) in four ( 12.5 %). As a result of histopathological investigation , the hypointense stalk of the inchworm sign was mainly composed of various degrees of stromal proliferation , including smooth muscle cells and metaplastic fibromuscular stroma , with or without intervening endometrial cancer. The inchworm sign of endometrial cancer on DWI images usually indicated superficial myometrial invasion and was caused by a stalk composed of stromal proliferation with or without intervening endometrial cancer.
