  The therapeutic potential of cardiac μ-opioid receptors in ischaemia-reperfusion ( I/R) injury during opioid-modulating diseases , such as heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , is unknown. We aimed to explore the changes of cardiac μ-opioid receptor expression during heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and its role in opioid-induced cardioprotection. Rats received doxorubicin ( DOX) or were subjected to coronary artery ligation to induce heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , or received normal saline ( NS) as control. Hearts from NS or DOX rats were isolated and subjected to myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion in an in vitro perfusion system. The opioid ( D-Ala , Cardiac μ-opioid receptor mRNA concentrations were 3.2 times elevated in DOX-treated rats compared with NS rats , while cardiac μ-opioid receptor protein concentrations showed 6.1- and 3.5-fold increases in DOX-treated and post-infarcted rats , respectively. DAMGO reduced I/R-caused infarct size , expressed as the ratio of area at risk , from 0.50 ( 0.04) to 0.25 ( 0.03) in failing rat hearts , but had no effect on infarct size in control hearts. DAMGO promoted phosphorylation of ERK and glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK) -3 β only in failing hearts. DAMGO-mediated cardioprotection was blocked by an ERK inhibitor. The μ-opioid receptor antagonist D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 ( CTOP) prevented morphine- and remifentanil-induced cardioprotection and phosphorylation of ERK and GSK-3β in failing hearts. In contrast , δ- and κ-opioid receptor selective antagonists were less potent than CTOP in the failing hearts. Cardiac μ-opioid receptors were substantially up-regulated during heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , which increased DAMGO-induced cardioprotection against I/R injury.
