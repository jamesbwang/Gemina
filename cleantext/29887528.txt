  The anatomical uniqueness of Einstein 's brain is thought to be the seat of his intellectual prowess. Einstein 's brain has been reported to contain: a higher neuron/glia ratio in the left inferior parietal lobule , greater neuron density in the frontal lobe , a larger expansion of the inferior parietal lobule , complex gyrification in many parts of the cerebral cortex , and a thick corpus callosum , especially the splenium. Individual differences in brain anatomy and current brain research were used to test the validity of these assertions. The investigation concluded that the so called anatomical uniqueness of Einstein 's brain is not associated with his intellectual prowess.
