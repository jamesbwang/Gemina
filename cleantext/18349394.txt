  In clinical practice , older patients are often undertreated due to underrepresentation in clinical trials and fear of toxicity. Our objective was therefore to review toxicities that are specific to older cancer patients , to review risk factors in order to help physicians guide their decisions , and to review interventions that can be implemented in routine clinical practice to prevent toxicity induced by cancer therapies. On the whole , reviews report similar number and frequency as well as similar grade 3 or 4 adverse events between subjects older and younger than 65 years. Yet patients included in clinical trials are often not representative of real-life patients and are often fit older cancer patients. Moreover , tolerance to the additive impact of multiple adverse effects is different between older and younger patients. And specific symptoms such as stomatitis may cause a series of consequences such as dehydration<symptom> , denutrition , renal insufficiency , and adverse events of renally excreted drugs. Older patients are at high risk of toxicity due to many factors but mainly due to the prevalence of frailty in this population that has been estimated to be around 40 % increasing the risk of chemotherapy intolerance. As a consequence , interventions must be implemented according to altered domains of comprehensive geriatric assessment in order to improve anticancer tolerance. These interventions are reviewed here.
