  Papillomaviruses infect many vertebrates , including birds. Persistent infections by some strains can cause malignant proliferation of cells ( i.e. cancer) , though more typically infections cause benign tumours , or may be completely subclinical. Sometimes extensive , persistent tumours are recorded-notably in chaffinches and humans. In 2016 , a novel papillomavirus<pathogen> genotype was characterized from a duck faecal microbiome , in Bhopal , India; the sixth papillomavirus<pathogen> genotype from birds. Prompted by this finding , we screened 160 cloacal swabs and 968 faecal samples collected from 299 ducks sampled at Ottenby Bird Observatory , Sweden in 2015 , using a newly designed real-time PCR. Twenty one samples ( 1.9 %) from six individuals ( 2 %) were positive. Eighteen sequences were identical to the published genotype , duck papillomavirus<pathogen> 1. One additional novel genotype was recovered from three samples. Both genotypes were recovered from a wild strain domestic mallard that was infected for more than 60 days with each genotype. All positive individuals were adult ( P = 0.004). Significantly more positive samples were detected from swabs than faecal samples ( P < 0.0001). Sample type data suggests transmission may be via direct contact , and only infrequently , via the oral-faecal route. Infection in only adult birds supports the hypothesis that this virus is sexually transmitted , though more work is required to verify this.
