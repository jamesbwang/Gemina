  Accumulation of succinate as a fermentation product of Fusobacterium<pathogen> varium<pathogen> was enhanced when the anaerobic bacterium<pathogen> was grown on complex peptone medium supplemented with fumarate. Residual substrates and fermentation products were determined by proton NMR spectroscopy. Cells collected from the fumarate-supplemented medium ( 8-10 h after inoculation) supported the conversion of fumarate to succinate when suspended with fumarate and a co-substrate ( glucose , sorbitol , or glycerol). Succinate production was limited by the availability of fumarate or reducing equivalents supplied by catabolism of a co-substrate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas ( EMP) pathway. The choice of reducing co-substrate influenced the yield of acetate and lactate as side products. High conversions of fumarate to succinate were achieved over pH 6.6-8.2 and initial fumarate concentrations up to 300 mM. However , at high substrate concentrations , intracellular retention of succinate reduced extracellular yields. Overall , the efficient utilization of fumarate ( ≤ 400 mM) combined with the significant extracellular accumulation of succinate ( corresponding to ≥ 70 % conversion) indicated the effective utilization of fumarate as a terminal electron acceptor by F.<pathogen> varium<pathogen> and the potential of the methodology for the bioproduction of succinate.
