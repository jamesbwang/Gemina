  This prospective study was designed to validate the CompuFlo ® device and to assess its use in difficult epidural placement. In the first part of the study , 30 parturients requesting labor epidural analgesia were recruited. The block was performed by an expert anesthesiologist , with the Tuohy needle connected to the CompuFlo ® device to evaluate the agreement between the anesthesiologist 's reported sensation and the variation of pressure recorded by the CompuFlo ®. In the second part of the study , 56 consecutive parturients , for whom at least two complete needle reinsertions were made by trainees during epidural placement for labor analgesia , were enrolled. CompuFlo ® was used as a rescue tool for the subsequent attempt. In all cases epidural analgesia was successful and no complications were noted. There was a good correlation between the operator 's feelings and the delta of pressure recorded by the CompuFlo ® , for both identification of the ligamentum flavum and of the epidural space ( Rho = 0.79; tau = 0.67). In the second part of the study , all the difficult blocks performed with the CompuFlo ® were successful after a single attempt. The pressure curves of false loss-of-resistance were significantly different from the true loss-of-resistance ( P < 0.0001) DISCUSSION: CompuFlo ® was validated as a tool to identify the epidural space. It may also assist trainees in successful epidural placement in difficult cases.
