  The letter by Kraus et al. ( 2018) published recently in World Psychiatry presents diagnostic criteria for compulsive sexual behaviors ( CSBs). Here , we discuss the potential impact of including CSB disorder in ICD-11 for four areas: educational efforts related to CSB ( for both clinicians and patients) , investigation of underlying mechanisms and subtypes , development of personalized treatment frameworks , and answering socially important questions and advancing important prevention efforts and effective policies. Each of these four areas has their own challenges that should be addressed , and we briefly describe and discuss them. We hope that this information will help continue a dialog and provide a framework for moving forward in this area.
