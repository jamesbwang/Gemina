  This study used near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) to detect the pulmonary regional oxygen saturation ( rSO NIRS was used to measure the pulmonary rSO Pulmonary rSO NIRS objectively reflects the changes in oxygenation in the lung tissue. This study provides evidence for the clinical application of NIRS.
