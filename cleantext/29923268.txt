  Human genetic research has implicated functional variants of more than one hundred genes in the modulation of persisting pain. Artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques may combine this knowledge with results of genetic research gathered in any context , which permits the identification of the key biological processes involved in chronic sensitization to pain. Based on published evidence , a set of 110 genes carrying variants reported to be associated with modulation of the clinical phenotype of persisting pain in eight different clinical settings was submitted to unsupervised machine-learning aimed at functional clustering. Subsequently , a mathematically supported subset of genes , comprising those most consistently involved in persisting pain , was analysed by means of computational functional genomics in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase. Clustering of genes with evidence for a modulation of persisting pain elucidated a functionally heterogeneous set. The situation cleared when the focus was narrowed to a genetic modulation consistently observed throughout several clinical settings. On this basis , two groups of biological processes , the immune system and nitric oxide signalling , emerged as major players in sensitization to persisting pain , which is biologically highly plausible and in agreement with other lines of pain research. The present computational functional genomics-based approach provided a computational systems-biology perspective on chronic sensitization to pain. Human genetic control of persisting pain points to the immune system as a source of potential future targets for drugs directed against persisting pain. Contemporary machine-learned methods provide innovative approaches to knowledge discovery from previous evidence. We show that knowledge discovery in genetic databases and contemporary machine-learned techniques can identify relevant biological processes involved in Persitent pain.
