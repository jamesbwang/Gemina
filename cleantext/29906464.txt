  Danger-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs) play a proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of airway obstructive diseases such as severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytosolic multiprotein platform that activates the caspase-1 pathway in response to inflammatory stimuli such as DAMPs. ATP and S100 proteins are newly identified DAMPs that accumulate in inflamed airways. We previously demonstrated that S100A8 , S100A9 , and S100A12 induce production and secretion of MUC5AC , a major mucin in the conducting airway mucosa. The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in , and the contribution of ATP to , S100 protein-induced MUC5AC production by NCI-H292 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells. Stimulation with either S100A12 or ATP led to MUC5AC production at comparable levels. Simultaneous treatment with both stimuli resulted in additive increases in NLRP3 , active caspase-1 , IL-1β , NLRP3/caspase -1 colocalization , and MUC5AC. NLRP3 siRNA or inhibitors of NF-κB , NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization , or caspase-1 nearly completely inhibited ATP- and S100A12-mediated MUC5AC production. Furthermore , S100A12-as well as ATP-mediated MUC5AC production was almost equally blunted by both nonspecific and specific antagonists of the purinergic receptor P2X7 , a principal receptor mediating NLRP3 inflammasome activation by ATP. Thus , these two danger signals contribute to MUC5AC production in airway epithelial cells through overlapping signaling pathways for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
