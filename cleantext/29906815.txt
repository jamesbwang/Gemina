  Plants are sessile organisms. Therefore , they developed the capacity to quickly respond to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses , for instance by producing a broad spectrum of bioactive specialized metabolites. In this defense response , the jasmonate phytohormones can instigate a signaling cascade that leads to the specific elicitation and reprograming of numerous metabolic pathways. Recent research progress has provided several insights into the regulatory networks of many specialized metabolic pathways , mainly at the transcriptional level. Nonetheless , our view on the regulation of defense metabolism remains far from comprehensive. Here , we describe the recent advances obtained with regard to one aspect of the regulation of plant specialized metabolism , namely the posttranslational regulation of enzyme stability. We focus on terpenoid biosynthesis and in particular on the rate-limiting and well-investigated enzyme of the terpenoid precursor pathway , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase ( HMGR). There are clear similarities , as well as important mechanistic differences , among the components involved in the posttranslational regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis via HMGR in plants , yeasts , and mammals. Furthermore , in plants , several of these components evolved to respond to specific signaling cues. Indeed , the elements of the plant endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation ( ERAD) and ER stress-associated processes can be induced upon environmental stresses and during specific developmental processes , thereby allowing a unique posttranslational regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis pathways.
