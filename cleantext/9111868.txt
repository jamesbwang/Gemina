  Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone tumors. Insulin Growth Factor 1 receptor ( IGFR1) has been known as a prognostic factor for metastasis of osteosarcoma. ABC subfamily G member2 ( ABCG2) is related to resistance to anti-cancer drug , and CD44 has a role in tumor growth and metastasis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship among expression patterns of IGF1R , ABCG2 , and CD44 in osteosarcoma. The expression levels of IGF1R , ABCG2 , and CD44 proteins were determined in tissue arrays containing osteosarcoma tissues from 59 osteosarcoma patients. The expression pattern of IGF1R was highly correlated with the expression pattern of ABCG2 ( r = 0.88) in overall osteosarcoma patients. According to pathological types , the expression pattern of IGF1R showed the higher correlation with ABGC2 ( r = 0.90) and CD44 ( r = 0.61) in osteoblatic type than in chondroblastic type. According to gender with pathologic type , the correlation between the expression patterns of IGF1R and CD44 was higher in male with osteoblatic type than in female with osteoblatic type. Among different age groups , the 1-10 years age group showed higher correlation in IGF1R versus CD44 ( r = 0.90) and ABCG2 versus CD44 ( 0.80) than in other age groups. These results showed that the expression of IGF1R appears to be highly correlated with the expression of ABCG2 in osteosarcoma and with the expression of CD44 in osteosarcoma patients under age of 10 , which suggests that ABCG2 and CD44 can be used as prognostic factors with IGF1R for specific prognosis and efficient treatment of osteosarcoma.
