  An enzyme-free titer plate-based colorimetric assay utilizing functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs) entrapping pH-indicator molecules has been developed. Pores in the silica nanoparticles were functionalized with phenyltrimethyloxysilane so that pH indicator molecules ( thymolphthalein or TP in the present case) can be tightly entrapped through π-π conjugation. To detect prostate specific antigen ( PSA) , the TP-containing MSNs were coated with polyethylenimine ( PEI) , which favors the attachment of the negatively charged secondary anti-PSA antibody. The entrapped thymolphthalein molecules can be readily released from the pores with a simple addition of alkaline solution. The resultant bifunctional MSNs were used for signal-amplified detection of PSA captured by the primary antibody preimmobilized in the wells of a plate. Our method possesses a wide dynamic range ( 0.5 to 8000 pg/mL) wherein the adsorption of the bifunctional MSNs obeys a modified Langmuir isotherm. A detection limit ( LOD) down to as low as 0.36 pg/mL can be attained. Owing to the size uniformity of the MSNs and the obviation of enzyme molecules employed in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , excellent reproducibility ( RSD = 1.12 %) was achieved. The selective detection of PSA in human serum samples demonstrates the amenability of our method to detect important biomarkers in complex biological samples , whereas the performance of the assay in a titer plate ensures high throughput and obviates the use of expensive instruments. Both of these features are prerequisites for clinical settings wherein a great number of samples need to be analyzed in a timely fashion.
