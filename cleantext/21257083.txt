  The incorporation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) is essential for generating in vitro models that truly represent the microarchitecture found in human tissues. However , the cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in vitro remains poorly understood in placental trophoblast biology. We investigated the effects of varying the surface properties ( surface thickness and stiffness) of two ECMs , collagen I and Matrigel , on placental trophoblast cell morphology , viability , proliferation , and expression of markers involved in differentiation/syncytial fusion. Most notably , thicker Matrigel surfaces were found to induce the self-assembly of trophoblast cells into 3D spheroids that exhibited thickness-dependent changes in viability , proliferation , syncytial fusion , and gene expression profiles compared to two-dimensional cultures. Changes in F-actin organization , cell spread morphologies , and integrin and matrix metalloproteinase gene expression profiles , further reveal that the response to surface thickness may be mediated in part through cellular stiffness-sensing mechanisms. Our derivation of self-assembling trophoblast spheroid cultures through regulation of ECM surface alone contributes to a deeper understanding of cell-ECM interactions , and may be important for the advancement of in vitro platforms for research or diagnostics.
