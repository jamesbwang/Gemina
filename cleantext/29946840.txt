  As one kind of cheap , environmentally-friendly and efficient treatment materials for direct control of cyanobacterial blooms , modified clays have been widely concerned. The present study evaluated cyanobaterial removal by a red soil-based flocculant ( RSBF) with a large enclosure experiment in a tropical mesotrophic reservoir , in which phytoplankton community was dominated by Microcystis spp. and Anabaena spp.. The flocculant was composed of red soil , chitosan and FeCl
