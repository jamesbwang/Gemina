  Dispositional emotion regulation is related to the severity and maintenance of depressive symptoms. However , whether emotion regulation specific to an event highly central for an individual 's identity is predictive of depressive symptoms has not been examined. Nonclinical participants ( N = 220) reported the extent to which they employed a selection of emotion regulation strategies when recalling low- and high-centrality events. Dispositional emotion regulation and depressive symptoms were also assessed. A 7-week follow-up was conducted. High-centrality events were associated with more emotion regulation efforts. Greater brooding and expressive suppression in relation to high-centrality memories predicted concurrent depressive symptoms after controlling for event valence and dispostional emotion regulation. Effects were absent for low-centrality memories. Emotion regulation in response to high-centrality memories did not predict depressive symptoms at follow-up beyond baseline depressive symptoms. Overall , the findings showed that maladaptive emotion regulation in response to memories of high-centrality events is important for explaining depressive symptomatology.
