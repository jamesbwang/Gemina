  The VenaTech LGM ( B. Braun , Melsungen , Germany) inferior vena cava ( IVC) filter was designed as a permanent IVC filter to prevent clot migration and pulmonary embolism. This filter has been discontinued , but thousands remain implanted within patients who incur the added long-term risks of an indwelling IVC filter. We present a case of successful removal of a permanent VenaTech LGM IVC filter using a novel technique in a patient in whom filter placement was no longer indicated. The conical portion of the filter was removed intact , and the vertical struts were intentionally left embedded extravascularly within the caval wall.
