  Chondrosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of cartilage commonly arising in the pelvis , proximal femur , and humerus , but quite uncommon in the small bones of the hand. Although limited surgical procedures such as curettage are mentioned as a management option in low-grade chondrosarcomas , they tend to have a high rate of recurrences. Hence , wide excision is recommended as a treatment option even in low-grade chondrosarcomas of the hand.
