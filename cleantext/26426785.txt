  Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. We previously reported the identification of a new genetic marker , cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 ( CRABP2) , in lung cancer tissues. The aim of this study was to assess plasma levels of CRABP2 from patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Blood samples that were collected from 122 patients with NSCLC between September 2009 and September 2013 were selected for the analysis , along with samples from age- ( ± 5 years) , sex- , and cigarette smoking history ( ± 10 pack-years ( PY))- matched controls from the Korea Biobank Network. The control specimens were from patients who were without malignancies or pulmonary diseases. We measured plasma levels of CRABP2 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The mean age of the NSCLC patients was 71.8 ± 8.9 years , and the median cigarette smoking history was 32 PY ( range , 0-150 PY). Plasma CRABP2 levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLC than in the matched controls ( 37.63 ± 28.71 ng/mL vs. 24.09 ± 21.09 ng/mL , Plasma CRABP2 levels might be a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in NSCLC.
