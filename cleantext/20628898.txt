  The indigenous health care system continues in the postcolonial era to be perceived by antagonists as a threat to Western medicine. It has been associated with ` witchcraft ' , actively discouraged and repressed through official government prohibition laws. Despite that , human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> and acquired immunodeficiency<pathogen> syndrome<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen> and AIDS) patients consult both allopathic and indigenous health practitioners. The study explored a collaboration model between allopathic and traditional health practitioners in the management of patients living with HIV<pathogen> and AIDS in postcolonial South Africa. We conducted six combined focus group discussions and four separate group discussions with each category of co-researchers. Combined and separate focus group discussions were conducted with community members , allopathic and indigenous health practitioners , applying the cyclical method in the decolonisation process. Their perceptions and experiences in the management of HIV<pathogen> and AIDS patients were explored , and finally decolonisation strategies suitable for collaboration in their context were identified. The two health systems were rendering services to the same HIV<pathogen> and AIDS communities.Lack of communication created confusion.<pathogen> Collaboration was long overdue. A change in mindsets , attitudes and practices among practitioners was critical , with an acknowledgementthat ` neither health system is better than the other , but the two should be complementary , recognising that the culture and beliefs of patients influence their health-seeking behaviour '. Co-researchers were committed to working together in the fight against HIV<pathogen> and AIDS infections.<pathogen> Their model for collaboration addresses the challenges of patients ' secrecy , treatment overdose and the abandonment of antiretroviral treatment. Through the application of a decolonisation process , their mindsets , attitudes and practices towards each other were changed , enabling the joint development of a custom model for collaboration between allopathic health practitioners and indigenous health practitioners in the management of patients living with HIV<pathogen> and AIDS.
