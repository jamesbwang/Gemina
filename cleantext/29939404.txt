  Rice bran polysaccharides ( RBPSs) are the major active constituents of rice bran ( RB). In this study , we utilized intracellular enzymes from Grifola frondosa to modify RBPSs , which were extracted from RB using ultrasound. To enhance the effect on natural killer ( NK) cell cytotoxicity of modified polysaccharides ( mRBPSs) generated from RBPSs , an orthogonal test ( L Rice bran polysaccharides ( RBPSs) contain compounds with many biological activities. However , these polysaccharides difficult to absorb due to high molecular weights and unexposed active sites , which are the main factors that limit their use in functional foods. The results of this study demonstrate that modification of RBPSs using intracellular enzymes from an edible fungus alters the molecular weights and monosaccharide composition of RBPSs. In addition , immune and antioxidant activities of RBPSs were increased. The findings provide a new and beneficial application for rice bran.
