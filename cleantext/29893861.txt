  The mucositis of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies was poorly understood. We conducted this systematic review to fully investigate the mucositis of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in cancer patients. EMBASE , MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for articles published till December 2017. The relevant randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. Thirty-six randomized controlled trials and 15,364 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade ( RR , 1.48; 95 % CI , 1.24-1.77; P < 0.0001) and high-grade mucositis ( RR , 2.16; 95 % CI , 1.61-2.89; P < 0.00001). The relative risk of high-grade mucositis tended to be higher in colorectal cancer patients than non-colorectal cancer patients. The available data suggested that the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies significantly increases the risk of developing mucositis. Physicians should be aware of mucositis and should monitor cancer patients when receiving anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies.
