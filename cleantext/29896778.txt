  To examine the performance of screening for preeclampsia ( PE) at 35-37 weeks ' gestation by maternal factors and combinations of mean arterial pressure ( MAP) , uterine artery pulsatility index ( UtA-PI) , serum placental growth factor ( PLGF) and serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 ( sFLT). This was a prospective observational study in women with singleton pregnancies attending for an ultrasound scan at 35 The study population of 13,350 pregnancies included 272 ( 2.0 %) that subsequently developed PE. In pregnancies that developed PE , the values of MAP , UtA-PI and sFLT were increased and PLGF was decreased. At a risk cut-off of 1 in 20 the proportion of the population stratified into high-risk was about 10 % of the total and the proportion of the cases of PE contained within this high-risk group was 28 % with screening by maternal factors alone; the detection rate increased to 53 % with the addition of MAP , 67 % with the addition of MAP and PLGF and 70 % with the addition of MAP , PLGF and sFLT. The performance of screening was not improved by the addition of UtA-PI. The performance of screening depended on the racial origin of the women; in screening by a combination of maternal factors , MAP , PLGF and sFLT and use of the risk cut-off of 1 in 20 the detection rate and screen positive rate were 66 % and 9.5 % , respectively , for Caucasian women and 88 % and 18.2 % for those of Afro-Caribbean racial origin. Screening by maternal factors and biomarkers at 35-37 weeks ' gestation can identify a high proportion of pregnancies that develop late PE. The performance of screening depends on the racial origin of the women. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
