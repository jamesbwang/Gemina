  Foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD) is a highly contagious virus that affects cloven-hoofed animals. To understand better the role of nonstructural protein 2B of the causative agent FMD virus ( FMDV) in the process of virus replication , we identified a porcine host protein , cyclophilin A ( CypA) , which interacts with FMDV 2B. The 2B-CypA interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. CypA showed antiviral functions during FMDV infection. Overexpression of CypA decreased FMDV leader protein ( L
