  There are minimal data regarding clinical outcomes and echocardiographic findings after transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement ( TMVR) compared with redo surgical mitral valve replacement ( SMVR). TMVR therapy has emerged as therapy for a degenerated bioprosthetic valve failure. The authors retrospectively identified patients with degenerated mitral bioprostheses who underwent redo SMVR or TMVR at 3 U.S. institutions. The authors compared clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of patients who had TMVR with those of patients who underwent redo SMVR. Sixty-two patients underwent TMVR and 59 patients underwent SMVR during the study period. Mean age and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality ( STS PROM) scores were significantly higher in patients with TMVR than in those with SMVR ( age 74.9 ± 9.4 years vs. 63.7 ± 14.9 years; p < 0.001; STS PROM 12.7 ± 8.0 % vs. 8.7 ± 10.1 %; p < 0.0001). Total procedure time , intensive care unit hours , and post-procedure length of stay were all significantly shorter in the TMVR group. There was no difference in mortality at 1 year between the 2 groups ( TMVR 11.3 % vs. SMVR 11.9 %; p = 0.92). Mean mitral valve pressure gradient and the grade of mitral regurgitation ( MR) were similar between the TMVR group and the SMVR group ( mitral valve pressure gradient 7.1 ± 2.5 mm Hg vs. 6.5 ± 2.5 mm Hg; p = 0.42; MR ( ≥ moderate) 3.8 % vs. 5.6 %; p = 1.00) at 30 days. At 1 year , the mitral valve pressure gradient was higher in the TMVR group ( TMVR 7.2 ± 2.7 vs. SMVR 5.5 ± 1.8; p = 0.01) , although there was no difference in the grade of MR. Despite the higher STS PROM in TMVR patients , there was no difference in 1-year mortality between the TMVR and SMVR groups. Echocardiographic findings after TMVR were similar to SMVR at 30 days. There was a statistically significant difference in mitral gradient at 1 year , though this is likely not clinically important. TMVR may be an alternative to SMVR in patients with previous mitral bioprosthetic valves.
