  Poly ( 2-oxazoline) s have been investigated for decades as biomaterials. Pioneering early work suggested that hydrophilic poly ( 2-oxazoline) s are comparable to poly ( ethylene glycol) regarding their potential as biomaterials , but the ready commercial availability of the latter has led to its meteoric rise to become the gold standard of hydrophilic synthetic biomaterials. In contrast , poly ( 2-oxazoline) s almost fell into oblivion. However , in the last decade , this family of polymers has gained much more interest in general and as biomaterials in particular. The rich chemistry and comparably straightforward synthesis of poly ( 2-oxazoline) s gives many opportunities for tailoring the properties of the resulting biomaterials , allowing the chemist to explore new conjugation chemistry , and to fine-tune the molar mass , hydrophilic-lipophilic balance<symptom> as well as architecture. Thus , the wide range of demands for various applications of biomaterials can be suitably addressed. This review aims to give a comprehensive and critical update of the development of poly ( 2-oxazoline) based biomaterials , focusing on the last 5 years , which have seen an explosive increase of interest. We believe that the research regarding this diverse family of polymers will remain strong and will keep growing , in particular after the promising first-in-human studies of a poly ( 2-oxazoline) drug conjugate. This review aims at researchers and students new to this polymer family and seasoned poly ( 2-oxazoline) experts alike and attempts to showcase how the chemical diversity of poly ( 2-oxazoline) s allows a relatively facile and broad access to biomaterials of all kinds.
