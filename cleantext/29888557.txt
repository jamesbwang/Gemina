  The impact of de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies ( DSA) on outcomes in lung transplantation is still a matter of debate. We hypothesize that differentiating DSA by persistent and transient appearance may offer an additional risk assessment. The clinical relevance of HLA-antibodies was investigated prospectively in 72 recipients with a median follow-up period of 21 months. The presence of HLA-antibodies was analysed by single antigen bead assay prior to and after ( 3 weeks , 3 , 6 , 12 and 18 months) transplantation. In 23 patients ( 32 %) de novo DSA were detected. In 10 of these patients ( 44 %) DSA persisted throughout the follow-up period whereas 13 of these patients ( 56 %) had transient DSA. There was a trend towards lower one-year-survival in DSA positive compared to DSA negative patients ( 83 % versus 94 %; p = 0.199). Remarkably , patients with persistent DSA had significantly reduced survival ( one-year survival 60 %) compared with both patients without DSA and those with transient DSA ( p = 0.005). Persistent DSA represented an independent prognostic factor for reduced overall survival in multivariate analysis ( HR 8.3 , 95 % CI 1.8-37.0; p = 0.006). Persistence of DSA during the first year after transplantation seems to be more harmful for lung allograft function than transiently detected DSA at an early stage.
