  In cases of Kümmell disease without neurologic deficit , percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty has achieved short-term favorable outcomes. In the long term , recollapse of the augmented vertebral body and aggravation of kyphosis at the index level is often reported. Owing to medical comorbidities , elderly patients are often unsuited for extensive open spine surgery under general anesthesia. A 95-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of intractable back pain and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intravertebral avascular necrosis<symptom> with fluid collection at the L4 vertebra. After postural reduction using a pillow in the supine position for 2 days , percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with bone cement augmentation was performed at the L3-5 level including L4 fracture under epidural anesthesia. Additional posterior column compression was performed to achieve restoration of spinal canal and lumbar lordosis. Severe back pain was reduced after surgery , and the patient was able to walk the day after surgery. To our knowledge , this is the first case of Kümmell disease in an extremely elderly patient in whom good clinical result was obtained after postural reduction , vertebral augmentation , and short segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation under epidural anesthesia.
