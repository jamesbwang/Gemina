  Drug resistance , accounting for therapeutic failure in the clinic , remains a major challenge to effectively manage cancer. Cyclosporin A ( CsA) can reverse multidrug resistance ( MDR) , especially resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However , the application of both drugs in cancer therapies is hampered by their poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability due to oral administration. CsA augments the potency of gefitinib ( Gef) in both Gef-sensitive and Gef-resistant cell lines. Here , we show that the simultaneous encapsulation of CsA and Gef within polyethylene glycol-
