  To describe the design and clinical use of a rotational phantom for dosimetric verification of IMRT/VMAT treatment plans using radiochromic film. A solid water cylindrical phantom was designed with separable upper and lower halves and rests on plastic bearings allowing for 360 Â° rotation about its central axis. The phantom accommodates a half sheet of radiochromic film , and by rotating the cylinder , the film can be placed in any plane between coronal and sagittal. Calculated dose planes coinciding with rotated film measurements are exported by rotating the CT image and dose distribution within the treatment planning system. The process is illustrated with 2 rotated film measurements of an SRS treatment plan involving 4 separate targets. Additionally , 276 patient specific QA measurements were obtained with the phantom and analyzed with a 2 %/ 2 mm gamma criterion. The average 2 %/ 2 mm gamma passing rate for all 276 plans was 99.3 %. Seventy-two of the 276 plans were measured with the plane of the film rotated between the coronal and sagittal planes and had an average passing rate of 99.4 %. The rotational phantom allows for accurate film measurements in any plane. With this technique , regions of a dose distribution which might otherwise require multiple sagittal or coronal measurements can be verified with as few as a single measurement. This increases efficiency and , in combination with the high spatial resolution inherent to film dosimetry , makes the rotational technique an attractive option for patient-specific QA.
