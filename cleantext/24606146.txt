  Small proteins are a new and expanding area of research. Many characterized small proteins are composed of a single hydrophobic α-helix , and the functional requirements of their limited amino acid sequence are not well understood. One hydrophobic small protein , CydX , has been shown to be a component of the cytochrome bd oxidase complex in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and is required for enzyme function. To investigate small protein sequence specificity , an alanine scanning mutagenesis on the small protein CydX was conducted using mutant alleles expressed from the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> chromosome at the wild-type locus. The resulting mutant strains were assayed for CydX function. No single amino acid was required to maintain wild-type resistance to β-mercaptoethanol. However , substitutions of 10-amino acid blocks indicated that the N-terminus of the protein was required for wild-type CydX activity. A series of double mutants showed that multiple mutations at the N-terminus led to β-mercaptoethanol sensitivity in vivo. Triple mutants showed both in vivo and in vitro phenotypes. Together , these data provide evidence suggesting a high level of functional plasticity in CydX , in which multiple amino acids may work cooperatively to facilitate CydX function.
