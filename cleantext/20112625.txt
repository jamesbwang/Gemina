  A 21 year old male with no relevant medical history presented to our Institution for further assessments of a right paracardiac mass founded on a chest X-ray. Chest computed tomography revealed a wide median defect of the diaphragm at the level of xiphoid process of the sternum , with the herniation of omental fat tissue in the mediastinum. Cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed the presence of a huge hernia originating from the foramen of Morgagni ( sterno-costal hiatus) , displacing the heart leftwards and posteriorly and compressing the right ventricle ( RV) , giving to it a tubular shape.The signal characteristics were typical of fat tissue , with hyperintense signal in T1 and T2 weighted black blood images and homogeneus signal suppression on STIR T2 black blood images. Short axis real time cine images , performed during deep inspiration , showed an early diastolic ventricular septal bounce , with flattening of the interventricular septum during mid-late diastole: they represented signs of diastolic dysfunction of the right ventricle , resembling a sort of `` pseudo-constrictive '' pathophysiological model. The patient was thus referred to surgical repair of the diaphragmatic defect.
