  OBJECTIVE The number of patients who benefit from deep brain stimulation ( DBS) for Parkinson 's disease ( PD) has increased significantly since the therapy was first approved by the FDA. Suboptimal outcomes , infection , or device failure are risks of the procedure and may require lead removal or repositioning. The authors present here the results of their series of revision and reimplantation surgeries. METHODS The data were reviewed from all DBS intracranial lead removals , revisions , or reimplantations among patients with PD over a 6-year period at the authors ' institution. The indications for these procedures were categorized as infection , suboptimal outcome , and device failure. Motor outcomes as well as lead location were analyzed before removal and after reimplant or revision. RESULTS The final sample included 25 patients who underwent 34 lead removals. Thirteen patients had 18 leads reimplanted after removal. There was significant improvement in the motor scores after revision surgery among the patients who had the lead revised for a suboptimal outcome ( p = 0.025). The mean vector distance of the new lead location compared to the previous location was 2.16 mm ( SD 1.17) , measured on an axial plane 3.5 mm below the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. When these leads were analyzed by subgroup , the mean distance was 1.67 mm ( SD 0.83 mm) among patients treated for infection and 2.73 mm ( SD 1.31 mm) for those with suboptimal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Patients with PD who undergo reimplantation surgery due to suboptimal outcome may experience significant benefits. Reimplantation after surgical<disease> infection<disease> seems feasible and overall safe.
