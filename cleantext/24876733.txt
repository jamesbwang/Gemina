  This study attempted to identify risk factors for development of post-hepatectomy hepatic failure ( PHF) and its effect on long-term survival of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. We carried out a retrospective study of 143 patients who had been diagnosed with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and who had undergone hepatectomy between 2003 and 2010. We allocated these patients to PHF and non-PHF groups , using the definition of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery , and compared the clinical factors of the two groups , using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the differences in overall survival ( OS) and recurrence-free survival ( RFS) between these groups. The PHF group comprised 19 patients ( 13.3 %); all had Grade A PHF. Independent risk factors for development of PHF were metachronous liver metastases and major hepatectomy. The differences between the PHF and non-PHF groups in OS or RFS were not statistically significant; however , the PHF group tended to have a worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between OS and the factors of poor differentiation of the primary colorectal cancer , major hepatectomy , and positive resection margin. Major hepatectomy is an important risk factor for PHF in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The pathological characteristics of the primary tumor are more important as predictors than is Grade A PHF.
