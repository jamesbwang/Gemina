  This manuscript provides an overview of therapeutic options for the problem of bleeding in a dentist 's office. Bleeding after tooth extraction is a very common finding in dental medicine and persistent blood in the mouth<symptom> is obviously uncomfortable and sometimes terrifying for the patient. Most bleedings<symptom> can be stopped simply with compression , in some cases a homeostatic therapy is necessary. For local compression , a swab with tranexamic acid is useful. If local compression is not sufficient , sutures are often an option. A very effective therapy would also be Tabotamp ® , a local hemostypticum which is placed onto the bleeding and should increase the thrombocytic aggregation. In the worst case Floseal ® , a human Thrombin , can be placed locally. It stops the bleeding very fast and sufficiently.
