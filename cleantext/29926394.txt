  In many studies of autobiographical memory , participants are asked to generate more than one autobiographical memory. The resulting data then have a hierarchical or multilevel structure , in the sense that the autobiographical memories ( Level 1) generated by the same person ( Level 2) tend to be more similar. Transferred to an analysis of the reminiscence bump in autobiographical memory , at Level 1 the prediction of whether an autobiographical memory will fall within the reminiscence bump is based on the characteristics of that memory. At Level 2 , the prediction of whether an individual will report more autobiographical memories that fall in the reminiscence bump is based on the characteristics of the individual. We suggest a multilevel multinomial model that allows for analyzing whether an autobiographical memory falls in the reminiscence bump at both levels of analysis simultaneously. The data come from 100 older participants who reported up to 33 autobiographical memories. Our results showed that about 12 % of the total variance was between persons ( Level 2). Moreover , at Level 1 , memories of first-time experiences were more likely to fall in the reminiscence bump than were emotionally more positive memories. At Level 2 , persons who reported more emotionally positive memories tended to report fewer memories from the life period after the reminiscence bump. In addition , cross-level interactions showed that the effects at Level 1 partly depended on the Level 2 effects. We discuss possible extensions of the model we present and the meaning of our findings for two prominent explanatory approaches to the reminiscence bump , as well as future directions.
