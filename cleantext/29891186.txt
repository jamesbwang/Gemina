  Reductions in quality of life ( QOL) exist among individuals with multiple sclerosis ( MS). The present investigation aimed to adopt a biopsychosocial model in examining QOL in the early stages of MS. Individuals with MS ( 34 with average to low QOL and 35 with high QOL) were compared on measures of disease symptoms , psychological functioning , personality , self-efficacy , locus of control ( LOC) , social support , and coping to determine the most salient predictors of QOL. Individuals were matched on disease course and duration. Individuals with lower QOL reported more fatigue<symptom> , sleep problems , pain , depression<symptom> , and anxiety<symptom> ( d = 0.83-1.49 , p 's < 0.001). They also reported lower levels of self-efficacy , LOC , and social support ( d = 0.75-1.50 p 's < 0.01). They indicated higher levels of neuroticism ( d = 1.31 , p < .001) and lower levels of extraversion ( d = 1.21 , p < .001) and reported greater levels of disengagement as a means of coping ( d = 0.75 , p = .002). Those with high QOL endorsed more use of adaptive coping ( d = 0.52- 0.86 , p 's < 0.05). When taken together , LOC and anxiety<symptom> were the most significant predictors , accounting for 40 % of the variance. Even early on in the illness , there exists differing levels of QOL. Identifying the psychological and social variables as well as the disease related factors is important , and in this case , may make a much greater contribution. Efforts to assure routine assessment and effective intervention aimed at these factors are warranted , particularly as an early intervention to assure maintenance/improvement in QOL among individuals with MS.
