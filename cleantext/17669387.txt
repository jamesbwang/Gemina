  Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) , an epithelial malignancy of the biliary tree , is one of the aggressive cancers with poor prognosis and unsatisfactory response to chemotherapy with acquired resistance. NAD ( P) H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1) , an antioxidant/detoxifying enzyme , plays important roles in chemo-resistance and proliferation in several cancer cells. The study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of β-eudesmol on NQO1 enhanced chemotherapeutic effects of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU) and doxorubicin ( DOX) in the high NQO1-expressing human CCA cell line , NQO1-KKU-100. In addition , the molecular events associated with the inhibition of the cell proliferation , cell migration , and induction of apoptosis were investigated. Human CCA KKU-100 cells were exposed to β-eudesmol at various concentrations. NQO1 enzyme activity and protein expression were measured by enzymatic assay and Western blot analysis , respectively. Sulforhodamine B ( SRB) assay and wound<disease> healing assay were performed to detect the inhibitory effect of β-eudesmol on cell proliferation , cell migration , and sensitivity to 5-FU and DOX. Apoptotic induction was detected by flow cytometry with annexin V/PI and DAPI nuclear staining. Caspase 3/7 activation was determined by fluorescence microscopy. The mechanism of enhanced chemo-sensitivity was evaluated by Western blot analysis. β-Eudesmol significantly suppressed NQO1 enzyme activity ( both in KKU-100 cells and cell lysates) and protein expression in KKU-100 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. β-Eudesmol exhibited potent cytotoxicity on KKU-100 cells with mean ± SD IC β-Eudesmol may serve as a potential anti-CCA candidate particularly when used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics. The mechanisms involved may be mediated via NQO1 suppression-related apoptosis pathway.
