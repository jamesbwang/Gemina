  Parents influence the foods their children consume and often provide proxy reports of this intake. One way parents exert this influence is by providing home-packed lunches. This study compared parental reports of foods packed in children 's lunches with what was actually packed and identified parental barriers and facilitators to packing lunches. Grade 3 and 4 student-parent dyads ( n = 321) in 19 elementary schools in Ontario participated. Parental reports and actual packed lunch contents were collected via self-administered surveys and direct observation , respectively. Parental barriers and facilitators were obtained through open and closed survey questions. Median portions packed were significantly higher for sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks and significantly lower for fruits , fruit juice , vegetables , milk/alternatives , and meat/alternatives than parents reported. Packing a healthy lunch was `` important/very important/of the utmost importance '' for 95.9 % of respondents , and 97.5 % perceived their nutrition knowledge as `` adequate/good/very good ''. Barriers to packing a lunch included: child 's food preferences , time , finances , allergy policies , and food safety. Nutrition resources , observing other children 's lunches , child 's input , and planning ahead were identified as facilitators. Strategies to improve packed lunches should move beyond parental nutrition knowledge and importance of lunch packing to address parental barriers and facilitators.
