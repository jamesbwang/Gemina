  The incidence rate of thoracic metastasis from breast cancer is increasing. Microwave ablation is one type of clinical therapy used to treat metastatic spine disease , although it can cause protein denaturation and immediate cell death , and coagulative necrosis<symptom> can occur. Minimally invasive open decompression is associated with lower rates of surgical complications in comparison to traditional open surgery. Therefore , it is an alternative therapeutic option for spinal metastases. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of microwave ablation with minimally invasive open decompression in the management of breast cancer patients with thoracic metastasis. This single-institution retrospective study investigated 23 cases of thoracic metastasis from breast cancer treated with combined microwave ablation and minimally invasive open decompression. Patients that presented with indications for surgery underwent surgical treatment. Data were collected for pain scores , the Frankel Grade classification system for acute spinal injury , the Karnofsky performance status ( KPS) scale and complications due to treatment. Of the 23 patients included in this study , all were successfully treated with microwave ablation and minimal invasive open decompression using our metrics. Of those , 18 patients ( 78.3 %) showed improvement in their KPS results while 5 ( 21.7 %) had alleviation of KPS. All 23 patients showed improvement in their Frankel Grade , suggesting improved neurological function following surgery. Most of the patients reported pain relief. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients. Microwave ablation combined with minimally invasive open decompression therapy for breast cancer patients with thoracic metastatic tumors is an alternative treatment that maintains or improves functional outcome in comparison to open surgery.
