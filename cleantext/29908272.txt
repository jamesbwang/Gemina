  A novel esterase , designated as EstSP was identified by function based screening from a soil metagenomic fosmid library of solar saltern of Goa. EstSP gene of 1065 bp encoding a putative esterase of 354 amino acids showing 55 % identity to esterase from gamma proteobacterium HIMB55 was identified. The enzyme EstSP belongs to family IV hormone sensitive lipase with novel sequence characteristics and a unique motif GDSGG. EstSP expressed as a His-tag fusion protein of mass 58 kDa was visualized on SDS PAGE and confirmed by Western blot analysis. The enzyme is an alkaline esterase that exhibited highest catalytic activity towards p-nitrophenyl acetate with optimum temperature 40 Â°C and pH 8.0. The catalytic efficiency and specific activity of EstSP for p-nitrophenyl acetate was 7407.4 min
