  The influence of stem sagittal alignment on clinical outcomes is unclear in total hip arthroplasty ( THA). The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between stem sagittal alignment and clinical and radiographic outcomes using 3D-CT. We performed 370 consecutive primary THAs between 2009 and 2013. After exclusion , 102 hips in 89 patients using single tapered-wedge stem were included. Mean follow-up was 4.7 years. Stem sagittal alignment was measured using CT , and patients were divided into flexion and neutral alignment groups. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were compared between two groups. Furthermore , we evaluated the anterior femoral offset and initial contact state. There were no significant differences in clinical or radiographic outcomes between two groups. CT data analysis and multiple regression analysis showed flexion alignment increased anterior femoral offset ( AFO) and Gruen zone 4 contact area. There was no significant difference in clinical or radiographic outcomes between flexion and neutral alignment of the tapered-wedge stem at an average of 4.7 years of follow-up. The increase of AFO and distal contact area in flexion alignment could affect the improvement of impingement-free range of flexion and intraoperative fracture.
