  The goal of our study was to investigate the effect of alginate on in vitro gastric digestion and sucrose release of soy protein isolate ( SPI) in model beverages. Model beverages containing 5 % w/w SPI , 0 % to 0.20 % w/w alginate , and 10 % w/w sucrose were prepared by heating the mixtures at 85 Â°C for 30 min at pH 6.0 or 7.0. Characterizations of beverages included determination of zeta potential , particle size and rheological properties. Digestion patterns and sucrose release profiles were determined during 2 hr in vitro gastric digestion using SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis , respectively. Increasing alginate concentration led to increased negative surface charge , particle size , as well as viscosity and pseudoplastic behavior; however , no phase separation was observed. SPI beverages formed intragastric gel during in vitro gastric digestion when the formulations contained alginate or at pH 6.0 without alginate. Formation of the intragastric gel led to delayed protein digestion and release of sucrose. Higher resistance to digestion and a slower sucrose release rate were exhibited at increased alginate concentration , and to a lesser extent , at pH 6.0. This suggests that electrostatic interaction between SPI and alginate that occurred when the beverages were under gastric condition could be responsible for the intragastric gelation. These results could potentially lead to the formulation of SPI beverages with functionality to lower postprandial glycemic response. The results could be used to design beverages or semi solid food products with altered digestion properties and lowered or slower glucose release.
