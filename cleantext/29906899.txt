  We investigate the dynamics of classical spins mapped as walkers in a virtual `` spin '' space using a generalized two-parameter family of spin models characterized by parameters y and z ( de Oliveira et al. , J. Phys. A 26 , 2317 ( 1993) JPHAC50305-447010.1088/ 0305-4470/26/ 10/006). The behavior of S ( x , t) , the probability that the walker is at position x at time t , is studied in detail. In general S ( x , t) ∼ t ^ (- α) f ( x/t ^ ( α)) with α ≃ 1 or 0.5 at large times depending on the parameters. In particular , S ( x , t) for the point y = 1 , z = 0.5 corresponding to the Voter model shows a crossover in time; associated with this crossover , two timescales can be defined which vary with the system size L as L ^ ( 2) logL. We also show that as the Voter model point is approached from the disordered regions along different directions , the width of the Gaussian distribution S ( x , t) diverges in a power law manner with different exponents. For the majority Voter case , the results indicate that the the virtual walk can detect the phase transition perhaps more efficiently compared to other nonequilibrium methods.
