  Vibrio<pathogen> fischeri<pathogen> bioluminescence inhibition bioassay ( VFBIA) has been widely applied for the monitoring of toxicity on account of multiple advantages encompassing shorter test duration , sensitive , cost-effective and ease of operation. Moreover , this bioassay found to be equally applicable to all types of matrices ( organic & inorganic compounds , metals , wastewater , river water , sewage sludge , landfill leachate , herbicides , treated wastewater etc.) for toxicity monitoring. This review highlights the apparent significance of Vibrio<pathogen> fischeri<pathogen> bioluminescence inhibition assay for ecotoxicological screening and evaluation of diverse chemical substances toxicity profile. The biochemical and genetic basis of the bioluminescence assay and its regulatory mechanism have been concisely discussed. The basic test protocol with ongoing improvements , widespread applications , typical advantages and probable limitations of the assay have been overviewed. The sensitivity of VFBIA and toxicity bioassays has also been compared.
