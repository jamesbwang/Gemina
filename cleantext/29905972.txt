  Physical forces are involved in the regulation of plant development and morphogenesis by translating mechanical stress into the modification of physiological processes , which , in turn , can affect cellular growth. Pollen tubes respond rapidly to external stimuli and provide an ideal system to study the effect of mechanical cues at the single-cell level. Here , pollen tubes were exposed to mechanical stress while monitoring the reconfiguration of their growth and recording the generated forces in real-time. We combined a lab-on-a-chip device with a microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS)- based capacitive force sensor to mimic and quantify the forces that are involved in pollen tube navigation upon confronting mechanical obstacles. Several stages of obstacle avoidance were identified , including force perception , growth adjustment and penetration. We have experimentally determined the perceptive force threshold , which is the force threshold at which the pollen tube reacts to an obstacle , for Lilium longiflorum and Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition , the method we developed provides a way to calculate turgor pressure based on force and optical data. Pollen tubes sense physical barriers and actively adjust their growth behavior to overcome them. Furthermore , our system offers an ideal platform to investigate intracellular activity during force perception and growth adaption in tip growing cells.
