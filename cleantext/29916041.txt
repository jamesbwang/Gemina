  The Massive Auditory Lexical Decision ( MALD) database is an end-to-end , freely available auditory and production data set for speech and psycholinguistic research , providing time-aligned stimulus recordings for 26,793 words and 9592 pseudowords , and response data for 227,179 auditory lexical decisions from 231 unique monolingual English listeners. In addition to the experimental data , we provide many precompiled listener- and item-level descriptor variables. This data set makes it easy to explore responses , build and test theories , and compare a wide range of models. We present summary statistics and analyses.
