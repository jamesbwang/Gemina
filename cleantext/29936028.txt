  Phylogenetic relationships among the taxa of Crocus series Crocus are still unclear , preventing the understanding of species diversity and the evolution of the important spice saffron ( Crocus sativus). Therefore , we analyzed sequences of two chloroplast ( trnL-trnF , matK-trnK) and three nuclear ( TOPO6 , ribosomal DNA ETS and ITS) marker regions to infer phylogenetic relationships among all species belonging to series Crocus. Our phylogenetic analyses resolved the relationships among all taxa of the series. Crocus hadriaticus and the former C. pallasii subspecies appeared polyphyletic. The latter deserve elevating the subspecies to species rank , while for C. hadriaticus a detailed study of species boundaries is necessary. Multi-locus and also genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data obtained through genotyping-by-sequencing placed C. sativus within C. cartwrightianus with no indication that other Crocus species contributed to the evolution of the triploid. Our analyses thus made an autotriploid origin of C. sativus from C. cartwrightianus very likely.
