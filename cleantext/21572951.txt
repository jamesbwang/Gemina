  Lionfish , native to reef ecosystems of the tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific , were introduced to Florida waters in the 1980s , and have spread rapidly throughout the northwestern Atlantic , Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. These invasive , carnivorous fish significantly reduce other fish and benthic invertebrate biomass , fish recruitment , and species richness in reef ecosystems. Fisheries resource managers have proposed the establishment of a commercial fishery to reduce lionfish populations and mitigate adverse effects on reef communities. The potential for a commercial fishery for lionfish is the primary reason to identify locations where lionfish accumulate sufficient amounts of ciguatoxin ( CTX) to cause ciguatera fish poisoning<disease> ( CFP) , the leading cause of non-bacterial seafood poisoning<disease> associated with fish consumption. To address this issue , an initial geographic assessment of CTX toxicity in lionfish from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico was conducted. Lionfish samples ( n = 293) were collected by spearfishing from 13 locations ( 74 sampling sites) around the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico between 2012 and 2015. The highest frequencies of lionfish containing measurable CTX occurred in areas known to be high-risk regions for CFP in the central to eastern Caribbean ( e.g. , 53 % British Virgin Islands and 5 % Florida Keys). Though measurable CTX was found in some locations , the majority of the samples ( 99.3 %) contained CTX concentrations below the United States Food and Drug Administration guidance level of 0.1 ppb Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 ( C-CTX-1) equivalents ( eq.). Only 0.7 % of lionfish tested contained more than 0.1 ppb C-CTX-1 eq. As of 2018 , there has been one suspected case of CFP from eating lionfish. Given this finding , current risk reduction techniques used to manage CTX accumulating fish are discussed.
