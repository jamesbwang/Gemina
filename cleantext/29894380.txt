  The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate a self-report questionnaire ( the Emotional Communication in Hearing Questionnaire or EMO-CHeQ) designed to assess experiences of hearing and handicap when listening to signals that contain vocal emotion information. Study 1 involved internet-based administration of a 42-item version of the EMO-CHeQ to 586 adult participants ( 243 with self-reported normal hearing ( NH) , 193 with self-reported hearing impairment but no reported use of hearing aids ( HI) , and 150 with self-reported hearing impairment and use of hearing aids ( HA)). To better understand the factor structure of the EMO-CHeQ and eliminate redundant items , an exploratory factor analysis was conducted. Study 2 involved laboratory-based administration of a 16-item version of the EMO-CHeQ to 32 adult participants ( 12 normal hearing/near normal hearing ( NH/nNH) , 10 HI , and 10 HA). In addition , participants completed an emotion-identification task under audio and audiovisual conditions. In study 1 , the exploratory factor analysis yielded an interpretable solution with four factors emerging that explained a total of 66.3 % of the variance in performance the EMO-CHeQ. Item deletion resulted in construction of the 16-item EMO-CHeQ. In study 1 , both the HI and HA group reported greater vocal emotion communication handicap on the EMO-CHeQ than on the NH group , but differences in handicap were not observed between the HI and HA group. In study 2 , the same pattern of reported handicap was observed in individuals with audiometrically verified hearing as was found in study 1. On the emotion-identification task , no group differences in performance were observed in the audiovisual condition , but group differences were observed in the audio alone condition. Although the HI and HA group exhibited similar emotion-identification performance , both groups performed worse than the NH/nNH group , thus suggesting the presence of behavioral deficits that parallel self-reported vocal emotion communication handicap. The EMO-CHeQ was significantly and strongly ( r = -0.64) correlated with performance on the emotion-identification task for listeners with hearing impairment. The results from both studies suggest that the EMO-CHeQ appears to be a reliable and ecologically valid measure to rapidly assess experiences of hearing and handicap when listening to signals that contain vocal emotion information.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
