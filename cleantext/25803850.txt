  Tumor microenvironment is fundamental for cancer progression and chemoresistance. Among stromal cells tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs) represent the largest population of infiltrating inflammatory cells in malignant tumors , promoting their growth , invasion , and immune evasion. M2-polarized TAMs are endowed with the nitric oxide ( NO)- generating enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS). NO has divergent effects on tumors , since it can either stimulate tumor cells growth or promote their death depending on the source of it; likewise the role of iNOS in cancer differs depending on the cell type. The role of NO generated by TAMs has not been investigated. Using different tumor models
