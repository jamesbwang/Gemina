  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> is a serious public health problem affecting hundreds of millions of elderly people worldwide , which is difficult to be treated by traditional methods because of the peculiarity of skeletal system and liver damage caused by high-dose administration. In this research , a porous drug release system has been attempted to encapsulate rifampicin ( RIF) into poly ( ε-caprolactone) ( PCL) microspheres to improve the efficacy and benefit of anti-tuberculosis drug in skeletal system. The microspheres prepared by two different methods , oil-in-oil ( o/o) emulsion solvent evaporation method and oil-in-water ( o/w) method , were characterized in terms of morphology , size , encapsulation efficiency , drug distribution , degradation , and crystallinity. The microspheres exhibited a porous structure with evenly drug distribution prepared by o/o emulsion solvent evaporation method , and their diameter ranged from 50.54 to 57.34 μm. The encapsulation efficiency was up to 61.86 % when drug-loading content was only 1.51 % , and showed a little decrease with the drug-loading content increasing. In vitro release studies revealed that the drug release from porous microspheres was controlled by non-Fickian diffusion , and almost 80 % of the RIF were completely released after 10 days. The results of RIF-loaded microspheres on the antibacterial activity against It was an efficient way to entrap slightly water-soluble drug like RIF into PCL by o/o emulsion solvent evaporation method with uniform drug distribution. The RIF-loaded porous PCL microspheres showed the combination of good antimicrobial properties and excellent cytocompatibility , and it could generate gentle environment by PCL slow degradation.
