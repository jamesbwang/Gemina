  There is limited literature on Mycobacterium<pathogen> abscessus<pathogen> infections in children and limited data about its diagnosis and management. The incidence of infections due to M abscessus<pathogen> appears to be increasing in certain populations and can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.Management of these infections is challenging and relies on combination antimicrobial therapy and debridement of diseased tissue , depending on the site and extent of disease. Treatment regimens often are difficult to tolerate , and the antimicrobials used can cause significant adverse effects , particularly given the long duration of therapy needed.This review summarizes the literature and includes information from our own institution 's experience on pediatric M abscessus<pathogen> infections including the epidemiology , transmission , clinical manifestations , and the management of these infections. Adult data have been used where there are limited pediatric data. Further studies regarding epidemiology and risk factors , clinical presentation , optimal treatment , and outcomes in children are necessary.
