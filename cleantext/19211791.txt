  Vaccines against a variety of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> have been developed and tested. Although there have been some notable successes , most are less than optimal or have failed outright. There has been discussion about whether either B cells or dendritic cells ( DCs) could be useful for the development of antimicrobial vaccines with the production of high titers of antibodies. Invariant ( i) NKT cells have direct antimicrobial effects as well as adjuvant activity , and iNKT-stimulated antigen-presenting cells ( APCs) can determine the form of the ensuing humoral and cellular immune responses. In fact , upon activation by ligand , iNKT cells can stimulate both B cells and DCs as
