  Obesity and insulin resistance are characterized by metabolic inflexibility , a condition described as an inability to switch from fat oxidation during fasting to carbohydrate oxidation during hyperinsulinemia. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of metabolic flexibility in 103 obese ( 37-59 % fat) , sedentary ( VO Insulin sensitivity ( M) and metabolic flexibility via an 80 mU/m Metabolic flexibility correlated inversely with glucose Metabolic flexibility is related to insulin sensitivity and insulin 's action on LPL. Furthermore , metabolic flexibility and insulin suppression of skeletal muscle LPL activity increase with AEX + WL in overweight and obese , sedentary older women.
