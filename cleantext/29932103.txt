  Monitoring nitric oxide at the trace level is required in a large range of applications. We report on a trace gas analyzer optimized for nitric oxide measurements by Optical Feedback Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy with an interband cascade laser at 5.3 & micro; m. The short response time of the instrument allows for reaching the level of 50 ppt in only 180 ms. Its stability enables averaging up to 12 min to reach a detection limit of 0.9 ppt. Absolute concentration calibration requires to account for the optical saturation effect that results from the intense absorption line intensity addressed here , in the mid infrared region , in contrast to instruments that are operating in the near infrared region.
