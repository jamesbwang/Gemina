  The expression of programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) is considered a predictive biomarker of anti-programmed death 1 ( PD-1)/ PD-L1 cancer therapies. However , changes in PD-L1 expression of tumor cells during clinical courses have not been fully evaluated. We evaluated changes in PD-L1 expression for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients who received anticancer treatments during clinical courses. In 76 NSCLC patients , PD-L1 expression was evaluated before and after anticancer treatment by immunohistochemical ( IHC) analysis using an anti-PD-L1 antibody. We defined two cut-off points of PD-L1 expression ( 1 and 50 %) and three corresponding IHC groups ( A: 0 % , B: 1-49 % , and C: â‰¥ 50 %). IHC group B and C were considered to be positive expression , and we defined the difference of IHC group between pre- and post-treatment as ` major change ' in PD-L1 expression. Before anticancer treatment , PD-L1 expression was observed in 38/76 ( 50 %) patients , and was significantly less common in patients harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( EGFR) than in those without ( P = 0.039). After anticancer treatment , PD-L1 expression was observed in 36/76 ( 47 %) patients. Major increases in PD-L1 expression were seen in 11 ( 14 %) , and major decreases in 18 ( 24 %) patients. Among 13 patients harboring EGFR mutations treated with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI) , five ( 38 %) showed major increases. Major changes of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells were observed in 38 % of NSCLC patients who received anticancer treatments. And , treatments with EGFR-TKI may increase PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations.
