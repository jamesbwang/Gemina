  We review the prevalence , predictability , prognosis , and preventability of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and associated cardiogenic brain embolism , focusing on ` silent ' subclinical atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( SCAF) which is very common in the elderly , and associated with significantly increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular mortality. The current paradigm treats atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> once discovered by its symptoms , complications ( stroke) or by chance , and screening recommendations are limited to opportunistic pulse palpation. We argue that the marked incidence of SCAF in patients over 65justifies a much more active approach to identify patients at a particularly high-risk by routine evaluation of readily-available clinical , electrocardiographic , echocardiographic and laboratory markers. Elderly patients at high-risk need further monitoring by suitable devices ( occasionally , long-term) and treatment with DOACs once SCAF is revealed. This approach can already be adopted during clinical encounters at the general practitioner and consultant level , to decrease the substantial SCAF-associated morbidity and mortality.
