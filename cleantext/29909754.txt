  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL) is a distinct subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with unique clinical and pathological features. This study aim to design a prognostic model specifically for AITL , providing risk stratification in affected patients. A total of 115 newly diagnosed AITL patients were retrospectively analyzed. The estimated five-year overall survival ( OS) rate for all patients was 45.4 %. Multivariate analysis found prognostic factors for survival were bone<disease> marrow involvement , number of extranodal sites > 1 , and performance status > 1. We categorized three risk groups: group 1 , no adverse factor; group 2 , one factor; and group 3 , two or three factors. Five-year OS was 86.9 % for Group 1 , 46.3 % for Group 2 , and 16.2 % for Group 3 ( p < .0001). The novel prognostic model balanced the distribution of patients into different risk groups with better predictive discrimination as compared to the International Prognostic Index and Prognostic Index for PTCL , unless otherwise specified.
