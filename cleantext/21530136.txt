  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( TTC) is primarily regarded as a form of acute and transient myocardial disease with a variety of characteristic wall-motion abnormalities. Importantly , a significant portion of TTC cases generally present with variable degrees of acute left ventricular ( LV) dysfunction with or without clinical HF. On the other hand , LV dysfunction in the setting of TTC has been universally and exclusively considered as a synonym for systolic dysfunction , potentially overlooking other forms of myocardial pathologies , including transient diastolic dysfunction , in this setting. More interestingly , recent observations suggest that TTC , despite its macroscopic recovery , may not always manifest as a fully reversible phenomenon , suggesting persistence of microscopic changes at the cellular level to some degree. In clinical practice , these residual changes might largely account for the evolution of certain pathologies , including persistent diastolic dysfunction and subclinical LV dysfunction with variable symptomatology ( particularly those arising during high levels of myocardial workload , including exercise , etc.) among TTC survivors. Within this context , the present review aims to highlight various clinical patterns and implications of LV dysfunction in the setting of TTC , and to provide basic information regarding morphological and mechanistic characteristics of wall-motion abnormalities in this setting.
