  The liquid and glass states of metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) have recently become of interest due to the potential for liquid-phase separations and ion transport , alongside the fundamental nature of the latter as a new , fourth category of melt-quenched glass. Here we show that the MOF liquid state can be blended with another MOF component , resulting in a domain structured MOF glass with a single , tailorable glass transition. Intra-domain connectivity and short range order is confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and pair distribution function measurements. The interfacial binding between MOF domains in the glass state is evidenced by electron tomography , and the relationship between domain size and T
