  This study aims to investigate the adhesive performance of three different universal adhesives to repair aged composite restorations , with or without the application of silane. A hundred and twenty resin composite samples were prepared , aged and randomly divided into 6 main Groups ( single bond universal ( SBU) , All-Bond Universal ( ABU) , Futurabond U , Clearfil Tri-S Bond , Single Bond 2 , and Clearfil SE Bond) and 2 subgroups ( with or without silane). A microhybrid composite resin was placed on the aged composite surfaces and light cured. After a micro-shear bonding test , the fracture surfaces were examined under the scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey 's Among all the universal adhesives , SBU showed the highest bond strength values compared to the other two universal adhesives when used with and without silane ( Within the limitations of this study , while SBU can be safely used with and without the application of silane , Futurabond U can not be used without silane.
