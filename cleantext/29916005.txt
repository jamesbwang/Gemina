  Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is an important component in rheumatology for imaging diagnostics and therapy monitoring of inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the spine and peripheral joints. The correct selection of suitable and practical MRI protocols and sequences represents a great challenge for physicians with respect to requesting and interpreting the indications for MRI investigations. This review article provides recommendations and suggestions for MRI investigation protocols for clinical utilization and practice. New sequences are evaluated and assessed in order to generate the best possible standardized and comparable examinations for rheumatology in the future and therefore optimize the quality of radiological interventions.
