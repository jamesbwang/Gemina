  Solitary fibrous tumor ( SFT) is a relatively uncommon mesenchymal tumor , and its occurrence in the meninges is rare. We herein report what is , to the best of our knowledge , the first cytological case of meningeal SFT metastatic to the lung with immunocytochemical analysis for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 ( STAT6) , and compare the cytological characteristics to those of pleuropulmonary SFT. A 58-year-old Japanese male patient was found to have multiple nodules<symptom> in the bilateral lungs after surgery for meningeal SFT. Partial resection of the nodules<symptom> was performed , and touch smears were obtained. The Papanicolaou smear revealed cohesive hypercellular clusters of polygonal to elongated neoplastic cells with scant cytoplasm and oval to short spindle-shaped nuclei with nucleoli containing coarse chromatin. Mild-to-moderate nuclear pleomorphism was observed. No collagenous stroma was noted. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the neoplastic cells diffusely expressed STAT6. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diagnosis of meningeal SFT metastatic to the lung. Moreover , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the lung tumor harbored
