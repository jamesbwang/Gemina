  To evaluate 2-year choroidal changes in eyes with birdshot retinochoroiditis ( BRC). Thirteen patients ( 26 eyes) with BRC were prospectively evaluated during a 2-year period with standard automated perimetry ( SAP) , fluorescein angiography , indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography ( Spectralis Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph + optical coherence tomography). Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography was performed. Eight patients ( 61 %) were females; the patients mean age was 60 ± 4.7 ( range 49-66) years. At baseline , best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) was 0.08 ± 0.2 and foveal sensitivity threshold ( FST) at SAP was 34.04 ± 2.6; at 2-year visit , no significant changes were observed ( BCVA 0.06 ± 02 , p = 0.1 and FST 34.36 ± 2.6 , p = 0.1). In all cases , at the 2-year visit , a significant reduction of choroidal thickness was present only at the fovea ( p = 0.01). The rate of foveal choroidal thinning was 1.8 ± 1.6 µm per month. When compared to baseline , suprachoroidal fluid ( SCF) was more frequent ( 42.3 vs. 23 %; p = 0.002). The amount of foveal choroidal thinning was associated with the presence of SCF at baseline ( p = 0.005). In patients with BRC , foveal choroidal thinning and increase of SCF at 2-year follow-up can be observed , even in the absence of visual loss.
