  Clinical cancer treatments nowadays still face the challenge of recurrence due to the residual cancer cells and minute lesions<symptom> in surgeries or chemotherapies. To effectively address the problem , we introduce a strategy for constructing cancer cell nuclear-targeted copper sulfide nanoparticles ( NPs) with a significant photothermal effect to completely kill residual cancer cells and prevent local cancer recurrence. The NPs could directly target the tumor cells and further enter the nucleus by the surface modification of RGD and TAT peptides. Under the irradiation of 980 nm near-infrared laser , the NPs rapidly increase the temperature of the nucleus , destroy the genetic substances , and ultimately lead to an exhaustive apoptosis of the cancer cells. In vivo experiments show that the designed NPs could effectively treat cancer and prevent the return of cancer with a single laser irradiation for 5 min. The photothermal therapy strategy with nuclear targeting for cancer therapy and anti-recurrence will provide more possibilities to develop efficient platforms for treating cancer.
