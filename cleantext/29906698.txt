  This study compared the frontal lobe functioning and anger rumination between patients with epilepsy and healthy individuals. The second objective was to examine the efficacy of levetiracetam therapy on frontal lobe dysfunctions and anger rumination in patients with epilepsy. Participants ( 50 patients with epilepsy and 50 healthy individuals) completed the Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB) and Anger Rumination Scale ( ARS). The patients had two testing sessions: pre- and post-levetiracetam therapies. The results showed that patients with epilepsy had frontal lobe dysfunctions in contrast with healthy individuals. Patients with epilepsy had higher anger rumination than healthy individuals. Compared with baseline performance , frontal lobe dysfunctions and anger rumination were significantly reduced after three months of levetiracetam therapy in patients with epilepsy. It is concluded that levetiracetam therapy may be beneficial in improving frontal lobe functioning and anger rumination thought pattern in patients with epilepsy. However , further studies are required to confirm this evidence.
