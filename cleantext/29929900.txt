  Since the inception of clinical VCA almost two decades ago , burn victims have been identified as immunologically complex patients owing to preformed HLA antibodies. However , it remains unclear whether the detected HLA antibodies are the result of former alloantigenic events or if their de novo formation occurs during primary burn care. Patients with burns > 20 % of total body surface area ( TBSA) admitted to Zurich Burn Centre between May 2015 and September 2016 were screened for HLA antibodies at admission and 6 months post trauma. The influence of glycerol-preserved donor skin and red blood cell transfusion on HLA antibody formation was investigated. Thirty-seven patients ( 7 females and 30 males) with an average age of 45.2 ± 19.1 years and average affected TBSA of 38.5 % ± 18.9 % were screened for HLA antibodies. Five patients ( 13.5 %) showed preformed HLA antibodies at admission. Only 3 patients demonstrated verified de novo sensitization during acute burn care. Six patients treated with donor skin and blood transfusions showed no occurrence of HLA antibodies after 6 months. One patient died after 2 weeks due to infectious and thromboembolic complications- however , HLA antibodies were already detected. Formation of HLA antibodies during acute burn care might be lower than that previously expected by using glycerol-preserved donor skin and restrictive administration of blood products. Modern concepts of burn care may contribute to a revised outlook on burn patients as potential candidates for VCA.
