  To investigate the biomechanical properties of the ex vivo human cornea after flap-based versus cap-based laser refractive surgery in the same donor. In this experimental study , 11 pairs of human corneas<symptom> unsuitable for transplantation were equally divided into two groups. Corneas<symptom> from the right eye were treated with femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK ( FSLASIK) and corneas<symptom> from the left eye with small incision lenticule extraction ( SMILE). Pachymetry was measured in each eye directly before laser refractive surgery. All corneas<symptom> were subjected to a refractive correction of -10.00 diopters ( D) sphere and -0.75 D cylinder at 0 ° with a 7-mm zone , using either a 110-μm flap ( FS-LASIK) or 130-μm cap ( SMILE). For two-dimensional biomechanical measurements , corneoscleral buttons underwent two testing cycles ( preconditioning stress-strain curve from 0.03 to 9.0 N and stress-relaxation at 9.0 N during 120 sec) to analyze the elastic and viscoelastic material properties. The effective elastic modulus was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with a confidence interval of 95 %. In stress-strain measurements , the effective elastic modulus was 1.47 times higher ( P = .003) after SMILE ( median = 8.22 ( interquartile range = 4.76) MPa) compared to FS-LASIK ( median = 5.59 ( inter-quartile range = 2.77) MPa). The effect size was large ( r = 0.83). No significant differences ( P = .658) were observed among stress-relaxation measurements , with a mean remaining stress of 181 ± 31 kPa after SMILE and 177 ± 26 kPa after FS-LASIK after relaxation. Compared to a flap-based procedure such as FS-LASIK , the SMILE technique can be considered superior in terms of biomechanical stability , when measured experimentally in ex vivo human fellow eye corneas<symptom>.
