  There are various guidelines for the treatment of obesity , and thus the quality of these clinical guidelines has become a matter of concern. The objective was to describe and assess the quality of clinical guidelines for treatment of obesity in adults. We collected several studies , dated from 1998 to 2016 , produced by different countries. The literature search included the National Guideline Clearinghouse ( NGC) , Guidelines International Network ( GIN) , PubMed ( MEDLINE) , Scopus , Web of Science , webpages of health institutions from different countries , and search sites , with the criterion: `` clinical guidelines for treatment of obesity in adults and published until the 2016 ''. The guidelines were assessed with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation ( AGREE II) , according to the domains of the instrument. The search identified 21 guidelines: nine from Europe , six from North<pathogen> America , three from Latin America , and one each from Asia and Oceania and a transnational association. The Australian guideline had the best assessment. Of the six guidelines with the highest scores , five had been elaborated by the government sector responsible for the country 's health. The domains `` scope and purpose '' and `` clarity of presentation '' had the highest score. Except for the Canadian guideline , the three guidelines drafted before the elaboration of AGREE II had the worst quality. In the domain `` stakeholder involvement '' , only four guidelines ( Australia , Scotland , France , and England) mentioned patient participation. Guideline development and quality enhancement are ongoing processes requiring systematic appraisal of the guideline production process and existing guidelines.
