  Genetic mutations in genes within and outside of the trypsin-dependent pathologic pathway have been found to be associated with chronic pancreatitis<disease> This review highlights recent developments. CTRB1-CTRB2 has been identified as a new risk locus for chronic pancreatitis<disease> and the disease mechanism may involve trypsin degradation. Misfolding mutations in PRSS1 , CPA1 , and CEL , as well as environmental stress factors like tobacco and alcohol can trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ER-Stress). Protein misfolding as well as enzyme activity changes due to altered autoactivation , intracellular degradation , or enzyme inhibition represent the most important pathological mechanisms of chronic pancreatitis<disease> to date. Analysis of composite risk patterns by next-generation sequencing will help elucidate complex gene interactions and identify new potential therapeutic targets.
