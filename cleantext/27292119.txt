  We report here the complete genome sequence of an atypical porcine pestivirus ( APPV). The virus strain JX-JM01-2018A01 was isolated from the Jiangxi Province , China , from a sucking piglet. This genome sequence will contribute to the understanding of APPV genetic divergence and promote future disease control and vaccine research and development in China.
