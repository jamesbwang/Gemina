  The hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations is suitable to describe a magnetized plasma at scales on the order of or larger than proton kinetic scales. An exact stationary solution is presented by revisiting previous results with a uniform-density shear flow , directed either parallel or perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field , and by adapting the solution to the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model. A quantitative characterization of the equilibrium distribution function is provided by studying both analytically and numerically the temperature anisotropy and gyrotropy and the heat flux. In both cases , in the shear region , the velocity distribution significantly departs from local thermodynamical equilibrium. A comparison between the time behavior of the usual `` fluidlike '' equilibrium shifted Maxwellian and the exact stationary solutions is carried out by means of numerical simulations of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell equations. These hybrid equilibria can be employed as unperturbed states for numerous problems which involve sheared flows , such as the wave propagation in an inhomogeneous background and the onset of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
