  Insects can dramatically change their outer morphology at molting. To prepare for this drastic transformation , insects generate new external organs as folded primordia under the old cuticle. At molting , these folded primordia are physically extended to form their final outer shape in a very short time. Beetle horns are a typical example. Horn primordia are derived from a flat head epithelial sheet , on which deep furrows are densely added to construct the complex folded structure. Because the 3D structure of the pupa horn is coded in the complex furrow pattern , it is indispensable to know how and where the furrows are set. Here , we studied the mechanism of furrow formation using dachsous ( ds) gene knocked down beetles that have shorter and fatter adult horns. The global shape of the beetle horn primordia is mushroom like , with dense local furrows across its surface. Knockdown of ds by RNAi changed the global shape of the primordia , causing the stalk region become apparently thicker. The direction of cell division is biased in wildtype horns to make the stalk shape thin and tall. However , in ds knocked down beetles , it became random , resulting in the short and thick stalk shape. On the other hand , a fine and dense local furrow was not significantly affected by the ds knockdown. In developing wildtype horn primordia , we observed that , before the local furrow is formed , the apical constriction signal emerged at the position of the future furrow , suggesting the pre-pattern for the fine furrow pattern. According to the results , we propose that development of complex horn primordia can be roughly divided to two distinct processes , 1) development of global primordia shape by anisotropic cell division , and 2) local furrow formation via actin-myosin dependent apical constriction of specific cells.
