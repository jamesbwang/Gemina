  Organic crystals frequently adopt multiple distinct polymorphs exhibiting different properties. The ability to predict not only what crystal forms might occur , but under what experimental thermodynamic conditions those polymorphs are stable would be immensely valuable to the pharmaceutical industry and others. Starting only from knowledge of the experimental crystal structures , this study successfully predicts the methanol crystal polymorph phase diagram from first-principles quantum chemistry , mapping out the thermodynamic regions of stability for three polymorphs over the range 0-400 K and 0-6 GPa. The agreement between the predicted and experimental phase diagrams corresponds to predicting the relative polymorph free energies to within âˆ¼ 0.5 kJ mol
