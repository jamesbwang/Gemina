  This study compared the impact of controlled tile drainage ( CD) and freely draining ( FD) systems on the prevalence and quantitative real-time PCR-based enumeration of four major pathogens including Arcobacter<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> , Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> , Campylobacter<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> in tile- and groundwater following a fall liquid swine manure ( LSM) application on clay loam field plots. Although the prevalence of all target pathogens were detected in CD and FD systems , the loads of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> , C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> , and C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were significantly lower in CD tile-water ( p < 0.05) , in relation to FD tile-water. However , concentrations of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> were significantly greater in CD than FD tile-water ( p < 0.05). In shallow groundwater ( 1.2 m depth) , concentrations of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> , C.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and H pylori showed no significant difference between CD and FD plots , while C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> concentrations were significantly higher in FD plots ( p < 0.05). No impact of CD on the H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> was observed since quantitative detection in tile- and groundwater was scarce. Although speculative , H pylori occurrence may have been related to the application of municipal biosolids four years prior to the LSM experiment. Overall , CD can be used to help minimize off-field export of pathogens into surface waters following manure applications to land , thereby reducing waterborne pathogen exposure risks to humans.
