  A series of phosphonic acid analogues of phenylglycine variously substituted in phenyl ring have been synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity towards potato l-phenylalanine ammonia<pathogen> lyase. Most of the compounds appeared to act as moderate ( micromolar) inhibitors of the enzyme. Analysis of their binding performed using molecular modeling have shown that they might be bound either in active site of the enzyme or in the non-physiologic site. The latter one is located in adjoining deep site nearby the to the entrance channel for substrate into active site.
