  To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy ( PELD) in treatment of buttock pain associated with lumbar disc herniation. Between June 2015 and May 2016 , 36 patients with buttock pain associated with lumbar disc herniation were treated with PELD. Of 36 cases , 26 were male and 10 were female , aged from 18 to 76 years ( mean , 35.6 years). The disease duration ranged from 3 months to 10 years ( mean , 14 months). The location of the pain was buttock in 2 cases , buttock and thigh in 6 cases , buttock and the ipsilateral lower extremity in 28 cases. Thirty-four patients had single-level lumbar disc herniation , and the involved segments were L All patients were successfully operated and the operation time was 27-91 minutes ( mean , 51 minutes). There was no nerve root injury , dural tear , hematoma formation , or other serious complications. The hospitalization time was 3-8 days ( mean , 5.3 days). All incisions healed well and no infection occurred. Patients were followed up 12-24 months ( median , 16 months). MRI examination results showed that the dural sac and nerve root compression were sufficiently relieved at 3 months after operation. Patients obtained pain relief after operation. The postoperative VAS scores of buttock pain at 1 month , 3 months , 6 months , and last follow-up were 1.1 ± 0.6 , 0.9 ± 0.3 , 1.0 ± 0.3 , and 0.9 ± 0.4 respectively , showing significant differences when compared with preoperative VAS scores ( PELD can achieve satisfactory short-term results in the treatment of buttock pain associated with lumbar disc herniation and it is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgical technique.
