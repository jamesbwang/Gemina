  This paper is concerned with leaderless synchronization of coupled delayed neural networks. A distributed event-triggered control strategy under the periodic sampling scheme is introduced to reduce control updates. By introducing a weighted average state as a virtual leader , the leaderless synchronization problem can be transformed to the stability problem of the error system , which is defined as the distance between each node and the virtual leader. A leaderless synchronization criterion under the periodic event-triggered scheme in strongly connected networks is first derived based on Finsler 's lemma. The results are then extended to the network containing a directed spanning tree. A corollary with the lower dimension in the form of LMIs is further presented. Two examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
