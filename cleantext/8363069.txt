  To assess the effects of magnesium on the depth of anesthesia and to determine the effects of magnesium on incidence of awareness and postoperative pain after caesarean section. Methods: The study was designed as a double-blind , controlled , randomized study and conducted in Hacettepe University Hospital , Ankara , Turkey between January 2015 and March 2016. A total of 100 pregnant healthy women who were between 17 and 41 years old , ASA II , and scheduled for an elective cesarean section with general anesthesia were included in the study. After induction , sevoflurane was used for maintenance in Group S and desflurane in Group D ( control groups). At Group S-M and Group D-M ( study groups) , magnesium infusion was started with sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia respectively. Minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane and desflurane were kept constant. Bispectral index scores ( BIS) , fentanyl consumption and postoperative visual analogue scale ( VAS) values were recorded. All of the patients had been followed-up for awareness until the postoperative first year. Results: Demographic variables of the patients were similar. BIS values were significantly higher in control groups throughout the operation ( p less than 0.001). No significant difference was detected for intraoperative fentanyl consumption and awareness incidence. VAS values were significantly lower in study groups ( p less than 0.05). Conclusion: Magnesium infusion provided significantly lower intraoperative BIS values and lower postoperative VAS scores. We believe that magnesium can be useful as an adjuvant to general anesthesia.
