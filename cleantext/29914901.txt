  A 22-year-old woman presented with symptoms and signs consistent with acute severe asthma. After significant doses of beta-agonist , she developed a significant lactic acidosis. Significant issues arose in this patient 's history with regards to purchase of medications , compliance and follow-up with respiratory service. Beta-adrenergic receptors when stimulated have been hypothesised to increase lipolysis , producing free fatty acids , which inhibit the conversion of pyruvate to coenzyme A within the Krebs cycle. Additional pyruvate is generated through stimulation of glycolysis and glycogenolysis through simultaneous catecholamine surge. This increased pyruvate load is shunted through anaerobic glycolysis , producing increased lactate. Steroid use during an asthma attack enhances the beta-2 receptor sensitivity , further potentiating lactate production. The hyperadrenergic state in this young asthmatic likely resulted in pyruvate and therefore lactate rise and thus metabolic acidosis as mentioned before. This piece highlights a physiological phenomenon that may occur in the context of iatrogenic hyperadrenergism.
