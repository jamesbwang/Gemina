  This work was devoted to the synthesis and performance report of an optical sensing platform for dipicolinate ( DPA) , which was known as a biomarker for Bacillus<pathogen> anthracis<pathogen> spores. This DPA optical sensing platform ( denoted as EuBTC@RB) was composed of luminescent rare earth MOF and rhodamine-derived sensing probe. Its structure was discussed and confirmed by means of XRD , IR , TGA , absorption , emission and excitation spectra. EuBTC@RB showed two sensing channels for DPA , including colorimetric sensing and ratiometric fluorescent sensing. Linear response was found for both sensing channels , with LOD value of 3.4 μM. Its sensing mechanism was discussed and confirmed as the combination of an emission turn off effect caused by energy transfer process ( EuBTC → DPA pyridine) and an emission turn on effect of rhodamine molecules triggered by DPA-released protons. EuBTC@RB showed its advantage over traditional DPA optical sensing systems due to its dual sensing skills and the possibility of naked eye detection.
