  To monitor changes in time spent on pediatric physical therapy actions during a COPing With and CAring for Infants With Special Needs ( COPCA) course. Data were collected before ( T0) , during , and after ( T3) the course , which was attended by 15 Swiss physical therapists. Four treatment sessions of each therapist were video recorded and analyzed with the Groningen Observation Protocol 2.0 , allowing for quantification of relative duration of therapeutic actions. Between T0 and T3 , time spent on caregiver coaching and hands-off approaches significantly increased. The shift from caregiver trainer to family coach and the increasing hands-off techniques represent successful changes in various domains of behavior. The moderate changes in hands-off approaches suggest that changing habits requires specific attention. The COPCA course will be adapted accordingly.
