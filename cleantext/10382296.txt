  Barley chromosome 5H , carrying important QTLs for plant adaptation and tolerance to abiotic stresses , is extremely instable in the wheat genetic background and is eliminated in the early generations of wheat-barley crosses. A spontaneous wheat-barley 5HS-7DS.7 DL translocation was previously obtained among the progenies of the Mv9kr1 x Igri hybrid. The present work reports on the transfer of the 5HS-7DS.7 DL translocation into a modern wheat cultivar , Mv Bodri , in order to use it in the wheat breeding program. The comparison of the hybridization bands of DNA repeats HvT01 , pTa71 , ( GAA) n and the barley centromere-specific ( AGGGAG) n in Igri barley and the 5HS-7DS.7 DL translocation , together with the visualization of the barley chromatin made it possible to determine the size of the introgressed barley segment , which was approximately 74 % of the whole 5HS. Of the 29 newly developed PCR markers , whose source ESTs were selected from the Genome Zipper of barley chromosome 5H , 23 were mapped in the introgressed 1-0.26 FL 5HS bin , three were located in the missing C-0.26 FL region , while three markers were specific for 5HL. The translocation breakpoint was flanked by markers Hv7502 and Hv3949. A comparison of the parental wheat cultivars and the wheat-barley introgression lines indicated that the presence of the translocation improved tillering ability in the Mv9kr1 and Mv Bodri genetic background. The similar or better yield components under high- or low-input cultivation environments , respectively , indicated that the 5HS-7DS.7 DL translocation had little or no negative effect on yield components , making it a promising genotype to improve wheat genetic diversity. These results promise to accelerate functional genomic studies on barley chromosome 5H and to support pre-breeding and breeding research on wheat.
