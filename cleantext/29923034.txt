  German data regarding the economic burden of chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> ( CHC) and potential benefits of CHC treatment are limited. To address this issue , we evaluated the role of treatment in mitigating the economic burden of hepatic and extrahepatic complications ( EHCs) from CHC virus infection in Germany. This retrospective , cross-sectional study used claims data from the Betriebskrankenkasse German sickness fund ( 2007-2014) to assess the medical costs of hepatic complications and EHCs , including conditions that are prevalent and behavioral factors associated with CHC. All-cause costs , medical costs related to hepatic and EHCs , and CHC-related and non-CHC-related pharmacy costs ( adjusted to the 2016 euro rate) were calculated and compared between CHC patients ' treated ( n = 1714) and untreated time ( n = 7124) and CHC patients that initiated treatment early ( i.e. , without cirrhosis; n = 1552) vs. late ( i.e. , with cirrhosis; n = 162). CHC treatment was associated with an average adjusted savings of $ 1885 in annual all-cause medical costs per patient , with a significant proportion attributed to EHC-related cost savings ( adjusted difference , $ 1363; P < 0.01). Although initiating CHC treatment early was economically beneficial compared with initiating treatment late , the total cost savings were not significantly different ( annual average adjusted difference , $ 3831; P = 0.27). However , nearly 60 % of these savings were EHC related ( adjusted difference , $ 2255; P < 0.01). CHC is associated with a significant economic burden in Germany , largely due to EHCs. Antiviral treatment may reduce the burden of CHC and result in significant cost savings , even when initiated at earlier stages of liver disease. AbbVie Inc..
