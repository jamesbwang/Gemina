  Breast cancer cells frequently express tumor-associated antigens that can elicit immune responses to eradicate cancer. Cancer-testis antigens ( CTAs) are a group of tumor-associated antigens that might serve as ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their cancer-restricted expression and robust immunogenicity. Previous clinical studies reported that CTAs are associated with negative hormonal status , aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival. Furthermore , experimental studies have shown the ability of CTAs to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses. They also demonstrated the implication of CTAs in promoting cancer cell growth , inhibiting apoptosis and inducing cancer cell invasion and migration. In the current review , we attempt to address the immunogenic and oncogenic potential of CTAs and their current utilization in therapeutic interventions for breast cancer.
