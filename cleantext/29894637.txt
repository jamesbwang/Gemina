  Though dominating most of the practical applications , inorganic ferroelectric thin films usually suffer from the high processing temperatures , the substrate limitation , and the complicated fabrication techniques that are high-cost , energy-intensive , and time-consuming. By contrast , molecular ferroelectrics offer more opportunities for the next-generation flexible and wearable devices due to their inherent flexibility , tunability , environmental-friendliness , and easy processability. However , most of the discovered molecular ferroelectrics are uniaxial , one major obstacle for improving the thin-film performance and expanding the application potential. In this Perspective , we overview the recent advances on multiaxial molecular ferroelectric thin films , which is a solution to this issue. We describe the strategies for screening multiaxial molecular ferroelectrics and characterizations of the thin films , and highlight their advantages and future applications. Upon rational and precise design as well as optimizing ferroelectric performance , the family of multiaxial molecular ferroelectric thin films surely will get booming in the near future and inject vigor into the century-old ferroelectric field.
