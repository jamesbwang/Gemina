  Low-loss photonic crystal ( PC) mirrors exhibit positive and negative Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift ( GHS) due to the strong angular and wavelength dependencies of their reflected phase. This Letter demonstrates the existence of large positive and negative GHS in PC mirrors through theoretical , numerical , and experimental approaches. A simple algebraic relation shows that positive effective thickness yields positive ( negative) GHS for resonances that blue ( red) shift with angle , while the opposite is true for interfaces with negative effective thickness. Spatiotemporal coupled-mode theory demonstrates the above relation for simple systems with one or two resonance modes , and it also shows the existence of both positive and negative GHS. These effects are numerically and experimentally verified in complex PCs with several resonance modes.
