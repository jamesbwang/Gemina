  Sulfur ( S) is a macronutrient for the plant , which has an immense role in basic plant processes and regulation of several metabolic pathways. It has also a major role in providing protection against adverse conditions. Sulfur-containing amino acids and metabolites maintain plant cell mechanisms to improve stress tolerance. It interacts with several biomolecules such as phytohormones , polyamines , nitric oxide ( NO) , and even with other plant nutrients , which can produce some derivatives those are essential for abiotic stress tolerance. Different S derivatives stimulate signaling cascades , for the upregulation of different cellular messengers such as abscisic acid , Ca
