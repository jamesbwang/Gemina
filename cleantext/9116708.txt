  Observational studies have indicated a high but heterogeneous prevalence of low bone mineral density ( BMD) and vertebral fractures ( VF) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). Therefore , the objectives of this systematic review and meta-regression were: 1) to compare BMD between SLE patients and healthy controls and 2) to evaluate the relationship between BMD and glucocorticoid therapy and VF in SLE patients. Articles were identified from electronic databases ( PubMed , Embase , VHL , SciELO and the Cochrane Library). Prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional studies were considered for review. We evaluated the quality of the evidence included using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine ( EBM) Levels of Evidence. In total , 38 articles were identified and analyzed ( 3442 SLE cases and 6198 controls) in the analysis of BMD ( 9232 women and 408 men). There were significant differences in mean BMD between SLE patients and controls. BMD mean difference in cases/controls: -0.0566 95 % CI ( -0.071 , -0.0439; p = < 0.0001). When only SLE patients were analyzed , the BMD did not significantly differ between patients who had or had not received glucocorticoid ( GCT) therapy. 694 SLE patients were included in the analysis of VF ( 189 with VF vs. 505 without VF). Patients with VF had lower BMD than patients without VF ( BMD mean difference without VF/with VF: 0.033 ( 95 % CI: 0.006-0.060); p-value: 0.0156). Patients with SLE had lower BMD than healthy controls. Moreover , SLE patients with VF had lower BMD than patients without VF. However , our data did not show that GCT therapy had an impact on BMD.
