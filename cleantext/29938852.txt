  Hyperglycaemia , a side-effect of acute glucocorticoid exposure , is associated with poor outcome in those undergoing chemotherapy. The incidence , risk factors and diurnal profile of glucocorticoid-induced glucose dysregulation in the context of chemotherapy treatment remain incompletely understood. Blinded continuous interstitial glucose monitoring was performed on 16 women without diabetes for 24 h prior to and 5 days following carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone treatment for gynaecological cancer. At the end of the treatment period , glucose data were analysed and integrated with baseline metabolic and anthropomorphic variables. Some 15/16 ( 94 %) women exhibited elevated glucose levels ( > 11.1 mmol/l). Peak glucose levels were highest on the day of treatment ( median 14.45 mmol/l , range 10.2-22.2 mmol/l) and total time spent with an elevated interstitial glucose level was highly variable ( median 3.6 h , range 0.0-55.1 h). Peak interstitial glucose levels occurred predominantly , but not exclusively , in the afternoon ( 13.00-15.00) and evening ( 19.00-22.00); however , elevated levels were noted throughout the 24-h period. Baseline HbA These data report for the first time that high glucose levels are encountered by nearly all women following this regimen , the severity and duration of which are independently associated with HbA
