  A substituted divinylborinium cation was synthesized recently and characterized crystallographically as a gauche structure with a 153 ° C1-C2-C3-C4 dihedral angle. A full theoretical geometrical optimization of the bis ( 2-mesityl-1,2-diphenylvinyl)- borane cation shows excellent agreement with the crystal structure. However , for the parent unsubstituted divinylborinium cation , we predict a nearly 90 ° C1-C2-C3-C4 dihedral angle using the CCSD ( T)/ cc-pVTZ coupled cluster method. The cis and trans planar geometries ( 0 ° and 180 ° for the C1-C2-C3-C4 dihedral angle) proved to be transition states with energy barriers of 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol , respectively , with respect to unimolecular conversion to the gauche equilibrium. The structures of the heavier boron group cations ( Al , Ga , In , and Tl) have also been investigated here , finding even lower energy barriers ( 0.3-0.7 kcal/mol). After the ZPVE corrections , the barriers are further decreased. The torsional angles for the unknown Al , Ga , In , and Tl dimesityl substituted compounds should be somewhat less than 153 °. Many of these findings may be understood in terms of qualitative electronic structure theory. The torsional folding of borane complex , including cationic divinylborinium and elementary vinylborane ( C
