  Aortic graft infection is a feared complication after open abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair secondary to its high mortality. Perigraft air is a common finding after open aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair; however , it is also associated with aortic graft infection. Delineating between graft infection and common postoperative finding is a challenge. This is further complicated by use of hemostatic agents such as Gelfoam , which is also documented to cause perigraft air. Correct diagnosis has crucial implications in management of potential aortic graft infection , which is a vascular emergency. We report a case of perigraft air in a patient status after open aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair with associated clinical manifestations of infection in whom conservative management and surveillance was selected for treatment. We then discuss the timeline of perigraft air , potential causation , importance of history , and physical examination , and finally , we discuss how specific findings on computed tomography imaging for infection in other areas may be useful in aortic graft infection.
