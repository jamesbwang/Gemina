  The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in upper gastrointestinal symptoms between generations and genders in relatively healthy Japanese subjects. Altogether , 4086 healthy Japanese male and female ( M/F) adults ( M/F: 2244/1842) were analyzed. Among them , 3505 subjects ( M/F: 1922/1583) were underwent a routine medical checkup at one of five hospitals in Saga , Japan from January 2013 to December 2013. The others were 581 ( M/F: 322/259) healthy young volunteers at the Saga Medical School from April 2007 to March 2013. The participants were asked to complete the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflex disease ( FSSG) questionnaire , undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , and submit to a rapid urease test to diagnose Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection.

Subjects ' average age was 46.9 Â± 12.2 years , with males ' and females ' ages being almost equivalent. The total FSSG score were high in females compared to males ( P < 0.01) and decreased significantly with aging ( P < 0.05). Among the generations , FSSG scores were the highest for those 20-29 years old , and they were significantly decreased with ageing in both males and females ( P < 0.05).
