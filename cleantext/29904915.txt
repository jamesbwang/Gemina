  Neurotransmitter release occurs in the form of quantal events by fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane , and begins with the formation of a fusion pore that has a conductance similar to that of a large ion channel or gap junction. In this review , we propose mechanisms of fusion pore formation and discuss their implications for fusion pore structure and function. Accumulating evidence indicates a direct role of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptor proteins in the opening of fusion pores. Fusion pores are likely neither protein channels nor purely lipid , but are of proteolipidic composition. Future perspectives to gain better insight into the molecular structure of fusion pores are discussed.
