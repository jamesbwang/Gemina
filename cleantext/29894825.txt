  Monetary rewards and punishments have been shown to respectively enhance retention of motor memories and short-term motor performance , but their underlying neural bases in the context of motor control tasks remain unclear. Using electroencephalography ( EEG) , the present study tested the hypothesis that monetary rewards and punishments are respectively reflected in post-feedback beta-band ( 20-30 Hz) and theta-band ( 3-8 Hz) oscillatory power. While participants performed upper limb reaching movements toward visual targets using their right hand , the delivery of monetary rewards and punishments was manipulated as well as their probability ( i.e. , by changing target size). Compared to unrewarded and unpunished trials , monetary rewards and the successful avoidance of punishments both entailed greater beta-band power at left central electrodes overlaying contralateral motor areas. In contrast , monetary punishments and reward omissions both entailed increased theta-band power at fronto-central scalp sites. Additional analyses revealed that beta-band power was further increased when rewards were lowly probable. In light of previous work demonstrating similar beta-band modulations in basal ganglia during reward processing , the present results may reflect functional communication of reward-related information between the basal ganglia and motor cortical regions. In turn , the increase in fronto-central theta-band power after monetary punishments may reflect an emphasized cognitive need for behavioral adjustments. Globally , the present work identifies possible neural substrates for the growing behavioral evidence showing beneficial effects of monetary feedback on motor learning and performance.
