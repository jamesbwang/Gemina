  The maintenance of a chlorine or chloramine residual to suppress waterborne pathogens in drinking water distribution systems is common practice in the United States but less common in Europe. In this study , we investigated the occurrence of Bacteria and Legionella<pathogen> spp. in water-main biofilms and tap water from a chloraminated distribution system in the United States and a system in Norway with no residual using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR). Despite generally higher temperatures and assimilable organic carbon levels in the chloraminated system , total Bacteria and Legionella<pathogen> spp. were significantly lower in water-main biofilms and tap water of that system ( p < 0.05). Legionella<pathogen> spp. were not detected in the biofilms of the chloraminated system ( 0 of 35 samples) but were frequently detected in biofilms from the no-residual system ( 10 of 23 samples; maximum concentration = 7.8 Ã— 10
