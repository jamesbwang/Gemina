  Depleting aquifers , lack of planning and low socioeconomic status of Pakistani farmers have led them to use wastewater ( WW) for irrigating their crops causing food contamination with heavy metals and ultimately negative effects on human health. This study evaluates the effects of chitosan ( CH) and biochar ( BC) on growth and nutritional quality of brinjal plant together with in situ immobilization of heavy metals in a soil polluted with heavy metals due to irrigation with wastewater ( SPHIW) and further irrigated with the same WW. Both CH and BC were applied at three different rates i.e. low rate ( ( LR) , BC0 .5 % , CH0 .5 % and BC0 .25 % + CH0 .25 %) , medium rate ( ( MR) , BC1 % , CH1 % and BC0 .5 % + CH0 .5 %) and high rate ( ( HR) , BC1 .5 % , CH1 .5 % and BC0 .75 % + CH0 .75 %). Result revealed that brinjal growth , antioxidant enzymes , and fruit nutritional quality significantly improved from LR to HR for each amendment , relative to control. However , these results were more prominent with BC alone and BC+CH , compared with CH alone at each rate. Similarly , with few exceptions , significant reduction in Ni , Cd , Co , Cr and Pb concentrations in the root , shoot and fruit were found in sole CH treatment both at LR and MR but in both CH and BC+CH treatments at HR , relative to control. Interestingly , the concentrations of Fe in the roots , shoots and fruit were more pronounced at BC treatments relative to CH and BC+CH treatments at each rate , compared to control. Overall , the BC+CH treatment at HR was the most effective treatment for in situ immobilization of heavy metals in SPHIW and further irrigated with the same WW , compared to rest of the treatments. This study indicates that BC0 .75 % + CH0 .75 % treatment can be used to reduce mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in SPHIW and facilitates plant growth by improving the antioxidant system. However , the feasibility of BC0 .75 % + CH0 .75 % treatment should also be tested at the field scale.
