  This work reports that abrasive blasting of a structural steel results in significant retention of garnet abrasive residues. A comparative study of the adsorption behavior of a number of organic species , relevant to paint components and additives , onto the surfaces of garnet and S355 steel from nonaqueous solutions is also presented. Areas per adsorbed molecule , estimated from the isotherm data , suggest a range of molecular orientations on the surfaces. Pronounced differences in the adsorption strength to the garnet and steel were observed , particularly that most additives bind more strongly to steel than to garnet. Surface characterization data from acid-base titrations , photoelectron spectroscopy , and backscattered electron diffraction were used to rationalize the adsorption data obtained. The ramifications of these findings for particular industrial processes , with regards the strength of paint adhesion and paint additive formulations , are highlighted.
