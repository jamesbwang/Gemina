  A diverse range of molecular surfactants and polymers have been incorporated into aqueous graphene oxide ( GO) and reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) dispersions in order to understand the complex relationship between surface chemistry , surface forces and interfacial thermodynamics of these materials with typical amphiphiles. Surfactant additives were systematically varied in terms of their charge and hydrophobicity to reveal important structure-function relationships affecting adsorption and interaction with GO and rGO surfaces. Small-angle ( and ultra small-angle) neutron scattering was employed to examine and monitor the interactions and self-assembly in each system. Charge was found to be the overriding factor driving adsorption , as cationic surfactants very readily adsorbed to both GO and rGO , whereas anionic surfactants gave little to no evidence of adsorption despite possessing hydrophobic tail-groups. Molecules of neutral charge such as nonionic and zwitterionic surfactants as well as neutral polymers also showed strong affinities for GO and rGO , indicating that dispersion and dipole ( induction polarisation) interactions also play a significant role in adsorption with these materials. Modelling the neutron data revealed in many cases a q-2 slope in the low q and ultra low q regions , indicating that scattering was occurring from large , flat surfaces ( lamellae or bilayers) , suggesting an effective flattening of the sheets in dispersion. The results presented thus help to form a roadmap for the behaviour of GO and rGO with surfactants and polymers , relevant to adsorption , stabilisation , formulation and coating in aqueous environments as adsorbent and functional materials.
