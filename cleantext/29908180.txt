  Start domain-containing protein 3 ( Stard3) plays roles in intracellular cholesterol distribution , however , the role of Stard3 in the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes remains unclear. We demonstrated that Stard3 expression was significantly increased during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes , accompanied by an increase of mitochondrial Reactive oxygen species ( ROS). Stard3 knocking-down inhibited 3T3-L1 preadipocyte adipogenesis with decreased mitochondrial ROS levels , while ROS inducer rescued the stard3 silencing 3T3 cells with increased ROS. Moreover , Stard3 silencing reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ( C/EBP) α in 3T3- L1 cells. In conclusion , Stard3 enhanced the adipogenesis of preadipocytes by enhancement of cholesterol redistribution to the mitochondrial , increasing mitochondrial ROS production. These results suggest that Stard3 is an essential factor for the 3T3-L1 cells ' differentiation.
