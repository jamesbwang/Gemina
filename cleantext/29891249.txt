  In athletes who undertake a high volume of high intensity exercise , the resultant changes in cardiac structure and function which develop as a result of physiological adaptation to exercise ( so called `` Athlete 's Heart '') may overlap with some features of pathological conditions. This chapter will focus on the left side of the heart , where left ventricular cavity enlargement , increase in left ventricular wall thickness and increased left ventricular trabeculation associated with athletic remodelling may sometimes be difficult to differentiate from conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or isolated left ventricular non-compaction. The distinction between physiological versus pathological changes in athletes is imperative as an incorrect diagnosis can have important consequences , such as exclusion from competitive sport , or false reassurance and missed opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention.
