  UDP-Rhamnose synthase ( RHM) , the branch-point enzyme controlling the nucleotide sugar interconversion pathway , converts UDP-d-glucose into UDP-rhamnose. As a rhamnose residue donor , UDP-l-rhamnose is essential for the biosynthesis of pectic polysaccharides and secondary metabolites in plants. In this study , three CsRHM genes from tea plants ( Camellia sinensis<pathogen>) were cloned and characterized. Enzyme assays showed that three recombinant proteins displayed RHM activity and were involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-rhamnose in vitro. The transcript profiles , metabolite profiles , and mucilage location suggest that the three CsRHM genes likely contribute to UDP-rhamnose biosynthesis and may be involved in primary wall formation in C. sinensis<pathogen>. These analyses of CsRHM genes and metabolite profiles provide a comprehensive understanding of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and regulation in tea plants. Moreover , our results can be applied for the synthesis of the secondary metabolite rhamnoside in future studies.
