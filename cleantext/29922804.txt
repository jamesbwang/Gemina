  Herein , we report a crystalline CoTcPP-based ( TcPP = the anion of meso-tetra ( 4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) polymeric system , 1 , as a hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) electrocatalyst in acidic aqueous media. The material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction ( p-XRD) , Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy , and energy dispersive X-ray ( EDX) analysis and its morphology was probed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). Polymer 1 shows a surface area of 441.74 m
