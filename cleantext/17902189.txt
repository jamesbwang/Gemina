  Tissue engineering ( TE) may provide effective alternative treatment for challenging temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) pathologies associated with disc malpositioning or degeneration and leading to severe masticatory dysfunction. Aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of chitosan/alginate ( Ch/Alg) scaffolds to promote fibro/chondrogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells ( DPSCs) and production of fibrocartilage tissue , serving as a replacement of the natural TMJ disc. Ch/Alg scaffolds were fabricated by crosslinking with CaCl2 combined or not with glutaraldehyde , resulting in two scaffold types that were physicochemically characterized , seeded with DPSCs or human nucleus pulposus cells ( hNPCs) used as control and evaluated for cell attachment , viability , and proliferation. The DPSCs/scaffold constructs were incubated for up to 8 weeks and assessed for extracellular matrix production by means of histology , immunofluorescence , and thermomechanical analysis. Both Ch/Alg scaffold types with a mass ratio of 1:1 presented a gel-like structure with interconnected pores. Scaffolds supported cell adhesion and long-term viability/proliferation of DPSCs and hNPCs. DPSCs cultured into Ch/Alg scaffolds demonstrated a significant increase of gene expression of fibrocartilaginous markers ( COLI<pathogen> , COL<pathogen> X , SOX9 , COM , ACAN) after up to 3 weeks in culture. Dynamic thermomechanical analysis revealed that scaffolds loaded with DPSCs significantly increased storage modulus and elastic response compared to cell-free scaffolds , obtaining values similar to those of native TMJ disc. Histological data and immunochemical staining for aggrecan after 4 to 8 weeks indicated that the scaffolds support abundant fibrocartilaginous tissue formation , thus providing a promising strategy for TMJ disc TE-based replacement.
