  In B-lineage cells , the cytidine deaminase AID not only generates somatic mutations to variable regions of Ig genes but also inflicts , at a lower frequency , mutations to several non-Ig genes named AID off-targets , which include proto-oncogenes. High-throughput sequencing should be in principle the method of choice to detect and document these rare nucleotide substitutions. So far , high-throughput sequencing-based methods are impaired by a global sequencing error rate that usually covers the real mutation rate of AID off-target genes in activated B cells. We demonstrate the validity of a per-base background subtraction method called detection of minor variants by error correction ( DeMinEr) , which uses deep sequencing data from mutated and nonmutated samples to correct the substitution frequency at each nucleotide position along the sequenced region. Our DeMinEr method identifies somatic mutations at a frequency down to 0.02 % at any nucleotide position within two off-target genes:
