  Endocardial pacing has experienced a tremendous evolution since the 1960s. A lot of challenges associated with pacemaker and ICD devices have already been successfully targeted. However , a relevant number of problems have not been solved to date. Not all patients with accepted indication for biventricular pacing have benefited from cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT) despite extensive efforts to reduce the rate of non-responders. Current strategies to optimize lead position , multipolar left-ventricular ( LV) pacing leads , new strategies to gain access to the left-ventricle ( atrial transseptal or ventricular transseptal access) or alternative right-ventricular ( septal , His bundle pacing) pacing sites , and `` leadless '' LV pacing have the potential to increase response to device-based heart-failure treatment. The opportunity of pacemaker and ICD remote monitoring led to relevant improvements in therapy management by timely detection of events requiring medical or invasive interventions ( e.g. , external cardioversion of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , increasing effective biventricular pacing , catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardias<symptom> , or changes in heart-failure medication). Two completely endocardial leadless `` all-in-one '' pacemaker systems recently became available. Besides these innovations , new `` synergistic '' therapy concepts combining catheter ablation and device therapy proved to affect clinical endpoints ( e.g. , ATAAC study and CASTLE-AF study).
