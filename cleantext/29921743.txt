  Arachnoid cysts<symptom> are benign space-occupying brain lesions<symptom> that contain cerebrospinal fluid. Most cases are congenital in origin , caused by failed fusion of the arachnoid membrane early in fetal development. Cases are often incidentally detected on neuroimaging; however , rarely patients present with neuropsychiatric manifestations when cysts<symptom> expand and cause a midline shift , compression of nearby brain tissue or cerebrospinal fluid compartments or both. We report a case of a 56-year-old woman with no past history or family history of psychiatric illness who developed acute-onset right-sided weakness<symptom> , depressive symptoms , and other neuropsychiatric deficits. A diagnosis of organic mood disorder caused by an arachnoid cyst<symptom> was made. Her symptoms and neuropsychiatric deficits remitted after cyst<symptom> marsupialisation by open craniotomy. Therefore , it is important to investigate the organic aetiology in elderly patients who present with simultaneous mood disorder and cognitive dysfunction.
