  The Health Technology Expert Review Panel is an advisory body<symptom> to Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health ( CADTH) that develops recommendations on health technology assessments ( HTAs) for nondrug health technologies using a deliberative framework. The framework spans several domains , including the environmental impact of the health technology ( ies). Our research objective was to identify articles on frameworks , methods or case studies on the environmental impact assessment of health technologies. A literature search in major databases and a focused gray literature search were conducted. The main search concepts were HTA and environmental impact/sustainability. Eligible articles were those that described a conceptual framework or methods used to conduct an environmental assessment of health technologies , and case studies on the application of an environmental assessment. From the 1,710 citations identified , thirteen publications were included. Two articles presented a framework to incorporate environmental assessment in HTAs. Other approaches described weight of evidence practices and comprehensive and integrated environmental impact assessments. Central themes derived include transparency and repeatability , integration of components in a framework or of evidence into a single outcome , data availability to ensure the accuracy of findings , and familiarity with the approach used. Each framework and methods presented have different foci related to the ecosystem , health economics , or engineering practices. Their descriptions suggested transparency , repeatability , and the integration of components or of evidence into a single outcome as their main strengths. Our review is an initial step of a larger initiative by CADTH to develop the methods and processes to address the environmental impact question in an HTA.
