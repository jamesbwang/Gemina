  Chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> is the first example of successful clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs). Blockade of oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity by imatinib translated into an impressive demonstration of clinical and biological control of the disease. Historically , the primary objective of TKIs use was to achieve long-term survival. Today this is a reality for the majority of patients. The rapid development of BCR-ABL1 quantification by RT-qPCR has facilitated the monitoring of residual disease. Molecular response has emerged as a new therapeutic objective , opening the door to TKIs discontinuation. The first prospective stop study in patients in deep molecular response was initiated in 2004 , with today nearly 15 years of follow-up. The pioneering observations of this study followed by numerous stop-studies have led to a new therapeutic goal of treatment-free remission. Five cases of patients who discontinued TKIs are reviewed , illustrating the current issues and challenges surrounding this approach.
