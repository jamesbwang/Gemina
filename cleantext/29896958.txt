  Geopolymers are hydrated aluminosilicates with excellent binding properties. Geopolymers appeal to the construction sector as a more sustainable alternative to traditional cements , but their exploitation is limited by a poor understanding of the linkage between chemical composition and macroscopic properties. Molecular simulations can help clarify this linkage , but existing models based on amorphous or crystalline aluminosilicate structures provide only a partial explanation of experimental data on the nanoscale. This paper presents a new model for the molecular structure of geopolymers , in particular for nanoscale interfacial zones between crystalline and amorphous nanodomains , which are crucial for the overall mechanical properties of the material. For a range of Si-Al molar ratios and water contents , the proposed structures are analyzed in terms of skeletal density , ring structure , pore structure , bond-angle distribution , bond length distribution , X-ray diffraction , X-ray pair distribution function , elastic moduli , and large-strain mechanics. Results are compared with experimental data and with other simulation results for amorphous and crystalline molecular models , showing that the newly proposed structures better capture important structural features with an impact on mechanical properties. This offers a new starting point for the multiscale modeling of geopolymers.
