  Here and for the first time , we show that the organometallic compound ( Ru ( & eta; ⁵- C ₅ H ₅) ( PPh ₃) ₂ Cl) ( RuCp) has potential to be used as a metallodrug in anticancer therapy , and further present a new approach for the cellular delivery of the ( Ru ( & eta; ⁵- C ₅ H ₅) ( PPh ₃) ₂) ⁺ fragment via coordination on the periphery of low-generation poly ( alkylidenimine) dendrimers through nitrile terminal groups. Importantly , both the RuCp and the dendrimers functionalized with ( Ru ( & eta; ⁵- C ₅ H ₅) ( PPh ₃) ₂) ⁺ fragments present remarkable toxicity towards a wide set of cancer cells ( Caco-2 , MCF-7 , CAL-72 , and A2780 cells) , including cisplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( A2780
