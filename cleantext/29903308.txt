  A method for the determination of 6-benzylaminopurine ( 6-BAP) , isopentennyladenine ( z-IP) , 4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid ( 4-FPA) , 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 4-CPA) in bean sprout was developed using solid phase extraction column with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. The sample was extracted by acetonitrile , dehydrated by salt , then centrifugation , and purified by PXC/PWA solid phase extraction column. The chromatographic analysis was carried out on C18 chromatographic column ( 100 mm × 2. 1 mm ,1. 8 μm) , acetonitrile and sodium dihydrogen phosphate for gradient elution , diode array detector for detection , and quantified with external standard method. The calibration curves showed good linearity in the range of 0. 25-25 μg/mL ( 6-BAP and z-IP) and 0. 50-50 μg/mL ( 4-FPA and 4-CPA) with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 999. Three levels spiked recoveries were carried out using blank bean sprout extraction as substrate , the recoveries ranged from70. 0 % to 96. 4 % , and the relative standard deviations ( RSDs) ranged from 2. 84 % to12. 10 % ( n = 6). The qualitative limits of detections were 0. 0082-0. 075 mg/kg and the quantitative limits were 0. 027-0. 25 mg/kg for the 4 PGRs. The method is simple and easy to operate using solid phase extraction column coupled , simultaneous determination of 4 PGRs by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography , can ensure the corresponding accuracy , sensitivity and precision.
