  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects when acid etching on the dentin surface was immediately performed ( I) or 7 days ( D) after calcium silicate-based sealer ( MTA Fillapex) removal , using 95 % ethanol ( E) or xylol ( X). First study , 60 bovine incisor dentin specimens were impregnated with sealer and divided into six groups ( n = 10): ( EI) , E + I; ( XI) , X + I; ( ED) , E + D; ( XD) , X + D , ( UN) , untreated and ( MR) , mechanical removal of sealer. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) images ( 500 ×) were obtained from each specimen and scores assessed the sealer residues persistence. Second study , 60 specimens were similarly treated; however , the specimens were restored with composite resin after the removal protocols. Hybrid layer formation was evaluated using confocal laser microscopy ( 1,024 ×). Third study , 60 specimens were similarly obtained and subjected to micro-shear test to evaluate the effects of removal protocols on the bond strength of etch-and- rinse adhesive system to dentin. XI showed the highest persistence of sealer residues ( p < .05) , similar to MR ( p > .05). EI showed the greatest hybrid layer extension , except in relation to UN ( p < .05). XI and MR presented the lowest bond strength adhesive system to dentin ( p < .05). Acid etching immediately after calcium silicate-based endodontic sealer removal using xylol presented the highest residues persistence and negatively affected the adhesive interface between dentin and etch-and-rinse adhesive system.
