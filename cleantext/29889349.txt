  The development of peptidomimetic helical foldamers with a wide repertoire of functions is of significant interest. Herein , we report the X-ray crystal structures of a series of homogeneous l-sulfono-γ-AA foldamers and elucidate their folding conformation at the atomic level. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography revealed that this class of oligomers fold into unprecedented dragon-boat-shaped and unexpected left-handed helices , which are stabilized by the 14-hydrogen-bonding pattern present in all sequences. These l-sulfono-γ-AApeptides have a helical pitch of 5.1 Å and exactly four side chains per turn , and the side chains lie perfectly on top of each other along the helical axis. 2D NMR spectroscopy , computational simulations , and CD studies support the folding conformation in solution. Our results provide a structural basis at the atomic level for the design of novel biomimetics with a precise arrangement of functional groups in three dimensions.
