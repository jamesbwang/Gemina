  Implementation of daylight photodynamic therapy ( dPDT) is somewhat limited by variable weather conditions. Light sources have been employed to provide artificial dPDT indoors , with low irradiances and longer treatment times. Uniform light distribution across the target area is key to ensuring effective treatment , particularly for large areas. A novel light source is developed with tuneable direction of light emission in order to meet this challenge. Wavelength composition of the novel light source is controlled such that the protoporphyrin-IX ( PpIX) weighed spectra of both the light source and daylight match. The uniformity of the light source is characterised on a flat surface , a model head and a model leg. For context , a typical conventional PDT light source is also characterised. Additionally , the wavelength uniformity across the treatment site is characterised. The PpIX-weighted spectrum of the novel light source matches with PpIX-weighted daylight spectrum , with irradiance values within the bounds for effective dPDT. By tuning the direction of light emission , improvements are seen in the uniformity across large anatomical surfaces. Wavelength uniformity is discussed. We have developed a light source that addresses the challenges in uniform , multiwavelength light distribution for large area artificial dPDT across curved anatomical surfaces.
