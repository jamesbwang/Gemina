  The uncultured NS5 marine group represents one of the most ubiquitous flavobacterial bacterioplankton associated with marine blooms in the pelagic ocean. Here , we present a single-cell genome sampled from coastal waters in the Red Sea that represents the first high-quality draft genome sequence within the NS5 lineage.
