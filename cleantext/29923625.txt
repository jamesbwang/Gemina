  Patients affected by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( LCHAD) deficiency predominantly present severe liver and cardiac dysfunction , as well as neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> during metabolic crises , whose pathogenesis is still poorly known. In this study , we demonstrate for the first time that pathological concentrations of 3-hydroxypalmitic acid ( 3HPA) , the long-chain hydroxyl fatty acid ( LCHFA) that most accumulates in LCHAD deficiency , significantly decreased adenosine triphosphate-linked and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration<symptom> in intact cell systems consisting of heart fibers , cardiomyocytes , and hepatocytes , but less intense in diced forebrain. 3HPA also significantly reduced mitochondrial Ca
