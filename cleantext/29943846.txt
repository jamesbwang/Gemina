  To evaluate the risk of pleural disorders ( PD) associated with 33 Protein Kinase Inhibitors ( PKIs) through a disproportionality analysis and to identify which protein kinase ( PK) and pathways are involved in PKI-induced PD. In order to evaluate the risk of PD , reporting odds ratios ( RORs) were calculated for 33 PKIs through data registered in the World Health Organization safety report database ( VigiBase Â®). We undertook a literature review to identify PKs that were possibly involved in PD caused by PKIs. Pearson correlation coefficients ( r) between RORs and affinity data of 19 PKIs were calculated to identify the cellular target most likely to be involved in PKI-induced PD. A total of 235,110 individual case safety reports ( ICSRs) were extracted from the database for 33 available PKIs. Among them , 5001 ICSRs concerned PD ( 2.1 %). Significant and positive disproportionality for PD was found for 29 of 33 PKI included in our study with top values for dasatinib ( ROR = 115.3; CI95: 110.1-120.8) , bosutinib ( ROR = 20.4; CI95: 15.8-26.4) and ponatinib ( ROR = 12; CI95: 9.2.-15.6). Correlation analyses between the product of dissociation constant and ROR highlighted possibly Lyn involvement in PD with PKI ( r = 0.73 , p = 0.0004). Our study showed that 28 of the 33 tested PKIs were associated with PD. Besides , the study highlighted the role of Lyn in PD caused by PKIs through an immune-mediated process.
