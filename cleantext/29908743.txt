  Although estuaries are critical habitats for many aquatic species , the spatial trends of toxic methylmercury ( MeHg) in biota from fresh to marine waters are poorly understood. Our objective was to determine if MeHg concentrations in biota changed along a salinity gradient in an estuary. Fourspine Stickleback ( Apeltes quadracus) , invertebrates ( snails , amphipods , and chironomids) , sediments , and water were collected from ten sites along the Saint John River estuary , New Brunswick , Canada in 2015 and 2016 , with salinities ranging from 0.06 to 6.96. Total mercury ( proxy for MeHg) was measured in whole fish and MeHg was measured in a subset of fish , pooled invertebrates , sediments , and water. Stable sulfur ( Î´
