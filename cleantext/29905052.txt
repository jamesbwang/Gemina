  To evaluate the biomechanical effect of a nickel-titanium ( Ni-Ti) three-dimensional memory alloy mesh in treating a canine tibial plateau collapse fracture model and to lay a foundation for further experiments Sixteen tibial plateau specimens of 8 adult Beagle dogs were harvested. Twelve specimens were taken to prepare canine tibial plateau collapse fracture models ( Schatzker type Ⅲ) and randomly divided into groups A , B , and C , with 4 specimens in each group. Four normal tibia specimens were used as blank control group ( group D). In groups A and B , the bone defects were repaired with Ni-Ti three-dimensional shape memory alloy mesh combined with autologous bone and simple autologous bone respectively , and fixed with the lateral plate and screw. In group C , the bone defect was directly fixed with the lateral plate and screw. By using a biomechanical tester , a progressive load ( 0-1 700 N) was loaded vertically above the femoral condyle. The maximum failure load was recorded and the stiffness was calculated according to the load-displacement curve. The maximum failure loads in groups A , B , C , and D were ( 1 624.72 ± 7.02) , ( 1 506.57 ± 3.37) , ( 1 102.00 ± 1.83) , and ( 1 767.64 ± 24.56) N , respectively; and the stiffnesses were ( 129.72 ± 20.83) , ( 96.54 ± 27.05) , ( 74.96 ± 17.70) , and ( 169.01 ± 35.62) N/mm , respectively. The maximum failure load and stiffness in group A were significantly higher than those in groups B and C , but which were significantly lower than those in group D ( Ni-Ti three-dimensional memory alloy mesh combined with autologous bone can repair the Schatzker type Ⅲ tibial plateau collapse fracture , which has better biomechanical properties than simple autologous bone grafting.
