  Oenococcus oeni is the lactic acid bacteria species which is the most adapted to wine. Recently , two groups of strains that form two genetic lineages were described in red and white Burgundy wines. The aim of this study was to analyze the phenotypes of these strains in order to determine how they have adapted specifically to either red or white wines. Four strains from each group were tested in grape must and in wines to evaluate their tolerance to pH and to phenolic compounds content. White wine strains proved to be the most tolerant to low pH , both in grape must and in wine , whereas they were inhibited by the presence of grape tannins in wine. Red wine strains were more sensitive to acidity , but very resistant to phenolic compounds. The results suggest that pH and phenolic compounds drive strains selection at several stages of wine production. Although it is well known that O. oeni is well adapted to wine , this study shows that strains of some genetic lineages within this species have evolved to adapt better than others to specific types of wines.
