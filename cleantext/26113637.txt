  KaiC , the core oscillator of the cyanobacterial circadian clock , is composed of an N-terminal C1 domain and a C-terminal C2 domain , and assembles into a double-ring hexamer upon ATP binding. Cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser431 and Thr432 in the C2 domain proceed with a period of approximately 24 h in the presence of other clock proteins , KaiA and KaiB , but recent studies have revealed a crucial role for the C1 ring in determining the cycle period. In this study , we mapped dynamic structural changes of the C1 ring in solution using a combination of site-directed tryptophan mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that the C1 ring undergoes a structural transition , coupled with ATPase activity and the phosphorylation state , while maintaining its hexameric ring structure. This transition triggered by ATP hydrolysis in the C1 ring in specific phosphorylation states is a necessary event for recruitment of KaiB , limiting the overall rate of slow complex formation. Our results provide structural and kinetic insights into the C1-ring rearrangements governing the slow dynamics of the cyanobacterial circadian clock.
