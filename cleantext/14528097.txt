  Extramedullary leukemia<disease> is common in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and occurs as a solid tumor ( myeloid sarcoma<disease>). We report a case of a child who presented with acute onset of paraparesis<disease> and found to have intracranial and paravertebral mass; subsequently , he was diagnosed as having AML on tissue biopsy. He was started on AML treatment protocol , and later he was in remission and myeloid sarcoma<disease> got cleared from intracranial and paravertebral region. Timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment are essential to improve survival in such cases.
