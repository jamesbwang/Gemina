  Cubic π-phase monochalcogenides ( MX , M = Sn , Ge; X = S , Se) are an emerging new class of materials that has recently been discovered. Here , their thermodynamic stability , progress in synthetic routes , properties , and prospective applications are reviewed. The thermodynamic stability is demonstrated through density functional theory total energy and phonon spectra calculations , which show that the π-phase polytype is stable across the monochalcogenide family. To date , only π-phase tin monochalcogenides have been observed experimentally while π-phase Ge-monochalcogenides are predicted to be stable but are yet to be experimentally realized. Various synthetic preparation protocols of π-SnS and π-SnSe are described , focusing on surfactant-assisted nanoparticle synthesis and chemical deposition of thin films from aqueous-bath compositions. These techniques provide materials with different surface energies , which are likely to play a major role in stabilizing the π-phase in nanoscale materials. The properties of this newly discovered family of semiconducting materials are discussed in comparison with their conventional orthorhombic polymorphs. These could benefit a number of photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications since , apart from being cubic , they also possess characteristic advantages , such as moderately low toxicity and natural abundance.
