  The problem of identifying functional connectivity from multiple time series data recorded in each of two or more brain areas arises in many neuroscientific investigations. For a single stationary time series in each of two brain areas statistical tools such as cross-correlation and Granger causality may be applied. On the other hand , to examine multivariate interactions at a single time point , canonical correlation , which finds the linear combinations of signals that maximize the correlation , may be used. We report here a new method that produces interpretations much like these standard techniques and , in addition , ( a) extends the idea of canonical correlation to 3-way arrays ( with dimensionality number of signals by number of time points by number of trials) , ( b) allows for non-stationarity , ( c) also allows for nonlinearity , ( d) scales well as the number of signals increases , and ( e) captures predictive relationships , as is done with Granger causality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through simulation studies , and illustrate by analyzing local field potentials recorded from a behaving
