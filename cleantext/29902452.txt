  An interaction between the Rad17-RFC2-5 and 9-1-1 complexes is essential for ATR-Chk1 signaling , which is one of the major DNA damage checkpoints. Recently , we showed that the polyanionic C-terminal tail of human Rad17 and the embedded conserved sequence iVERGE are important for the interaction with 9-1-1 complex. Here , we show that Rad17-S667 in the C-terminal tail is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo in a casein kinase 2-dependent manner , and the phosphorylation is important for 9-1-1 interaction. The serine phosphorylation of Rad17 could be seen in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress , and was mostly abolished by S667A substitution. Rad17-S667 was also phosphorylated when the C-terminal tail was fused with EGFP , but the phosphorylation was inhibited by two casein kinase 2 inhibitors. Furthermore , interaction between Rad17 and the 9-1-1 complex was inhibited by the casein kinase 2 inhibitor CX-4945/ Silmitasertib , and the effect was dependent on the Rad17-S667 residue , indicating that S667 phosphorylation is the only role of casein kinase 2 in the 9-1-1 interaction. Our data raise the possibility that the C-terminal tail of vertebrate Rad17 regulates ATR-Chk1 signaling through multi-site phosphorylation in the iVERGE.
