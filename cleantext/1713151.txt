  Prominent theories highlight the importance of bodily perception for self-consciousness , but it is currently not known whether this is based on interoceptive or exteroceptive signals or on integrated signals from these anatomically distinct systems , nor where in the brain such integration might occur. To investigate this , we measured brain activity during the recently described ` cardio-visual full body illusion ' which combines interoceptive and exteroceptive signals , by providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat in the form of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlining a video image of the participant 's body and flashing in synchrony with their heartbeat. We found , as also reported previously , that synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with the virtual body. Here we further investigated whether experimental changes in self-consciousness during this illusion are accompanied by activity changes in somatosensory cortex by recording somatosensory evoked potentials ( SEPs). We show that a late somatosensory evoked potential component ( P45) reflects the illusory self-identification with a virtual body. These data demonstrate that interoceptive and exteroceptive signals can be combined to modulate activity in parietal somatosensory cortex.
