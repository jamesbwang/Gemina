  Ilizarov is an accepted technique for lengthening short amputation stumps to improve prosthetic function and rehabilitation. The relation of stump lengthening and phantom limb<symptom> pain<symptom> ( PLP) has not been reported in literature. We present here a case report of a transfemoral amputee who had a flare up of PLP following stump lengthening. He responded well to a combination of pharmacological therapy and soft tissue manipulative techniques and desired length was achieved. This report alerts the possibility of aggravation of PLP following stump lengthening and discusses its management.
