  Controlling the cell behavior on biocompatible polymer surfaces is critical for the development of suitable medical implant coatings as well as in anti-adhesive applications. Synthetic glycopolymer brushes , based on sugar methacrylate monomers have been reported as robust surfaces to resist protein adsorption and cell adhesion. In this study , poly ( D-gluconamidoethyl methacrylate) ( PGAMA) brushes of various chain lengths were synthesized directly from initiator functionalized glass substrates using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. The glycopolymer film thicknesses were determined by ellipsometry , whereas the wettability and the morphology of the surfaces were characterized by static water contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy , respectively. Stable , grafted films with thicknesses in the dry state between 4 and 20 nm and of low roughness ( ~ 1 nm) were obtained by varying the polymerization time. Cell experiments with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts cultured on the PGAMA brushes were performed to examine the effect of film thickness on the cell morphology , cytoskeleton organization and growth. The results revealed good cell spreading and proliferation on PGAMA layers of low film thickness , whereas cell adhesion was prevented on polymer films with thickness higher than ~ 10 nm , indicating their potential use in medical implants and anti-adhesive surfaces , respectively.
