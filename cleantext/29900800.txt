  The Amajuba Child Health and Wellbeing Research Project measured the impact of orphaning due to HIV/AIDS on South African households between 2004 and 2007. Community engagement was a central component of the project and extended through 2010. We describe researcher engagement with the community to recruit participants , build local buy-in , stimulate interest in study findings , and promote integration of government social welfare services for families and children affected by HIV/AIDS. This narrative documents the experience of researchers , drawing also on project reports , public documents , and published articles , with the objective of documenting lessons learned in this collaboration between researchers from two universities and a community in South Africa during a period that spanned seven years. This experience is then analyzed within the context of an applied research , community-engagement framework.
