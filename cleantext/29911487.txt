  Solidarity groups were established in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to provide female survivors of conflict-related sexual violence an opportunity to generate income , establish networks of support , and cope with atrocities. Qualitative data were collected from 12 members of solidarity groups to explore factors that contributed to members ' mental health. All women identified some improvement ( physiological , psychological , economic , or social) since joining the solidarity group , but none of the women were free from ailments. Our findings suggest that a multifaceted intervention in women 's own communities has the potential to improve multiple aspects of women 's lives , including mental health.
