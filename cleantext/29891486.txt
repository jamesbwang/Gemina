  Constitutively activated STAT3 plays a critical role in non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC) progression by mediating proliferation and survival. STAT 3 activation in normal cells is transient , making it an attractive target for NSCLC therapy. The therapeutic potential of blocking STAT3 in NSCLC was assessed utilizing a decoy approach by ligating a double-stranded 15-mer oligonucleotide that corresponds to the STAT3 response element of STAT3-target genes , to produce a cyclic STAT3 decoy ( CS3D). The decoy was evaluated using NSCLC cells containing either wild-type ( WT) EGFR ( 201T) or mutant EGFR with an additional EGFRi resistance mutation ( H1975). These cells are resistant to EGFR inhibitors and require an alternate therapeutic approach. CS3D activity was compared to an inactive cyclic control oligonucleotide ( CS3M) that differs by a single base pair , rendering it unable to bind to STAT3 protein. Transfection of 0.3 ÂµM of CS3D caused a 50 % inhibition in proliferation in 201T and H1975 cells , relative to CS3M , and a 2-fold increase in apoptotic cells. Toxicity was minimal in normal cells. CS3D treatment caused a significant reduction of mRNA and protein expression of the STAT3 target gene c-Myc , and inhibited colony formation by 70 %. The active decoy decreased the nuclear pool of STAT3 compared to the mutant. In a xenograft model , treatments with CS3D ( 5 mg/kg) caused a potent 96.5 % and 81.7 % reduction in tumor growth in 201T ( P < 0.007) and H1975 models ( P < .0001) , respectively , and reduced c-Myc and p-STAT3 proteins. Targeting STAT3 with the cyclic decoy could be an effective therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.
