  In the last six years , the direct functionalization of aliphatic C-H ( and C-C) bonds through user-friendly , radical-based fluorination reactions has emerged as an exciting research area in fluorine chemistry. Considering the historical narratives about the challenges of developing practical radical fluorination in organic frameworks , notable advancements in controlling both reactivity and selectivity have been achieved during this time. As one of the participants in the field , herein , we a provide brief account of research efforts in our laboratory from the initial discovery of radical monofluorination on unactivated C-H bonds in 2012 to more useful strategies to install fluorine on biologically relevant molecules through directed fluorination methods. In addition , accompanying mechanistic studies that have helped guide reaction design are highlighted in context.
