  Vaccination with MHC-II-restricted peptides from Apolipoprotein B ( ApoB) with complete and incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ( CFA/IFA) is known to protect mice from atherosclerosis. This vaccination induces antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2c antibody responses and a robust CD4 T cell response in lymph nodes. However , CFA/IFA can not be used in humans. To find a clinically applicable adjuvant , we tested the effect of vaccinating Apoe-deficient mice with ApoB peptide P6 ( TGAYSNASSTESASY). In a broad screening experiment , Addavax , a squalene oil similar to MF59 , was the only adjuvant that showed similar efficacy as CFA/IFA. This was confirmed in a confirmation experiment for both the aortic arch and whole aorta analyzed by en face analysis after atherosclerotic lesion<symptom> staining. Mechanistically , restimulated peritoneal cells from mice immunized with P6 in Addavax released significant amounts of IL-10. Unlike P6 in CFA/IFA , vaccination with P6 in Addavax did not induce any detectable IgG1 or IgG2c antibodies to P6. These data suggest that squalene-based adjuvants such as MF59 are good candidate adjuvants for developing a clinically effective atherosclerosis vaccine. This article is protected by copyright.
