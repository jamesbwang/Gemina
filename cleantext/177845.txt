  BACKGROUND SC79 has been reported to protect against experimental ischemia-elicited neuronal death and brain injury and to protect myocardiocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R) injury. Here , we investigated the effects of SC79 in primary hepatocytes in vitro and in rat liver in vivo following hypoxia-reoxygenation ( H/R) and hepatic I/R injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS The livers of Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 min of ischemia followed by 2-24 h of reperfusion. The primary hepatocytes were subjected to hypoxia for 6 h and for 2-24 h. The hepatocytes cells or the hepatic I/R injury model livers were treated with SC79 or/and LY294002 at different times and concentrations. The serum ALT , AST , histologic examination , cellular viability , and cell apoptosis were assessed. The levels of phospho-Akt , Bad , Bim , Bax , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS SC79 improved viability and inhibited apoptosis in hepatocytes following H/R. SC79 decreased serum AST and ALT , markedly improved pathology , and decreased cell apoptosis in livers following I/R. In addition , SC79 promoted the expression of phospho-Akt , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-XL , and decreased the expression of Bid , Bax , and Bim. PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002) pre-treatment completely abolished the above-mentioned effects of SC79. CONCLUSIONS The protective role of SC79 against H/R of hepatocytes or hepatic I/R injury is related to activation of phosphorylation of Akt , resulting in the decrease of pro-apoptotic protein of Bim , Bax , and Bad , and increase of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL induced by cell H/R and hepatic I/R injury.
