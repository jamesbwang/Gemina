  Collagen cross-linking , as a form of collagen post-translational modification , plays a crucial role in maintaining bone mechanical properties as well as in regulating cell biological functions. Shifts in cross-links profile are found apparently correlated to kinds of skeletal pathology and diseases , whereas little is known about the relationship between collagen cross-links and osteogenesis. Here , we hypothesized that the inhibition of collagen cross-links could impair skeletal microstructure and inhibit osteogenesis. A mouse model of collagen cross-linking defects has been established using subcutaneous injection of 350 mg/kg Î²-aminopropionitrile ( BAPN) daily for 4 weeks , and same dose of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) served as control group. The analysis of bone microstructural parameters revealed a significant decrease of bone volume fraction ( BV/TV) and trabecular thickness ( Tb.Th) , and increase of bone surface ratio ( BS/BV) , structure model index ( SMI) as well as trabecular separation ( Tb.Sp) in the experimental group ( p < 0.05) , whereas there was no difference observed in bone mineral density ( BMD). Histological staining displayed that the BAPN treatment caused thinner trabeculae and decrease of collagen content in proximal tibiae. The analysis of osteogenesis PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction) array reflected that BAPN remarkably influenced the expression of Alpl , Bglap , Bgn , Bmp5 , Col10a1 , Col1a1 , Col1a2 , Col5a1 , Itga2b , and Serpinh1. The results of immunohistochemistry displayed a significant reduction in the mean optical densities of OCN and COL1 at the presence of BAPN. The overall results of this study suggested that BAPN alters bone microstructure and hinders the expression of osteogenic genes without affecting mineralization processes , indicating the influences of collagen cross-links on osteogenesis may be a potential pathological mechanism in skeletal diseases.
