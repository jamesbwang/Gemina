  Epidemiological studies on heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) using large health care databases are becoming increasingly frequent , as they represent an invaluable opportunity to characterize the importance and risk factors of HF from a population perspective. Nevertheless , because of its complex diagnosis and natural history , the heterogeneous use of the relevant terminology in routine clinical practice , and the limitations of some disease coding systems , HF can be a challenging condition to assess using large health care databases as the main source of information. In this narrative review , we discuss some of the challenges that researchers may face , with a special focus on the identification and validation of chronic HF cases and acute HF decompensations. For each of these challenges , we present some potential solutions inspired by the literature and/or based on our research experience , aimed at increasing the internal validity of research and at informing its interpretation. We also discuss future directions on the field , presenting constructive recommendations aimed at facilitating the conduct of valid epidemiological studies on HF in the coming years.
