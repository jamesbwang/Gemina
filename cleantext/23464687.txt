  Interleukin-10 ( IL-10) , interleukin-17A ( IL-17A) and transforming growth factor α ( TGF-α) have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. However , the diagnostic and prognostic roles of these cytokines in ductal carcinoma remain unclear. The present study therefore aimed to determine the serum levels of IL-10 , IL-17 and TGF-α in subjects with benign and malignant breast diseases and to evaluate the clinical significance of these cytokines in ductal carcinoma. Pre-operative serum samples were collected from 378 patients with breast disease and 70 healthy subjects. IL-10 , IL-17A and TGF-α levels were measured using ELISA. Serum levels of these cytokine in patients with different breast diseases were evaluated. Furthermore , correlations between levels of these cytokines and the expression of estrogen receptor ( ER) , progesterone receptor ( PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) in ductal carcinoma were determined. The results demonstrated that serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17A were significantly increased in subjects with atypical hyperplasia<disease> and ductal carcinoma. Furthermore , IL-10 and IL-17A levels were increased in patients with a more serious clinical tumor stage and tumors that were ER
