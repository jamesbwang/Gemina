  Advance care planning ( ACP) engagement includes a wide range of behaviors and actions related to discussions and documentation , yet few ACP intervention studies measure the full process. The objective of the study was to compare the effects of an easy-to-read advance directive ( AD) versus an ACP web site plus the AD ( PREPARE + AD) on Behavior Change Processes and Actions , including discussions and documentation. Secondary data were from a completed ACP trial. Participants were primary care patients , ≥ 60 years old , with two comorbidities. We used the validated ACP Engagement Survey to examine six-month change in subscales measuring Behavior Change Processes ( knowledge , contemplation , self-efficacy , readiness) and Actions ( decision makers , quality of life , flexibility for decision makers , asking clinicians questions) , specifically related to discussions and documentation. We used adjusted mixed-effects linear models to compare mean change and engagement over time. Compared to the AD-only , PREPARE + AD resulted in greater increases in all Behavior Change Processes subscales and Actions related to decision makers , quality of life , and flexibility ( all P-values ≤ 0.005). Both interventions significantly increased the proportion of participants who engaged in ACP discussions ( PREPARE + AD , 99.5 %; AD-only , 93.3 %) and documentation ( PREPARE + AD , 99.5 %; AD-only , 90.4 %) , with greater increases for PREPARE + AD ( all P-values < 0.001). Both PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD and an AD-only markedly increased ACP engagement in a full range of ACP behaviors , including discussions and documentation , and engagement was nearly 100 % with PREPARE + AD. Future ACP studies should examine a full range of ACP behaviors beyond ADs and the impact of PREPARE and easy-to-read AD implementation on health care systems.
