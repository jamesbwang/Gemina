  Marine macrofoulers ( e.g. , barnacles , tubeworms , mussels) create underwater adhesives capable of attaching themselves to almost any material. The difficulty in removing these organisms frustrates maritime and oceanographic communities , and fascinates biomedical and industrial communities seeking synthetic adhesives that cure and hold steadfast in aqueous environments. Protein analysis can reveal the chemical composition of natural adhesives; however , developing synthetic analogs that mimic their performance remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of adhesion processes. Here , it is shown that acorn barnacles (
