  Heading cabbage is a nutritionally rich and economically important cruciferous vegetable. Black rot disease , caused by the bacterium<pathogen> Xanthomonas<pathogen> campestris<pathogen> pv. campestris<pathogen> , reduces both the yield and quality of the cabbage head. Nucleotide binding site ( NBS)- encoding resistance ( R) genes play a vital role in the plant immune response to various pathogens. In this study , we analyzed the expression and DNA sequence variation of 31 NBS-encoding genes in cabbage ( Brassica oleracea var. capitata). These genes encoded TIR , NBS , LRR and RPW8 protein domains , all of which are known to be involved in disease resistance. RNA-seq revealed that these 31 genes were differentially expressed in leaf , root , silique , and stem tissues. Furthermore , qPCR analyses revealed that several of these genes were more highly expressed in resistant compared to susceptible cabbage lines , including Bol003711 , Bol010135 , Bol010559 , Bol022784 , Bol029866 , Bol042121 , Bol031422 , Bol040045 and Bol042095. Further analysis of these genes promises to yield both practical benefits , such as molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding , and fundamental insights to the mechanisms of resistance to black rot in cabbage.
