  This study was to explore the main influencing factors of attempted suicide and establish an early warning model , so as to put forward prevention strategies for attempted suicide. Data came from a large-scale case-control epidemiological survey. A sample of 659 serious suicide attempters was randomly recruited from 13 rural counties in China. Each case was matched by a community control for gender , age , and residence location. Face to face interviews were conducted for all the cases and controls with the same structured questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression was applied to screen the factors and multivariate logistic regression was used to excavate the predictors. There were no statistical differences between suicide attempters and the community controls in gender , age , and residence location. The Cronbach ` s coefficients for all the scales used were above 0.675. The multivariate logistic regressions have revealed 12 statistically significant variables predicting attempted suicide , including less education , family history of suicide , poor health , mental problem , aspiration strain , hopelessness , impulsivity , depression<symptom> , negative life events. On the other hand , social support , coping skills , and healthy community protected the rural residents from suicide attempt. The excavated warning predictors are significant clinical meaning for the clinical psychiatrist. Crisis intervention strategies in rural China should be informed by the findings from this research. Education , social support , healthy community , and strain reduction are all measures to decrease the likelihood of crises.
