  Parvalbumin ( PV) , calretinin ( CR) , calbindin D-28k ( CB) , stage specific embryonic antigen-4 ( SSEA4) , and phosphorylated neurofilament 200 ( pNF200) have been commonly used as markers for primary afferent neurons with large myelinated ( A) fibers but detailed information on the expression of these markers in specific primary afferent fiber types is still lacking. We here examined the fibers that express PV , CR , CB , SSEA4 , and pNF200 in the trigeminal ganglion and its peripheral sensory root by light- and electron-microscopic immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis. We found that all CR-immunopositive ( +) , CB + , and SSEA4 + fibers and virtually all ( 98.8 %) PV + fibers were myelinated , most CR + fibers were large myelinated , whereas most CB + and SSEA4 + fibers were small myelinated. One half of the PV + fibers were small myelinated and the other half were large myelinated. Of all pNF200 + fibers , about a third each were small myelinated , large myelinated , and unmyelinated. These findings suggest that PV , CR , CB , and SSEA4 can be used as specific markers for primary afferent neurons with myelinated fibers , but that pNF200 is not suitable as a specific marker for primary afferent neurons with myelinated fibers , and also raise the possibility that PV , CR , CB , and SSEA4 may be expressed in both mechanoreceptive and nociceptive neurons.
