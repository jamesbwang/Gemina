  The study describes adolescent and parent retention and changes in willingness to participate ( WTP) in research among adolescents , parents , and adolescent-parent dyads. Adolescent-parent dyads were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study to assess research participation attitudes using simultaneous individual interviews of the adolescent and parent with a return visit one year later using the same interview. Adolescents ( 14-17 years old) and their parents. None. The relationship between participant characteristics and dyad retention was assessed. WTP was measured on a Likert scale and dichotomized ( willing/unwilling) in order to assess changes in WTP attitudes over time for adolescents , parents , and dyads. Eighty-three percent of the 300 dyads were retained. Dyads in which there was successful contact with the parent prior to follow-up were more likely to be retained ( OR 4.88; 95 % CI: 2.57- 9.26). For adolescents at baseline , 59 % were willing to participate and 55 % were willing to participate at follow-up ( McNemar 's: S = 0.91 ( 1) , p = 0.34). For parents at baseline , 51 % were willing to participate and 57 % were willing to participate at follow-up ( McNemar 's: S = 5.12 , p = 0.02). For dyads at baseline , 57 % were concordant ( in either direction) and 70 % of dyads were concordant at follow-up ( McNemar 's: S = 10.56 , p = 0.001). Over one year , parent contact may positively influence successful adolescent retention. Parents become more willing to let their adolescents participate over time , with dyads becoming more concordant about research participation.
