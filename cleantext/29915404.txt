  Celiac disease affects about 1 % of the population and is treated with a gluten-free diet. However , the last decade has seen a huge rise in individuals self-reporting wheat sensitivity , and consuming a gluten-free diet , despite not having a doctor-diagnosis of celiac disease. A recent flurry of observational studies from across the globe suggests that approximately 10 % of the population is self-reporting wheat sensitivity. They describe a constellation of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms attributed to ingestion of gluten-based products. This phenomenon poses a significant challenge to clinicians with regards to adequately excluding celiac disease , identifying the culprit agent , understanding the pathophysiology , and providing safe aftercare.
