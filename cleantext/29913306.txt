  To evaluate whether selective dentin etching protocols using reduced phosphoric acid ( H Mid-coronal flat dentin surfaces were produced on sound third molars , selectively etched with 32 % H Selective dentin etching for 3 s improved the interaction depth of the tested universal adhesive without overexposing demineralized collagen or reducing Ca-content availability at the bonded interface. The improved immediate bond strengths of the selective etching protocol remained significantly higher ( p < 0.05) after long-term aging producing hybrid layers without significant differences ( p > 0.05) in silver uptake levels compared to those produced on non-etched dentin. Despite the adjunctive conclusion that universal adhesives used in self-etch mode produce superior long-term dentin bonding compared to the etch-and-rinse mode , selective etching for 3 s with conventionally used H
