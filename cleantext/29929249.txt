  An increasing diversity of technologies are being used to remediate contaminated sites , yet there remains little understanding of the level of acceptance that residents living near these sites hold for these technologies , and what factors influence their level of acceptance. This lack of understanding hinders the remediation industry 's ability to effectively engage with these residents about remediation technology selection , at a time when such engagement is become part and parcel of remediation policy and practice. The study develops on wider research into public acceptance of technologies , using data from a telephone survey of 2009 residents living near thirteen contaminated sites across Australia. Within the survey acceptance is measured through residents ' level of support for the application of remediation technologies in their local area. Firstly , a regression analysis of closed-ended questions , and coding of open-ended questions are combined to identify the main predictors of residents ' support for remediation technologies. Secondly , coding of open-ended questions was analysed using Crawford and Ostrom 's Institutional Grammar Tool to identify norms and sanctions guiding residents ' willingness to negotiate their support. The research identifies factors associated with the residents ' personal and demographic characteristics , their physical context and engagement with institution during remediation processes , and the technologies themselves which predict residents ' level of support for the application of remediation technologies. Bioremediation technologies had higher levels of support than chemical , thermal and physical technologies. Furthermore , the paper identifies a core set of norms and sanctions residents use to negotiate their level of support for remediation technologies.
