  Arteriovenous malformations ( AVMs) of the scalp are rare and infrequently encountered by the neurosurgeon. We report a unique case of a 42-year-old patient who presented with a progressive worsening of visual acuity in the right eye ( lower quadrantanopia) and palpebral ptosis<symptom>. Physical examination revealed a right exophthalmos and a right frontoparietal scalp soft swelling when the patient was in the supine position. Neurologic work-up showed a scalp AVM extending into the orbit and connected to an intraorbital cavernous angioma. The patient was treated with a frontotemporal craniotomy and decompression of the orbit. In the rare case of intraorbital extension of a scalp AVM , neurologic symptoms may appear when the size of the vascular malformation increases with age. The aims of surgery should be decompression of the orbit and aesthetic preservation , rather than complete excision. A review of the literature is also provided.
