  Diabetes mellitus ( DM) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer ( CRC). Hyperglycemia , a chronic abnormality in diabetes , is an independent predictor of cancer-associated mortality in CRC. However , the underlying biological mechanism of hyperglycemia in CRC cells is largely unknown. In the present study , HCT-116 and HT-29 cell proliferation , apoptosis , migration and invasion were assessed. In addition , the expression of epithelial ( E)- cadherin , vimentin and high-mobility group A protein 2 ( HMGA2) were assessed using western blotting. The results demonstrated that high glucose ( HG; 30 mmol/l) caused CRC cells to lose their epithelial morphology , with a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in vimentin , suggesting epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT). Furthermore , HG significantly enhanced the cell migration and invasion of CRC cells and the expression of HMGA2. Transfection with HMGA2 small interfering RNA reversed the HG-induced changes to CRC cells. In addition , HG promoted CRC cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. The results of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia promotes EMT , proliferation , migration and invasion in CRC cells and may provide novel insights into the link between HG and CRC.
