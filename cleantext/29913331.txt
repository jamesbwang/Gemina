  Molecular interactions and binding of probes/drugs with biomacromolecular systems are of fundamental importance in understanding the mechanism of action and hence designing of proactive drugs. In the present study , binding interactions of a biologically potent fluorophore , ( E) -1,5-diphenyl-3-styryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole ( DSDP) with two serum transport proteins , human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin , have been investigated exploiting multi-spectroscopic techniques. The spectrophotometric and fluorometric studies together with fluorescence quenching , fluorescence anisotropy , urea induced denaturation studies and fluorescence lifetime measurements reveal strong binding of DSDP with both the plasma proteins. Going beyond the vast literature data mostly providing 1:1 probe-protein complexation , the present investigation portrays 2:1 probe-protein complex formation at higher relative probe concentration. A newer approach has been developed to have an estimate of the binding constants varying the concentration of the protein , instead of the usual practice of varying the probe. The binding constants for the 2:1 DSDP-protein complexes are determined to be 1.37 Ã— 10
