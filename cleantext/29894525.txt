  Perianal basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) is a rare lesion<symptom> that accounts for less than 0.08 % of all BCCs. It is challenging to diagnose , as it can be overlooked or mistaken for an inflammatory dermatosis. When discovered early and treated properly , BCC is associated with low mortality and a good prognosis. Thorough total-body skin examinations and biopsy of suspected lesions<symptom> found in the perianal region is recommended. We present a case of a superficial nodular perianal BCC that was discovered following a routine total-body skin examination and was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS). Patient nonattendance is also discussed.
