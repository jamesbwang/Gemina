  The purpose of this paper is to identify commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) that are associated with hypertension , primarily , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) signaling pathway ( VSP) inhibitors. We review the incidence , mechanism , and strategies for management of TKI-induced HTN. We hope to provide clinicians with guidance on how to manage similar clinical scenarios. Many of the newer VSP inhibitors are reviewed here , including cediranib , axitinib , pazopanib , and ponatinib. Trials utilizing prophylactic treatment with angiotensin system inhibitors ( ASIs) are discussed as well as recent data showing an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in patients on ASIs and TKI-induced hypertension. The incidence of TKI-induced HTN among the VEGF inhibitors ranges from 5 to 80 % and is dose dependent. Newer generation small-molecule TKIs has a lower incidence. The mechanism of action involves VSP inhibition , leading to decreased nitric oxide and increased endothelin production , which causes vasoconstriction , capillary rarefaction , and hypertension. ASIs and calcium channel blockers are first-line therapy for treatment and are associated with improved overall survival. Nitrates and beta-blockers are associated with in vitro cancer regression; however , there is a paucity of trials regarding their use as an anti-hypertensive agent in the TKI-induced HTN patient population.
