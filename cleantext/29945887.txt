  The levels of copper , which is an essential element in living organisms , are under tight homeostatic control. Inactivating mutations in ATP7B , a P-type Cu-ATPase that functions in copper excretion , promote aberrant accumulation of the metal , primarily the in liver and brain. This condition underlies Wilson 's disease , a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by profound hepatic and neurological deficits. Current treatment regimens rely on the use of broad specificity metal chelators as `` decoppering '' agents; however , there are side effects that limit their effectiveness. Here , we present the characterization of DPM-1001 ( methyl 4- ( 7-hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-3- ( ( 4- ( ( pyridin-2-ylmethyl) amino) butyl) amino) hexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta ( a) phenanthren-17-yl) pentanoate) as a potent and highly selective chelator of copper that is orally bioavailable. Treatment of cell models , including fibroblasts derived from Wilson 's disease patients , eliminated adverse effects associated with copper accumulation. Furthermore , treatment of the toxic milk mouse model of Wilson 's disease with DPM-1001 lowered the levels of copper in the liver and brain , removing excess copper by excretion in the feces while ameliorating symptoms associated with the disease. These data suggest that it may be worthwhile to investigate DPM-1001 further as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of Wilson 's disease , with potential for application in other indications associated with elevated copper , including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
