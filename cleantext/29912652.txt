  Some components of bitterness make key flavor contributions to promote the palatability of foods , whereas other components are recognized as aversive signals to avoid consuming harmful substances. These contradictory behaviors suggest that humans tolerate tastes of bitterants based on certain criteria. Here , we investigated human taste tolerance and sensory cues leading to diverse taste tolerance of bitter compounds. Tolerance of eight bitter compounds , which are typically contained in foods , was evaluated by measuring detection and rejection thresholds. The results revealed that the level of tolerance of each compound was variable , and some compounds showed an acceptable concentration regarding the suprathreshold intensity. Tolerance did not depend on the nutritive value or attenuation and accumulation characteristics of bitterness and bitter taste receptors. These results suggest that the criteria controlling tolerance of bitter compounds may be derived from a complex relationship between the taste quality and cognitive process.
