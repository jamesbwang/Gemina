  An exploratory survey assessed the influence of current and potential future genomic applications for weight management on individuals ' desires to address weight management within primary care. Materials & methods: A convenience sample of 714 US adults aged 18-70 completed an online survey that presented three scenarios: no genomic information; current genomic capabilities; and potential future applications of genomics for weight management. Participants had increased interest in weight management assistance through primary care when considering genomic applications in weight management , p ( 1,1.68) = 24.66 , p < 0.001; this increase was more robust among individuals who felt their weight was important for their health , p ( 1,1.68) = 20.85 , p < 0.001. Primary care systems may need to accommodate a rise in the volume of patients seeking weight management assistance as genomic approaches come to fruition.
