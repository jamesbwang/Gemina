  Current therapies for pancreatic ductal cancer ( PDAC) do not sufficiently control distant metastasis. Thus , new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Numerous studies have suggested that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) is pivotal for metastasis of carcinomas. The fact that the EMT is reversible suggests the possibility that it is induced by an epigenetic mechanism. In this study , we aimed to investigate the role of histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1) , which is an epigenetic mechanism on distant metastasis of PDAC. We investigated the HDAC1 expression in 103 resected PDAC specimens obtained from patients who were treated with/without preoperative therapy using immunohistochemistry. To validate the findings in the clinical samples , we evaluated the HDAC1 activity , the EMT-associated genes and the migration/invasion ability in vitro , and performed an HDAC1 inhibitor assay. The high expression of HDAC1 in clinical samples was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival , especially distant metastasis-free survival. In vitro , HDAC1 inhibitors decreased the invasion ability and reversed the EMT change; the only factor to show a concomitant decrease was the expression of SNAIL. We confirmed that the HDAC1 expression was associated with the SNAIL expression in clinical samples. Moreover , the resistant cells and parental cells did not show any significant differences in the expression of HDAC1; this was consistent with the finding that preoperative therapy did not alter the HDAC1 expression in clinical samples. The targeting of HDAC1 , which could suppress metastasis by inhibiting the EMT , is a promising treatment option for PDAC.
