  Only a few surgical choices are available for cervical and thoracic spine coverage. The trapezius perforator flap is relatively unknown and only a few authors have published on this subject. In this article , we report on four clinical cases where a trapezius perforator flap was used either as a propeller flap , as a tunnelized island<disease> flap , or as a supercharged flap for cervical spine , thoracic spine and anterior cervical defects. Harvesting this flap is quite simple and enables high quality reconstruction with low donor-site morbidity in complex situations.
