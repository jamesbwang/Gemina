  Classic surgical teaching advocates for closure of the mesenteric defect ( MD) after bowel anastomosis but the necessity is controversial. We sought to evaluate the necessity of MD closure at the time of harvest of ileum for genitourinary reconstructive surgery ( GURS) by analyzing the incidence of early and late gastrointestinal adverse events ( GIAE) in patients with and without MD closure. A retrospective review was conducted on patients undergoing urologic reconstruction with ileum to identify incidence of ileus , small bowel obstruction ( SBO) , gastrointestinal ( GI) fistula<disease> and stoma complications. Patient and procedure variables were analyzed to identify risk factors for GIAE. A total of 288 patients met inclusion criteria and 93 % of GURS was for urinary diversion following cystectomy. MD was closed in 194 cases ( 67 %). Median follow up was 19 months. Early ( < 30 day) GIAE rates were 16.5 % ( n = 32) and 21.3 % ( n = 20) in the closure and non-closure groups , respectively ( p = 0.22). The rate of early ileus/SBO requiring nasogastric tube decompression or laparotomy were similar after closure ( 15.0 %) and non-closure ( 21.3 %) ( p = .18). The late GIAE rates were 5.7 % ( n = 11) and 6.4 % ( n = 6) in the closure and non-closure cohorts , respectively ( p = 0.56). The rate of late SBO were similar and no cases of early or late SBO in either cohort were due to internal herniation. On multivariate analysis , increasing BMI was associated with both early and late GIAE. After harvesting ileum for urologic reconstruction , the MD can safely be left open as we found no association between non-closure and early or late GIAE..
