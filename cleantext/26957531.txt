  Coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality , and while most commonly is atherosclerotic , it can present with variable manifestations , both congenital and acquired. One such manifestation is coronary aneurysm<disease> , which is a localized dilatation of a coronary artery wall segment to greater than 1.5 times the adjacent normal segments. While a dilated outpouching of a coronary artery has been commonly classified as a coronary aneurysm<disease> , a non-dilated outpouching is rare and is referred to as a diverticulum , with only one previous case report in the literature. It is conceivable that other cases of coronary artery diverticulum may have been previously reported as an aneurysm<disease> , given the overlapping angiographic appearance. We present a case of a 72-year-old female patient with an incidental finding of left main coronary artery diverticulum on diagnostic coronary angiogram done for preoperative liver transplantation evaluation.
