  Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( eCRSwNP) is characterized by Th2-skewed inflammation<symptom> with eosinophilic infiltration. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP) promotes the development of allergic inflammation<symptom>. Although increased TSLP is found in eCRSwNP , little is known about whether TSLP regulates eotaxin-1 production , a potent eosinophil chemoattractant that recruits and activates eosinophils. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TSLP in eotaxin-1 production in the eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> of eCRSwNP. Human nasal epithelial cells ( HNECs) from eCRSwNP patients were stimulated with recombinant human TSLP in the presence or absence of CYT387 ( Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor). Phosphorylated signal transducer activator of transcription 3 ( p-STAT3) was measured by using immunocytochemistry. Eotaxin-1 expression was determined by using real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the levels of p-STAT3 and eotaxin-1 protein. The treatment with TSLP induced STAT3 phosphorylation in HNECs , and promoted p-STAT3 nuclear translocation , leading to a time-dependent increase of eotaxin-1 expression. However , these effects were attenuated by CYT387 pretreatment. TSLP regulated eotaxin-1 production in HNECs via JAK1/2-STAT 3 signaling , which might contribute to the eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> of eCRSwNP.
