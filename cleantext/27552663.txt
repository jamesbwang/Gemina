  Dental<disease> caries<disease> remains the most prevalent and costly oral infectious<disease> disease<disease> worldwide , encouraging the search for new and more effective antimicrobials. Therefore , the aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial action of selected phytochemicals ( eugenol , citronellol , sabinene hydrate , trans-cinnamaldehyde , terpineol and cinnamic acid) against The antibacterial activity of the selected compounds was evaluated by the determination of the minimal bactericidal concentration. The resazurin assay was used to assess the metabolic activity of sessile Among the tested phytochemicals , citronellol , cinnamic acid and trans-cinnamaldehyde were the most effective against both planktonic and sessile Citronellol , cinnamic acid and trans-cinnamaldehyde demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity proposing their potential as a novel group of therapeutic compounds to control oral infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Moreover , their effects are particularly relevant when benchmarked against eugenol , a phytochemical commonly used for prosthodontic applications in dentistry.
