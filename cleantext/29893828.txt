  Staphylococcal infections associated with indwelling medical devices are difficult to eradicate owing to its recalcitrant nature of biofilms to conventional antibiotics. In our earlier study , we reported the efficacy of geraniol ( GE) in inhibiting the in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> and adaptive resistant development. To examine the in vivo potential of GE in eradicating the in vivo colonization of S.<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> , an implanted rat jugular vein catheter model was developed. Oral supplementation of GE ( GE at 200 mg/kg bw for three days) in rats infected with S epidermidis exhibited a significant reduction of the bacterial burden in catheter , blood , heart and kidney , when compared to the untreated infection control. In addition , GE supplemented animals showed significantly reduced level of inflammatory markers such as nitric oxide and malondialdehyde in heart and kidney tissues. Furthermore , in contrast to the infection control , histopathology analysis of the heart and kidney tissues of the GE-treated group showed a normal histoarchitecture similar to animal control. Thus , the outcome of the present study exhibits the potential of GE as antibiofilm and anti-inflammatory agent against S epidermidis infections. Furthermore , elucidating the molecular mechanism of GE is important to exploit the therapeutic efficacy of GE.
