  The immobilization properties and cardiopulmonary effects following intramuscular administration of one of two chemical immobilization agents were compared in the Haitian giant galliwasp ( Celestus warreni) in a prospective , blinded , randomized controlled trial. Adult<disease> , clinically healthy galliwasps ( n = 30) were given a randomly assigned single intramuscular injection of either 15 mg/kg alfaxalone ( n = 15) or 40 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride ( n = 15). Heart rate , respiratory rate , and depth classification stage were recorded every 5 min; cloacal temperature was recorded every 15 min to ensure maintenance within this species ' preferred optimal temperature range ( 75-85 °F , 24-29 °C). Physical examination , radiographs , and phlebotomy were performed in all animals. Alfaxalone given intramuscularly resulted in reliable anesthetic induction , maintenance , and recovery ( total duration of anesthesia 57.7 ± 23.6 min , recovery 7.9 ± 7.8 min). Ketamine hydrochloride resulted in variable levels of sedation or anesthesia and a longer recovery ( total duration of anesthesia 14 ± 17.5 min , recovery 47.9 ± 19.3 min). Heart and respiratory rates remained within clinically acceptable ranges in all lizards using both protocols; however , alfaxalone animals had lower heart rates and respiratory rates associated with increased anesthetic depth as compared to ketamine hydrochloride animals ( heart rates: alfaxalone 59.6 ± 13.3 beats/min , ketamine hydrochloride 71.9 ± 7.9 beats/min; respiratory rates: alfaxalone 33.4 ± 16.8 breaths/min , ketamine hydrochloride 50.0 ± 16.2 breaths/min). Duration of anesthesia for alfaxalone-treated galliwasps was longer than previously reported in other studies. This study determined that a single injection of alfaxalone at 15 mg/kg administered intramuscularly can be used for consistent induction and maintenance of anesthesia and prompt recovery in the Haitian giant galliwasp , while ketamine hydrochloride even at 40 mg/kg was unreliable and is not recommended as a sole immobilization agent in the Haitian giant galliwasp.
