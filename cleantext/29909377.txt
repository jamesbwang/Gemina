  This study analyzed the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in cancer chemoprevention in patients with diabetes. This study was a posttrial follow-up of the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes ( JPAD) trial. Participants in the JPAD trial ( 2,536 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and without preexisting cardiovascular disease) were randomly allocated to receive aspirin ( 81 or 100 mg daily) or no aspirin. After that trial ended in 2008 , we followed up with the participants until 2015 , with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. The primary end point was total cancer incidence. We investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin on cancer incidence. During the median follow-up period of 10.7 years , a total of 318 cancers occurred. The cancer incidence was not significantly different between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups ( log-rank , Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cancer incidence in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
