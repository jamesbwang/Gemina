  Molecular dynamics simulations have found use in a wide variety of biomolecular applications , from protein folding kinetics to computational drug design to refinement of molecular structures. Two areas where users and developers frequently need to extend the built-in capabilities of most software packages are implementing custom interactions , for instance biases derived from experimental data , and running ensembles of simulations. We present a Python high-level interface for the popular simulation package GROMACS that 1) allows custom potential functions without modifying the simulation package code , 2) maintains the optimized performance of GROMACS , and 3) presents an abstract interface to building and executing computational graphs that allows transparent low-level optimization of data flow and task placement. Minimal dependencies make this integrated API for the GROMACS simulation engine simple , portable , and maintainable. We demonstrate this API for experimentally-driven refinement of protein conformational ensembles. LGPLv2 .1 source and instructions are available at https://github.com/kassonlab/gmxapi. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
