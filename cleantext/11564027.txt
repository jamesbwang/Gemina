  The published literature shows controversies with regard to the treatment of choice for longer stricture. Augmented anastomotic urethroplasty ( AAU) was described for long bulbar urethral strictures with an extended area of narrowing and fibrosis<disease> , the technique combines the advantages of both anastomosis and graft substitution. We aimed to compare the dorsal and ventral strip anastomosis in the AAU. A retrospective Review was conducted at the Department of Urology , Sohag University Hospital; we included adult patients with long bulbar urethral strictures ( > 2 cm) who underwent dorsal or ventral strip AAU. Patients were followed at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively for subjective improvements. The statistical analysis was carried with SPSS software version 24 for windows. At the end of follow-up , stricture recurrence occurred in 5 ( 12.5 %) in ventral strip group compared to 6 ( 23.1 %) in dorsal group , the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.5). With regard to safety outcomes , there was no statistically significant difference between both groups in any of the postoperative complications , except post-void dribbling which showed higher incidence in dorsal strip group ( p < 0.001). In conclusion , both dorsal strip and ventral strip techniques are feasible for long bulbar urethral strictures with comparable postoperative efficacy outcomes and high success rate.
