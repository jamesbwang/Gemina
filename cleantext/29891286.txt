  Normal wheat , waxy wheat and waxy maize starches were cross-linked with 0.01 , 0.03 and 0.06 % ( sb) phosphorus oxychloride. The objective of this study was to correlate the morphology changes and settling volume to the pasting properties of those cross-linked and unmodified starches. Pasting and microscopic data for waxy maize starch and its cross-linked products was similar to waxy wheat starch , except changes occurred at ∼ 5 °C higher in temperature. At 6 % solids , waxy wheat starch cross-linked with 0.01 % POCl
