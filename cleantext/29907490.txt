  The aim of this multi-institutional study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carbon-ion radiotherapy ( C-ion RT) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( LAPC). Patients with LAPC treated with C-ion RT from April 2012 to December 2014 at 3 institutions were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with pathologically-confirmed invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were eligible. The prescribed dose was 52.8 Gy ( relative biological effectiveness weighted absorbed dose; RBE) or 55.2 Gy ( RBE) in 12 fractions. Overall survival ( OS) , distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS) , local recurrence ( LR) , and toxicity were evaluated. In total , 72 patients were included in this study. Tumors in the head of the pancreas were seen in 30 patients ( 42 %) , while those in the body or tail of the pancreas were seen in 42 patients ( 58 %). Fifty-six patients ( 78 %) received concurrent chemotherapy. The OS rates were 73 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 62 % -84 %) at 1 year , and 46 % ( 95 % CI , 31 % -61 %) at 2 years with a median OS of 21.5 months ( 95 % CI , 11.8-31.2 months). The 1- and 2-year DMFS rates were 41 % ( 95 % CI , 29 % -52 %) and 28 % ( 95 % CI , 16 % -40 %) , respectively. The 1- and 2-year cumulative incidences of LR were 16 % ( 95 % CI , 9 % -26 %) and 24 % ( 95 % CI , 14 % -36 %) , respectively. Nineteen patients ( 26 %) experienced acute grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities. Two patients ( 3 %) had grade 3 anorexia<symptom> Late gastrointestinal ( GI) grade 3 toxicity was observed in 1 patient ( 1 %). No patients developed late grade 4 or 5 toxicity. The first multi-institutional analysis of C-ion RT for LAPC indicated relatively favorable outcomes with limited toxicities , especially for tumors not in close proximity to GI tract.
