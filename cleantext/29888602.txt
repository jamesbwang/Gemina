  ( +)- and (-)- Mangelonoids A and B , two pairs of novel macrocyclic diterpenoid enantiomers featuring an unprecedented bicyclo ( 9.3.1) pentadecane core and a rare bridgehead double bond , were isolated from Croton mangelong. Their structures were unambiguously established using spectroscopic data , X-ray crystallography , and electronic circular dichroism analysis. A plausible biosynthesis pathway for these compounds was proposed. (-)- Mangelonoid A exhibited NF-ÎºB inhibition with an IC
