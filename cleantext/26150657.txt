  Germline and somatic genomic variation represent the bulk of ` omics data available for precision medicine research. These data , however , may fail to capture the dynamic biological processes that underlie disease development , particularly for chronic<disease> diseases<disease> of aging such as chronic kidney disease ( CKD). To demonstrate the value of additional dynamic precision medicine data , we sequenced somatic T-cell receptor rearrangements , markers of the adaptive immune response , from genomic DNA collected during a clinical encounter from 15 participants with CKD and associated co-morbidities. Participants were consented as part of a larger precision medicine research project at the MetroHealth System , a large urban public hospital in Cleveland , Ohio. Despite the limited sample size , we observed reduced T-cell receptor diversity in relation to biomarkers ( creatinine and BUN) of CKD status in this older and mostly African American sample. Overall , these data suggest a relationship between advanced CKD and premature aging of the adaptive immune system and highlight the potential of dynamic ` omic data to generate novel hypotheses about disease mechanisms and unique opportunities for precision medicine applications.
