  To use Magnetic Resonance Imaging to define the innate pelvic neurovascular course and prostate anatomy in infants with classic bladder exstrophy before their pelvis is altered by surgery. Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed on male classic bladder exstrophy infants and compared to a group of age matched controls. Data collected included the prostatic dimensions as well as the course of the prostatic artery , periprostatic vessels , and pudendal neurovasculature. Classic bladder exstrophy prostates were larger in the transverse ( p < 0.001) and anterior-posterior ( p < 0.001) dimensions than in normal prostates , but were smaller in the cranial-caudal dimension ( p < 0.001). This resulted in a larger calculated prostate volume in classic bladder exstrophy when compared with control patients ( p = 0.015). The pelvic vasculature and prostatic artery follow a similar course in classic bladder exstrophy and control patients. Relative to each other , the lateral to medial course of the prostatic arteries in classic bladder exstrophy males was less pronounced than that of normal males. A similar externally rotated pattern is seen when both sides of the pudendal vasculature are compared in classic bladder exstrophy males. The prostate in classic bladder exstrophy infants has a consistent configuration and dimensions that differ from prostates in normal infants. When both sides are compared , the periprostatic vasculature and penile sensory neurovascular bundles are externally rotated in classic bladder exstrophy infants. They all course along the same landmarks in normal and classic bladder exstrophy patients.
