  Despite increasing recognition of the critical importance of legal status for understanding the well-being of immigrants and their families , there has been scant research on this topic due to data limitations. Using Wave 1 of the Los Angles Family and Neighborhood Survey ( 2000-2002) and the 2000 decennial census , we investigate how parenting strain among Mexican-origin mothers varies by legal status and neighborhood context. We find significant differences in parenting strain by nativity and legal status , with undocumented mothers reporting the lowest level. Results from multilevel models with cross-level interactions reveal that the influence of neighborhood immigrant concentration differs by legal status. Percent foreign born in the neighborhood is associated with reduced parenting strain for documented Mexican-origin mothers while it is associated with heightened parenting strain for undocumented Mexican-origin mothers. Findings provide empirical support for the need to recognize legal status distinctions in studies of the well-being of immigrants and their families.
