  To investigate mitral valve posterior leaflet and subvalvular reconstruction using a 2-ply small intestinal submucosal extracellular matrix sheet. Mitral valve posterior leaflet and subvalvular reconstruction was characterized in an acute 80-kg porcine model with 7 pigs acting as their own controls. The characterization was based on pressure catheter measurements of pressure differences to identify mitral regurgitation , stenosis and systolic anterior motion. Furthermore , echocardiography was used for the evaluation of leaflet mobility and geometry , whereas sonomicrometry was used to describe annular and subvalvular geometry. The reconstructed mitral valve was fully functional without any signs of regurgitation ( peak left atrial pressure for baseline and reconstruction 12 ± 2 mmHg vs 11 ± 2 mmHg , P = 0.550) , mitral valve stenosis ( mean pressure difference across the mitral valve 4.8 ± 2.3 mmHg vs 4.1 ± 2.3 mmHg , P = 0.589) or systolic anterior motion. The echocardiographic characterization revealed septal-lateral downsizing , reduced tenting area , increased coaptation length ( 6.0 ± 0.6 mm vs 8.7 ± 2.3 mm , P = 0.002) and an atrial bend of the reconstructed posterior leaflet. A ballooning effect of the patch material was present at the posterior annular segment. Mitral valve posterior leaflet and subvalvular reconstruction using a 2-ply small intestinal submucosal extracellular matrix sheet as patch material was possible in an acute porcine model. The reconstructed mitral valve was fully functional without signs of mitral valve stenosis , valve regurgitation , stenosis or systolic anterior motion. The ballooning appearance of the patch material might , however , constitute an altered leaflet stress distribution in this area.
