  Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is one of the major malignant tumors leading to death. Chronic hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection is an important risk factor for HCC initiation. HBx protein , encoded by HBV X gene , is a significant factor that promotes HBV related HCC , although the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. This article summarizes the pathological roles and related mechanisms of HBx in HCC. HBx plays a carcinogenic role by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis , angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis in HCC. Detailed study of the biological functions of HBx will help to elucidate the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis and lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets for treating HBV-related HCC.
