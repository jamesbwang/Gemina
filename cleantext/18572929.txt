  Angiotensin II ( Ang II) plays a profibrotic role in the kidneys. Although many pathways of Ang II have been discovered , the morphological and mechanical aspects have not been well investigated. We observed the changes in tubular epithelial cells ( TECs) after Ang II treatment with or without Ang II receptor blockers ( ARBs) using atomic force microscopy ( AFM). TECs were stimulated with Ang II with or without telmisartan , PD123319 , and blebbistatin. AFM was performed to measure the cellular stiffness , cell volume , and cell surface roughness. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers were determined via immunocytochemistry. After Ang II stimulation , cells transformed to a flattened and elongated mesenchymal morphology. Cell surface roughness and volume significantly increased in Ang II treated TECs. Ang II also induced an increase in phospho-myosin light chain and F-actin and a decrease in E-cadherin. Ang II coincubation with either telmisartan or blebbistatin attenuated these Ang II-induced changes. We report , for the first time , the use of AFM in directly observing the changes in TECs after Ang II treatment with or without ARBs. Simultaneously , we successfully measured the selective effect of PD123319 or blebbistatin. AFM could be a noninvasive evaluating strategy for cellular processes in TECs.
