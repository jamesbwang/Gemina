  The objective of the research described in this Research Communication was to describe potential associations of subclinical mastitis<symptom> with sheep breeds in Greece. A countrywide survey ( 2198 ewes in 111 farms) was performed. Prevalence of subclinical mastitis<symptom> was 0 · 260. Results did not indicate any difference in the prevalence of subclinical mastitis<symptom> between farms with pure-bred and farms with cross-bred animals , nor any difference in prevalence between farms with Greek pure-bred animals and farms with imported pure-bred animals. Results indicated that prevalence of subclinical mastitis<symptom> was smaller in farms with Assaf-breed ( 0 · 100) and higher in farms with Frisarta-breed ( 0 · 625) ( P < 0 · 02). Prevalence of mastitis<symptom> was smaller in farms with Greek traditional indigenous breeds ( 0 · 221) ( P = 0 · 007). In a model that included sheep breed and management system in farm , breed emerged as a significant factor for prevalence of subclinical mastitis<symptom> ( P = 0 · 003).
