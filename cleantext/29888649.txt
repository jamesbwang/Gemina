  In September 2013 , President Correa balanced himself on a felled log over an oil waste pit in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Extending a bare hand dripping with crude , he launched La Mano Sucia de Chevron campaign , demanding accountability for decades of contamination. This article explores the role of bodily knowledge in witnessing industrial contamination and struggles for environmental justice. Situating the mano sucia in the history of activism in the region , I show how the juxtaposition of different hands within the same motif reveals profoundly asymmetric relationships to the toxic entanglements that oil produces. Dirtied hands reveal the co-production of toxicity and power in extractive landscapes: At times throughout this article , the gesture calls for corporate accountability and distributive environmental justice , at other times , it reveals the systemic production of material , social and political distance between the accrual of benefit and the production of harm in an industrial-capitalist order. While drawing on the central role of bodily knowledges in apprehending environmental harm , I argue that bodily knowledges must also be examined for their specific relationships to forms of power and exploitation , and for their potential for appropriation by other parties- even when dedicated to condemning environmental injustice.
