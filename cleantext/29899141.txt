  Post-replicative correction of replication errors by the mismatch repair ( MMR) system is critical for suppression of mutations. Although the MMR system may need to handle nucleosomes at the site of chromatin replication , how MMR occurs in the chromatin environment remains unclear. Here , we show that nucleosomes are excluded from a > 1-kb region surrounding a mismatched base pair in
