  To compare the effectiveness of a comprehensive non-surgical training program to a self-directed approach in improving walking ability in lumbar spinal stenosis. Randomized controlled trial. Academic hospital outpatient clinic. A total of 104 participants with neurogenic claudication and imaging confirmed LSS were randomized. The mean age was 70.6 years , 57 % were female , 84 % had leg symptoms for more than 12-months and the mean maximum walking capacity was 328.7 m. A six-week structured comprehensive training program or a six-week self-directed program. Continuous walking distance in meters ( m) measured by the Self-Paced Walk Test ( SPWT) and proportion of participants achieving at least 30 % improvement ( MCID) in the SPWT at 6-months. Secondary outcomes included the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire ( ZCQ) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) , ODI walk score and the Short-Form General Health Survey ( SF-36) subscales. Forty-eight verses 51 participants who were randomized to comprehensive ( n = 51) or self-directed ( n = 53) treatment respectively , received the intervention and 89 % of the total study sample completed the study. At 6-months the adjusted mean difference in walking distance from baseline was 421.0 m ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 181.4 to 660.6 ;-RRB- favoring the comprehensive program and 82 % of participants in the comprehensive group and 63 % in the self-directed group achieved the MCID , ( adjusted relative risk ( RR) , 1.3; 95 % CI , 1.0 to1 .7; P = 0.03). Both primary treatment effects persisted at 12-months favoring the comprehensive program. At 6-months the ODI walk score and at 12-months the ZCQ , SF-36 physical function and bodily pain scores showed greater improvements favoring the comprehensive program. A comprehensive conservative program demonstrated superior , large and sustained improvements in walking ability and can be a safe non-surgical treatment option for patients with neurogenic claudication due to LSS.
