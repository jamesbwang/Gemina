  High blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) affects over one billion people and is the leading risk factor for global mortality. While many lifestyle and genetic risk factors are well-accepted to increase BP , the role of the external environment is typically overlooked. Mounting evidence now supports that numerous environmental factors can promote an elevation in BP. Broadly speaking these include aspects of the natural environment ( e.g. , cold temperatures , higher altitude , and winter season) , natural disasters ( e.g. , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions) , and man-made exposures ( e.g. , noise , air pollutants , and toxins/chemicals). This is important for health care providers to recognize as one ( or several) of these environmental factors could be playing a clinically meaningful role in elevating BP or disrupting hypertension control among their patients. At the population level , certain environmental exposures may even be contributing to the growing pandemic of hypertension. Here we provide an updated review of the literature linking environment exposures with high BP and outline practical recommendations for clinicians.
