  As one of the most serious meteorological disasters in modern society , air pollution has received extensive attention from both citizens and decision-makers. With the complexity of pollution components and the uncertainty of prediction , it is both critical and challenging to construct an effective and practical early-warning system. In this paper , a novel hybrid air quality early-warning system for pollution contaminant monitoring and analysis was proposed. To improve the efficiency of the system , an advanced attribute selection method based on fuzzy evaluation and rough set theory was developed to select the main pollution contaminants for cities. Moreover , a hybrid model composed of the theory of `` decomposition and ensemble '' , an extreme learning machine and an advanced heuristic algorithm was developed for pollution contaminant prediction; it provides deterministic and interval forecasting for tackling the uncertainty of future air quality. Daily pollution contaminants of six major cities in China were selected as a dataset to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of the developed air quality early-warning system. The superior experimental performance determined by the values of several error indexes illustrated that the proposed early-warning system was of great effectiveness and efficiency.
