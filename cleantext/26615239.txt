  To report daily total fluid intake ( TFI) and fluid types in Indonesia according to age , sex , socio-economic status ( SES) and geographic region , and compare TFI with the Indonesian adequate fluid intake ( AI) recommendations. Data were collected in 32 cities over nine regions from children ( 4-9 years , n = 388) , adolescents , ( 10-17 years , n = 478) and adults ( 18-65 years , n = 2778) using a fluid intake 7-day record ( Liq.In Total median fluid intakes for all age groups exceeded 2000 mL/day. At population level , TFI was associated with household income ( P < 0.001) , education ( P < 0.001) and Indonesian geographical regions ( P < 0.001). More than 67 % of participants met the AI of water from fluids. A higher percentage of children and adolescents met the AI ( 78 and 80 % , respectively) , compared with adults ( 72 %). Drinking water was the main contributor to TFI in all age groups ( 76-81 %). Sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSB) were consumed by 62 % children , 72 % adolescents and 61 % of adults. An SSB intake â‰¥ 1 serving per day was observed for 24 % children , 41 % adolescents and 33 % adults. A high percentage of the population drank enough to meet the AI of water from fluids. Water was the most frequently consumed drink; however , many participants consumed at least one serving of SSB per day. This study provides data to help direct targeted intervention programs.
