  A recent meta-analysis identified a prospective association between depression<symptom> and cardiovascular disease; however , there was no association for studies with long-term follow-up periods. The literature has primarily focused on baseline depression<symptom> status<symptom> or symptoms , which may not capture the chronic nature of depression<symptom> This study examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular disease up to 15 years later in 274 cardiovascular disease-free older adults. Depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms , mean arterial pressure , and cardiovascular disease status were assessed. Baseline and chronic depressive symptoms predicted increased risk of cardiovascular disease , underscoring the importance of assessing and treating depression<symptom> in older adults.
