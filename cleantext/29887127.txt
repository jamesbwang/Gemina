  Higher patient-caregiver mutuality is associated with improved patient and caregiver outcomes , but no studies have tested the psychometric characteristics of the mutuality scale ( MS) in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) patient and caregiver population. To test the validity and reliability of the MS. A cross-sectional design. The MS validity and reliability were tested with confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) and hypothesis testing , and with Cronbach 's alpha and model-based internal consistency index , respectively. CFA supported the validity of the MS in the HF patient and caregiver versions. Hypothesis testing showed significant correlations between both versions of the MS and anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , quality of life , and self-care. Also , MS caregiver version scores correlated significantly with caregiver preparedness. Cronbach 's alphas and the model-based internal consistency index ranged between 0.72 and 0.94 in both versions. The Mutuality Scale showed supportive validity and reliability for HF patients and caregivers.
