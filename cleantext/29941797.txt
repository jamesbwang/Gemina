  Reelin depletion and stress seem to affect similar pathways including GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling and both are implicated in psychiatric disorders in late adolescence/early adulthood. The interaction between reelin depletion and stress , however , remains unclear. To investigate this , male and female heterozygous reelin mice ( HRM) and wildtype ( WT) controls were treated with the stress hormone , corticosterone ( CORT) , during late adolescence to simulate chronic stress. Glucocorticoid receptors ( GR) ,
