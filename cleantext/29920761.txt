  The fathead minnow fish embryo toxicity ( FET) test has been proposed as a more humane alternative to current toxicity testing methods , as younger organisms are thought to experience less distress during toxicant exposure. However , the FET test protocol does not include endpoints that allow for the prediction of sublethal adverse outcomes , limiting its utility relative to other test types. Researchers have proposed the development of sublethal endpoints for the FET test to increase its utility. The present study 1) developed methods for previously unmeasured sublethal metrics in fathead minnows ( i.e. , spontaneous contraction frequency and heart rate) and 2) investigated the responsiveness of several sublethal endpoints related to growth ( wet weight , length , and growth-related gene expression) , neurodevelopment ( spontaneous contraction frequency , and neurodevelopmental gene expression) , and cardiovascular function and development ( pericardial area , eye size and cardiovascular related gene expression) as additional FET test metrics using the model toxicant 3,4-dichloroaniline. Of the growth , neurological and cardiovascular endpoints measured , length , eye size and pericardial area were found to more responsive than the other endpoints , respectively. Future studies linking alterations in these endpoints to longer-term adverse impacts are needed to fully evaluate the predictive power of these metrics in chemical and whole effluent toxicity testing.
