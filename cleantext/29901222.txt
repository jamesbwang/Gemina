  Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy of high-pressure freezing ( HPF) samples is a well-established technique for the analysis of liquid containing specimens. This technique enables observation without removing water or other volatile components. The HPF technique is less used in scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) due to the lack of a suitable HPF specimen carrier adapter. The traditional SEM cryotransfer system ( PP3000T Quorum Laughton , East Sussex , UK; Alto Gatan , Pleasanton , CA , USA) usually uses nitrogen slush. Unfortunately , and unlike HPF , nitrogen slush produces water crystal artefacts. So , we propose a new HPF specimen carrier adapter for sample transfer from HPF system to cryogenic-scanning electronic microscope ( Cryo-SEM). The new transfer system is validated using technical two applications , a stearic acid in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution and mice myocardium. Preservation of samples is suitable in both cases. Cryo-SEM examination of HPF samples enables a good correlation between acid stearic liquid concentration and acid stearic occupation surface ( only for homogeneous solution). For biological samples as myocardium , cytoplasmic structures of cardiomyocyte are easily recognized with adequate preservation of organelle contacts and inner cell organization. We expect this new HPF specimen carrier adapter would enable more SEM-studies using HPF.
