  The study describes functional outcomes and health-related quality of life ( HRQL) in patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) 20 years postinjury. Forty-four survivors who acquired moderate and severe TBI during 1995-1996 were followed 10 and 20 years postinjury. Outcomes were Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended ( GOSE) , Community Integration Questionnaire ( CIQ) , and SF-36 questionnaire ( SF-36). Multiple regressions were performed to examine the relationship between follow-up measurements , controlling for baseline demographics and injury severity. There were no significant differences in baseline age and civil status between moderate and severe TBI , but patients with severe injury had significantly lower employment rates ( p = 0.05). Mean age at 20-years follow-up was 50.8 ( SD 11.4) years , and 73 % were males. Most patients showed good recovery ( 52 %) or moderate disability ( 43 %). Disability levels remained stable between and within severity groups from 10 to 20 years. Community integration including social integration improved from 10 to 20 years ( p = 0.01 and p = 0.005 , respectively). HRQL remained stable , except for subscales Bodily Pain and Role Emotional ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.06). Depression<symptom> at 10 years and females were associated with poorer mental health , while productive activity at 10 years indicated better physical and mental health at 20 years postinjury , respectively. Functional limitations persist even decades after moderate and severe TBI , with poorer prognosis for females and persons who were depressed at the 10-year follow-up. Development and evaluation of targeted long-term follow-up programs and access to rehabilitation services for these groups should be highlighted. Improved community integration despite stable functional limitations draws attention to long-term adaptation to adversity and illness.
