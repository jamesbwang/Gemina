  Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of R0 resection of thymoma to identify prognostic factors for long-term outcomes. Methods Data of 62 patients ( 28 male , 34 female) with a mean age of 47.26 ± 14.42 years , who underwent R0 resection for thymoma and were followed-up between February 2004 and March 2016 , were analyzed retrospectively. Results Eight patients had a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy and 54 had a transsternal extended thymectomy. During a mean follow-up of 128.67 ± 7.95 months , regional recurrence of thymoma was observed in 9 ( 14.5 %) patients. Overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 85.36 % and 78.20 % , respectively. The 5- and 10-year survival rates in patients aged < 50 years were significantly better than in those aged ≥ 50 years ( 92 % and 72 % vs. 88 % and 39 % , p < 0.0001). The 10-year overall survival of patients in Masaoka stage I and II was better than those in stage III ( 88.9 % , 78.4 % , 69.8 % , respectively , log-rank p < 0.001). The 10-year survival of patients with World Health Organization histological type A , AB , and B1 thymomas was better than those with type B2 and B3 ( log-rank test p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis , age < 50 years ( p = 0.001) , Masaoka stage ( p = 0.006) , histological type ( p = 0.001) , and recurrence ( p = 0.04) were independent prognostic factors for survival. Conclusion Our study indicates that age < 50 years , Masaoka stage , histological type , and recurrence are the determinants of survival in surgically resected cases of thymoma.
