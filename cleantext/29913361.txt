  Exploratory research quantifying the change of spasticity among patients who underwent baclofen intrathecal drug delivery system ( IDDS) implantation. 88 patients with a baclofen IDDS were identified. Patient characteristics , spasticity scores pre/post intrathecal baclofen test dose , and IDDS perioperative implantation records were collected. The primary outcome was to quantify the extent to which there was a change in Modified Ashworth Scores ( MAS) pre/post-intrathecal baclofen test dose administration. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of perioperative IDDS implantation complications. The mean age at IDDS implant was 44.2 years ( range , 19-71) , and 62.5 % were male. 45.5 % had spasticity of spinal cord origin , 9 % of cerebral origin , and 45.5 % of other upper motor neuron dysfunction. Reduction of MAS in the spinal cord origin group was 2.6 ( mean , 3.5 to 0.9) , cerebral origin group was 2.9 ( mean , 3.3 to 0.4) , and other origin group was 2.5 ( mean , 3.6 to 1.1). In all patients , post dural puncture headache<symptom> was the most commonly reported complication at 22.7 %. This report offers novel findings documenting a quantifiable change of at least two points on the MAS before and after intrathecal baclofen test dose as statistically significant and could prove to be useful information to enhance the decision making process to proceed with intrathecal baclofen beyond assessment of functional abilities.
