  This study aimed to determine the causal effect of the number of lay counselors employed at a primary care clinic in rural South Africa on the number of clinic-based HIV<pathogen> tests performed. Fixed effects panel analysis. We collected monthly data on the number of lay counselors employed and HIV<pathogen> tests performed at nine primary care clinics in rural KwaZulu-Natal from January 2014 to December 2015. Using clinic- and month-level fixed effects regressions , we exploited the fact that lay counselors were removed from clinics at two quasi-random time points by a redeployment policy. A total of 24,526 HIV<pathogen> tests were conducted over the study period. 21 of 27 lay counselors were removed across the nine clinics in the two redeployment waves. A ten percent reduction in the number of lay counselors was associated with a 4.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.8- 7.0 , p < 0.001) decrease in the number of HIV<pathogen> tests performed. In absolute terms , losing one lay counselor from a clinic was associated with a mean of 29.7 ( 95 % CI: 21.2- 38.2 , p < 0.001) fewer HIV<pathogen> tests carried out at the clinic per month. This study provides evidence for the crucial role that lay counselors play in the HIV<pathogen> response in rural South Africa. More broadly , this analysis supports the use of lay cadres in the HIV<pathogen> response and by extension UNAIDS ' and the African Union 's goal to triple the number of community health workers in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020.
