  In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office some 14 years ago , a ` religiously inspired approach ' was proposed to combat tobacco use. This promoted a useful debate in the region. The purpose of this paper is to argue the need to identify the role which Islamic beliefs and teachings play ( 1) in influencing individual motivation to quit smoking and ( 2) in gaining support for public policies to reduce smoking. Ramadan and Hajj are taken as key points. These , it is argued , are times when Muslim religious motivation to abstain from smoking is strongest. This paper concludes that there is an insufficient evidence base on which to adopt a religiously inspired approach. All of civil society , including religious Muslim authorities , should rather supplement the efforts of health professionals to encourage smoking cessation.
