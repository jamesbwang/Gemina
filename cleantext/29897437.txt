  To evaluate the influence of a history of cancer on clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease ( CAD) patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). In the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/coronary bypass grafting ( CABG) Registry Cohort-2 , there were 12,180 CAD patients who received PCI with stents. There were 1109 patients with a history of cancer ( cancer group) , and 11,071 patients without cancer ( non-cancer group). The cumulative 5-year incidences of cardiac death and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) hospitalization were significantly higher in the cancer group than in the non-cancer group ( 12.4 % versus 7.5 % , P < 0.001 , and 12.1 % versus 7.6 % , P < 0.001 , respectively). Even after adjusting for confounders , the excess risk of the cancer group relative to non-cancer group for cardiac death and HF hospitalization remained significant ( HR: 1.27 , 95 % CI: 1.05-1.53 , P = 0.02 , and HR: 1.39 , 95 % CI: 1.13 to 1.68 , P = 0.002 , respectively). Also , the cancer group had a trend toward higher adjusted risk for definite or probable stent thrombosis as compared with the non-cancer group ( HR: 1.49 , 95 % CI: 0.99 to 2.16 , P = 0.055). The cancer group had significantly higher adjusted risk for all-cause death , non-cardiac death , major bleeding , and non-CABG surgery than the non-cancer group , while the risks for myocardial infarction and stroke were neutral between the 2 groups. Patients with a history of cancer at the time of PCI had increased risk for cardiac events such as cardiac death and HF hospitalization as well as non-cardiac events such as non-cardiac death , major bleeding , and non-CABG surgery.
