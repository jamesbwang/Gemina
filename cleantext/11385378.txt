  The aim of this study was to determine CT risk findings predictive of temporary neurological<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> ( TND) and permanent neurological<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> ( PND) after surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection ( ATAAD). A total of 255 patients ( 41 Â± 16 years , 79 % male) with ATAAD underwent aortic CT angiography ( CTA) and surgical repair consecutively from January 2013 to June 2016. The CTA findings of the 255 patients for the thoracic aorta and carotid artery were analysed to identify risk factors predictive of TND and PND. Thirty-eight patients ( 15 %) suffered TND , and 18 ( 7 %) exhibited PND. Common carotid artery ( CCA) dissection ( OR = 4.63) , lower enhancement of unilateral ICA ( OR = 3.02) and aortic arch tears ( OR = 2.83) were predictors of postoperative TND , while PND was best predicted by retrograde ascending aorta ( aAO) dissection ( OR = 5.62) and aortic arch tears ( OR = 6.74). In CCA dissection , the extent of the entire CCA and proximal ICA ( P = 0.014) , a low-enhancement false lumen with re-entry ( P = 0.000) and a severely narrowed true lumen without re-entry ( P = 0.005) significantly increased the risk of postoperative TND. In patients with ATAAD , specific CT findings allow the individual risk of postoperative TND and PND to be identified and may guide subsequent surgical management.
