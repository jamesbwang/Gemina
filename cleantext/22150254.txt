  An increasing cancer incidence affecting any age and social class is putting serious strain on populations and health care systems around the world. This systematic literature search aims ( i) to examine the correlation of heart rate variability ( HRV) and cancer patients ' prognosis , ( ii) to examine the relationship of HRV and clinicopathological features , and ( iii) to compare HRV between different patient groups , and between patient and control groups. We conducted a systematic literature review following the PRISMA Statement. We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for publications released by December 2017. The search terms were: `` cancer '' AND `` heart rate variability '' AND `` human '' NOT `` animal '' NOT `` review. '' A total of 19 studies were finally included in this review. Most publications were high-quality observational studies. The studies showed that higher HRV correlated positively with patients ' progression of disease and outcome. Thus , we conclude that individuals with higher HRV and advanced coping mechanisms seem to have a better prognosis in cancer progression. HRV appears to be a useful aspect to access the general health status of cancer patients.
