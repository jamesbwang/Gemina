  Diagnosing underlying arrhythmia in ED syncope patients remains problematic. This study investigates diagnostic yield , event prevalence , patient satisfaction and compliance , and influence on resource utilisation of an ambulatory patch monitor in unexplained ED syncope patients. Prospective pilot study conducted in a single tertiary ED in Scotland between 17 November 2015 and 16 June 2017 with a historical unmatched comparator group. Patients 16 years or over presenting within 6 hours of unexplained syncope were fitted in the ED with an ambulatory patch ECG recorder ( Zio XT monitor) , which continuously records a single-lead ECG for up to 14 days. Patients with an obvious underlying cause were excluded. An unmatched historical group of 603 syncope patients with no obvious diagnosis in ED , recruited to a prior cohort study ( 2007-2008) , were used as a comparator. Primary endpoint was symptomatic significant arrhythmia at 90-day follow-up. During the prospective study period , 86 patients were recruited. 90-day diagnostic yield for symptomatic significant arrhythmia was 10.5 % ( 95 % CI 4.0 to 16.9; 9 of 86) versus 2.0 % ( 95 % CI 0.9 to 3.1; 12 of 603) in the comparator group. 24 patients ( 27.9 %) had a significant arrhythmia ( five serious); 26 patients ( 30.2 %) had serious outcomes ( major adverse cardiac event and/or death). Blinded patch report review suggested the patch would significantly reduce requirement for standard outpatient ambulatory ECG monitoring. 56 of 76 returned patches had a diagnostic finding within Â± 45 s of a triggered/diary event ( 73.7 % diagnostic utility; 95 % CI 63.7 to 83.6); 34 of 56 ( 61 %) for sinus rhythm or ectopic beats only. Routine , early ambulatory ECG monitoring in ED patients with unexplained syncope is probably warranted. A large-scale trial comparing this approach to standard care with cost-effectiveness and safety analysis is now required. NCT02683174.
