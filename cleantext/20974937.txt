  In recent years , an increasing number of Campylobacter<pathogen> species have been associated with human gastrointestinal ( GI) diseases<pathogen> including gastroenteritis<pathogen> , inflammatory bowel disease<pathogen> , and colorectal cancer. Campylobacter<pathogen> concisus<pathogen> , an oral commensal historically linked to gingivitis<pathogen> and periodontitis<pathogen> , has been increasingly detected in the lower GI tract. In the present study , we generated robust genome sequence data from C.<pathogen> concisus<pathogen> strains and undertook a comprehensive pangenome assessment to identify C.<pathogen> concisus<pathogen> virulence properties and to explain potential adaptations acquired while residing in specific ecological niche ( s) of the GI tract. Genomes of 53 new C.<pathogen> concisus<pathogen> strains were sequenced , assembled , and annotated including 36 strains from gastroenteritis<pathogen> patients , 13 strains from Crohn 's disease<pathogen> patients and four strains from colitis<pathogen> patients ( three collagenous colitis<pathogen> and one lymphocytic colitis).<pathogen> When compared with previous published sequences , strains clustered into two main groups/genomospecies ( GS) with phylogenetic clustering explained neither by disease<pathogen> phenotype nor sample location. Paired oral/faecal isolates , from the same patient , indicated that there are few genetic differences between oral and gut isolates which suggests that gut isolates most likely reflect oral strain relocation. Type IV and VI secretion systems genes , genes known to be important for pathogenicity in the Campylobacter<pathogen> genus , were present in the genomes assemblies , with 82 % containing Type VI secretion system genes. Our findings indicate that C.<pathogen> concisus<pathogen> strains are genetically diverse , and the variability in bacterial secretion system content may play an important role in their virulence potential.
