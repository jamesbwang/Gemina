  Plastic particle accumulation in arable soils is a growing contaminant of concern with unknown consequences for soil productivity and quality. This study aimed to investigate abundance and distribution of plastic particles among soil aggregate fractions in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest<disease> buffer zone at Dian Lake , southwestern China. Plastic particles ( 10-0.05 mm) from fifty soil samples were extracted and then sorted by size , counted , and categorized. Plastic particles were found in all soil samples. The concentration of plastic particles ranges from 7100 to 42,960 particles kg
