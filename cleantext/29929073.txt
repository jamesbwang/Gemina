  Marine Protected Areas ( MPAs) are important tools to achieve marine conservation and resources management goals. The management effectiveness of MPAs ( the degree to which MPAs achieve their goals) is highly variable and can be affected by many MPA attributes , for example their design , enforcement and age. Another key factor possibly affecting MPA management effectiveness is the management performance , here conceived according to Horigue et al. definition ( 2014) as the `` level of effort exerted to enhance and sustain management of MPAs ''. Organization Science ( OS) , the discipline that studies organizations , can offer a useful framework to assess and interpret MPA management performance. Using an exploratory multiple case study approach , we applied OS principles to 11 Mediterranean MPAs in order to: i) characterize several MPA organizational features; ii) assess MPA management performance ( evaluated as the effort deployed in , for example , planning the future , formalizing measurable goals , and implementing specific strategies). Results show that a number of organizational features and networking attributes are highly variable among the MPAs we have studied. For instance , goals are seldom measurable and the strategy to achieve goals is not systematically pursued. Two relevant outcomes emerge from this exploratory study: i) the management performance of the MPAs considered needs considerable improvements; ii) the methods and the approach proposed could help MPAs ' managers and policy makers to understand how to improve their management performance and , consequently , their effectiveness.
