  Erdheim-Chester disease ( ECD) is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the infiltration of multiple tissues with lipid-laden histiocytes. Cardiovascular involvement is frequent in ECD and leads to a severe prognosis. The objective of this study was to determine whether an alteration of lipid metabolism participates in the lipid accumulation in histiocytes and the cardiovascular involvement in ECD. An analysis of plasma lipid levels indicated that male ECD patients carrying the Our findings indicate that hypoalphalipoproteinemia in male ECD patients carrying the
