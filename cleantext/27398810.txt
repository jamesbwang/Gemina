  The photoregulation of nucleic acids by azobenzene photoswitches has recently attracted considerable interest in the context of emerging biotechnological applications. To understand the mechanism of photoinduced isomerisation and conformational control in these complex biological environments , we employ a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics ( QM/MM) approach in conjunction with nonadiabatic Surface Hopping ( SH) dynamics. Two representative RNA-azobenzene complexes are investigated , both of which contain the azobenzene chromophore covalently attached to an RNA double strand
