  Low vitamin D levels have been linked to the risk of sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB) in children. Although adenotonsillar hypertrophy ( ATH) is the major contributor to childhood SDB , the relationship between ATH and serum vitamin D is uncertain. We therefore investigated the relationship between vitamin D levels and associated factors in children with ATH. We reviewed data from all children with SDB symptoms who were treated from December 2013 to February 2014. Of these , 88 children whose serum vitamin D levels were measured were enrolled in the study. We divided the children into four groups based on adenoidal and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze demographic data , the sizes of tonsils and adenoids , serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D level , body mass index ( BMI) , and allergen sensitization patterns. Children in the ATH group had a lower mean 25 ( OH) D level than did those in the control group ( p < 0.05). Children with vitamin D deficiencies exhibited markedly higher frequencies of adenoidal and/or tonsillar hypertrophy than did those with sufficient vitamin D ( p < 0.05). Spearman 's correlation analysis identified an inverse correlation between serum 25 ( OH) D levels and age , tonsil and adenoid size , and height ( all p < 0.05). In a multiple regression analysis , tonsil and adenoid size as well as BMI-z score , were associated with 25 ( OH) D levels after controlling for age , sex , height , and mite sensitization ( p < 0.05). Our results suggest that low vitamin D levels are linked to ATH. Both the sizes of the adenoids and tonsils and the BMI-z score were associated with the 25 ( OH) D level. Therefore , measurement of the serum 25 ( OH) D level should be considered in children with ATH and SDB symptoms.
