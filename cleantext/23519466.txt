  Fas associated phosphatase 1 ( Fap1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase. Fap1 substrates include Fas and Gsk3Î² , suggesting a role in regulating cell survival. Consistent with this , increased Fap1 expression is associated with resistance to Fas or platinum induced apoptosis in some human colon cancer tumors or cell lines. In the current studies , we found that Fap1 expression was significantly greater in CD133
