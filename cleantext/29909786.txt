  This prospective study involved a longitudinal analysis of the progression of hearing thresholds in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. Audiometric results from 36 osteogenesis imperfecta patients ( age range , 6-79 years) were compared between two test times with an average interval of 4 years. Audiometric evaluation included acoustic admittance measurements , acoustic stapedial reflex measurements , pure tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions testing. Air conduction pure tone average , corrected for sex and age , and bone conduction pure tone average increased significantly in the study population ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 , respectively). In 14.3 per cent of the evaluated ears<disease> , an alteration in type and/or severity of hearing loss was observed. After an average time interval of four years , significant changes in hearing status occurred in a population of osteogenesis imperfecta patients. These findings highlight the importance of regular audiological follow up in osteogenesis imperfecta patients , including audiometry , and measurements of acoustic admittance , acoustic stapedial reflexes and otoacoustic emissions.
