  Childhood obesity has been separately associated with cardiometabolic risk factors ( CMRs) and increased risk of fracture. However , both augmented and compromised bone mass have been reported among overweight/obese children. Metabolic dysfunction , often co-existing with obesity , may explain the discrepancy in previous studies. The aim of this study was to examine whether the relationship between adiposity and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) derived bone mass differed in young girls with and without CMR ( s). Whole-body bone and body composition measures by DXA and measures of CMR ( fasting glucose , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , triglyceride ( TG) , systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , waist circumference ( WC)) were obtained from 307 , 9- to 12-year-old girls. Girls with 1 or ≥ 2 CMR ( s) were considered to be at risk ( vs. no CMR). Multiple linear regression was used to test the relationship of total fat mass with total body bone mineral content ( BMC) after controlling for height , lean mass , CMR risk , and other potential confounders. There was a significant interaction between CMR risk and total body fat mass. When girls were stratified by CMR group , all groups had a significant positive relationship between fat mass and BMC ( p < 0.05) , however , girls with ≥ 2 CMRs had a lower BMC for a given level of body fat. Total body fat was not significantly related to bone mineral density ( p > 0.05). Fat mass has a positive relationship with BMC even after controlling for lean mass. However , the positive relationship of fat mass with BMC may be attenuated if multiple CMRs are present.
