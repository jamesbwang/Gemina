  We aimed to explore the effect of hyperphosphorylation of Tau on cognitive function of propofol-anesthetized rats. Thirty 2-month-old male Wistar rats weighing 180-220 g were randomly divided into 3 groups ( n = 10): group of treating with saline ( C group) , group of treating with propofol for 1 hour ( P1) and 24 h ( P24 group). The cognitive function of rats was tested by Morris water maze before and 1 h or 24 h after drug administration. The rats were then sacrificed. The protein and mRNA expression levels of GSK-3β , total and phosphorylated Tau , cyclin D1 , p27kip1 and c-caspase 3 in hippocampus were determined by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) , respectively. Compared with group C , the incubation period of P1 group and P24 group was prolonged , and the target quadrant retention time was shortened ( p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between P1 and P24 group ( p > 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that compared with group C , p-Tau in hippocampus of P1 group and P24 group was highly expressed , with statistical difference ( p < 0.05). Western blot and RT-PCR showed that protein and mRNA expressions of GSK-3β , phosphorylated Tau , cyclin D1 and c-caspase 3 in hippocampus of P1 and P24 groups were up-regulated ( p < 0.05). Propofol-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats may be related to the hyperphosphorylation of Tau that causes neuronal cells to re-enter the cell cycle , thus leading to apoptosis.
