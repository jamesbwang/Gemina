  Osteosarcoma ( OS) is identified as the most commonly diagnosed malignant cancer of bone , and has approximately three million new cases annually. miR-26a plays an important role in the development of various types of cancer. We investigated whether miR-26a can regulate the migration and invasion of OS by targeting high-mobility group A1 HMGA1. Western blot analysis was used to identify the changes of protein levels. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to test expression levels of genes and miR-26a. Luciferase reporter assay was used to test the specific target gene of miR-26a. Transwell assay was employed to determine the migration and invasion of OS cell lines. In the present study , miRNA-26a was frequently downregulated in OS tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-26a inhibited cell migration and invasion
