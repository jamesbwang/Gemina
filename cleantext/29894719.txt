  Soluble PD-1 ( sPD1) can bind with ligands PD-L1/ PD-L2 on the surface of dendritic cells ( DCs). Therefore , a sPD1 vaccine fused with an immunogen can increase T cell activation against cancer. Here , we constructed a MUC1 and survivin ( MS) combination gene tumor vaccine expressing MS fused with soluble PD-1 ( sPD1/MS). To investigate whether the sPD1/MS fusion vaccine could enhance tumor-specific immune responses , its immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity were examined after intramuscular immunization in mice. Compared with the MS DNA vaccine , the specific cytolysis rate of the sPD1/MS fusion DNA vaccine was increased from 21.64 % to 34.77 %. Moreover , the sPD1/MS vaccine increased the tumor suppression rate from 17.18 % to 30.96 % and prolonged survival from 6.96 % to 19.44 % in a murine colorectal cancer model. Combining the sPD1/MS vaccine with oxaliplatin improved the tumor suppression rate to 74.71 % in the murine colorectal cancer model. The sPD1/MS vaccine could also exert a good anti-tumor effect , increasing the tumor infiltrated CD8
