  The present study aimed to investigate whether or not eccentric-only training induced different sex-related adaptations in vastus lateralis muscle architecture and knee extensors strength. Thirteen healthy women and 13 healthy men were recruited. Vastus lateralis pennation angle , fascicle length , and muscle thickness , as well as knee extensors eccentric , isometric , and concentric peak torque and one-repetition maximum ( 1RM) were measured. Both women and men underwent a unilateral iso-load knee-extension eccentric-only training with 120 % of the concentric 1RM , consisting of 4 sets Ã— 10 repetitions twice a week for a total of 8 weeks. Pennation angle increased in women ( + 14 % , 95 % CI ( 10 , 17) , effect size ( ES) = 1.54) but not in men ( + 5 % , 95 % CI ( -1 , 11) , ES = 0.28) , while fascicle length increased in both women ( + 7 % , 95 % CI ( 4 , 10) , ES = 1.02) and men ( + 12 % , 95 % CI ( 8 , 16) , ES = 1.82) and muscle thickness increased in women ( + 13 % , 95 % CI ( 8 , 18) , ES = 1.11) and men ( + 11 % , 95 % CI ( 7 , 15) , ES = 0.89). In both women and men , eccentric ( 18 % , 95 % CI ( 11 , 25) , ES = 0.96 , and 16 % , 95 % CI ( 9 , 22) , ES = 0.82 , respectively) , isometric ( 17 % , 95 % CI ( 11 , 23) , ES = 0.53 , and 17 % , 95 % CI ( 10 , 24) , ES = 0.62) , concentric ( 12 % , 95 % CI ( 7 , 16) , ES = 0.49 , and 9 % , 95 % CI ( 5 , 13) , ES = 0.42) peak torque and 1RM ( 10 % , 95 % CI ( 6 , 14) , ES = 0.53 , and 10 % , 95 % CI ( 5 , 15) , ES = 0.50) similarly increased after the intervention. This study showed that the adaptations in strength are not sex-dependent , but the increases in pennation angle only in women suggest that the changes in muscle architecture may depend on sex.
