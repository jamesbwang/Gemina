  This study investigated whether professional experience and type of image examination ( panoramic radiography ( PAN) or cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT)) could influence the pre-surgical planning for dental implant treatment. Six dentists , from two different levels of experience ( senior ( Sr) and junior ( Jr)) performed simulated pre-surgical planning by using PANs and after 1 month , by using CBCTs , considering implant length ( IL) , implant width ( IW) , need for bone graft ( BG) , and other surgical procedures ( OP). Bland-Altman test and Kappa coefficient were used to identify agreements. Bland-Altman test showed good agreement in the plans for inter-professional ( i.e. , Sr vs Jr) comparisons. Bland-Altman plots displayed intra-observer agreement ( i.e. , differences between PAN and CBCT) , showing discrepancy between imaging modalities for IL and a tendency towards selecting larger dental implant options when using PAN and smaller options with CBCT. Kappa showed almost perfect ( 0.81-1.0) agreement between Jr and Sr for OP ( PAN and CBCT). For BG , agreement was substantial ( 0.61-0.80) when planning was done with PAN and CBCT. Descriptive statistics showed evidence that when Jrs used CBCT , they no longer indicated the BG they had planned when they used PAN. There were differences in the pre-surgical planning for treatment with dental implants depending on the professional experience and the type of imaging examination used. Variation in dental implant planning can affect treatment time , cost , and morbidity in patients.
