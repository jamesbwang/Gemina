  Fundamental theories of human cognition have long posited that the short-term maintenance of actions is supported by one of the `` core knowledge '' systems of human visual cognition , yet its neural substrates are still not well understood. In particular , it is unclear whether the visual short-term memory ( VSTM) of actions has distinct neural substrates or , as proposed by the spatio-object architecture of VSTM , shares them with VSTM of objects and spatial locations. In two experiments , we tested these two competing hypotheses by directly contrasting the neural substrates for VSTM of actions with those for objects and locations. Our results showed that the bilateral middle temporal cortex ( MT) was specifically involved in VSTM of actions because its activation and its functional connectivity with the frontal-parietal network ( FPN) were only modulated by the memory load of actions , but not by that of objects/agents or locations. Moreover , the brain regions involved in the maintenance of spatial location information ( i.e. , superior parietal lobule , SPL) was also recruited during the maintenance of actions , consistent with the temporal-spatial nature of actions. Meanwhile , the frontoparietal network ( FPN) was commonly involved in all types of VSTM and showed flexible functional connectivity with the domain-specific regions , depending on the current working memory tasks. Together , our results provide clear evidence for a distinct neural system for maintaining actions in VSTM , which supports the core knowledge system theory and the domain-specific and domain-general architectures of VSTM.
