  Environmental sustainability research is dependent on accurate land cover information. Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with improved spectral , spatial , radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution policy , most existing land cover datasets are derived from a pixel-based , single-date multi-spectral remotely sensed image with an unacceptable accuracy. One major bottleneck for accuracy improvement is how to develop an accurate and effective image classification protocol. By incorporating and utilizing multi-spectral , multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and considering the inherit spatial and sequential interdependence among neighboring pixels , we propose a new patch-based recurrent neural network ( PB-RNN) system tailored for classifying multi-temporal remote sensing data. The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular , it uses multi-temporal-spectral-spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow present in multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering an area of 771 square kilometers , the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over a pixel-based recurrent neural network ( RNN) system , a pixel-based single-image neural network ( NN) system , a pixel-based multi-image NN system , a patch-based single-image NN system , and a patch-based multi-image NN system. For example , the proposed system achieves 97.21 % classification accuracy while the pixel-based single-image NN system achieves 64.74 %. By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one , we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.
