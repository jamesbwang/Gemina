  A ` terrible triad ' of anterior shoulder dislocation , axillary nerve damage and rotator cuff tear has been previously described. However , we are unaware of any report of anterior shoulder dislocation , humeral fracture , axillary neuropathy and subsequent rotator cuff tear requiring surgery when the axillary neuropathy was deemed permanent. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman who fell in a motocross accident and had an anterior shoulder dislocation , humeral fracture and axillary neuropathy. The fracture was treated surgically with open reduction and internal fixation. The axillary nerve injury was ultimately permanent. Thirteen months after the motocross accident , the patient sustained a rotator cuff tear from seemingly minor trauma. However , several months of aggressive physical therapy preceded the rotator cuff tear. The tear was repaired and the patient was followed for 5 years after the initial injury. She returned to competing in motocross , even though the axillary neuropathy remained complete and permanent.
