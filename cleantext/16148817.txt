  Thermometers that measure core ( internal) body temperature are the gold standard for monitoring temperature. Despite that most modern hemodialysis machines are equipped with an internal blood monitor that measures core body temperature , current practice is to use peripheral thermometers. A better understanding of how peripheral thermometers compare with the dialysis machine thermometer may help guide practice. The study followed a prospective cross-sectional design. Hemodialysis patients were recruited from 2 sites in Calgary , Alberta ( April- June 2017). Body temperatures were obtained from peripheral ( temporal artery) and dialysis machine thermometers concurrently. Paired t-tests , Bland-Altman plots , and quantile-quantile plots were used to compare measurements from the two devices and to explore potential factors affecting temperature in hemodialysis patients. The mean body temperature of 94 hemodialysis patients measured using the temporal artery thermometer ( 36.7 째C) was significantly different than the dialysis machine thermometer ( 36.4 째C); p < 0.001. The mean difference ( 0.27 째C) appeared to be consistent across average temperature ( range: 35.8-37.3 째C). Temperature measured by the temporal artery thermometer was statistically and clinically higher than that measured by the dialysis machine thermometer. Using the dialysis machine to monitor body temperature may result in more accurate readings and is likely to reduce the purchasing and maintenance costs associated with manual temperature readings , as well as easing the workload for dialysis staff.
