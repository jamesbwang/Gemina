  MiR-30d-5p , a member of the microRNA family , was recently reported to regulate androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer ( PCa). Ecto-5 '- nucleotidase ( NT5E/CD73) is a pivotal regulator of tumor migration and has angiogenetic properties. However , the undiscovered function of miR-30d-5p and whether it targeted NT5E in PCa remain uncertain. In this study , the authors observed miR-30d-5p was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines compared with the adjacent normal tissues and normal prostate cells , respectively. The lower expression of miR-30d-5p was found to be inversely correlated with the NT5E expression in PCa tissues. Subsequently , the biological function of miR-30d-5p was evaluated in PCa in vitro. The results indicated that miR-30d-5p overexpression inhibited PCa cell growth and invasion by MTT , Transwell assays , respectively , as well as induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis using flow cytometry analysis. In addition , miR-30d-5p directly bound to the 3 ` UTR ( 3 ' untranslated region) of NT5E in DU-145 and PC-3 cells by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore , enforced NT5E expression alleviated miR-30d-5p inhibition of PCa cell growth and invasion in DU145 cells. Taken together , these data indicated that miR-30d-5p may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PCa by serving as a tumor suppressor , by negatively regulating NT5E.
