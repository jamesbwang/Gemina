  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy among women. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the disease , as well as the insidious onset of symptoms , timely diagnosis remains extremely challenging. Despite recent advances in chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer patients , many still suffer from recurrence and ultimately succumb to the disease; thus , there is an urgent need for the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Within this rapidly evolving field , the role of platelets in the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment has garnered increased attention. It is well-established that platelets and tumor cells exhibit bidirectional communication in which platelets enhance tumor cell invasion , extravasation , and protection from host system defenses , while tumor cells serve as platelet agonists , increasing platelet adhesion , aggregation , and degranulation. This mini-review focuses on the platelet-tumor cell relationship in ovarian cancer , specifically highlighting the essential role of bioactive lipid mediators at this interface.
