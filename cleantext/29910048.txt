  Length of stay after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI) continues to decrease , but information to guide duration of hospitalization is limited. We used landmark analyses , in which the landmark defined potential days of discharge , to estimate complication rates on the first day the patient would have been out of the hospital , and estimated associations between timing of discharge and 30-day and 1-year event-free survival after discharge among NSTEMI patients. Among 20,410 NSTEMI patients , median length of stay was 7 ( 4 , 12) days; 3,209 ( 15.7 %) experienced a cardiac complication on days 0 to 2 and 1,322 ( 6.5 %) were discharged without complications during hospital days 0 to 2. At the start of day 3 , 15,879 patients ( 77.8 %) were still hospitalized without complications. Of these , 1,689 ( 10.6 %) were discharged event-free on day 3. Adjusted event-free survival rates of death or myocardial infarction from day 4 to 30 days after among the 1,689 patients was 99.1 % compared with 93.1 % for the 14,190 who remained hospitalized at the end of day 3. For 1-year mortality , these rates were 98.1 % and 96.4 % , respectively. Among 13,334 patients hospitalized without complications at the start of day 4 , 1,706 were discharged event-free that day. Adjusted survival rates among these patients , compared with those still hospitalized at the end of day 4 , were 98.0 % versus 93.7 % for 30-day death or myocardial infarction and 97.8 % versus 96.1 % for 1-year mortality. Patients with NSTEMI who had no serious complications during the first 2 hospital days were at low risk of subsequent short- and intermediate-term death or ischemic events.
