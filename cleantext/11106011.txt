  Data sourcesPubMed , Embase , the Cochrane Library and reference lists of identified studies.Study selectionObservational studies comparing dental<disease> caries<disease> and body mass index ( BMI) where BMI was clearly defined were considered.Data extraction and synthesisTwo reviewers independently abstracted data using standard forms with study quality being assessed using a modified version of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) methodology checklist for cross-sectional studies. The weighted mean differences and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals for dental<disease> caries<disease> between children with abnormal weight and those with normal weight were analysed.ResultsFourteen cross-sectional studies including 43,860 children ( boys: 23,299; girls: 20,561) were included. Only two studies were considered to be of high quality , eight of medium quality and four of low quality. Four main patterns of associations between dental<disease> caries<disease> and BMI were found: five studies showed no association , five studies found a positive association , three an inverse association and one found a U-shaped pattern , which meant that the deft score was significantly higher in underweight children and there was a higher DMFT score in overweight and obese children.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis showed no differences in dental<disease> caries<disease> between underweight and normal weight children. Further studies are recommended using suitable sample sizes , to unify the criteria for BMI categorisation and the dental<disease> caries<disease> index , and investigate the confounding factors that might influence dental<disease> caries<disease> and BMI.
