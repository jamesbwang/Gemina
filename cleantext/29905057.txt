  To summarize the research progress of rehabilitation after autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI). The literature related to basic science and clinical practice about rehabilitation after ACI in recent years was searched , selected , and analyzed. Based on the included literature , the progress of the graft maturation consists of proliferation phase ( 0-6 weeks) , transition phase ( 6-12 weeks) , remodeling phase ( 12-26 weeks) , and maturation phase ( 26 weeks-2 years). To achieve early protection , stimulate the maturation , and promote the graft-bone integrity , rehabilitation protocol ought to be based on the biomechanical properties at different phases. Weight-bearing program , range of motion ( ROM) , and options or facilities of exercise are importance when considering a rehabilitation program. It has been proved that the patients need a program with an increasingly progressive weight-bearing and ROM in principles of rehabilitation after ACI. Specific facilities can be taken at a certain phase. Evidences extracted in the present work are rather low and the high-quality and controlled trials still need to improve the rehabilitation protocol.
