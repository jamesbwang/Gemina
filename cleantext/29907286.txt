  Sensitive and specific detection of protein is of great significance for early diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. However , great challenges remain unsolved including relative low sensitivity , high cost , long testing time , complicated instrument and laborious operation. To improve the performance of protein detection methods , development of fine reaction interface for recognition and signal amplification is of great importance. In this work , we construct a novel mode of DNA assembly at electrode interface based on a tripodal surface anchor and an electrochemical aptasensor for protein assay is developed. The orientation of the immobilized DNA is optimized , which promises the efficiency of protein recognition. In addition , hybridization chain reaction is employed for further signal amplification. Therefore , this detection method shows high sensitivity with excellent specificity. The strategy can be universally applicable by simply modifying the sequences of used DNA probes.
