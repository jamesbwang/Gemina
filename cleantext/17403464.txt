  Public health and clinical practice pattern trends are often analyzed using complex survey data. Use of statistical approaches that do not account for survey design predisposes to error , potentially leading to resource misdirection and inefficiency. This study examined two techniques for analyzing trends in complex survey data: ( 1) design-corrected logistic regression and ( 2) jackknife re-weighted linear regression. These approaches were compared toweighted least squares regression , as well as non-design corrected techniques. Data were obtained from NEISS , a complex survey of emergency departments that can be weighted to produce national estimates of injury occurrence. Trends were analyzed in rug-related injuries among male versus female patients â‰¥ 65 years of age. All design-corrected techniques performed comparably in assessment of trend within sex-based subgroups. In almost all cases , design-corrected approaches contrasted profoundly with standard statistical techniques. Future analyses may employ these design-corrected approaches to appropriately account for estimate variance in complex survey data.
