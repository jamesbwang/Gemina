  Healthy eating is a challenge for most college students , and students in the field of veterinary medicine are no exception. Health experts have recommended that universities emphasize the importance of healthy eating and promote healthy eating habits among students. However , before we can begin offering targeted interventions to promote healthy eating strategies and behaviors , we must first understand students ' current strategies used for making healthy eating choices , self-reported eating habits , and perceptions of diet quality. Thus , the purpose of this study was to understand veterinary medical students ' perceptions of current diet quality and to characterize their strategies for making healthy eating choices. Results indicate veterinary medical students employ a wide range of strategies and behaviors for healthy eating , yet few students reported eating a diet of poor quality. We conclude that while most students report eating a relatively healthy diet , variation in strategies used suggests room for improvement for many. This article discusses potential intervention strategies to promote healthy eating among veterinary students.
