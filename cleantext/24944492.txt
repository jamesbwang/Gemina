  Gastric cancer ( GC) is one of the most common digestive malignancies globally , and the prognosis of patients with advanced tumors remains poor. Isocryptotanshinone ( ICTS) , isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza , was found to inhibit the proliferation of lung and breast cancer cells. However , whether ICTS has anticancer activities against GC is unknown. In the present study , we reported that the proliferation of GC cells was inhibited by ICTS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment with ICTS , GC cells were arrested in the G1/G0 phase of cell cycle and the apoptotic cells were induced in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally , ICTS suppressed the expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-associated proteins ( e.g. , Cyclin D1 , phosphorylated Rb , E2F1 , Mcl-1 , Bcl-2 , and Survivin). ICTS inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. Down-regulated STAT3 attenuated the expression of Cyclin D1 , p-Rb , and Survivin , which remarkably increased the sensitivity of ICTS in GC cells; overexpression of STAT3 restored the cell growth and proliferation and the protein expression suppressed by ICTS. ICTS also suppressed the xenograft tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice. Together , these data indicate that ICTS inhibits GC proliferation by inducing G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway.
