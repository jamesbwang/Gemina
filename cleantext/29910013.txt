  Mindfulness based relapse prevention ( MBRP) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating substance use , stress , and craving but how MBRP works for marginalized young adults has not been investigated. The current study used a novel rolling group format for MBRP as an additional intervention for young adults in residential treatment. We tested the hypothesis that MBRP ( plus Treatment as usual ( TAU)) would reduce stress , craving , and substance use among young adults in residential treatment relative to treatment-as-usual plus 12-step/self-help meetings ( TAU only). Further , we examined whether reduced stress during treatment was a potential mechanism of change operating in MBRP. Seventy-nine young adults ( M At treatment completion young adults receiving MBRP had lower substance use ( d = -0.58 , ( -0.91 , -0.26)) , craving ( d = -0.58 , ( -1.0 , -0.14)) , and stress ( d = -0.77 ( -1.2 , -0.30)) relative to TAU condition. Reduced stress during treatment partially mediated observed outcome differences between MBRP and TAU for substance use ( Î² Results suggest that MBRP is a useful and appropriate intervention for marginalized young adults. Further , our results suggest that the effects of MBRP on long-term substance use outcomes may be partially explained by reduced stress.
