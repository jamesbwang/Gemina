  The aim of this paper was to know the epidemiological characteristics of the salivary gland tumors in a Mexican population. A descriptive , retrospective and cross-sectional study was performed. All cases of salivary gland tumor were collected in a period of 5 years ( 2009-2014) in two hospitals of our State , the Hospital General de Veracruz and the Unidad MÃ©dica de Alta Especialidad y Hospital de Especialidades No. 14 , with the study of variables like: age , gender , location , biological behavior and histological type. The series studied included a total of 79 cases. 51 % ( 40 cases) corresponded to female patients , the average age was 52.13 years ( range of 14 to 87 years). The most frequent location of neoplasia was in the parotid<symptom> gland ( 72 %). The most frequent benign neoplasms were the pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin 's tumor. The most frequent malignancy was cystic adenoid carcinoma , followed by moderately differentiated carcinoma. Our results are similar to those previously reported in Mexico. The main neoplasms were the pleomorphic adenoma as a benign tumor and as malignant tumors the adenoid cystic carcinoma and the moderately differentiated carcinoma.
