  In patients with cortical lesions<symptom> , the structure of intelligence has never been studied as a function of age at lesion<symptom> onset and presence vs absence of lesional epilepsy over the life span. Two thousand one hundred eighty-six cases were assembled bearing unilateral cortical lesions<symptom> occurring at all ages ( 1301 with seizures<symptom>) with postlesion verbal intelligence quotient ( IQ) ( VIQ) and performance IQ ( PIQ). Global IQ significantly and constantly decreased as a function of age at lesion<symptom> onset in the cases without epilepsy , and increased in the cases with epilepsy. Beyond the lesion<symptom> onset age of 12 years , VIQ was significantly higher than PIQ in the cases without epilepsy , and lower in the cases with epilepsy. The VIQ/PIQ Ã— lesion-side interaction indicative of hemispheric specialization increased significantly linearly with age at lesion<symptom> onset in the patients without epilepsy but ceased to progress at the lesion-onset age of 30 years and beyond in the cases with epilepsy. Postlesion global IQ , the difference between VIQ and PIQ , and the laterality index all vary significantly as a function of age at lesion<symptom> onset. In addition , these changes over the life span are all quite different between cases with and without epilepsy.
