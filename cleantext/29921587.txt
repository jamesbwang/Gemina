  Many proteins , such as RNA-binding proteins , have complex folding landscapes. How cells maintain the solubility and folding state of such proteins , particularly under stress conditions , is largely unknown. Here , we argue that prion-like low-complexity regions ( LCRs) are key regulators of protein solubility and folding. We discuss emerging evidence that prion-like LCRs are not , as commonly thought , autonomous aggregation modules that adopt amyloid-like conformations , but protein-specific sequences with chaperone-like functions. On the basis of recent findings , we propose that prion-like LCRs have evolved to regulate protein phase behavior and to protect proteins against proteotoxic damage.
