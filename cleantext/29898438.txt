  The present survey aimed to evaluate current opinion and practice regarding peritoneal metastasis ( PM) , satisfaction with available treatment options , and need for new therapeutic approaches. This was a qualitative study conducted between October 2016 and October 2017 in the RÃ©seau Suisse Romand d'Oncologie including 101 members of various oncological specialties. Participants ' demographics , current practice , knowledge , and satisfaction regarding available treatment options and need for new treatment options were assessed by semantic differential scales through 33 closed questions with automatic reminders at 4- , 8- , 12- , and 16-week intervals. Twenty-seven participants ( 27 %) completed the survey. Participants were gastrointestinal or gynecologic oncologists and surgeons. Most participants ( 67 %) evaluated their knowledge on PM as moderate , while 22 % considered themselves as experts. Clinical usefulness of systemic chemotherapy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy was judged to be moderate to high for PM of ovarian and colorectal origin and moderate to poor for gastric origin. Satisfaction with available treatment options was 6/10 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 4-7) for ovarian , 5/10 ( IQR 3-7) for colorectal , and 3/10 ( IQR 1-3) for gastric PM. Treatment strategies varied widely for typical case vignettes. The need for new treatment modalities was rated as 8/10 ( IQR 6-10). Usefulness of and satisfaction with available treatment options for PM were rated as moderate at best by oncological experts , and treatment strategies differed importantly among participants. There appears to be a clear need for standardization and new treatment modalities.
