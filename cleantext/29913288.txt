  In this study , a novel biomass pretreatment process using three kinds of deep eutectic solvents ( DESs) was developed to improve saccharification efficiency and lignin valorization. The major components of xylose residue including cellulose and lignin fractions were released , recovered and utilized. Pretreatment with betaine/lactic acid system at 120 Â°C for 2 h was found to be the optimal conditions with prominently increased enzymatic digestibility ( from 55.3 % to 96.8 %). The efficient conversion was mainly ascribed to the significant delignification efficiency of 81.6 % after betaine/lactic acid pretreatment , which caused incompact structure and corrosive surface of treated xylose residue. The recoverable lignin had high purity , low molecular weight ( 630-2040 g/mol) and polydispersity ( 1.07-1.76). Based on the comprehensive analysis , the one-pot DESs system provides us a facile and effective approach for whole components valorization of lignocellulosic materials.
