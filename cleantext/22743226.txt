  Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. Here , we provide a whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing ( called RNA-seq) dataset conducted with ten samples of invasive ductal carcinoma tissue and three samples of adjacent normal tissue from a single Korean breast cancer patient ( luminal B subtype). Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were identified with a false discovery rate ( FDR)- adjusted
