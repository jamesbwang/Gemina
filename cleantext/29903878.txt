  Capture of each and every chromosome by spindle microtubules is essential to prevent chromosome loss and aneuploidy. In somatic cells , astral microtubules search and capture chromosomes forming lateral attachments to kinetochores. However , this mechanism alone is insufficient in large oocytes. We have previously shown that a contractile F-actin network is additionally required to collect chromosomes scattered in the 70-Âµm starfish oocyte nucleus. How this F-actin-driven mechanism is coordinated with microtubule capture remained unknown. Here , we show that after nuclear envelope breakdown Arp2/3-nucleated F-actin `` patches '' form around chromosomes in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner , and we propose that these structures sterically block kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Once F-actin-driven chromosome transport is complete , coordinated disassembly of F-actin patches allows synchronous capture by microtubules. Our observations indicate that this coordination is necessary because early capture of chromosomes by microtubules would interfere with F-actin-driven transport leading to chromosome loss and formation of aneuploid eggs.
