  In chronic instability of syndesmosis , osteoarthritis and poor functional outcome were seen more prevalently. To avoid diastasis of ankle joint , the affected distal tibiofibular syndesmosis should be restored. We evaluated the clinical and radiological results of operative treatment of ankle fractures in patients who required syndesmotic stabilization. Twenty-one patients operated for ankle fracture were evaluated. Patients were followed up for 12 to 81 months , with a mean value of 49 months. Anteroposterior ( AP) , lateral , and mortise radiographs were taken at the follow-up period , and AP tibiofibular distance , lateral fibular distance , and medial mortise distance were measured on the preoperative , postoperative , and last follow-up radiographs. At the last follow-up , patients were evaluated clinically with Hannover scoring system. The decrease in AP tibiofibular distance was statistically significant postoperatively in Weber Type B and C fractures. The mean preoperative AP tibiofibular distance which was 7.1 mm decreased to 3.6 mm after operation. There was no statistically significant relation between the amount of decrease and fracture type , either Weber B or C. At the same time , the AP tibiofibular distance did not change at the last follow-up. At the last follow-up clinical evaluation , patient scores were ranging from 74 to 94 , with a mean value of 86 , which was designated as a fair result. In ankle fractures , if diastasis of distal tibiofibular joint is present , syndesmosis should be fixed for both Weber Type B and C fractures. The most important predictor of good clinical outcome is accurate reduction of the syndesmosis.
