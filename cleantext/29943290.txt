  The physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) models allow for predictive assessment of variability in population of interest. One of the future application of PBPK modeling is in the field of precision dosing and personalized medicine. The aim of the study was to develop PBPK model for amitriptyline given orally , predict the variability of cardiac concentrations of amitriptyline and its main metabolite-nortriptyline in populations as well as individuals , and simulate the influence of those xenobiotics in therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations on human electrophysiology. The cardiac effect with regard to QT and RR interval lengths was assessed. The Emax model to describe the relationship between amitriptyline concentration and heart rate ( RR) length was proposed. The developed PBPK model was used to mimic 29 clinical trials and 19 cases of amitriptyline intoxication. Three clinical trials and 18 cases were simulated with the use of PBPK-QSTS approach , confirming lack of cardiotoxic effect of amitriptyline in therapeutic doses and the increase in heart rate along with potential for arrhythmia development in case of amitriptyline overdose. The results of our study support the validity and feasibility of the PBPK-QSTS modeling development for personalized medicine.
