  This study was designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of single ascending subcutaneous doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Forty patients were randomized across 5 cohorts ( 5 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg , 40 mg , 80 mg; 8 patients each ( bapineuzumab 6; placebo 2)). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) was higher in pooled bapineuzumab cohorts ( 83 %) than in the pooled placebo group ( 27.7 %). Most common TEAEs in the bapineuzumab group were gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders ( bapineuzumab 17 % each; placebo 0 %). Serious TEAEs were observed in 7 % of bapineuzumab-treated patients without any deaths or adverse event-related discontinuation. The median times to reach peak measurable concentration ( C
