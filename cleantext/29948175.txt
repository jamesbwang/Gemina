  Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP) is a four-repeat tauopathy with high phenotypic and neuropathological variability , highlighting the urgent need for effective disease biomarkers. Quantitative analysis of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) proteins reflecting pathological changes of CNS is currently used as biomarkers of multiple neurodegenerative disorders for both early differential diagnosis and prognostic clustering of patients. In this study , we thus assessed the clinical usefulness of a panel of CSF biomarker in PSP patients presenting with Richardson 's Syndrome<disease>. CSF levels of 42-beta-amyloid , total-tau , phosphorylated-tau , and both 42-beta-amyloid/phosphorylated-tau and phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratios were comparatively evaluated in 39 PSP patients , 31 patients with Parkinson 's Disease ( PD) and 58 gender-/ age-matched healthy controls. Specific gold-standard clinical scores were obtained. Diagnostic accuracy and clinical correlates of each biomarker were measured with receiver operating curve analysis and Spearman 's test/linear regression , respectively. In PSP , 42-beta-amyloid was lower than either controls or PD; total-tau and phosphorylated-tau were instead reduced compared to controls , but similar to PD. At the cut-off value of 623 pg/ml , 42-beta-amyloid significantly distinguished PSP from controls and PD. Likewise , phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratio also supported differential diagnosis between PSP and PD ( cut-off = 0.185). 42-beta-amyloid was inversely associated with PSP severity , as measured with PSP Rating Scale. Our study demonstrates that CSF 42-beta-amyloid is reduced in PSP patients , proportionally to clinical severity , thus suggesting a potential use as disease biomarker. Moreover , phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratio resulted helpful in the early differential diagnosis between PSP and PD.
