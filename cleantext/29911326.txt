  Vaccines to protect livestock against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia ( CCPP) consist in inactivated , adjuvanted antigens. Quality control of these vaccines is challenging as total protein quantification provides no indication of protein identity or purity , and culture is not an option. Here , a tandem mass spectrometry approach was used to identify the mycoplasma<pathogen> antigen contained in reference samples and in commercial CCPP vaccines. By the same approach , the relative amounts of mycoplasma<pathogen> antigen and residual proteins originating from the production medium were determined. Mass spectrometry allowed easy and rapid identification of the peptides present in the vaccine samples. Alongside the most probable mycoplasma<pathogen> species effectively present in the vaccines , a very high proportion of peptides from medium constituents was detected in the commercial vaccines tested.
