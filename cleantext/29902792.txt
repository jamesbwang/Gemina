  In mammals , the sex of the embryo depends on the SRY gene. In the presence of at least one intact and functional copy of this genetic factor ( XY embryo) undifferentiated gonads will develop as testicles that subsequently determine the male phenotype. When this factor is not present , i.e. , in subjects with 2 X chromosomes , an alternative pathway induces the development of ovaries , hence a female phenotype. In this case study , we describe a female cattle affected by a disorder of sex development ( DSD). The subject , despite having a chromosomal XY constitution , did not develop testicles but ovaries , although they were underdeveloped. Moreover , genetic analysis highlighted the presence of the SRY gene with a normal coding region in both blood- and tissue-derived DNA. A chimeric condition was excluded in blood by sexing more than 350 cells and by allele profile investigation of 18 microsatellite markers. Array CGH analysis showed the presence of a not yet described 99-kb duplication ( BTA18) , but its relationship with the phenotype remains to be demonstrated. Gonadal histology demonstrated paired ovaries: the left one containing a large corpus luteum and the right one showing an underdeveloped aspect and very few early follicles. To our knowledge , we describe the first case of XY ( SRY +) DSD in cattle with a normal SRY gene coding sequence.
