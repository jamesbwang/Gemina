  Fluoride had been reported to damage the structure and function of testicular tissues and reproductive cells; however , the mechanisms underlying its toxicity remained unclear. Autophagy plays a key role in reproductive function. In this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of fluoride on autophagy in Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells were exposed to 0 , 0.125 , 0.25 , and 0.5 mM NaF for 24 h. The results showed that fluoride exposure up-regulated Beclin1 and p62 mRNA and protein expression levels with concomitant down-regulated mRNA and protein expression levels of LC3 and Atg5. In conclusion , exposure to fluoride impaired the autophagy process in Sertoli cells , which could be one of fluoride 's mechanisms in male reproductive toxicity.
