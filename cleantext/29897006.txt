  Euthyroid multinodular goiter ( MNG) is common , but little is known about the genetic variations conferring predisposition. Previously , a family with MNG of adolescent onset was reported in which some family members developed papillary thyroid carcinomas ( PTC). Genome-wide linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing were conducted to identify genetic variants that may confer disease predisposition. A multipoint nonparametric LOD score of 3.01 was obtained , covering 19 cM on chromosome 20p. Haplotype analysis reduced the region of interest to 10 cM. Analysis of copy number variation identified an intronic InDel ( ∼ 1000 bp) in the PLCB1 gene in all eight affected family members and carriers ( an unaffected person who has inherited the genetic trait). This InDel is present in approximately 1 % of `` healthy '' Caucasians. Next-generation sequencing of the region identified no additional disease-associated variant , suggesting a possible role of the InDel. Since PLCB1 contributes to thyrocyte growth regulation , the InDel was investigated in relevant Caucasian cohorts. It was detected in 0/70 PTC but 4/81 unrelated subjects with MNG ( three females; age at thyroidectomy 27-59 years; no family history of MNG/PTC). The InDel frequency is significantly higher in MNG subjects compared to controls ( χ The intronic PLCB1 InDel is the first variant found in familial multiple papilloid adenomata-type MNG and in a subset of patients with sporadic MNG. It may function through overexpression , and increased PLC activity has been reported in thyroid neoplasms. The potential role of the deletion as a biomarker to identify MNG patients more likely to progress to PTC merits exploration.
