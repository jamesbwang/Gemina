  Accountable care organizations ( ACOs) have been shown to reduce prostate cancer treatment among men unlikely to benefit because of competing risks ( ie , potential overtreatment). This study assessed whether the level of engagement in ACOs by urologists affected rates of treatment , overtreatment , and spending. A 20 % sample of national Medicare data was used to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014. The extent of urologist engagement in an ACO , as measured by the proportion of patients in an ACO managed by an ACO-participating urologist , served as the exposure. The use of treatment , potential overtreatment ( ie , treatment in men with a ≥ 75 % risk of 10-year noncancer mortality) , and average payments in the year after diagnosis for each ACO were modeled. Among 2822 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer , the median rates of treatment and potential overtreatment by an ACO were 71.3 % ( range , 23.6 % -79.5 %) and 53.6 % ( range , 12.4 % -76.9 %) , respectively. Average Medicare payments among ACOs in the year after diagnosis ranged from $ 16,523.52 to $ 34,766.33. Stronger urologist-ACO engagement was not associated with treatment ( odds ratio , 0.87; 95 % confidence interval , 0.6-1.2; P = .4) or spending ( 9.7 % decrease in spending; P = .08). However , urologist engagement was associated with a lower likelihood of potential overtreatment ( odds ratio , 0.29; 95 % confidence interval , 0.1-0.86; P = .03). ACOs vary widely in treatment , potential overtreatment , and spending for prostate cancer. ACOs with stronger urologist engagement are less likely to treat men with a high risk of noncancer mortality , and this suggests that organizations that better engage specialists may be able to improve the value of specialty care.
