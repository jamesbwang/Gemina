  Despite accumulating theoretical and empirical knowledge in the field of process research in psychotherapy , not much is known about individuals ' expectations of the mechanisms that produce change in psychotherapy. In this article we present the Expectations of Active Processes in Psychotherapy Scale ( EAPPS) , aimed to assess and quantify psychotherapy process expectations derived from current process constructs. Two studies with a total of 381 participants were conducted in order to assess the scale factor structure , reliability , and validity. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a seven-factor structure , which consisted of dimensions related to the patient-therapist relationship , the secure exploration of sensitive personal contents , and specific functions of the therapeutic process. The derived factors were found to have satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability , and were correlated with clinically relevant variables as well as other expectations scales , thus supporting the scale 's convergent validity. The EAPPS can allow an in-depth examination of the effects of psychotherapy process expectations on therapy outcomes , as well as their mediating effects through patients ' ongoing evaluations of the therapeutic process.
