  Three amphipathic cationic antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) were characterized by determining their effect on Gram-positive bacteria using Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> strain 168 as a model organism. These peptides were TC19 and TC84 , derivatives of thrombocidin-1 ( TC-1) , the major AMPs of human blood platelets , and Bactericidal Peptide 2 ( BP2) , a synthetic designer peptide based on human bactericidal permeability increasing protein ( BPI). To elucidate the possible mode of action of the AMPs we performed a transcriptomic analysis using microarrays. Physiological analyses were performed using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , fluorescence microscopy and various B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> mutants that produce essential membrane bound proteins fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP). The transcriptome analysis showed that the AMPs induced a cell envelope stress response ( cell membrane and cell wall). The cell membrane stress response was confirmed with the physiological observations that TC19 , TC84 and BP2 perturb the membrane of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen>. Using B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> mutants , we established that the cell wall stress response is due to the delocalization of essential membrane bound proteins involved in cell wall synthesis. Other essential membrane proteins , involved in cell membrane synthesis and metabolism , were also delocalized due to alterations caused by the AMPs. We showed that peptides TC19 , TC84 and BP2 perturb the membrane causing essential proteins to delocalize , thus preventing the possible repair of the cell envelope after the initial interference with the membrane. These AMPs show potential for eventual clinical application against Gram-positive bacterial cells and merit further application-oriented investigation.
