  Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER) , generally defined as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus , is an almost universal phenomenon in preterm infants. It is a common diagnosis in the NICU; however , there is large variation in its treatment across NICU sites. In this clinical report , the physiology , diagnosis , and symptomatology in preterm infants as well as currently used treatment strategies in the NICU are examined. Conservative measures to control reflux , such as left lateral body position , head elevation , and feeding regimen manipulation , have not been shown to reduce clinically assessed signs of GER in the preterm infant. In addition , preterm infants with clinically diagnosed GER are often treated with pharmacologic agents; however , a lack of evidence of efficacy together with emerging evidence of significant harm ( particularly with gastric acid blockade) strongly suggest that these agents should be used sparingly , if at all , in preterm infants.
