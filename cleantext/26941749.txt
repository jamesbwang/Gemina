  The use of herbicides with different modes of action is the primary strategy used to control weeds possessing resistance to a single mechanism of action ( MOA). However , this practice can lead to selection for generalist resistance mechanisms and may cause resistance to all MOAs. In this research , we characterized the resistance to diquat/paraquat ( bipyridiliums) in an
