  The best known effects of nesfatin-1 are on appetite<symptom> and metabolic regulation. Moreover , several research suggest that nesfatin-1 play a role in stress responses. This molecule may be involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and suicidal behavior. We compared nesfatin-1 levels between depressed patients with suicidal ideation ( n = 32 , mean ± SD , 1,40 ± 0.11) , without suicidal ideation ( n = 31 , 1.46 ± 0.14) and healthy controls ( n = 32 , 1.52 ± 0.13). Suicidal ideation was assessed with the Suicide Probability Scale , Scale for Suicide Ideation and depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression<symptom> Rating Scale. Blood samples were collected to measure serum nesfatin-1levels by using ELISA method. The study revealed that serum nesfatin-1 levels were significantly lower in MDD with suicidal ideation than in healthy volunteers ( p < 0.001). There were a negative correlation between the scores of suicidal ideation and nesfatin-1 levels in MDD with SI group ( r = -0.215; p = 0.016). In the future , nesfatin-1 levels may one day be applied in predicting and monitoring patients ' suicide risk. Further prospective studies are required to elucidate this potential association.
