  Chronic exposure to sleep deprivation may increase the risk of depression<symptom> in young people who are particularly vulnerable to changes in sleep and mental health. Sleep deprivation and incident depression<symptom> may also differ by gender. We investigated the prospective association between cumulative sleep deprivation and subsequent levels of depressive symptomatology among adolescents from a gender perspective. A longitudinal study of 3071 young people in the British Columbia Adolescent Substance Use Survey ( BASUS) cohort with three sleep time and two depression<symptom> measures over 12 months ( 2011-12). Multivariable linear regression models with interaction terms estimated gender-specific associations between self-reported chronic sleep deprivation and changes in depressive symptomatology; post-estimation analysis calculated adjusted mean depression<symptom> scores for each level of cumulative sleep deprivation. Cumulative sleep deprivation was associated with a monotonic increase in depression<symptom> scores at follow-up in young women , but no consistent pattern was seen in young men. During follow-up , 15 % of young women were chronically sleep deprived and 29 % were depressed ( CESD â‰¥ 24). Young women reporting chronic exposure to sleep deprivation had higher CESD scores at follow-up ( 21.50 points , ( CI95 19.55-23.45)) , than those reporting no history ( 16.59 ( 15.72-17.45)); that remained after multivariable adjustment ( 19.48 ( 17.59-21.38)). Results suggested that chronic sleep deprivation increases the risk of major depression<symptom> among young women. Mental health promotion for young people should include relevant strategies to ensure young women can achieve recommended amounts of sleep.
