  Cell lines stably transfected with genes responding to Type I interferons ( IFN) are potentially a useful alternative to enzyme linked immuo-assays ( ELISAs) or assays based on resistance of a test cell line to virus infection using cell death or infection endpoints. Increasingly available are a variety of commercial cell lines developed for reporter gene assays ( RGAs) which are responsive to IFN exposure. These cells produce a soluble gene product which can be readily quantified using multiwell plate spectrophotometers or luminometers. We have investigated RAW-Blue ISG ™ and B16-Blue IFNα/β ™ cells ( InvivoGen) which produce secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP) as a RGA to measure Interferon alpha ( IFNα) and beta ( IFNβ). These cells showed a log-linear response over 4 logs of IFN concentration between 10 and 100,000 Units/ml ( U/ml). Concentration dependent responses could be observed as early as 6 h but greater sensitivity was obtained at 24 h. Neutralizing antibodies to IFNα and IFNβ reduced the response to baseline. As proof of principle supernatants from RAW 264.7 ( murine macrophage; parental cell line) infected with 1 multiplicity of infection ( moi) of influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( X31/H3N2) were used as test samples. Pre-treatment of the supernatant with anti-IFNα failed to reduce the cell response but it was reduced to background by anti-IFNβ. The high level of IFNβ but very low level of IFNα was confirmed by ELISA. Availability , ease of use and maintenance , and possible cost savings make application of this reporter gene cell approach a valuable alternative to other methods for measuring Type I interferon.
