  Adoption of bare metal oxides as catalytic materials shows inferior electrochemical activity because of their poor electrical conductivity. Although synthetic strategies for the employment of conductive substrates are well-established , the rational design and fabrication of hollow metal oxides nanostructures on the robust matrix with a high surface area and conductivity remains challenging. In the present research work , a strategy that transforms a metal-organic framework thin layer into a nanostructured CuO/C hollow shell to coat on the 3D nano-dendritic Cu foams as an electrode was successfully developed. This electrode is claimed to provide an extraordinary electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) in alkaline media. The hierarchical complex presents fast electronic transmission networks and rich redox sites , leading to the significant enhancement in electrocatalytic OER efficiency. Furthermore , the spherical porous structure and robust architecture facilitate the high-speed diffusion of O
