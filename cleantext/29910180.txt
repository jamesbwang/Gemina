  High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation ( HDT-ASCT) and maintenance treatment with novel agents are the best options for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma , increasing the rate of complete response ( CR) and prolonging progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS). Indeed , the achievement of a CR is a predictor of long-term survival among transplant-eligible patients. However , it is unclear whether patients reaching a CR after induction treatment could receive less intense consolidation or avoid maintenance therapy. We analyzed CR patients treated in 2 phase III trials , GIMEMA-RV-MM-PI-209 and RV-MM-EMN-441 , to compare HDT-ASCT with an R-Alk ( lenalidomide , alkylator) regimen as consolidation , and lenalidomide ( R) maintenance with no maintenance. The primary endpoints were PFS , second PFS ( PFS2) , and OS from consolidation and maintenance ( _ m). Overall , the data from 166 patients in CR were analyzed , 95 in the HDT-ASCT group and 71 in the R-Alk group. The CR patients who received HDT-ASCT had a better PFS ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.55; P = .01) , PFS2 ( HR , 0.46; P = .02) , and OS ( HR , 0.42; P = .03) compared with patients randomized to R-Alk. The survival benefit with HDT-ASCT was confirmed among all the subgroups , according to age , International Staging System ( ISS stage , cytogenetic profile , and receipt of maintenance therapy. CR patients who received lenalidomide maintenance had a better PFS_m ( 4 years: 54 % vs. 19 %; HR , 0.43; P = .02) compared with those who received no maintenance. However , no difference was observed in terms of PFS2_m ( 4 years: 72 % vs. 58 %; HR , 0.83; P = .67) and OS_m ( 4 years: 79 % vs. 72 %; HR , 0.82; P = .73) with maintenance therapy. Even in CR patients , outcomes were improved by an intensified approach with HDT-ASCT consolidation and lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy.
