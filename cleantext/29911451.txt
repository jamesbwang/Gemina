  There are some evidences supporting the relation between gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) and diastolic dysfunction. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of well-controlled GDM on morphological and functional myocardium. We designed a prospective cross-sectional study to evaluate left ventricular ( LV) diastolic function of 60 neonates born from mothers with well-controlled GDM ( case group) on days of 3-5 after birth. The infants of diabetic mothers ( IDM) group were divided into two groups: diabetic mothers treated only with diet ( class A) and group of mothers on medical therapy by insulin or metformin ( class B). Traditional echocardiography and pulsed-wave Doppler ( PWD) , tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI) were performed for all the neonates. The study group consisted of 60 neonates as males ( M) = 32 , ( 0.53 %) and females ( F) = 28 , ( 0.46 %). Using M-mode echocardiography , interventricular septum thickness ( IVS) , and LV mass were significantly higher in IDM than control group ( p = .0001). The PWD showed both a significantly more peak mitral flow at early diastolic wave ( E) and an early filling deceleration time ( E-DT) ( p = .0001). Tissue Doppler echocardiography parameters A ' ( cm/s) ( p = .0001) , E ' ( cm/s) ( p = .002) , and E '/ A ' ratio ( p = .0001) , left ventricular myocardial performance index ( LVMPI) , and isovolumetric relaxation time ( IVRT) were outstandingly different between the two groups ( p = .0001 , respectively). Evaluating the GDM group mothers of class A and class B , no significant difference was noted in PWD or TDI parameters compared with the healthy ones. It seems that neonates of mothers with well-controlled GDM are still at increased risk of cardiac hypertrophy , subclinical diastolic dysfunction , and impaired left ventricular relaxation. This can be interpreted that focusing only on glycemic control is not enough to prevent cardiac dysfunction.
