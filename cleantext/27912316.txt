  Immunological memory is critical for long-standing protection against microorganisms; however , certain antigen-specific memory CD4 We performed a series of experiments using mice model for chronic airway inflammation<symptom>. We also investigated the human samples from patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. We recently reported that inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue ( iBALT) was shaped during chronic inflammation<symptom> in the lung. We also found that memory-type Tpath2 cells are maintained within iBALT. The maintenance of the Tpath2 cells within iBALT is supported by specific cell subpopulations within the lung. Furthermore , ectopic lymphoid structures consisting of memory CD4 Thus , the cell components that organize iBALT formation may be therapeutic targets for chronic allergic airway
