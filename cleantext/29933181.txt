  Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing ( anammox) bacteria are well known for their aggregation ability. However , very little is known about cell surface physicochemical properties of anammox bacteria and thus their aggregation abilities have not been quantitatively evaluated yet. Here , we investigated the aggregation abilities of three different anammox bacterial species: `` Candidatus<pathogen> Brocadia sinica<pathogen> '' , `` Ca. Jettenia caeni '' and `` Ca. Brocadia sapporoensis ''. Planktonic free-living enrichment cultures of these three anammox species were harvested from the membrane bioreactors ( MBRs). The physicochemical properties ( e.g. , contact angle , zeta potential , and surface thermodynamics) were analyzed for these anammox bacterial species and used in the extended DLVO theory to understand the force-distance relationship. In addition , their extracellular polymeric substances ( EPSs) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results revealed that the `` Ca. B.<pathogen> sinica<pathogen> '' cells have the most hydrophobic surface and less hydrophilic functional groups in EPS than other anammox strains , suggesting better aggregation capability. Furthermore , aggregate formation and anammox bacterial populations were monitored when planktonic free-living cells were cultured in up-flow column reactors under the same conditions. Rapid development of microbial aggregates was observed with the anammox bacterial population shifts to a dominance of `` Ca. B.<pathogen> sinica<pathogen> '' in all three reactors. The dominance of `` Ca. B.<pathogen> sinica<pathogen> '' could be explained by its better aggregation ability and the superior growth kinetic properties ( higher growth rate and affinity to nitrite). The superior aggregation ability of `` Ca. B.<pathogen> sinica<pathogen> '' indicates significant advantages ( efficient and rapid start-up of anammox reactors due to better biomass retention as granules and consequently stable performance) in wastewater treatment application.
