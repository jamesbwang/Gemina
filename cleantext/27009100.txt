  Whole slide images ( WSIs , digitized histopathology glass slides) are large data files whose long-term storage remains a significant cost for pathology departments. Currently used WSI formats are based on lossy image compression alogrithms , either using JPEG or its more efficient successor JPEG 2000. While the advantages of the JPEG 2000 algorithm ( JP2) are commonly recognized , its compression parameters have not been fully optimized for pathology WSIs. We defined an optimized parametrization for JPEG 2000 image compression , designated JP2-WSI , to be used specifically with histopathological WSIs. Our parametrization is based on allowing a very high degree of compression on the background part of the WSI while using a conventional amount of compression on the tissue-containing part of the image , resulting in high overall compression ratios. When comparing the compression power of JP2-WSI to the commonly used fixed 35:1 compression ratio JPEG 2000 and the default image formats of proprietary Aperio , Hamamatsu , and 3DHISTECH scanners , JP2-WSI produced the smallest file sizes and highest overall compression ratios for all 17 slides tested. The image quality , as judged by visual inspection and peak signal-to-noise ratio ( PSNR) measurements , was equal to or better than the compared image formats. The average file size by JP2-WSI amounted to 15 , 9 , and 16 percent , respectively , of the file sizes of the three commercial scanner vendors ' proprietary file formats ( 3DHISTECH MRXS , Aperio SVS , and Hamamatsu NDPI). In comparison to the commonly used 35:1 compressed JPEG 2000 , JP2-WSI was three times more efficient. JP2-WSI allows very efficient and cost-effective data compression for whole slide images without loss of image information required for histopathological diagnosis.
