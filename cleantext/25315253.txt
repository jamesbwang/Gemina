  Prenylated flavonoids and isoflavonoids are phytochemicals with remarkable antibacterial activity. In this study , 30 prenylated ( iso) flavonoids were tested against Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> and Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( the latter in combination with an efflux pump inhibitor). Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the most active compounds ranged between 6.3-15.0 Âµg/mL. Quantitative structure-activity relationships ( QSAR) analysis was performed and linear regression models were proposed with R
