  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced melanoma , with these agents significantly improving survival for patients with metastatic disease. With the increasing use of these agents , the number of adverse reactions secondary to their use has also increased. Sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like reactions are one such immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event. We report a case of sarcoid-like granulomatous tumoral melanosis in a patient on the programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1) receptor inhibitor pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma. This is , to our knowledge , the first reported case of a sarcoidal form of tumoral melanosis in a patient on anti-PD-1 therapy. We postulate that this reflects tumor regression in response to pembrolizumab-induced immune activation , with concomitant therapy-triggered induction of a sarcoid-like reaction. These findings and the literature review presented herein should alert clinicians and pathologists to the possibility of regressed lesions<symptom> with sarcoid-like features presenting as mimickers of disease progression in patients undergoing immunotherapy for advanced melanoma.
