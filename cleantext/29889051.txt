  Responses of retinal ganglion cells to direct electrical stimulation have been shown experimentally to be well described by linear-nonlinear models. These models rely on the simplifying assumption that retinal ganglion cell responses to stimulation with an array of electrodes are driven by a simple linear weighted sum of stimulus current amplitudes from each electrode , known as the ` electrical receptive field '. This paper aims to demonstrate the biophysical basis of the linear-nonlinear model and the electrical receptive field to facilitate the development of improved stimulation strategies for retinal implants. We compare the linear-nonlinear model of subretinal electrical stimulation with a multi-layered , biophysical , volume conductor model of retinal stimulation. Our results show that the linear electrical receptive field of the linear-nonlinear model matches the transmembrane currents induced by electrodes ( the activating function) at the site of the high-density sodium channel band with only minor discrepancies. The discrepancies are mostly eliminated by including axial current flow originating from adjacent cell compartments. Furthermore , for cells where a single linear electrical receptive field is insufficient , we show that cell responses are likely driven by multiple sites of action potential initiation with multiple distinct receptive fields , each of which can be accurately described by the activating function. This result establishes that the biophysical basis of the electrical receptive field of the linear-nonlinear model is the superposition of transmembrane currents induced by different electrodes at and near the site of action potential initiation. Together with existing experimental support for linear-nonlinear models of electrical stimulation , this provides a firm basis for using this much simplified model to generate more optimal stimulation patterns for retinal implants.
