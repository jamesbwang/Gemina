  The transcription factor GATA3 plays a significant role in mammary gland development and differentiation. We analyzed expression of GATA3 in breast cancer ( BC) cell lines and clinical specimens from BC patients in Taiwan. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase ( RT)- polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , quantitative real-time PCR carried out to determine the mRNA level of GATA3 from 241 pairs of matched tumor and adjacent normal tissues from anonymous female donors. GATA3 immunohistochemistry ( IHC) staining and H-score were performed ( n = 25). Inducing and silencing of GATA3 were done by exposure MCF-7 cell line to nicotine or curcumin , respectively. GATA3 expression was detected in most of the estrogen receptor-positive ( ER +) tumor specimens ( 176/241 , 73 %) compared with paired normal tissues ( 65/241 , 27 %) ( p = < 0.001). The GATA3 level was highest in Luminal A and independent t-tests revealed higher GATA3 were associated with ER + ( p = 0.018) and BC stages ( stage II , and stage IV). Nuclear protein expression of GATA3 was detected in tumor tissues ( p = < 0.001) with higher H-score in Luminal A patients ( p = 0.012). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that ER +/ progesterone receptor ( PgR) + and lower grade BC patients with relatively high GATA3 had better clinical overall survival ( OS). GATA3 regulate ERa and BCL-2 as BC luminal subtype markers. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the expression of GATA3 was an effective predictor of the risk of death. We demonstrated a correlation between GATA3 expression and only ER + and suggest that a higher GATA3 expression is a good prognostic factor for OS for ER +/ BC patients.
