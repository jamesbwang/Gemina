  Guilt is commonly associated with distress and psychopathology. However , there is a lack of validated measures that assess how people cope with this aversive emotional and cognitive experience. We therefore developed and validated a self-report measure that assesses how people manage their guilt: the Guilt Management Scale ( GMS). The GMS was administered to a non-clinical ( n = 339) and clinical ( n = 67) sample , alongside other validated measures of guilt severity , coping , thought control and psychological distress. Results from a principal component analysis ( PCA) and assessments of test-retest reliability and internal consistency are presented. The PCA yielded a six subscale solution ( Self-Punishment , Reparation , People-Focused , Spirituality , Avoidance and Metacognition) , accounting for 56.14 % of variance. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency was found to be good-excellent for the majority of subscales. Across samples , Self-Punishment was related to higher levels of guilt and distress whilst Metacognition and Reparation were related to less guilt and distress in the non-clinical sample only. This paper provides preliminary evidence for the psychometric properties of the GMS in a non-clinical sample. With development and validation in clinical samples , the GMS could be used to inform psychological formulations of guilt and assess therapy outcomes.
