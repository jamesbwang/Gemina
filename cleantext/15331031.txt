  Internet addiction and mobile phone addiction are both forms of technology addiction , and thus would be expected to show similarities and differences. This study investigated the association between the Internet Addiction Test ( IAT) and the Mobile Phone Dependence Questionnaire ( MPDQ) as a test of concurrent validity. Participants were 1,072 students aged between 9 and 18 years old ( 63 % male and 37 % female) from three primary schools and three secondary schools in Hong Kong. Correlations showed that scores on the two measures were moderately correlated , providing further evidence of each measure 's validity. Confirmatory factor analysis that the IAT 's factor structure was similar in both younger and older samples , suggesting that it is developmentally appropriate for primary and secondary school students. Latent Class Analysis showed that 4 classes or 5 classes are appropriate for IAT 's score classification. ROC analyses showed similar rates of participants with high scores on the IAT and on the MPDQ. The outcomes have implications for the prevention and treatment of Internet and mobile phone addiction. Future research can establish norms for different ages , genders and cultural groups.
