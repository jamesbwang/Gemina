The intervention group received pharmaceutical care from a pharmacist in collaboration with physicians and was followed-up for 6 months , while the control group received usual care in the outpatient pharmacy. A total of 73 participants in the intervention group and 79 participants in the control group completed the study. Participants in the intervention group had significantly better medication adherence ( median = 7.0 vs 5.0 , Collaborative interventions between pharmacists and physicians improved medication adherence and MAI scores of the elderly patients. Therefore , such services should be implemented in all hospitals , especially in countries where pharmacists are still not playing a substantial role in patient care. NMRR-12-958-13020.
