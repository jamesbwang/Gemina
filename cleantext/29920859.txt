  To evaluate the performance of Rapid-Heat LAMPellet assay in field conditions for diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis in an endemic area in Cubal , Angola , and to assess the reproducibility in a reference laboratory. A total of 172 urine samples from school-age children were tested for microhaematuria , microscopic detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs and LAMP for DNA detection. Urine samples were stored in a basic equipped laboratory. Field-LAMP tests were performed with and without prior DNA extraction from urine samples , and the results were read by turbidity and by colour change. When field procedures were finished , samples were sent to a reference laboratory to be reanalysed by LAMP. A total of 83 of 172 ( 48.3 %) were positive for microhaematuria , 87/172 ( 50.6 %) were microscopy-positive for S. haematobium eggs detection , and 127/172 ( 73.8 %) showed LAMP-positive results for detecting S. haematobium using purified DNA and 109/172 ( 63.4 %) without prior DNA extraction. MacNemar 's test showed a statistical significant relation between LAMP results and microscopy-detected S. haematobium infections and microhaematuria ( P < 0.001 in both cases) , respectively. When samples of purified DNA were reanalysed in a reference laboratory in Spain using the same LAMP methodology , the overall reproducibility achieved 72.1 %. The ease of use , simplicity and feasibility demonstrated by LAMP assay in field conditions together with the acceptable level of reproducibility achieved in a reference laboratory support the use of LAMP assay as an effective test for molecular diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis in endemic remote areas.
