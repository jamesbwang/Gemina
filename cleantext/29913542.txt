  The aim of this work was to evaluate the changes caused by estrogen deficiency in lipid metabolism. This study encompassed direct measurements of plasma biochemical analyses , liver lipid contents , and assessments of the mitochondrial β-oxidation capacity as well as an evaluation of the liver redox status in an animal model of estrogen deficiency. When compared with control mice , the livers of ovariectomized ( OVX) mice presented considerable accretions in their lipid contents , which were accompanied by increased levels of lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates and mitochondria from OVX groups and decreased reduced glutathione ( GSH) contents. In isolated mitochondria , estrogen deficiency inhibited mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids irrespective of their chain length. The liver mitochondrial and peroxisomal H These data provide one potential explanation for the increased susceptibility to metabolic diseases observed after menopause.
