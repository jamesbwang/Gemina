  The miR-34 family of microRNAs suppresses the expression of proteins involved in pluripotency and oncogenesis. miR-34 expression is frequently reduced in cancers; however , the regulation of their expression is not well understood. We used genome-wide miRNA profiling and mechanistic analysis to show that SUMOylation regulates miR-34b/ c expression , which impacts the expression of c-Myc and other tested miR-34 targets. We used site-directed mutagenesis and other methods to show that protein kinase B ( also known as Akt) phosphorylation of FOXO3a plays an important role in SUMOylation-dependent expression of miR-34b/ c. This study reveals how the miR-34-targeted gene expression program is regulated by SUMOylation and shows that SUMOylation need not regulate target proteins through direct modification , but instead can act through the expression of their targeting miRNAs.
