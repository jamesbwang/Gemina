  Glucose isomerase ( GI) catalyzes the reversible enzymatic isomerization of d-glucose and d-xylose to d-fructose and d-xylulose , respectively. This is one of the most important enzymes in the production of high-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS) and biofuel. We recently determined the crystal structure of GI from S. rubiginosus ( SruGI) complexed with a xylitol inhibitor in one metal binding mode. Although we assessed inhibitor binding at the M1 site , the metal binding at the M2 site and the substrate recognition mechanism for SruGI remains the unclear. Here , we report the crystal structure of the two metal binding modes of SruGI and its complex with glucose. This study provides a snapshot of metal binding at the SruGI M2 site in the presence of Mn
