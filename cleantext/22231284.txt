  Two-dimensional ( 2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides , known as MXenes , are a large class of materials that are finding numerous applications ranging from energy storage and electromagnetic interference shielding to water purification and antibacterial coatings. Yet , despite the fact that more than 20 different MXenes have been synthesized , the mechanical properties of a MXene monolayer have not been experimentally studied. We measured the elastic properties of monolayers and bilayers of the most important MXene material to date , Ti
