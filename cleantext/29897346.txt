  This paper presents the development of a continuous carbon nanotube ( CNT) composite film sensor with a strain detecting range of 0 % -2 % for structural composites. The strain-dependent resistance responses of continuous CNT film and its resin-impregnated composite films were investigated at temperatures as high as 200 °C. The results manifest that impregnation with resin leads to a much larger gauge factor than pristine film. Both the pristine and composite films show an increase in resistivity with increasing temperature. For different composite films , the ordering of gauge factors is consistent with that of the matrix moduli. This indicates that a resin matrix with higher modulus and strong interactions between CNTs/CNT bundles and the resin matrix are beneficial for enhancing the piezoresistive effect. The CNT/PAA composite film has a gauge factor of 4.3 at 150 °C , an order of magnitude higher than the metal foil sensor. Therefore , the CNT composite films have great potential for simultaneous application for reinforcement and as strain sensor to realise a multifunctional composite.
