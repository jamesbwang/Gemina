  The present study examined whether the ability to recognize vocal emotional expressions is negatively related to features of the Broader Autism Phenotype ( BAP) in the general population. We assessed 61 typically developing adults on a BAP self-report measure ( Broader Autism Phenotype Questionnaire) and a purpose-developed online emotion recognition task for efficient delivery of non-linguistic vocal stimuli corresponding to the six basic emotions. Contrary to expectations , we found that higher self-ratings of rigid BAP traits correlated with better recognition accuracy and higher intensity ratings for angry voices. We interpret this anger-specific association as an advantage for enhanced threat detection in the BAP and discuss this finding in the broader context of personality research and interpersonal theory.
