  The local cattle populations belonging to the ` Brune de l'Atlas ' cattle in Algeria and Morocco are potential resources in terms of genetic diversity and socioeconomic prevalence and their characterization is an essential step in any program designed to conserve genetic diversity. Our objectives were to assess the genetic diversity , the population structure and relationships among four Algerian cattle breeds , the Biskra , Cheurfa , Chelifienne and Guelmoise and of two Moroccan , the Oulmès-Zaër and Tidili by genotyping 50 309 single nucleotide polymorphism in 203 unrelated animals. A low population structure was observed across breeds with pairwise F ST values ranging from 0.008 to 0.043 , suggesting a high level of gene flow. These data were combined with the available data on cattle populations representative of Europe ( EUT) , West African taurine ( WAT) and zebu ( ZEB). Principle Components Analysis was carried out which revealed that the Maghrebin populations are closer to the EUT/ZEB population than to the WAT. Structure analysis confirmed this mixed origin of the Maghrebin cattle populations. We also detected the influence of zebu breeds in Cheurfa and Guelmoise populations. This study provides the first information about genetic diversity within and between Algerian and Moroccan cattle populations and gives a detailed description of their genetic structure and relationships according to their historical origins. This study revealed that several combined effects contributed to shape the genetic diversity of the six Maghrebin populations studied: ( i) gene flow among local breeds , ( ii) the recent introgression of European breeds in local Algerian breeds and ( iii) the traditional management systems. The results of this study will primarily assist policy makers and livestock keepers to make useful decisions for improvement of genetic resources while ensuring the preservation and conservation of local breeds in Algeria and Morocco.
