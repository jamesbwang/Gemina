  Signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1) has been well-defined as an androgen-sensitive transducer mediating skeletal muscle growth in vitro , however , this has yet to be tested in vivo. As such , male mice were subjected to either sham or castration surgery and allowed to recover for 7 weeks to induce atrophy of skeletal muscle. Then , castrated mice were implanted with either a control pellet or pellet that administered rapamycin ( ~ 2.5 mg/kg/day). Seven days post implant , a subset of castrated mice with control pellets and all castrated mice with rapamycin pellets were given once weekly injections of nandrolone decanoate ( ND) to induce muscle growth over a 6-week period. Effective blockade of mTORC1 by rapamycin was noted in the skeletal muscle by the inability of insulin to induce phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 70 kD ( Thr389) and uncoordinated like kinase 1 ( Ser757). While castration reduced TA mass , muscle fiber cross sectional area , and total protein content , ND administration restored these measures to sham levels in a rapamycin-insensitive manner. Similar findings were also observed in the plantaris and soleus , suggesting this rapamycin-insensitive effect was not specific to the TA or fiber type. Androgen-mediated growth was not due to changes in translational capacity. Despite these findings in the limb skeletal muscle , rapamycin completely prevented the ND-mediated growth of the heart. In all , these data indicate that mTORC1 has a limited role in the androgen-mediated growth of the limb skeletal muscle , however , mTORC1 was necessary for androgen-mediated growth of heart<symptom> muscle.
