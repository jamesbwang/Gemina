  The effect of temperature ( 6 , 15 and 30 °C) during ageing on the colour , phytochemical composition and bioactivity of roselle wine was investigated over 12 months. At the end of ageing , wines stored at 6 °C had the highest colour density and lowest polymeric anthocyanins. The initial concentration of most of the individual phenolic compounds decreased during ageing , with reduction of monomeric anthocyanins contributing to the formation of anthocyanin-derivatives ( pyranoanthocyanins) , eight of which were identified tentatively and reported here for the first time in roselle wine. The decrease in individual phenolic compounds did not affect inhibition of α-glucosidase ( maltase) activity , which remained relatively low but stable throughout ageing. Diethyl succinate was the only volatile clearly influenced by ageing temperature , with the most pronounced effect at 30 °C ( ∼ 256 fold increase). In summary , the final concentrations of anthocyanins and diethyl succinate were the major compounds influenced by ageing temperature.
