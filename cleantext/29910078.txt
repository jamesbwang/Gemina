  Neurons in the primate medial temporal lobe ( MTL) respond selectively to visual categories such as faces , contributing to how the brain represents stimulus meaning. However , it remains unknown whether MTL neurons continue to encode stimulus meaning when it changes flexibly as a function of variable task demands imposed by goal-directed behavior. While classically associated with long-term memory , recent lesion<symptom> and neuroimaging studies show that the MTL also contributes critically to the online guidance of goal-directed behaviors such as visual search. Do such tasks modulate responses of neurons in the MTL , and if so , do their responses mirror bottom-up input from visual cortices or do they reflect more abstract goal-directed properties? To answer these questions , we performed concurrent recordings of eye movements<symptom> and single neurons in the MTL and medial frontal cortex ( MFC) in human neurosurgical patients performing a memory-guided visual search task. We identified a distinct population of target-selective neurons in both the MTL and MFC whose response signaled whether the currently fixated stimulus was a target or distractor. This target-selective response was invariant to visual category and predicted whether a target was detected or missed behaviorally during a given fixation. The response latencies , relative to fixation onset , of MFC target-selective neurons preceded those in the MTL by âˆ¼ 200 ms , suggesting a frontal origin for the target signal. The human MTL thus represents not only fixed stimulus identity , but also task-specified stimulus relevance due to top-down goal relevance.
