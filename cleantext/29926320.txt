  Cross-talk between coding RNAs and regulatory non-coding microRNAs , within human genome , has provided compelling evidence for the existence of flexible checkpoint control of T-Cell activation. The present study attempts to demonstrate that the interplay between miR-2909 and its effector KLF4 gene has the inherent capacity to regulate genes coding for CTLA4 , CD28 , CD40 , CD134 , PDL1 , CD80 , CD86 , IL-6 and IL-10 within normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs). Based upon these findings , we propose a pathway that links miR-2909 RNomics with the genes coding for immune checkpoint regulators required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis.
