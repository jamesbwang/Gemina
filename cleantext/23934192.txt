  Prior studies have demonstrated an association between excision repair cross-complementation group 1 ( ERCC1) expression level and outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of ERCC1 on survival for patients with stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC ( NS-NSCLC) enrolled in the INNOVATIONS trial , thus receiving as treatment either erlotinib/bevacizumab ( EB) or cisplatin/gemcitabine/bevacizumab ( PGB). We retrospectively analyzed tumor tissue of 72 patients using immunohistochemistry to assess the expression of ERCC1. The distribution between treatment arms was equal ( 36 patients each). Two different H scores were calculated and correlated with survival. In ERCC1-positive patients , no significant difference in terms of progression-free survival ( PFS) between treatment arms has been detected. ERCC1-negative patients benefited from PGB compared to EB arm ( H score: HR = 0.377 , 95 % CI ( 0.167-0.849) , p = 0.0151; modified H score: HR = 0.484 , 95 % CI ( 0.234-1.004) , p = 0.0468). With respect to the scoring system , in the EB-arm , a significant superior PFS turned out in ERCC1-positive patients when employing the H-score ( HR = 0.430 , 95 % CI ( 0.188-0.981) , p = 0.0397; median 4.9 vs. 3.9 months) , but not with the modified H-score. Our findings support the hypothesis that NS-NSCLC displaying a low ERCC1 expression might benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. High expression indicated better PFS in the EB arm supporting the prognostic impact. However , as impact of ERCC1-assessment even might depend on scoring systems differences , the need in standardization of assessment methodology is emphasized.
