  The xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol improves endothelial function in different populations , including patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF). Its effect on arterial stiffness parameters is less clear. We investigated the effect of short-term low-dose allopurinol therapy on arterial stiffness in Saudi patients with stable mild-moderate CHF. A prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was performed on 73 patients with mild-moderate CHF. In all , 36 patients were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily for 3 months , while 37 patients were randomized to placebo. Arterial stiffness parameters , aortic pulse wave velocity ( Ao-PWV) and heart rate corrected augmentation index ( c-AIx) , were assessed before and after treatment along with serum uric acid. A total of 66 patients completed the study. Both groups were matched for age , sex , severity of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and arterial stiffness. Compared with placebo , allopurinol recipients had a significant fall in uric acid concentration from 6.31 ± 1.4 ( SD) mg/dL to 3.81 ± 1.2 ( We have shown that allopurinol significantly reduced uric acid concentration in Saudi patients with CHF but was not associated with a change in arterial stiffness. Our cohort of patients had worse arterial stiffness values at baseline , which might make them more resistant to change using our study regimen.The study has been registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry with an identifier number of ISRCTN58980230.
