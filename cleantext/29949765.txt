  The microenvironment shapes cell behavior and determines metastatic outcomes of tumors. We addressed how microenvironmental cues control tumor cell invasion in pediatric medulloblastoma ( MB). We show that bFGF promotes MB tumor cell invasion through FGF receptor ( FGFR) in vitro and that blockade of FGFR represses brain tissue infiltration in vivo. TGF-β regulates pro-migratory bFGF function in a context-dependent manner. Under low bFGF , the non-canonical TGF-β pathway causes ROCK activation and cortical translocation of ERK1/2 , which antagonizes FGFR signaling by inactivating FGFR substrate 2 ( FRS2) , and promotes a contractile , non-motile phenotype. Under high bFGF , negative-feedback regulation of FRS2 by bFGF-induced ERK1/2 causes repression of the FGFR pathway. Under these conditions , TGF-β counters inactivation of FRS2 and restores pro-migratory signaling. These findings pinpoint coincidence detection of bFGF and TGF-β signaling by FRS2 as a mechanism that controls tumor cell invasion. Thus , targeting FRS2 represents an emerging strategy to abrogate aberrant FGFR signaling.
