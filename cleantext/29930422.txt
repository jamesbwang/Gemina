  To investigate the level and influencing factors of health-related quality of life in myasthenia gravis ( MG) patients with myasthenia gravis quality of life-15 ( MGQOL-15) Chinese version and to provide corresponding measures in one tertiary hospital of Sichuan Province. We collected the general data ( gender , age , body mass index BMI , marital status , educational level and employee status) , clinical data ( Osserman type , myasthenia gravis composite ( MGC) , other immunopathies , disease duration , frequency of outpatient visits per month , ratio of disease cost to income each month and frequency of symptoms during the past month) and the MGQOL-15 Chinese version from 168 myasthenia gravis patients in one tertiary hospital of Sichuan Province. The mean score of MGQOL-15 was 17.67 ± 12.78. The score of the item `` My occupational skills and job status have been negatively affected. '' was the highest , followed by `` I have trouble using my eyes. '' and `` I am frustrated by my MG. '' Single factor analysis showed that MG patients ' QOL were different with different disease severity MGC ( F = 19.353 , P < 0.001) , ratio of disease cost to income each month ( F = 5.831 , P < 0.001) and the frequency of symptoms during the past month ( F = 9.128 , P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that disease severity MGC ( β = 0.743 , P < 0.001) , ration of disease cost to income each month ( β = 3.347 , P < 0.001) and the frequency of symptoms during the past month ( β = 2.216 , P < 0.003) were the main predictors of HRQOL in the MG patients. Our study showed that the MGQOL-15 is helpful for clinicians to evaluate MG patients ' QOL regularly , investigate the influencing factors and implement corresponding interventions the so as to improve the patients ' quality of life. Disease severity MGC , ratio of disease cost to income each month and the frequency of symptoms during the past month were the main predictors of MG patients ' QOL. Clinicians should pay more attention to MG patients ' disease severity MGC and the frequency of symptoms during the past month.
