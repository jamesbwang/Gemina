  Selenocysteine ( Sec) has received a lot of attention as a potential anticancer drug. However , its broad cytotoxicity limits its therapeutic usefulness. Thus , Sec is an attractive candidate for targeted drug delivery. Here , we demonstrate for the first time that an engineered version of the capsid formed by Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase ( AaLS) can act as a nanocarrier for delivery of Sec to cells. Specifically , a previously reported variant of AaLS ( AaLS-IC) , which contains a single cysteine per subunit that projects into the capsid interior , was modified by reaction with the diselenide dimer of Sec ( Sec
