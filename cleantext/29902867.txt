  Increasing resistance to praziquantel , the only available antischistosomal drug , is always developed by schistosomes. The recent description of stem cell-like neoblasts in schistosomes led to the idea of applying antineoplastic drugs as antischistosomal agents that may inhibit stem cell divisions and retard worm regeneration. Here , we explored the in vitro and in vivo effect of some antineoplastic drugs on S. mansoni worm and the host mouse liver. S. mansoni worms ' viability was tested after exposure to either praziquantel or one of the antitumor drugs ( hydroxyurea , cisplatin , methotrexate , and colchicine) in vitro for 24 and 48 h. The effect of two of them ( hydroxyurea and cisplatin) on worm burden , tegument ultrastructure , and host liver structure and function was tested in vivo in S. mansoni-infected mouse model. All drugs affected variably the worm burden in vitro. Hydroxyurea and cisplatin , like praziquantel , damaged the worm tegument , reduced worm burden , and viable schistosome eggs , decreased anti-schistosome IgG , reduced egg-induced hepatic granuloma<disease> size and cellularity , restored liver organization and improved liver function as represented by serum alanine aminotransferase and albumin. In conclusions , a single dose of hydroxyurea and cisplatin had anti-schistosome effects and may offer a safe promising alternative to control of schistosomiasis. A direct link between antitumor drugs and inhibition of schistosome neoblasts remains to be proven.
