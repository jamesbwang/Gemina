  Pathologists provide expert tissue assessment of breast cancer , yet their value to guide the appropriate use of breast cancer gene expression profile ( GEP) tests is underutilized. The specific aims of this study are to report morpho-immunohistologic characteristics of breast tumors with Oncotype DX 34 % of tumors were low grade special types , while the remainder were enriched with high hormone receptor content with mitosis score of 1. These algorithmic selection criteria correctly identified all patient cases below the chemotherapy cut-point , i.e. RS < 25 , indicating that these Oncotype test orders were an unnecessary cost. ( 1) This unique study demonstrates that pathologists add great value to triage breast cancer for GEP. ( 2) Pathologists can prospectively identify low-grade tumor biology with high sensitivity and high specificity for those cases which do not require chemotherapy ( RS < 25) using MS and hormone receptor content.
