  Macrodiscs , which are magnetically alignable lipid bilayer discs with diameters of > 30 nm , were obtained by solubilizing protein-containing liposomes with styrene-maleic acid copolymers. Macrodiscs provide a detergent-free phospholipid bilayer environment for biophysical and functional studies of membrane proteins under physiological conditions. The narrow resonance linewidths observed from membrane proteins in styrene-maleic acid macrodiscs advance structure determination by oriented sample solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
