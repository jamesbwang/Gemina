  Since its inception in 2001 , in utero electroporation ( IUE) has been widely used by the neuroscience community. IUE is a technique developed to introduce plasmid DNA into embryonic mouse brains without permanently removing the embryos from the uterus. Given that IUE labels cells that line the ventricles , including radial fibers and migrating neuroblasts , this technique is an excellent tool for studying factors that govern neural cell fate determination and migration in the developing mouse brain. Whether IUE has an effect on microglia , the immune cells of the central nervous system ( CNS) , has yet to be investigated. We used IUE and the pCIG2 , pCIC-Ascl1 , or pRFP-C-RS expression vectors to label radial glia lining the ventricles of the embryonic cortex and/or hypothalamus. Specifically , we conducted IUE at E14 .5 and harvested the brains at E15 .5 or E17 .5. Immunohistochemistry , along with cytokine and chemokine analyses , were performed on embryonic brains with or without IUE exposure. IUE using the pCIG2 , pCIC-Ascl1 , or pRFP-C-RS vectors alone altered microglia morphology , where the majority of microglia near the ventricles were amoeboid and displayed altered expression signatures , including the upregulation of Cd45 and downregulation of P2ry12. Moreover , IUE led to increases in P2ry12 Our results suggest that IUE might have unintended consequences of activating microglia in the embryonic brain , which could have long-term effects , particularly within the hypothalamus.
