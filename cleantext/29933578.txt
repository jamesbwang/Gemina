  Asphalt mixtures containing recycled construction aggregates ( RCA) have the problem of high bitumen absorption. This paper characterizes the effects of glass on the bitumen absorption and volumetric properties of asphalt mixtures containing 25 % and 50 % RCA through laboratory investigation. The materials used in the test program include C320 bitumen , RCA and recycled glass. Three glass contents of 0 % , 10 % , and 20 % in terms of the total weight of fine aggregates are used in the mixture designs for preparing 100 mm diameter specimens containing 0 % , 25 % and 50 % RCA , under 120 gyration cycles. Different types of tests including aggregate specification tests and volumetric analysis tests were conducted on individual aggregates and asphalt mixtures in accordance with Australian standards. The test results indicate that the glass waste can be a viable material for improving the problem of high bitumen absorption of asphalt mixtures containing RCA.
