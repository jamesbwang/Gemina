  A series of quinoylalkyl side chains was designed and synthesized , followed by introduction into ketolides by coupling with building block 6 or 32. The corresponding targets 7a-n , 33b , and 33e were tested for their in vitro activities against a series of macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant pathogens. Some of them showed a similar antibacterial spectrum and comparable activity to telithromycin. Among them , two C2-F ketolides , compounds 33b and 33e , displayed excellent activities against macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant pathogens.
