  Increased risk of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> has been associated with diabetes mellitus ( DM) and also periodontitis<disease> is considered as the sixth complication of DM. Medical physicians may have an advantageous position compared to the dentists to provide early patient counseling about oral health because patients attend medical offices more often than to dental offices and are more likely to be affiliated to medical than to dental insurance. Hence , the medical practitioners should have sufficient knowledge in this regard. The study aimed to assess the knowledge , attitudes , and practice behaviors of endocrinologists , general medicine practitioners , and diabetologists on the relationship between periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and DM. Data were collected from sixty participants practicing in Nellore , using a structured questionnaire survey. The obtained data were analyzed through percentages. All the participants ( 100 %) were aware that there existed a relation between oral health and general health. However , only 17.8 % ( 10) of the participants refer their patients to dentists without patients asking for referral. The endocrinologists were aware of the didactic relationship , whereas general medicine practitioners and diabetologists are not much well-equipped with the knowledge on relationship between DM and periodontitis<disease> There exists a wide gap between their practice behaviors and current scientific evidence. Therefore , more emphasis must be made by medical practitioners for the diabetic patient toward periodontal health which is most important yet neglected aspect of comprehensive health care.
