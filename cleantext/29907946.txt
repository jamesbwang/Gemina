  To examine the vascular density in different retinal layers and in the choriocapillaris in eyes with retinal vein occlusions ( RVO). Applying optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCTA) , we examined patients with unilateral RVOs and normal individuals of a control group. The study group included 48 patients with unilateral RVO and the control group 17 normal individuals. Eyes affected by RVO as compared to the contralateral unaffected eyes ( all P < 0.001) , and the contralateral unaffected eyes as compared to the eyes of the control group ( P < 0.05) , showed a lower vessel density in the superficial and deep retinal layers in all regions except for the foveal region. Choriocapillaris density was lower ( P < 0.001) , foveal retinal thickness and subfoveal choroidal thickness ( P < 0.001) were thicker , and the foveal avascular zone was larger ( P = 0.003) in the RVO eyes than in the contralateral eyes. For 29 eyes undergoing OCTA and fluorescein angiography , two examiners independently rated the retinas to be ischemic in fluorescein angiography in 14 eyes and in OCTA in 9 of these 14 eyes. Upon OCTA , unaffected eyes of patients with unilateral RVOs showed vascular abnormalities in the superficial and deep retinal layers when compared to those of healthy individuals.
