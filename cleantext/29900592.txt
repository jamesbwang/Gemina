  To synthesise the existing published literature on general practitioners ( GP) 's knowledge , attitudes , and experiences of managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia ( BPSD) with a view to informing future interventions. We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies that explored GPs ' experiences of managing BPSD ( PROSPERO protocol registration CRD42017054916). Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2017. Each stage of the review process involved at least 2 authors working independently. The meta-ethnographic approach was used to synthesise the findings of the included studies while preserving the context of the primary data. The Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research ( CERQual) was used to assess the confidence in our individual review findings. Of the 1638 articles identified , 76 full texts were reviewed and 11 were included. Three main concepts specific to GPs ' experiences of managing BPSD emerged: unmet primary care resource needs , justification of antipsychotic prescribing , and the pivotal role of families. A `` line of argument '' was drawn , which described how in the context of resource limitations a therapeutic void was created. This resulted in GPs being over reliant on antipsychotics and family caregivers. These factors appeared to culminate in a reactive response to BPSD whereby behaviours and symptoms could escalate until a crisis point was reached. This systematic review offers new insights into GPs ' perspectives on the management of BPSD and will help to inform the design and development of interventions to support GPs managing BPSD.
