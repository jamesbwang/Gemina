  Surgery in the neonatal period presents challenges , especially in preterm infants weighing < 1 kg. Their small size , minimal reserves and physiological immaturity means attention to detail and careful monitoring is critical to avoid cardiovascular instability; maintaining fluid balance<symptom> and metabolic stability is also problematic due to often limited vascular access and small blood volumes. Developments in technology have meant that cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and oxygen saturations are all routinely and continuously monitored before and during surgery.We have been exploring the role of continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) for metabolic monitoring and management of glucose control in very preterm infants ( 24-32 weeks gestation). In this paper , we report on a preterm infant who uniquely underwent surgery while wearing a continuous glucose monitor , blinded to the clinical team. This case highlights the metabolic vulnerability of these babies and a possible role for real-time CGM during surgical procedures.
