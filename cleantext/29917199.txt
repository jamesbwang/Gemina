  The aim of the present study was to compare socio-emotional patterns , temperamental traits , and coping strategies , between a group of Internet addiction ( IA) patients and a control group. Twenty-five IA patients and twenty-six healthy matched subjects were tested on IA , temperament , coping strategies , alexithymia and attachment dimensions. Participants reported their prevalent Internet use ( online pornography , social networks , online games). The IA patients using Internet for gaming online showed a greater attitude to novelty seeking and a lower tendency to use socio-emotional support and self-distraction compared to patients using Internet for social networking. Moreover , they showed a lower level of acceptance than patients using Internet for pornography. In the control group , the participants using Internet for online gaming showed higher levels of IA , emotional impairments and social alienation compared to social-networks and pornography users. Findings showed a higher psychological impairment in gaming online users compared to social networking and online pornography users.
