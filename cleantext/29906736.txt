  Two of the main goals of forensic science are ( 1) to estimate the time since death , or post mortem interval ( PMI) and ( 2) to find the site where a dead body was buried. Soil testate amoebae and diatoms may be useful indicators for these goals. However , the structure and patchiness of the habitat appears to be a main driver for the amoeba and diatom soil communities ( e.g. , individual density). In case the soil substrate is very dry and nutrient-poor ( as in our study) , the influence of a dead body on the soil microfaunal community may be superimposed by natural environmental heterogeneity , especially soil moisture content. Further studies are necessary to clarify if protist abundance data are helpful for forensic investigations.
