  lectomies were performed in the Department of General and Endocrine Surgery of the MUW. Hypercortisolemia was found in 50 ( 14 %) patients , while overt hypercortisolemia in 31 patients. In the hypercortisolemia group , ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia was diagnosed in 5 ( 10 %) and ACTH-independent hypercortisolemia in 25 patients ( 50 %). 1 patient with overt hypercortisolemia had cancer of the adrenal cortex. Remaining 19 ( 38 %) patients had subclinical Cushing 's syndrome<disease>. For our study , we compared patients with ACTH-independent hypercortisolemia ( n = 25) with those with Cushing 's syndrome<disease> ( n = 19). Patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia ( n = 5) and the patient with cancer of the adrenal cortex ( n = 1) were excluded. Patients from both groups ( n = 44) underwent a unilateral transperitoneal adrenalectomy. Good early outcomes were observed in 42 patients ( 93.3 %). In 1 patient , an additional laparoscopic surgery was necessary on postoperative day 0 due to bleeding. In another patient , on day 22 post-surgery , we found an abscess<disease> in the site of the excised adrenal gland , which was drained under laparoscopic guidance. In 3 patients ( 6.8 %) with substantial obesity , a temporary respiratory insufficiency of varying degrees occurred. We did not observe any thromboembolic complications. All patients with overt hypercortisolemia and 9 patients with subclinical hypercortisolemia had secondary adrenal insufficiency postoperatively. Transperitoneal unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy is an efficient and safe treatment option in patients with ACTH-independent hypercortisolemia , both overt and subclinical.
