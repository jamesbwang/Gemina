  MicroRNA-206 ( miR-206) has demonstrated tumor suppressive effects in a variety of cancers. Numerous studies have identified aberrantly expressed targets of miR-206 that contribute to tumor progression and metastasis , however , the broader gene-networks and pathways regulated by miR-206 remain poorly defined. Here , we have ectopically expressed miR-206 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumors to identify differentially expressed genes , and study the effects on tumor growth and metastasis. In H1299 tumor xenograft assays , stable expression of miR-206 suppressed both tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Profiling of xenograft tumors using small RNA sequencing and a targeted panel of tumor progression and metastasis-related genes revealed a network of genes involved in TGF-β signalling that were regulated by miR-206. Among these were the TGFB1 ligand , as well as direct transcriptional targets of Smad3. Other differentially expressed genes included components of the extracellular matrix involved in TGF-β activation and signalling , including Thrombospondin-1 , which is responsible for the activation of latent TGF-β in the stroma. In cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with recombinant TGF-β , ectopic expression of miR-206 impaired canonical signalling , and expression of TGF-β target genes linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This was due at least in part to the suppression of Smad3 protein levels in lung adenocarcinoma cells with ectopic miR-206 expression. Together , these findings indicate that miR-206 can suppress tumor progression and metastasis by limiting autocrine production of TGF-β , and highlight the potential utility of TGF-β inhibitors for the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas.
