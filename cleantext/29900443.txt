  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is associated with the aggregation of amyloid-β ( Aβ) peptides into toxic fibrillar aggregates. Finding effective inhibitors of Aβ aggregation is a crucial step for the development of drugs against AD. Recent experiments reported that dihydrochalcone ( Dih) , a compound extracted from the daemonorops draco tree , could effectively inhibit Aβ fibrillization and reduce Aβ cytotoxicity. However , the influence of Dih molecules on preformed Aβ fibrils and the atomic-level details of interactions between Dih and Aβ fibrils are largely unknown. In this work , we performed multiple molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations for 1.2 μs in total on the Aβ17-42 protofibrils with and without Dih molecules. We found that Dih molecules mostly bind to three different sites of the protofibril: the exterior central hydrophobic core ( CHC) spanning residues 17LVFFA21 in the β1 region , the protofibril cavity and the C-terminal hydrophobic-groove spanning residues 31IIGLM35 in the β2 region. Binding to the C-terminal hydrophobic-groove slightly affects the structures of Aβ17-42 protofibrils , while binding to the exterior CHC and the cavity strongly destabilizes the protofibrils by mostly disrupting the D23-K28 salt bridges and the inter-peptide β-sheet in the β1 region. The dynamic process of Dih molecules entering the cavity of Aβ17-42 protofibrils is also investigated. We also examined the effect of Dih molecules on both U-shaped Aβ40/Aβ42 protofibrils and S-shaped Aβ42 protofibrils by carrying out multiple MD simulations. Our simulations show that Dih molecules can destabilize both U-shaped and S-shaped Aβ protofibrils by binding to the protofibril cavity. This study reveals the mechanism by which Dih molecules disrupt Aβ protofibrils , which may offer new clues for the development of drug candidates for the treatment of AD.
