  Overweight and obesity rates stabilized or declined in the largest ethnic groups in the Netherlands , while reports on thinness are conflicting. Ethnic inequalities in time trends are unknown. The aim of this study was to examine ( differences in) trends in overweight ( including obesity) , obesity , severe obesity and thinness in children of Dutch , Turkish , Moroccan and South Asian descent. A retrospective cross-sectional study based on 135 150 height and weight measurements , taken between 2007 and 2015 in 77 058 children , aged 2-15 years , living in the city of The Hague ( the Netherlands). Trends were determined with logistic regression. An interaction term was added to the model to test for effects of ethnicity on time trends. In Dutch children , overweight , obesity and severe obesity rates declined between 2007 and 2015 , while overweight remained stable in Turkish , Moroccan and South Asian children. Turkish children showed a decrease in obesity ( OR 0.981; 95 % confidence interval 0.965-0.998) , and Moroccan children in severe obesity ( OR 0.918; 95 % CI 0.877-0.962). South Asian children had the highest overweight and obesity rates of all ethnic groups ( 32.7 and 21.5 % in 2015 , respectively). Thinness rates were generally low and only decreased in South Asian children ( 0.940; 95 % CI 0.886-0.997). Ethnic inequalities in overweight and obesity rates widened since 2007 , despite a decline in overweight and/or obesity in most ethnic groups. Ethnic specific interventions are highly needed , especially for South Asian children.
