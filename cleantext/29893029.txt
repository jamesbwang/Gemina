  This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of nebulized hypertonic saline ( HS) on the rate of hospitalization in infants with acute bronchiolitis<disease> in the Emergency Department ( ED) setting. We searched PubMed , Virtual Health Library-BVS and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception until January 31 , 2018. We selected randomized trials that compared nebulized HS with normal saline ( NS) or standard care in children up to 24 months of age with acute bronchiolitis<disease> in the ED setting. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the risk ratio ( RR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI). A total of 293 records were screened and 8 trials involving 1708 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed a 16 % reduction in the risk of hospitalization among patients treated with HS compared to NS ( risk ratio ( RR): 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.71-0.98 , P = 0.03). A significant effect of HS in reducing the risk of hospitalization was found only in the subgroup analyses of trials in which HS was mixed with bronchodilators , multiple doses ( â‰¥ 3) were given , and risk of bias was low. Nebulized hypertonic saline may potentially reduce the risk of hospitalization in infants with acute bronchiolitis<disease> in the ED setting. Quality of evidence is moderate due to substantial clinical heterogeneity between studies and large multicenter trials are still warranted.
