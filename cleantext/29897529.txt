  The aim of this study was to assess the impact of frailty on the outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) and whether it may improve the predictive ability of European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ( EuroSCORE II). The Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS) was assessed preoperatively in patients undergoing isolated CABG from the multicentre E-CABG registry , and patients were stratified into 3 classes: scores 1-2 , scores 3-4 and scores 5-7. Of the 6156 patients enrolled , 39.2 % had CFS scores 1-2 , 57.6 % scores 3-4 , and 3.2 % scores 5-7. Logistic regression adjusted for multiple covariates showed that the CFS was an independent predictor of hospital/30-day mortality ( CFS scores 3-4 , odds ratio ( OR) 3.95 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.19-7.14; CFS scores 5-7 , OR 5.90 , 95 % CI 2.67-13.05) and resulted in an Integrated Improvement Index of 1.3 ( P < 0.001) and a Net Reclassification Index of 55.6 ( P < 0.001) for prediction of hospital/30-day mortality. Adding the CFS classes to EuroSCORE II resulted in an Integrated Improvement Index of 0.9 ( P < 0.001) and Net Reclassification Index of 59.6 ( P < 0.001) for prediction of hospital/30-day mortality with a significantly larger area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( 0.809 vs 0.781 , P = 0.028). The CFS was an independent predictor of mid-term mortality ( CFS scores 3-4 , hazard ratio ( HR) 2.05 , 95 % CI 1.43-2.85; CFS scores 5-7 , HR 3.05 , 95 % CI 1.83-5.06). The CFS predicted early- and mid-term mortality in patients undergoing isolated CABG. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether frailty may improve the estimation of the operative risk of patients undergoing adult cardiac surgery. NCT02319083.
