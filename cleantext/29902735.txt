  We defined gender-specific profiles of mental ill-health for the main occupational groups using three outcomes; antidepressant use , sickness absence ( SA) due to depression<symptom> , and suicides. We also examined which occupational groups had the highest risk of the outcomes , and compared the importance of their predictors. From a random register cohort of Finnish working age population , individuals in the six largest occupational groups in 2004 for men and women were included ( N = 414 357). We used register data to define the first antidepressant purchase ( i.e. use) , the first long-term SA spell for depression<symptom> , and suicide between Jan 1st 2005 and Dec 31st 2014. We assessed the risk of each outcome by occupational group with logistic regression models , and used dominance analysis to compare the relative importance of predictors. In all six occupational groups for women , the prevalence of antidepressant use and SA for depression<symptom> was higher than in the men 's occupational groups. The opposite was observed for suicides. The risk of antidepressant use was lower , but the risk of suicide was 2-times higher among men in low vs. high-skilled occupations. Among women , a lower skill-level was associated with a higher risk of SA due to depression<symptom> Gender was the most important predictor of all outcomes. We lacked information on history of medication use or health problems prior to follow-up. Gendered occupational status was an underlying factor explaining distinctive mental health profiles in the working population. Occupational class-dependent behavioural patterns related to mental health existed among men.
