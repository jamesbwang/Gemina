  Craniosynostosis ( CS) is a complex condition consisting of the early fusion of one or more cranial sutures in the intrauterine stage. The affected infant exhibits abnormal head shape at time of birth or shortly thereafter. It can be observed in normal individuals ( non-syndromic CS or NSCS) or as a part of a multisystem syndrome<disease>. The purposes of the present article were to carry out a scoping review on Non-Syndromic CS and to discuss the most important findings retrieved. The steps of this scoping review were as follows: first , to pose a research question; second , to identify relevant studies to answer the research question; third , to select and retrieve the studies; fourth , to chart the critical data , and finally , to collate , summarize , and report the results from the most important articles. Relevant articles published over a 20-year period were identified and retrieved from five Internet databases: PubMed; EMBASE; Cochrane Library; Google Scholar , and EBSCO. Fourteen articles were finally included in the present scoping review. The following four most important clinical issues are discussed: ( i) normal cranial development , clinical manifestations , and pathogenesis of NCSC; ( ii) clinical evaluation of NCSC; ( iii) treatment and post-surgical follow-up; and ( iv) additional considerations. NSCS may be present with associated head shapes. Multiple early surgical reconstructive options are currently available for the disorder. Pediatric Dentistry practitioners must be familiarized with this condition and form part of a multi-approach health team as those responsible for the opportune oral health care of the affected child.
