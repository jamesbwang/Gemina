  HIV<pathogen> drug resistance is a major threat to sustained impact of antiretroviral therapy ( ART). We studied epidemiology of drug resistance in the country of Georgia. Study included all adult patients who experienced virologic failure on first line ART and received HIV<pathogen> drug resistance testing between 2005-2016. Stanford HIV<pathogen> Sequence Database was used for interpretation of resistance data. Patient-level data were extracted from the national AIDS health information system. Of 447 patients included 85.5 % harbored Subtype A6 virus , 8.0 %- subtype B , 2.9 %- subtype G , other subtypes were < 1 %. The most frequent first-line regimens were Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Efavirenz ( 28.4 %) , Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Efavirenz ( 28.4 %) and Abacavir/ Lamivudine/Efavirenz ( 15.9 %). 85.0 % of patients with treatment failure developed at least one drug resistance mutation affecting susceptibility to ART. The most frequent NRTI mutations were M184V ( 65.3 %) , K65R ( 19.7 %) and L74V ( 17.0 %). At least three thymidine analogue mutations were detected in 6.3 %. From NNRTI mutations G190S was shown to be the most prevalent ( 49.4 %) , followed by K101E ( 27.10 %) and K103N ( 24.4 %). G190S and K101E were more common in subtype A as compared to non-A viruses ( G190S- 54.9 % vs. 11.3 % , p < 0.0001; K101E- 29.8 % vs. 11.3 % , p = 0.005). On the other hand , K103N was more frequent in non-A subtypes ( 43.4 %) compared with subtype A ( 22.2 %) , p = 0.0008. Majority of persons failing on ART had HIV<pathogen> drug resistance. Drug resistance patterns may vary by subtype. K65R mutation remains below 20 % , but given the high use of Tenofovir in the country , continuing surveillance of drug resistance is needed.
