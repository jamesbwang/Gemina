  To investigate the role of caspase-1 activation in bilirubin-induced neuronal injury and the protective effect of VX-765 against bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons. Cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to DMSO ( control group) , 50 µmol/L bilirubin , or 50 µmol/L bilirubin 1 h after 50 µmol/L VX-765 treatment. The expressions of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in the neurons were detected by Western blotting , and the relative cell survival and death rates were assessed with a modified MTT assay , lactate dehydrogenase assay and Typan blue staining. Interleukin-18 ( IL-18) concentration in the culture supernatant was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). In cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons , bilirubin exposure for 3 and 6 h caused significant increases in the expressions of NLRP3 and activated caspase-1 compared with those in the control group ( P < 0.05). Pretreatment of the cells with VX-765 obviously suppressed bilirubin-induced activation of caspase-1 ( P < 0.05). The relative survival rate of the neurons was ( 84.02 ∓ 2.31) % in VX-765 intervention group , significantly higher than that in bilirubin group ( P < 0.05) but lower than that in the control group ( P < 0.05); LDH release rate in VX-765 intervention group was ( 10.78 ∓ 1.58) % , significantly lower than that in bilirubin group ( P < 0.05) but higher than that in the control group ( P < 0.05). The cell death rate in VX-765 intervention group was ( 5.58 ∓ 1.23) % , significantly lower than that in bilirubin group ( P < 0.05) but higher than that in the control group ( P < 0.05). In cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons , caspase-1 activation plays a role in bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity , and VX-765 treatment provides protection against bilirubin-induced neuronal injury by inhibiting caspase-1 activation.
