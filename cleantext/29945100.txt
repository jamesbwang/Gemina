  By combining the structural features of dihydropyrimidinone and 1,2,3-triazole heterocycles , novel hybrid compounds were synthesized using a simple and convenient method. A series of novel mono and bis 1,2,3-triazole was synthesized via copper-catalyzed Huisgen azide-alkyne cycloadditions ( CuAAC) under microwave irradiation. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activity against varicella-zoster virus ( VZV). Compounds 6aa , 7ab , 6ba and 6da showed valuable antiviral activities , with EC
