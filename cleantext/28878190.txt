  In order to achieve cermet-based solar absorber coatings with long-term thermal stability at high temperatures , a novel single-layer , multi-scale TiC-Ni/Mo cermet coating was first prepared using laser cladding technology in atmosphere. The results show that the optical properties of the cermet coatings using laser cladding were much better than the preplaced coating. In addition , the thermal stability of the optical properties for the laser cladding coating were excellent after annealing at 650 & deg; C for 200 h. The solar absorptance and thermal emittance of multi-scale cermet coating were 85 % and 4.7 % at 650 & deg; C. The results show that multi-scale cermet materials are more suitable for solar-selective absorbing coating. In addition , laser cladding is a new technology that can be used for the preparation of spectrally-selective coatings.
