  An abundant and low toxicity iron catalyst has enabled regioselective annulation of alkenes with α-halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives. The reaction proceeds smoothly without any additional ligands , bases , and additives to afford a variety of γ-lactones in good yields. A proposed reaction pathway through radical annulation is supported by some mechanistic studies , involving radical clock and isotope labeling experiments. The present method was applied to the practical iron-powder-promoted synthesis of γ-lactones.
