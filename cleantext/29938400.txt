  Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC) from colorectal origin may undergo cytoreductive surgery ( CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC) as a curative approach. One major prognostic factor that affects survival is completeness of cytoreduction. Molecular Fluorescence Guided Surgery ( MFGS) is a novel intraoperative imaging technique that may improve tumor identification in the future , potentially preventing over- and under-treatment in these patients. This narrative review outlines a chronological overview of MFGS development in patients with PC of colorectal origin.
