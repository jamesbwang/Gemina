  Hypertension has become a global health challenge given its high prevalence and but low awareness and detection. Whether the actual prevalence of hypertension has been estimated is important , especially for the poor. This study aimed to measure tested prevalence and self-reported prevalence of hypertension and compare the inequity between them in China. Data were derived from China Health and Nutrition Survey ( CHNS) conducted in 2011. By using the multistage , stratified , random sampling method , 12,168 respondents aged 18 or older were identified for analysis. Both tested prevalence ( systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 140 mmHg or/and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 90 mmHg or/ and current use any of antihypertensive medication) and self-reported prevalence ( ever diagnosed with hypertension by a doctor) were used to measure the prevalence of hypertension. The concentration index was employed to measure the extent of inequality in tested prevalence and self-reported prevalence. A decomposition method , based on a Probit model , was used to analyze income-related horizontal inequity of tested prevalence and self-reported prevalence. The tested prevalence and self-reported prevalence of total respondents were 28.8 % ( 95 % CI ( 28.0 % , 29.6 %)) and 15.7 % ( 95 % CI ( 15.0 % , 16.3 %)) , and 26.4 % ( 95 % CI ( 25.1 % , 27.6 %)) and 19.0 % ( 95 % CI ( 17.9 % , 20.1 %)) in urban areas , and 30.3 % ( 95 % CI ( 29.3 % , 31.4 %)) and 13.5 % ( 95 % CI ( 12.7 % , 14.3 %)) in rural areas. The horizontal inequity indexes of mean tested prevalence and self-reported prevalence were- 0.0494 and 0.1203 of total respondents ,- 0.0736 and 0.0748 in urban area , and- 0.0177 and 0.0466 in rural area respectively , indicating pro-poor inequity in tested prevalence and pro-rich inequity in self-reported prevalence of hypertension. Economic status , education attainment and age were key factors of the pro-poor inequity in tested prevalence. Economic status , area and age were key factors to explain the poor-rich inequity in self-reported prevalence. This study revealed self-reported prevalence of hypertension was much lower than tested prevalence in China , while a larger gap between self-reported and tested prevalence was found in rural areas. Our study suggested social strategies aiming at narrowing economic gap and regional disparities , reducing educational inequity , and facilitating health conditions of the elderly should be implemented. Finally , awareness raising campaigns to test hypertension in rural area need be strengthened by health education programs and improving the access to public health service , especially for those who do not engage with regular health checkups.
