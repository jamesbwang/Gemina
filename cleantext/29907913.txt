  Sickle cell disease ( SCD) is a multisystem disease , and the predominant articular manifestation is osteonecrosis ( ON). Total hip arthroplasty ( THA) is technically challenging , and the complication rates are high. In this retrospective study , we have analysed the outcome of THA in a cohort of patients with SCD at our institution. We identified 34 THAs between 1999 and 2016 in 30 patients ( mean age 37 years) from our SCD database. Co-morbidities , both sickle and non-sickle-related , were documented. Complications and indications for revision surgery were analysed. An uncemented prosthesis was predominantly used. The mean follow-up was 10.5 years ( range 1-18). Six patients had revision surgery ( 17.6 %) , 2 ( 5.8 %) for Prosthetic Joint Infection ( PJI) , and 4 ( 11.7 %) for osteolysis of the acetabular component. Our revision rates were comparable to the published literature. Our combined sickle cell clinic and the coordinated multidisciplinary management have been successful in reducing morbidity.
