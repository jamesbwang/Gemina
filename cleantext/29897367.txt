  Two thulium-based ParaCEST responsive contrast agents , Tm-DOTAm-py and Tm-DOTAm-βAla-py , have been synthesized and evaluated for imaging copper and zinc. Unusual for responsive MRI contrast agents , both agents display a complete on/off response in the presence of transition metals. Both complexes function as paraCEST agents in the absence of copper and zinc , with the positively charged Tm-DOTAm-py being more sensitive than the neutrally charged Tm-DOTAm-βAla-py. In each case , the CEST signal arises from amide protons rather than from a water molecule coordinated to Tm3 + ions. Upon binding to Cu + , Cu2 + , or Zn2 + , the exchange rate of the amide protons increases substantially , resulting in a complete loss of the CEST signal. This efficient mode of action along with the lack of inner-sphere water molecules both in the presence and absence of transition metals was confirmed by 1/T1 NMRD profiles , 17O NMR measurements , and molecular modelling simulations. Neither complex is selective for copper over zinc. Both form either a 1: 1 TmL: Cu + or a 2: 1 TmL: Cu2 + and TmL: Zn2 + complexes with binding affinities comparable to that of other responsive MRI contrast agents and sensitivity comparable to that of other CEST contrast agents.
