  Skin pigmentation involves multiple processes , including melanin synthesis , transport , and melanosome release. Melanin content determines skin<symptom> color and protects against UV radiation-induced damage. Autophagy is a cooperative process between autophagosomes and lysosomes that degrades cellular components and organelles. In the present study , B16F1 cells were treated with Rhizoma Arisaematis extract ( RA) and assessed for pigmentation and autophagy regulation. RA treatment suppressed the α-MSH-stimulated increase of melanogenesis and down-regulated the expression of tyrosinase and TRP1 proteins in B16F1 cells. In addition , autophagy was activated in RA-treated cells. Inhibition of autophagy reduced the anti-melanogenic activity of RA in α-MSH-treated B16F1 cells. We identified schaftoside as an effector molecule by LC-MS analysis of RA. Consistently , treatment of schaftoside showed anti-melanogenic effect and induced autophagy activation in B16F1 cells. Inhibition of autophagy by 3 MA treatment reduced the anti-melanogenic effect of the schaftoside and recovered expression level of melanogenesis regulators in α-MSH-treated B16F1 cells. Taken together , our results suggest that schaftoside from RA inhibits skin pigmentation through modulation of autophagy.
