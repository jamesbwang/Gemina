  Stem cells must preserve their function in order to sustain organ and tissue formation , homeostasis and repair. Adult stem cells , particularly those resident in tissues with little turnover , remain quiescent for most of their life , activating only in response to regenerative demands. Among the best studied long-lived quiescent stem cells are skeletal muscle stem cells , which are fully equipped to sustain repair in response to tissue trauma. Recent evidence indicates that the preservation of muscle stem-cell quiescence and regenerative capacity depends on intracellular networks linking metabolism and protein homeostasis. Here , we review recent research into how these networks control stem cell function and how their dysregulation contributes to aging , with a particular focus on senescence entry in extreme old age. We also discuss the implications of these new findings for anti-aging research in muscle stem-cell-based regenerative medicine.
