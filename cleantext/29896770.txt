  Stem cell-based therapies are considered a promising treatment modality for many medical conditions. Several types of stem cells with variable differentiation potentials have been isolated from dental tissues , among them stem cells from apical papilla ( SCAP). In parallel , new classes of biocompatible nanomaterials have also been developed , including graphene and carbon nanotube-based materials. The aim of the study was to assess whether graphene dispersion ( GD) and water-soluble single walled carbon nanotubes ( ws-SWCNT) , may enhance SCAPs capacity to undergo neural differentiation. SCAPs cultivated in neuroinductive medium supplemented with GD and ws-SWCNT , separately and in combination , were subjected to neural marker analysis by real-time PCR ( NF-M , ngn-2 , β III-tubulin , MAP2) and immunocytochemistry ( NeuN and β III-tubulin). GD , ws-SWCNT , and their combination , had neuro-stimulatory effects on SCAPs , as judged by the production of neural markers. Compared to cells grown in nanomaterial free medium , cells with GD showed higher production of B3T , cells with ws-SWCNT had higher production of ngn-2 and NF-M , while the combination of nanomaterials gave similar levels of both B3T and NF-M as the neuroinductive medium alone , but with the finest neuron-like morphology. In conclusion , GD and ws-SWCNT seem to enhance neural differentiation of stem cells from apical papilla. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
