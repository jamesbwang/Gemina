  A nickel-mediated tandem double cyclization of ethynylene-linked dibromodiporphyrins afforded highly reactive etheno-fused diporphyrins , which undergo a thermal ( 2 +2) cycloaddition at the fused C-C double bond to afford the cyclobutane moiety in X-shaped cyclobutane-linked tetraporphyrins. During the reaction of a Zn ( II) complex precursor , the initial double cyclization product was converted into the diketodiporphyrin , which exhibits red chemiluminescence under ambient conditions.
