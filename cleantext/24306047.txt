  Combined fractures of the talar body and the adjacent bones are rare. We present a case of a 35-year-old male with a complex foot and ankle trauma resulting in an unusual combined ipsilateral fracture of the anterolateral tibial plafond , talar body , and sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus. To the best of our knowledge , this particular combination of fractures has not yet been reported in the literature. The combination of talar body fracture with fractures of the adjacent bones was treated by a bilateral open reduction with anatomic reconstruction of the joint surfaces resulting in an excellent clinical outcome at 4-year followup.
