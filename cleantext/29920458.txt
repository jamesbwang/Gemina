  This study visually tracked the micro-spatial water distribution in bio-flocs of waste activated sludge through in situ synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography. Primarily , the two fractions of bound water , the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net-like structure of bio-flocs , were proposed based on the cross-section imaging results. Furthermore , the determinants on bound water occurrences were explored in terms of viscoelastic acoustic responses of extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS). The joint roles of hydrophilic substance removal , EPS aggregation compaction and colloidal instability of sludge flocs in bound water reduction were confirmed by the strong correlations ( Pearson correlation coefficient , R
