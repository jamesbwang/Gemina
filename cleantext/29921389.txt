  To study the curative effects and safety for patients who adopt both gefitinib and platinum-based chemotherapy or only platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma , 80 EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma patients in stage IIIB/IV were divided into two groups. Half of them received both gefitinib and standard chemotherapy ( group A) , and the others ( group B) received only standard chemotherapy. Overall response rate ( ORR) , disease control rate ( DCR) , progression-free survival ( PFS) , overall survival ( OS) and the related toxicities of both groups were recorded in order to take certain nursing measures for a variety of toxicities. Next , statistical methods were used to analyze the curative effects and safety of the two treatments. The results showed that ORR , DCR and median progression-free ( mPFS) survival of the two groups of patients showed no statistical difference ( P > 0.05). However , group A ( 18.56 months) had a longer median overall survival ( mOS) than group B ( 14.87 months) , which was of statistical significance ( P less than 0.05). Nausea<symptom> and loss of appetite<symptom> were common mild adverse reactions , and anemia<symptom> and leukocytopenia were moderate common adverse reactions. The difference between these two groups of patients regarding adverse reactions was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05). In conclusion , the two treatments have similar safety , but lung adenocarcinoma patients with drug resistance during stage IIIB/IV after using first-line gefitinib therapy have lower survival benefits than patients who take both gefitinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.
