  A widely used method for prediction of complex traits in animal and plant breeding is `` genomic best linear unbiased prediction '' ( GBLUP). In a quantitative genetics setting , BLUP is a linear regression of phenotypes on a pedigree or on a genomic relationship matrix , depending on the type of input information available. Normality of the distributions of random effects and of model residuals is not required for BLUP but a Gaussian assumption is made implicitly. A potential downside is that Gaussian linear regressions are sensitive to outliers , genetic or environmental in origin. We present simple ( relative to a fully Bayesian analysis) to implement robust alternatives to BLUP using a linear model with residual
