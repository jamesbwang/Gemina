  During the pulsed-electron beam direct grafting of neat styrene onto poly ( tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) ( FEP) substrate , the radiolytically-produced styryl and carbon-centered FEP radicals undergo various desired and undesired competing reactions. In this study , a high-dose rate is used to impede the undesired free radical homopolymerization of styrene and ensure uniform covalent grafting through 125-μm FEP films. This outweighs the enhancement of the undesired crosslinking reactions of carbon-centered FEP radicals and the dimerization of the styryl radicals. The degree of uniform grafting through 125-μm FEP films increases from ≈ 8 % , immediately after pulsed electron irradiation to 33 % with the subsequent thermal treatment exceeding the glass transition temperature of FEP of 39 °C. On the contrary , steady-state radiolysis using
