  This study aims to investigate the importance and types of peritumoral draining veins in parasagittal and falcine meningiomas , and administer corresponding protective strategies during surgery according to these different types , in order to improve tumor resection rate and maximize the protection of neurological functions. The clinical information of 156 patients with parasagittal and falcine meningiomas , who were admitted at the Neurosurgery Department of our hospital , was collected and retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent pathological classification , MRI scanning and enhancement , and MRV examinations. Among these patients , 113 patients ( 72.4 %) had Simpson grade I and II resection , while 43 patients ( 27.6 %) had Simpson grade III and IV resection and underwent postoperative adjuvant gamma knife surgery. Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS) evaluation was carried out at one week after surgery. 69 patients ( 44.3 %) improved , 66 patients ( 42.3 %) had no changes , and 21 patients ( 13.4 %) had worsened conditions ( seven patients had hemiplegia , five patients had aphasia<symptom> , four patients had decreased vision , and five patients had ataxia<symptom> There were no deaths. According to the 2016 WHO pathological grading , 131 patients ( 84 %) were grade I , 22 patients ( 14 %) were grade II , and three patients were grade III ( 2 %). Furthermore , 105 patients were followed-up for 1-4 years. There were 11 cases of recurrence. The classification and evaluation of peritumoral draining veins through preoperative-combined MRV can be used as a guide in determining the corresponding protective strategy during surgery. This can significantly improve the tumor resection rate and decrease the postoperative disability rate.
