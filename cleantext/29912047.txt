  Although risk factors for the long-term mortality of liver transplantation are well described , there is a lack of detailed study regarding these factors for adult living donor liver transplantation ( LDLT). We retrospectively analyzed 528 adult LDLT recipients in our hospital. The risk factors were analyzed for overall deaths > 5 years post-LDLT. Over the 20-year follow-up , 137 patients died. Patient survival at 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 years post-LDLT was 87.8 % , 81.8 % , 79.4 % , and 72.8 % , respectively. The independent risk factors for > 5 years post-LDLT overall death were hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 38.9 , P < 0.001) , lymphoid de novo malignancy ( HR = 47.2 , P = 0.001) , primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC) as primary diagnosis ( HR = 11.5 , P < 0.001) , chronic rejection ( HR = 6.93 , P = 0.006) , acute rejection ( HR = 2.96 , P = 0.017) , and bile duct stenosis ( HR = 2.30 , P = 0.045). Not only malignancies and rejection but also bile duct stenosis and PSC had significant impacts on late period post-LDLT mortality.
