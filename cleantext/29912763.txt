  To assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients. Low adenoma detection rate ( ADR) are linked to increased risk of interval cancer and related deaths. Compared with air insufflation ( AI) colonoscopy , the method of water exchange ( WE) significantly decreased insertion pain and increased ADR in unsedated patients. Deep sedation with propofol has been increasingly used in colonoscopy. One report suggested that WE significantly increased ADR in propofol-sedated patients , but the factors associated with adenoma detection were not analyzed. Post hoc multiple logistic regression analyses were performed based on pooled data from 2 randomized controlled trials to assess the factors associated with adenoma detection in propofol-sedated patients. Propofol-sedated patients ( n = 510) were randomized to AI and WE. The baseline characteristics were comparable. Multiple logistic regression analyses show that age , withdrawal time , indications ( screening vs. diagnostic) , and WE were significantly and independently associated with higher ADR. WE had fewer patients with inadequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of < 6. Despite a significantly shorter inspection time , WE had significantly higher overall ADR than AI , especially in those with adequate Boston Bowel Preparation Scale of â‰¥ 6. Right colon ADR ( 17.5 % vs. 10.5 %) , flat ADR ( 32.3 % vs. 19.4 %) , combined advanced and sessile serrated ADR ( 13.1 % vs. 7.4 %) of WE were significantly higher than those of AI. WE enhanced quality of colonoscopy in propofol-sedated patients by significantly improving colon cleanliness and overall ADR. Colonoscopists with patients under propofol sedation might consider evaluating WE method for performance improvement.
