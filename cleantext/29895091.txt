  Intratendinous lesions<symptom> of the rotator cuff of the shoulder are frequent and may be a distinct clinical entity. Nevertheless , there are only a few publications which deal specifically with this subject. This study analyses the existing literature for the arthroscopic reconstruction of the intratendinous lesion<symptom> of the supraspinatus tendon , by means of a systematic review , and identifies relevant research questions for future studies. In January 2017 , a systematic review of the U. S. National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health ( PubMed) Database and the Cochrane Library was conducted using the PRISMA checklist. The search words were `` supraspinatus '' and `` interstitial ''; `` supraspinatus '' , `` tear '' and `` intratendinous ''; `` supraspinatus '' and `` concealed ''. In the course of the review , articles written in English with at least a partial arthroscopic case series dealing with the reconstruction of the supraspinatus tendon were identified and further analysed. Primarily 70 hits could be generated. Five articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed in detail. The number of arthroscopic cases ranged between 6 and 33. Level of evidence was IV in all studies. The diagnosis of an intratendinous lesion<symptom> was made by MR imaging when T2/fat-saturated sequences showed an intratendinous high intensity signal without disruption of the bursal or articular layer. Three different concepts were followed in surgical treatment: opening of the intratendinous lesion<symptom> from the bursal or articular side or by complete resection of the lesion<symptom>. The reconstruction was performed with suture anchors in all cases. In the majority of cases , an acromioplasty was also performed. The reported clinical results were mostly good. Healing of the tendon was shown by MR imaging in 81.5 to 100 % of cases. After failure of conservative treatment , symptomatic intratendinous lesions<symptom> of the supraspinatus tendon can be localised intraoperatively and reconstructed after failure of conservative treatment. The expected results are good in the medium term. The evidence level of the studies analysed was low. Future studies should examine the role of alternative conservative and surgical therapies.
