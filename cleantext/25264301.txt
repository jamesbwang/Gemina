  The ability to produce nanotherapeutics at large-scale with high drug loading efficiency , high drug loading capacity , high stability , and high potency is critical for clinical translation. However , many nanoparticle-based therapeutics under investigation suffer from complicated synthesis , poor reproducibility , low stability , and high cost. In this work , a simple method for preparing multifunctional nanoparticles is utilized that act as both a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging and a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy for the treatment of cancer. In particular , the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX) is used to solubilize small nanoclusters of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( SPIONs) without the use of any additional carrier materials. These nanoclusters are characterized with a high PpIX loading efficiency; a high loading capacity , stable behavior; high potency; and a synthetic approach that is amenable to large-scale production. In vivo studies of photodynamic therapy ( PDT) efficacy show that the PpIX-coated SPION nanoclusters lead to a significant reduction in the growth rate of tumors in a syngeneic murine tumor model compared to both free PpIX and PpIX-loaded poly ( ethylene glycol)- polycaprolactone micelles , even when injected at 1/8th the dose. These results suggest that the nanoclusters developed in this work can be a promising nanotherapeutic for clinical translation.
