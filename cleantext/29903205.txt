  To detect the changes of serum tumor markers of vinyl chloride , and find the influencing factors of tumor markers. Two hundred and twenty-three workers exposed to vinyl chloride from a chlor alkali plant and one hundred and forty-nine workers without occupational exposure to vinyl chloride were recruited into this study. Detected 11 tumor markers in serum of the objective. The contentsof carcino-embryonic antigen ( CEA) , alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) , CA-199 and CA72-4 in exposed group increased with the length of service , while the content of neuron-specific enolase ( NSE) decreased with the length of service , but there was no correlation between contents of tumor markers and the length of service , which had no statistical significance ( P > 0. 05). By univariate analysis , the difference between the exposed group and the control group in the level of thiodiglycolic acid had statistical significance ( Z = -16. 178 , P < 0. 001). By univariate analysis , gender had effect on CEA , AFP and NSE ( Z = -4. 815 , -2. 052 and-4. 535 , P < 0. 05) , smoking had effect on CA-199 ( Z = -2. 016 , P < 0. 05) , vinyl chloride exposure had effect on AFP and NSE ( Z = -3. 763 and-2. 140 , P < 0. 05). By multivariate analysis , CEA and NSE of women were lower than those of men ( t = -3. 696 and-5. 722 , P < 0. 05). That vinyl chloride exposure was a factor in NSE and NSE of the exposed group were higher than the control group ( t = 2. 061 , P < 0. 05). Under the current exposure concentration , exposure to vinyl chloride can change the contents of tumor markers. As the time of exposure to harmful factors increases , the level of tumor markers changes , and the possibility of tumor increases. The level of thiodiglycolic acid may be related to some tumor markers. The influencing factors of different tumor markers are different.
