  With appropriate algorithms , computers can learn to detect patterns and associations in large data sets. The authors ' goal was to apply machine learning to arterial pressure waveforms and create an algorithm to predict hypotension<symptom>. The algorithm detects early alteration in waveforms that can herald the weakening of cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms affecting preload , afterload , and contractility. The algorithm was developed with two different data sources: ( 1) a retrospective cohort , used for training , consisting of 1,334 patients ' records with 545,959 min of arterial waveform recording and 25,461 episodes of hypotension<symptom>; and ( 2) a prospective , local hospital cohort used for external validation , consisting of 204 patients ' records with 33,236 min of arterial waveform recording and 1,923 episodes of hypotension<symptom>. The algorithm relates a large set of features calculated from the high-fidelity arterial pressure waveform to the prediction of an upcoming hypotensive event ( mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the algorithm 's success in predicting hypotension<symptom> , defined as mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. Using 3,022 individual features per cardiac cycle , the algorithm predicted arterial hypotension<symptom> with a sensitivity and specificity of 88 % ( 85 to 90 %) and 87 % ( 85 to 90 %) 15 min before a hypotensive event ( area under the curve , 0.95 ( 0.94 to 0.95)); 89 % ( 87 to 91 %) and 90 % ( 87 to 92 %) 10 min before ( area under the curve , 0.95 ( 0.95 to 0.96)); 92 % ( 90 to 94 %) and 92 % ( 90 to 94 %) 5 min before ( area under the curve , 0.97 ( 0.97 to 0.98)). The results demonstrate that a machine-learning algorithm can be trained , with large data sets of high-fidelity arterial waveforms , to predict hypotension<symptom> in surgical patients ' records.
