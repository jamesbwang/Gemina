  We describe our molecular design of aortic-selective acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol O-acyltransferase ( ACAT , also abbreviated as SOAT) inhibitors , their structure-activity relationships ( SARs<pathogen>) and their pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacological profiles. The connection of two weak ligands-N- ( 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) acetamide ( 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC
