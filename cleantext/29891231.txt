  In recent years there has been a growing trend towards nursing care at home in general as well as towards intensive home care being provided by specialized home care services in Germany. However , resulting challenges for patient safety have rarely been considered. Against this background we aimed to explore whether international recommendations for patient safety in home care in general and in intensive home care in particular already exist and how they can stimulate further practice development in Germany. A review of online English documents containing recommendations for patient safety in intensive home care was conducted. Available documents were analyzed and compared in terms of their form and content. Overall , a small number of relevant documents could be identified. None of these documents exclusively refer to the intensive home care sector. Despite their differences , however , the analysis of four selected documents showed similarities , e. g. , regarding specific topics of patient safety ( communication , involvement of patients and their relatives , risk assessment , medication management , qualification). Furthermore , strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of the documents became apparent: e. g. , an explicit understanding of patient safety , a literature-based introduction to safety topics or an adaptation of the recommendations to the specific features of home care were occasionally lacking. This document analysis provides interesting input to the formal and content-related development of specific recommendations and to practice development in Germany to improve patient safety in home care.
