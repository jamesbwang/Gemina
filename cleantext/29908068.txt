  Endometrial polyps ( EPs) are outgrowths in the endometrium with unknown etiology. The fact that EPs can often recur after surgical removal suggests that EPs are not induced by random events but by continuous or recurrent processes in patients. We previously demonstrated that the risk of EP development was positively associated with overactive Th17 responses. However , the requirements of Th17 upregulation are yet unclear. Here , we recruited 26 women with symptomatic EP and 24 without EP , and peripheral mononuclear cells were harvested for the examination of circulating immunity. Compared to controls without EP , the patients with symptomatic EP presented significantly elevated levels of monocyte activation. The circulating monocytes from patients secreted higher levels of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) , interleukin ( IL) -1 Î² , IL-6 and IL-23 directly ex vivo and with LPS stimulation.
