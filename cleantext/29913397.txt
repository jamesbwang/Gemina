  Polluted waters with a high residue of tetracycline also have a high concentration of nitrate. Thus , screening for both , highly efficient tetracycline biodegradation and nitrate transformation , is a key technical strategy. In this study , a novel tetracycline degrading strain , SQY5 , which was identified as Klebsiella<pathogen> sp. , was isolated from municipal sludge. Biodegradation characteristics of tetracycline were studied under various environmental conditions; including inoculation dose ( v/v) , initial tetracycline concentration , temperature , and pH. Response surface methodology ( RSM) analysis demonstrated that the maximum degradation ratio of tetracycline can be obtained under the condition with an initial tetracycline concentration of 61.27 mg L
