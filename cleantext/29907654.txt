  NADPH Oxidase 5 ( Nox5) is a calcium-sensitive superoxide-generating Nox. It is present in lower forms and higher mammals , but not in rodents. Nox5 is expressed in vascular cells , but the functional significance remains elusive. Given that contraction is controlled by calcium and reactive oxygen species , both associated with Nox5 , we questioned the role of Nox5 in pro-contractile signaling and vascular function. Transgenic mice expressing human Nox5 in a vascular smooth muscle cell-specific manner ( Nox5 mice) and Nox5 is a pro-contractile Nox isoform important in redox-sensitive contraction. This involves calcium-calmodulin and endoplasmic reticulum-regulated mechanisms. Our findings define a novel function for vascular Nox5 , linking calcium and reactive oxygen species to the pro-contractile molecular machinery in vascular smooth muscle cells.
