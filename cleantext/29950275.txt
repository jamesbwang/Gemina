  In cases of severe accidental hypothermia<symptom> ( AH) in urban areas , the prognostic factors are unknown. We identified factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe AH in urban areas of Japan. The J-Point registry database is a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study for AH in 12 Japanese emergency departments. From this registry , we enrolled patients whose core body temperature was 32 °C or less on admission. In-hospital death was the primary outcome of this study. We investigated the association between each candidate prognostic factor and in-hospital death by applying the multivariate logistic regression analyses with adjusted odds ratios ( AORs) and their 95 % confidence interval ( CI) as the effect variables. Of 572 patients registered in the J-point registry , 358 hypothermic patients were eligible for analyses. Median body temperature was 29.2 °C ( interquartile range , 27.0 °C -30.8 °C). In-hospital deaths comprised 26.3 % ( 94/358) of all study patients. Factors associated with in-hospital death were age ≥ 75 years ( AOR , 3.09; 95 % CI , 1.31-7.27) , need for assistance with activities of daily living ( ADL; AOR , 3.06; 95 % CI , 1.68-5.59) , hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> ( AOR , 2.49; 95 % CI , 1.32-4.68) , and hyperkalemia ( ≥ 5.6 mEq/L; AOR , 2.65; 95 % CI , 1.13-6.21). The independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality of patients with moderate-to-severe AH in urban areas of Japan were age ≥ 75 years , need for assistance with ADL , hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> , and hyperkalemia.
