  In SPRINT ( Systolic Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Intervention Trial) , use of the Omron 907XL blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) monitor set at 5 minutes of antecedent rest to record BP produced an automated office BP value 7/6 mm Hg lower than awake ambulatory BP at 27 months. The authors studied the impact on automated office BP of setting the Omron 907XL to 0 minutes instead of 5 minutes of rest in patients with readings in the lower normal BP range , similar to on-treatment BP in the SPRINT intensive therapy group. Patients ( n = 100) in cardiac rehabilitation were randomized to three BP readings at 1-minute intervals using an Omron 907XL BP device set for 5 or 0 minutes of antecedent rest. Mean ( ± standard deviation) automated office BP ( mm Hg) after 5 minutes of rest ( 120.2 ± 14.6/ 66.9 ± 8.6 mm Hg) was lower ( P < .001/ P < .01) than without rest ( 124.2 ± 16.4/ 67.9 ± 9.1 mm Hg). When target BP is in the lower normal range , automated office BP recorded without antecedent rest using an Omron 907XL device should be higher and closer to the awake ambulatory BP , compared with readings taken after 5 minutes of rest.
