  Biotin-conjugated multistimuli-responsive polysaccharide vesicular nanocarriers are designed and developed , for the first time , to accomplish receptor-mediated endocytosis in cancer cells and to deliver anticancer drugs to intracellular compartments. For this purpose , a new renewable hydrophobic unit was custom designed with redox-degradable disulfide and enzyme-biodegradable aliphatic ester chemical linkages , and it was conjugated along with biotin on the dextran backbone. The dextran derivative self-assembled into nanovesicles of < 200 nm in size , which were characterized by dynamic and static light scattering , electron , and atomic force microscopes. Avidin-HABA assay established the high affinity of biotin-tagged dextran vesicles toward membrane-receptors up to 25 nM concentration. Doxorubicin-hydrochloride ( DOX.HCl)- loaded dextran vesicles exhibited stable formulation in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS) and fetal bovine serum ( FBS). Redox-degradation by glutathione ( GSH) showed 60 % drug release , whereas lysosomal esterase enzyme enabled > 98 % drug release in 12 h. Confocal microscope and flow cytometry-assisted time-dependent cellular uptake studies revealed that the biotin-receptors overexpressed in cervical cancer cells ( HeLa) exhibited larger drug accumulation through the receptor-assisted endocytosis process. This process enabled the delivery of higher amount of DOX and significantly enhanced the killing in cancer cells ( HeLa) compared to wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells ( WT-MEF , normal cells). Control experiments such as biotin pretreatment in cancer cells and energy-suppressed cellular uptake at 4 Â°C further supported the occurrence of receptor-mediated endocytosis by the biotin-tagged polymer vesicles. This report provides first insights into the targeted polysaccharide vesicle platform , and the proof-of-concept is successfully demonstrated in biotin receptor-overexpressed cervical cancer cells.
