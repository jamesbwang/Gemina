  Members of the right open reading frame ( RIO<pathogen>) atypical kinase family are present in all three domains of life. In eukaryotes , three subfamilies have been identified: RIO1 , RIO2 , and RIO3. Studies have shown that the yeast and human RIO1 and RIO2 kinases are essential for the biogenesis of small ribosomal subunits. Thus far , RIO3 has been found only in multicellular eukaryotes. In this study , we systematically identified members of the RIO<pathogen> gene family in 37 species representing the major evolutionary lineages in Viridiplantae. A total of 84 RIO<pathogen> genes were identified; among them , 41 were classified as RIO1 and 43 as RIO2. However , no RIO3 gene was found in any of the species examined. Phylogenetic trees constructed for plant RIO1 and RIO2 proteins were generally congruent with the species phylogeny. Subcellular localization analyses showed that the plant RIO<pathogen> proteins were localized mainly in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm. Expression profile analysis of rice , maize , and Arabidopsis RIO<pathogen> genes in different tissues revealed similar expression patterns between RIO1 and RIO2 genes , and their expression levels were high in certain tissues. In addition , the expressions of plant RIO<pathogen> genes were regulated by two drugs: mycophenolic acid and actinomycin D. Function prediction using genome-wide coexpression analysis revealed that most plant RIO<pathogen> genes may be involved in ribosome biogenesis. Our results will be useful for the evolutionary analysis of the ancient RIO<pathogen> kinase family and provide a basis for further functional characterization of RIO<pathogen> genes in plants.
