  Since 2006 , CDC has recommended routine screening of all persons aged 13-64 years for human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) and at least annual rescreening of persons at higher risk ( 1). However , national surveillance data indicate that many persons at higher risk for HIV<pathogen> infection are not screened annually , and delays in diagnosis persist ( 2). CDC analyzed 2006-2016 data from the General Social Survey ( GSS) * and estimated that only 39.6 % of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults had ever tested for HIV<pathogen>. Among persons ever tested , the estimated median interval since last test was 1,080 days or almost 3 years. Only 62.2 % of persons who reported HIV-related risk behaviors in the past 12 months were ever tested for HIV<pathogen> , and the median interval since last test in this group was 512 days ( 1.4 years). The percentage of persons ever tested and the interval since last test remained largely unchanged during 2006-2016. More frequent screening of persons with ongoing HIV<pathogen> risk is needed to achieve full implementation of CDC 's screening recommendations and to prevent new infections. Integration of routine screening as standard clinical practice through existing strategies , such as electronic medical record prompts ( 3) , or through new , innovative strategies might be needed to increase repeat screening of persons with ongoing risk.
