  The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene ( 16S rRNA) has been successfully used to catalogue and study the diversity of prokaryotic species and communities but it offers limited resolution at the species and finer levels , and can not represent the whole-genome diversity and fluidity. To overcome these limitations , we introduced the Microbial Genomes Atlas ( MiGA) , a webserver that allows the classification of an unknown query genomic sequence , complete or partial , against all taxonomically classified taxa with available genome sequences , as well as comparisons to other related genomes including uncultivated ones , based on the genome-aggregate Average Nucleotide and Amino Acid Identity ( ANI/AAI) concepts. MiGA integrates best practices in sequence quality trimming and assembly and allows input to be raw reads or assemblies from isolate genomes , single-cell sequences , and metagenome-assembled genomes ( MAGs). Further , MiGA can take as input hundreds of closely related genomes of the same or closely related species ( a so-called ` Clade Project ') to assess their gene content diversity and evolutionary relationships , and calculate important clade properties such as the pangenome and core gene sets. Therefore , MiGA is expected to facilitate a range of genome-based taxonomic and diversity studies , and quality assessment across environmental and clinical settings. MiGA is available at http://microbial-genomes.org/.
