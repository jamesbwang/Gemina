  Tuning the band structure and , in particular , gap opening in 1D and 2D materials through their deformation is a promising approach for their application in modern semiconductor devices. However , there is an essential breach between existing laboratory scale methods applied for deformation of low-dimensional materials and the needs of large-scale production. In this work , we propose a novel method which is potentially well compatible with high end technological applications: single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs) first deposited on the flat surface of a supporting wafer , which has been pre-implanted with H
