  Top-down fabrication is commonly used to provide positioning control of optical structures; yet , it places stringent limitations on component materials , and oftentimes , dynamic reconfigurability is challenging to realize. Here , we present a reconfigurable nanoparticle platform that can integrate heterogeneous particle assembly of different shapes , sizes , and chemical compositions. We demonstrate dynamic control of disorder in this platform and use it to tune random laser emission characteristics for a suspension of titanium dioxide nanowires in a dye solution. Using an alternating current electric field , we control the nanowire orientation to dynamically engineer the collective scattering of the sample. Our theoretical model indicates that a change of up to 22 % in scattering coefficient can be achieved for the experimentally determined nanowire length distribution upon alignment. Dependence of light confinement on anisotropic particle alignment provides a means to reversibly tune random laser characteristics; a nearly 20-fold increase in lasing intensity was observed with aligned particle orientation. We illustrate the generality of the approach by demonstrating enhanced lasing for aligned nanowires of other materials including gold , mixed gold/dielectric , and vanadium oxide.
