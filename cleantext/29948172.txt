  Disorders related to pelvic floor include urinary incontinence ( UI) , anal incontinence , pelvic organ prolapse , sexual dysfunction and pelvic pain. Because pelvic floor dysfunctions ( PFD) can be diagnosed clinically , imaging techniques serve as auxiliary tools for establishing an accurate diagnosis. The objective is to evaluate the PFD in primiparous women after vaginal delivery and the association between clinical examination and three-dimensional ultrasonography ( 3DUS). A cross-sectional study was conducted in a in tertiary maternity. All primiparous women with vaginal deliveries that occurred between January 2013 and December 2015 were invited. Women who attended the invitation underwent detailed anamnesis , questionnaire application , physical examination and endovaginal and endoanal 3DUS. Crude and adjusted predictor factors for PFD were analyzed. Fifty women were evaluated. Sexual dysfunction was the most prevalent PFD ( 64.6 %). When associated with clinical features and PFD , oxytocin use increased by approximately four times the odds of UI ( crude OR 4.182 , 95 % CI 1.149-15.219). During the multivariate analysis , the odds of UI were increased in forceps use by approximately 11 times ( adjusted OR 11.552 , 95 % CI 11.155-115.577). When the clinical and obstetrical predictors for PFD were associated with 3DUS , forceps increased the odds of lesion<symptom> of the pubovisceral muscle and anal sphincter diagnosed by 3DUS by sixfold ( crude OR 6.000 , 95 % CI 1.172-30.725) , and in multivariate analysis forceps again increased the odds of injury by approximately 7 times ( adjusted OR 7.778 , 95 % CI 1.380-43.846). Sexual dysfunction was the most frequent PFD. The use of forceps in primiparous women was associated with a greater chance of UI and pelvic floor muscle damage diagnosed by 3DUS.
