  This study was performed to investigate the prognostic significance of a cumulative score based on the preoperative plasma fibrinogen and serum albumin ( FA score) in operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC). Clinicopathologic characteristics , preoperative fibrinogen , and albumin concentrations were retrospectively reviewed in patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy. The optimal cutoff value was defined as 4.0 g/L for fibrinogen according to previous studies and as 41.0 g/L for albumin for the lower quartile. Subjects with elevated fibrinogen and decreased albumin levels were allocated a score of 2 , those with only one of these two abnormalities were assigned a score of 1 , and those with neither of the abnormalities were allocated a score of 0. The preoperative FA score was significantly associated with tumor length , depth of invasion , lymph node involvement , tumor-node-metastasis ( TNM) stage , and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score ( mGPS). No significant differences in age , gender , tumor location , degree of differentiation , smoking or alcohol consumption were found between groups. Univariate survival analysis revealed that high preoperative FA score ( 1/2) was significantly associated with unfavorable disease-free survival ( DFS) ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.675; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.278-2.195; P < 0.001) and overall survival ( OS) ( HR , 1.685; 95 % CI , 1.268-2.239; P < 0.001). Furthermore , it remained an independent prognostic indicator for both DFS ( HR , 1.394; 95 % CI , 1.035-1.879; P = 0.029) and OS ( HR , 1.369; 95 % CI , 1.010-1.878; P = 0.048) in multivariable Cox regression analysis. A high preoperative FA score could significantly predict impaired long-term survival for ESCC patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy.
