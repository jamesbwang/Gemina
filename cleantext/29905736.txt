  We report a new quantitative measurement method of polarization direction based on the polarization axis finder ( PAF) and digital image processing. The PAF acts as an azimuthal analyzer to determine the polarization direction of linearly polarized light and form an `` hourglass '' intensity pattern , and a digital camera is employed to record the pattern , and then the lightwave 's polarization direction is obtained accurately by analyzing the pattern with a specially designed digital image processing algorithm. The quantitative measuring experiments have been carried out by validating the standard quartz plates with known rotation angles , and the measurement accuracy has reached 0.01 Â°.
