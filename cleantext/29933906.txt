  A retrospective , observational study was performed of 112 patients who underwent autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT) to determine the relationship between CD34 + stem cell dose and neutrophil engraftment. Importantly , a novel approach to more accurately calculate time to neutrophil engraftment was employed. The results demonstrated that a higher CD34 + stem cell dose was associated with faster neutrophil recovery ( P < 0.05). CD34 + stem cell dose using actual and ideal patient body<symptom> weight were both equally predictive of neutrophil engraftment as were absolute and viable CD34 + measurements. The clinical implications for this relationship are limited with an increase in CD34 + stem cell dose by 1 Ã— 10
