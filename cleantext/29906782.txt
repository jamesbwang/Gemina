  The study of secondary electron emission ( SEE) yield as a function of the kinetic energy of the incident primary electron beam and its evolution with charge accumulation inside insulators is a source of valuable information ( even though an indirect one) on charge transport and trapping phenomena. We will show that this evolution is essentially due , in plane geometry conditions ( achieved using a defocused electron beam) , to the electric field effect ( due to the accumulation of trapped charges in the bulk) in the escape zone of secondary electrons and not to modifications of trapping cross sections , which only have side effects. We propose an analytical model including the main basic phenomena underlying the space charge dynamics. It will be observed that such a model makes it possible to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the measurement of SEE evolution as well as to provide helpful indications concerning charge transport ( more precisely , the ratios between the mobility and diffusion coefficient with the thermal velocity of the charge carrier).
