  In this paper , we examined relationships and differences between personal and vicarious life stories , i.e. , the life stories one knows of others. Personal and vicarious life stories of both members of 51 young couples ( 102 participants) , based on McAdams ' Life Story Interview ( 2008) , were collected. We found significant positive relationships between participants ' personal and vicarious life stories on agency and communion themes and redemption sequences. We also found significant positive relationships between participants ' vicarious life stories about their partners and those partners ' personal life stories on agency and communion , but not redemption. Furthermore , these relationships were not explained by similarity between couples ' two personal life stories , as no associations were found between couples ' personal stories on agency , communion and redemption. These results suggest that the way we construct the vicarious life stories of close others may reflect how we construct our personal life stories.
