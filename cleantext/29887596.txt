  The role of YAP ( Yes-associated protein 1) and MRTF-A ( myocardin-related transcription factor A) , two transcriptional co-activators regulated downstream of GPCRs ( G protein-coupled receptors) and RhoA , in the growth of glioblastoma cells and in vivo glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM) tumor development was explored using human glioblastoma cell lines and tumor-initiating cells derived from patient-derived xenografts ( PDX). Knockdown of these co-activators in GSC-23 PDX cells using short hairpin RNA significantly attenuated in vitro self-renewal capability assessed by limiting dilution , oncogene expression , and neurosphere formation. Orthotopic xenografts of the MRTF-A and YAP knockdown PDX cells formed significantly smaller tumors and were of lower morbidity than wild-type cells. In vitro studies used PDX and 1321N1 glioblastoma cells to examine functional responses to sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P) , a GPCR agonist that activates RhoA signaling , demonstrated that YAP signaling was required for cell migration and invasion , whereas MRTF-A was required for cell adhesion; both YAP and MRTF-A were required for proliferation. Gene expression analysis by RNA-sequencing of S1P-treated MRTF-A or YAP knockout cells identified 44 genes that were induced through RhoA and highly dependent on YAP , MRTF-A , or both. Knockdown of F3 ( tissue factor ( TF)) , a target gene regulated selectively through YAP , blocked cell invasion and migration , whereas knockdown of HBEGF ( heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor) , a gene selectively induced through MRTF-A , prevented cell adhesion in response to S1P. Proliferation was sensitive to knockdown of target genes regulated through either or both YAP and MRTF-A. Expression of TF and HBEGF was also selectively decreased in tumors from PDX cells lacking YAP or MRTF-A , indicating that these transcriptional pathways are regulated in preclinical GBM models and suggesting that their activation through GPCRs and RhoA contributes to growth and maintenance of human GBM.
