  High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT) blood concentrations were shown to exhibit a diurnal rhythm , characterized by gradually decreasing concentrations throughout daytime , rising concentrations during nighttime and peak concentrations in the morning. We aimed to investigate whether this also applies to ( h) s-cTnI assays and whether it would affect diagnostic accuracy for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). Blood concentrations of cTnI were measured at presentation and after 1 h using four different cTnI assays: three commonly used sensitive ( s-cTnI Architect , Ultra and Accu) and one experimental high-sensitivity assay ( hs-cTnI Accu) in a prospective multicenter diagnostic study of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected AMI. These concentrations and their diagnostic accuracy for AMI ( quantified by the area under the curve ( AUC)) were compared between morning ( 11 p.m. to 2 p.m.) and evening ( 2 p.m. to 11 p.m.) presenters. Among 2601 patients , AMI was the final diagnosis in 17.6 % of patients. Concentrations of ( h) s-cTnI as measured using all four assays were comparable in patients presenting in the morning versus patients presenting in the evening. Diagnostic accuracy for AMI of all four ( h) s-cTnI assays were high and comparable between patients presenting in the morning versus presenting in the evening ( AUC at presentation: 0.90 vs 0.93 for s-cTnI Architect; 0.91 vs 0.94 for s-cTnI Ultra; 0.89 vs 0.94 for s-cTnI Accu; 0.91 vs 0.94 for hs-cTnI Accu). Cardiac TnI does not seem to express a diurnal rhythm. Diagnostic accuracy for AMI is very high and does not differ with time of presentation. NCT00470587 , http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00470587.
