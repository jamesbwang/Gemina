  This study examined the decorporation potential of lansoprazole ( LNP) as radioactivity decorporation agent for radiothallium ( Animals were divided into three groups , that is , control , pretreatment-1 ( 1X LNP) , and pretreatment-2 ( 2X LNP). Mice received LNP intraperitoneally , while in rabbits LNP was given through oral route 0.5 and 1.5 h before radiothallium administration , respectively. Mice and rabbits used in the experiment were administered 1.48 and 11.1 MBq radiothallium ( LNP treatment significantly increased the LNP exhibited dose-dependent decorporation potential to effectively enhance the elimination of
