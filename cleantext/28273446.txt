  The important role of mitochondria in cancer biology is gaining momentum. With their regulation of cell survival , metabolism , basic cell building blocks , and immunity , among other functions , mitochondria affect not only cancer progression but also the response and resistance to current treatments. Calcium ions are constantly shuttled in and out of mitochondria; thus , playing an important role in the regulation of various cellular processes. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter ( MCU) channel and its associated regulators transport calcium across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the mitochondrial matrix. Due to this central role and the capacity to affect cell behavior and fate , the MCU complex is being investigated in different cancers and cancer-related conditions. Here , we review current knowledge on the role of the MCU complex in multiple cancer types and models; we also provide a perspective for future research and clinical considerations.
