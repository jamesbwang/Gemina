  The pre-supplementary motor area ( pre-SMA) is engaged in speech comprehension under difficult circumstances such as poor acoustic signal quality or time-critical conditions. Previous studies found that left pre-SMA is activated when subjects listen to accelerated speech. Here , the functional role of pre-SMA was tested for accelerated speech comprehension by inducing a transient `` virtual lesion<symptom> '' using continuous theta-burst stimulation ( cTBS). Participants were tested ( 1) prior to ( pre-baseline) , ( 2) 10 min after ( test condition for the cTBS effect) , and ( 3) 60 min after stimulation ( post-baseline) using a sentence repetition task ( formant-synthesized at rates of 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16 syllables/s). Speech comprehension was quantified by the percentage of correctly reproduced speech material. For high speech rates , subjects showed decreased performance after cTBS of pre-SMA. Regarding the error pattern , the number of incorrect words without any semantic or phonological similarity to the target context increased , while related words decreased. Thus , the transient impairment of pre-SMA seems to affect its inhibitory function that normally eliminates erroneous speech material prior to speaking or , in case of perception , prior to encoding into a semantically/pragmatically meaningful message.
