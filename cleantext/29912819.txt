  Compare Eustachian tube balloon dilation versus continued medical therapy ( control) for treating persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction ( ETD). Prospective , multicenter , randomized controlled trial. Tertiary care academic center and private practice. Diagnosed with medically refractory persistent ETD. 1:1 Randomization to balloon dilation or control. After 6 weeks , control participants had the option to undergo balloon dilation if symptoms persisted. Primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison between treatment arms in the mean change from baseline in the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire ( ETDQ-7) score. Primary safety endpoint was complication rate. Sixty participants were randomized ( 31 balloon dilation , 29 control). Mean ( SD) change in overall ETDQ-7 score at 6 weeks was -2.9 ( 1.4) for balloon dilation compared with -0.6 ( 1.0) for control: balloon dilation was superior to control ( p < 0.0001). No complications were reported in either study arm. Among participants with abnormal baseline assessments , improvements in tympanogram type ( p < 0.006) and tympanic membrane position ( p < 0.001) were significantly better for balloon dilation than control. Technical success was 100 % ( 91 successful dilations/91 attempts) and most procedures ( 72 %) were completed in the office under local anesthesia. Improvements in the ETDQ-7 scores were maintained through 12 months after balloon dilation. Balloon dilation is a safe and effective treatment for persistent ETD. Based on improved ETDQ-7 scores , balloon dilation is superior to continued medical management for persistent ETD. Symptom improvement is durable through a minimum of 12 months. Procedures are well tolerated in the office setting under local anesthesia.
