  Adult dragonflies ( Anisoptera) were collected from different localities of South China covering eight provinces. Representative sequences were sixty-one , including 16 species , 11 genera and three families ( Aeshnidae , Gomphidae and Libellulidae) , under cytochrome oxidase subunit I ( COI) gene. After alignment of sequences by BioEdit v6 , genetic interaction and divergence were computed by MEGA 7 whereas all the indices of genetic diversity were calculated by DnaSP v5 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed through Neighbor-Joining method under Jukes-Cantor model , and all species of respective families were assembled with each other into individual groups. Maximum divergence was observed by Trithemis genus ( 18.69 %) , followed by Orthetrum genus ( 18.16 %) , whereas a minimum value of divergence was noted for Pantala genus ( 0.31 %). On the other hand , maximum genetic diversity was recorded for Orthetrum genus up to 142 mutations , followed by Trithemis genus ( 126 mutations) , while the minimum value ( two mutations) was observed for Pantala genus. Genetic diversity for overall and Libellulidae family sequences was much higher , up to 404 mutations and 344 mutations , respectively. Current results suggest a high diversity of odonates in the South China region and results are valuable in gaining a total obligation of the diversity of Asian odonates and conservation measures of this insect group.
