  Male reproductive investment is energetically costly , and measures of human reproductive steroid hormones ( testosterone) , developmental tempo ( pubertal timing) and growth ( stature) correlate with local ecologies at the population level. It is unclear whether male reproductive investment in later life is ` set ' during childhood development , mediated through adulthood , or varies by ethnicity. Applying a life-course model to Bangladeshi migrants to the United Kingdom , here we investigate plasticity in human male reproductive function resulting from childhood developmental conditions. We hypothesized that childhood ecology shapes adult trade-offs between reproductive investment and/or other fitness-related traits. We predicted correspondence between these traits and developmental timing of exposure to ecological constraints ( Bangladesh) or conditions of surplus ( United Kingdom). We compared: Bangladesh sedentees ( n = 107); Bangladeshi men who migrated in childhood to the United Kingdom ( n = 59); migrants who arrived in adulthood ( n = 75); second-generation UK-born and raised children of Bangladeshi migrants ( n = 56); and UK-born ethnic Europeans ( n = 62). Migration before puberty predicted higher testosterone and an earlier recalled pubertal age compared with Bangladeshi sedentees or adult migrants , with more pronounced differences in men who arrived before the age of eight. Second-generation Bangladeshis were taller , with higher testosterone than sedentees and adult migrants , and higher waking testosterone than Europeans. Age-related testosterone profiles varied by group , declining in UK migrants , increasing in sedentees , and having no significant relationship within UK-born groups. We conclude that male reproductive function apparently remains plastic late into childhood , is independent of Bengali or European ethnicity , and shapes physiological trade-offs later in life.
