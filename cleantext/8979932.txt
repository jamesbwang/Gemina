  Immigration leads to strong public and political debates in Europe and the Western world more generally. In some of these debates , migrants are described as either having little choice but to migrate ( involuntary migrants) or migrating out of their own free choice ( voluntary migrants). In two experimental studies among national samples of native Dutch respondents , we examined whether support for the accommodation of newcomers differs for voluntary and involuntary migrants and whether this depends on the relative importance of humanitarian considerations and host society considerations. The findings demonstrate that for people who find the topic of immigration personally important , involuntary , compared to voluntary , migration leads to stronger societal considerations which , in turn , is associated with weaker support for the accommodation of migrants. Additionally , humanitarian considerations are associated with stronger support but especially for participants who do not find the topic of immigration very important.
