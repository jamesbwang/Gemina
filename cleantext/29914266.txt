  1. Over the past decade rapid advancement in isolation methods for identifying markers of the once elusive intestinal stem cell ( ISC) populations have laid the foundation for unravelling their complex interrelationships during homeostasis. Study on ISC in avian intestinal tissue might play a pivotal foundation for further studies on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in gastrointestinal disease and cell-based therapy as well as intestinal tissue engineering. 2. The following experiment isolated a population of fibroblast-like , plastic adhering cells derived from chick embryo intestine , showing a strong self-renewing and proliferative ability , which was maintained in vitro up to passage 25. The findings included growth characteristics , detected expression of cell surface markers and characterised the capability of these cells to differentiate toward the osteogenic , adipogenic , and chondrogenic cell lineages. 3. RT-PCR analysis showed that these cells from chick embryos expressed mesenchymal stromal cell markers CD44 , CD90 and VIMENTIN as well as ISC-specific genes LGR5 , MI1 , SMOC2 , BMI1 , HOPX et al.. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry confirmed this biology characterisation further. 4. In conclusion , cells were isolated from the intestine of 18-day-old chicken embryos that exhibited the biological characteristics of mesenchymal stromal cells as well as markers of intestinal stem cells. Our findings may provide a novel insight for in vitro cell culture and characteristics of ISCs in avian species , which may also indicate a benefit for obtaining cell source for intestinal tissue engineering as well as cell-based investigation for gastrointestinal disease and treatment.
