  Redox deregulations are ubiquitous in cancer cells. However , the role of mitochondrial redox deregulation in metastasis remains unclear. In breast cancer , upregulation of mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein G1P3 ( IFI6) was associated with poor distance metastasis-free survival ( DMFS). Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that G1P3-induced mitochondrial redox deregulation confers metastatic potentials in breast cancer cells. Cell migration and invasion assays; confocal and immunofluorescence microscopy; and Illumina HumanHT-12 BeadChip to assess gene expression. Consequent to its localisation on inner-mitochondrial membrane , mtROS were higher in G1P3-expressing cells ( MCF-7 G1P3-induced mtROS have a direct role in migratory structure formation and nuclear gene expression to promote breast cancer cell metastasis. Therefore , interrupting mitochondrial functions of G1P3 may improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients.
