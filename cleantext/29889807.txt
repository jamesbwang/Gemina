  Cardiac arrest is not a common complication of sepsis<disease> , although sepsis<disease> has been recognized as one condition behind cardiac arrest. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of sepsis<disease> among patients with inhospital cardiac arrest ( IHCA) , and to determine if sepsis<disease> is associated with inferior outcome after IHCA. All consecutive emergency team dispatches in Turku University Hospital in 2011 to 2014 ( n = 607) were retrospectively reviewed to identify the patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) for IHCA ( n = 301). The patient records were reviewed for the criteria of severe sepsis<disease> , organ dysfunction , and chronic comorbidities before IHCA. Outcome was followed for 1 year. The criteria for prearrest severe sepsis<disease> were met by 83/301 ( 28 %) of the patients , and 93/301 ( 31 %) had multiorgan dysfunction ( 3 or more organ systems). The patients with severe sepsis<disease> had higher mortality than those without severe sepsis<disease> , increasing from 30-day mortalities of 63/83 ( 76 %) and 151/218 ( 69 %) , respectively ( P = 0.256) , to 1-year mortalities of 72/83 ( 87 %) and 164/218 ( 75 %) , respectively ( P = 0.030). Emergency admission , age , immunosuppression , DM , multiorgan dysfunction , and a nonshockable rhythm were independent predictors of 1-year mortality by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Six out of 83 patients with severe sepsis<disease> before IHCA ( 7 %) survived 1 year with good neurological outcome ( CPC scale 1). A high proportion of patients with IHCA have sepsis<disease> and multiorgan dysfunction , and their prognosis is worse than the prognosis of patients with IHCA in general.
