  Q-type C2H2 transcription factors ( TF) play crucial roles in the plant response to stress , often leading to regulation of downstream genes required for tolerance to these challenges. An infestation-responsive Q-type C2H2 TF ( StZFP2) is induced by wounding and infestation in potato. While mining the Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja genome for additional members of this family of proteins , five StZFP2-like genes were found on a portion of chromosome 11. The objective of this work was to differentiate these genes in tissue specificity and expression upon infestation. Examination of different tissues showed that young roots had the highest amounts of transcripts for five of the genes. Expression of their transcripts upon excision or infestation by Manduca sexta , showed that all six genes were induced. Overall , each gene showed variations in its response to infestation and specificity for tissue expression. The six genes encode very similar proteins but most likely play unique roles in the plant response to infestation. In contrast , only two homologs have been identified in Arabidopsis and tomato. Overexpression of similar genes has led to enhanced tolerance to , for example , salinity , drought and pathogen stress. Discovery of these new StZFP2 homologs could provide additional resources for potato breeders.
