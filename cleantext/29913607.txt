  Terrestrial particulate nutrients transported during flood events are known to indirectly fuel phytoplankton blooms in rivers , lakes and coastal waters , although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Quantifying the response of phytoplankton to nutrients in sediments eroded from catchments is fundamental to prioritizing areas for erosion control. This study developed a novel bioassay technique for rapidly assessing the effects of nutrients released from suspended sediments on the growth of marine and freshwater phytoplankton communities. A range of sediment slurries were placed in bioassay bottles within dialysis tubing in the presence of phytoplankton and their photosynthetic efficiency ( F
