  This study aimed to explore the protective effects of a Chinese herbal formula , Jinshui Huanxian formula ( JHF) , on experimental pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> and its underlying mechanisms. After being treated with single dose of bleomycin ( 5 mg/kg) intratracheally , rats were orally administered with JHF and pirfenidone from day 1 to 42 , then sacrificed at 7 , 14 , 28 , or 42 days post-bleomycin instillation. JHF ameliorated bleomycin-induced pathological changes , collagen deposition in the rat lung and recovered pulmonary function at different days post-bleomycin instillation. In lungs of JHF-treated rats , the levels of total superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione were higher , and myeloperoxidase and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde were lower than those in vehicle-treated rats , respectively. Additionally , JHF inhibited the expression of NADPH oxidase 4 ( NOX4) and increased the Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 ( Nrf2) in lung tissues.
