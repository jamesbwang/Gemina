  Non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms with differing biological characteristics. About 90 % of all lymphomas in the United States originate from B lymphocytes , while the remaining originate from T cells ( 1). The treatment of NHLs depends on neoplastic histology and the stage of the tumor , which will indicate whether radiotherapy , chemotherapy , or a combination is the best suitable treatment ( 2). The American Cancer Society describes the staging of lymphoma as follows: Stage I is lymphoma in a single node or area. Stage II is when that lymphoma has spread to another node or organ tissue. Stage III is when it has spread to lymph nodes in two sides of the diaphragm. Stage IV is when the cancer has significantly spread to organs outside the lymph system. Radiation therapy is the traditional therapeutic route for localized follicular and mucosa-associated lymphomas. Chemotherapy is utilized for the treatment of large cell lymphomas and high-grade lymphomas ( 2). However , treatment of indolent lymphomas remains problematic as the patients often have metastasis for which no standard approach exists ( 2).
