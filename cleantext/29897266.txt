  Angiotensin ( Ang) II is a major mediator of hypertension pathogenesis. In addition , there are well-documented differences in expression of the renin angiotensin system ( RAS) components and Ang II responses between males and females , which may explain sex differences in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and hypertension epidemiology. We have previously shown that type 1A Angiotensin ( AT1A) receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) play a critical role in BP regulation and hypertension pathogenesis , but these studies were carried out in male mice. Therefore , the major goal of these studies is to examine the impact of VSMC AT11A receptors on BP and hypertension pathogenesis in female mice. We found that elimination of VSMC AT1A receptors in female mice caused a reduction ( ≈ 8 mmHg) in baseline BP without altering sodium sensitivity. The severity of Ang II-dependent hypertension was diminished particularly during the last two weeks of chronic Ang II infusion ( ≈ 33 % reduction in BP) compared to controls without alterations in natriuresis during the first 5 days of Ang II. Female SMKO mice have enhanced urinary norepinephrine levels compared to controls. There was a virtually complete elimination of Ang II-dependent kidney hemodynamic responses with attenuation of acute vasoconstrictor responses in the systemic vasculature. These findings demonstrate that direct vascular actions of AT1A receptors play a prominent role in BP control and hypertension pathogenesis in female mice.
