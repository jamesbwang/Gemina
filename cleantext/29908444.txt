  No new and effective treatments have been approved for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) in the past decade. Cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil are the most commonly used drugs for this disease. In order to develop a new class of drugs effective in our ESCC phenotypic screens , we began a systematic approach to generate novel compounds based on the 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxamide fragment. Herein , we report on the synthesis and initial assessment of 55 new analogues in two ESCC cell lines. Some of the active analogues with IC
