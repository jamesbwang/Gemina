  Proficient bilinguals demonstrate slower lexical retrieval than comparable monolinguals. The present study tested predictions from two main accounts of this effect , the frequency-lag and competition hypotheses. Both make the same prediction for bilinguals but differ for trilinguals and for age differences. 200 younger or older adults who were monolingual , bilingual , or trilingual performed a picture naming task in English that included high and low frequency words. Naming times were faster for high than for low frequency words and , in line with frequency lag , group differences were larger for low than high frequency items. However , on all other measures , bilinguals and trilinguals performed equivalently , and lexical retrieval differences between language groups did not attenuate with age , consistent with the competition view.
