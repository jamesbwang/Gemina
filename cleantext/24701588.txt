  Poly ( methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid) ( PMVEMA) is a water-soluble , biodegradable polymer used for drug delivery. The aim of the present study was to prepare nanofibers of this polymer as a fast-dissolving carrier for montelukast. Polymeric nanofibers were spun by electrospinning method using different ratios of biodegradable polymer of PMVEMA. The processing variables including voltage , distance of the needle to rotating screen , and flow rate of the solution were optimized based on the diameter of the nanofibers , drug content , and release efficiency by a Taguchi design. The morphology , diameter , and diameter distribution of the nanofibers were studied by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). Drug loading and its release rate from the nanofibers were analyzed spectrophotometrically. The possible molecular between the polymer and the drug was characterized with Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed the best situation for electrospinning of the polymer obtained at the polymer concentration of 37 % , the distance of the needle to rotating screen of 19 cm , the voltage of 120 kV , and the rate of injection of 0.2 ml/h. In these situations , the fiber diameter and drug loading efficiency percentage were 273 nm and 83 % , respectively. These nanofibers released the total loaded drug within 1-3 s with no residue in the dissolution medium. SEM results showed that the optimized nanofibers were quite smooth and without beads. The results indicated that the nanofibers of PMVEMA could dissolve the drug very rapidly and can be adopted for fast-dissolving dosage forms.
