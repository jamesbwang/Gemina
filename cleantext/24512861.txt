  Differences in tumor characteristics might partially account for mortality disparities between African American ( AA) and European American ( EA) colorectal cancer patients. We evaluated effect modification by race for exposure and patient-outcomes associations with colorectal tumor methylation among 218 AA and 267 EA colorectal cancer cases from the population-based North Carolina Colon Cancer Study. Tumor methylation was assessed in CACNA1G , MLH1 , NEUROG1 , RUNX3 , and SOCS1. We used logistic regression to assess whether associations between several lifestyle factors-intake of fruits , vegetables , folate , and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-and tumor methylation were modified by race. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate whether race modified associations between tumor methylation and time to all-cause mortality. Greater fruit consumption was associated with greater odds of high NEUROG1 methylation among EA at methylation cut points of 15-35 % ( maximum OR 3.44 , 95 % CI 1.66 , 7.13) but not among AA. Higher folate intake was associated with lower odds of high CACNA1G methylation among EAs but not AAs. Tumor methylation was not associated with all-cause mortality for either group. Race might modify associations between lifestyle factors and colorectal tumor methylation , but in this sample did not appear to modify associations between tumor methylation and all-cause mortality.
