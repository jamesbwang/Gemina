  Low-frequency oscillations ( LFOs) in hemodynamics assessed by fMRI reflect synchronized neuronal activities and are the basis for mapping brain function and its disruption by drugs and disease. Here we assess if cocaine disrupts coupling between neuronal and vascular LFOs by simultaneously measuring cortical field potentials ( FP) and cerebral blood flow ( CBF) regarding their LFOs ( 0-1 Hz) spectral bandwidths in the somatosensory cortex of naïve and chronic cocaine-exposed rats at baseline and during cocaine intoxication. While across all conditions the dominant oscillation frequencies for FP and CBF LFOs were ~ 0.1 Hz , the bandwidth of FP LFOs was about 4.8 ± 0.67 times broader than that of CBF LFOs. Acute cocaine depressed high-frequency FP events but increased the relative intensity of neuronal and hemodynamic LFOs , an effect that was markedly accentuated in magnitude and duration in chronic cocaine-exposed animals. Neuronal LFOs were correlated with CBF LFOs in control animals but not in chronically cocaine-exposed animals , which suggests neurovascular uncoupling. The marked increases in neuronal LFOs with chronic cocaine , which we interpret to reflect increases in neuronal synchronization in the LFOs , and the uncoupling of hemodynamics with resting neuronal activities could contribute to brain<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> in cocaine abusers and confound the interpretation of fMRI studies.
