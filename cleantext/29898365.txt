  G-Quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid structures typically stabilized by GGGG tetrads. These structures are intrinsically fluorescent , which expands the known scope of nucleic acid function and raises the possibility that they could eventually be used as signaling components in label-free sensors constructed from DNA or RNA. In this study , we systematically investigated the effects of mutations in tetrads , loops , and overhanging nucleotides on the fluorescence intensity and maximum emission wavelength of > 500 sequence variants of a reference DNA G-quadruplex. Some of these mutations modestly increased the fluorescence intensity of this G-quadruplex , while others shifted its maximum emission wavelength. Mutations that increased the fluorescence intensity were distinct from those that increased the maximum emission wavelength , suggesting a trade-off between these two biochemical properties. The fluorescence intensity and maximum emission wavelength were also correlated with multimeric state: the most fluorescent G-quadruplexes were monomers , while those with the highest maximum emission wavelengths typically formed dimeric structures. Oligonucleotides containing multiple G-quadruplexes were in some cases more fluorescent than those containing a single G-quadruplex , although this depended on the length and sequence of the spacer linking the G-quadruplexes. These experiments provide new insights into the properties of fluorescent G-quadruplexes and should aid in the development of improved label-free nucleic acid sensors.
