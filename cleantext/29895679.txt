  The current study investigates an acute and a gradual transition of the point of force application ( PFA) from the rearfoot towards the fore of the foot during running , on the rate of metabolic energy consumption. The participants were randomly assigned in two experimental and one control groups: a short-term intervention group ( STI , N = 17; two training sessions) , a long-term intervention group ( LTI , N = 10; 14-week gradual transition) and a control group ( CG , N = 11). Data were collected at two running velocities ( 2.5 and 3.0 m/s). The cost coefficient ( i.e. energy required for a unit of vertical ground reaction force , J/N) decreased ( p < 0.001) after both interventions due to a more anterior PFA during running ( STI: 12 % , LTI: 11 %) , but led to a higher ( p < 0.001) rate of force generation ( STI: 17 % , LTI: 15.2 %). Dynamic stability of running showed a significant ( p < 0.001) decrease in the STI ( 2.1 %) , but no differences ( p = 0.673) in the LTI. The rate of metabolic energy consumption increased in the STI ( p = 0.038) , but remained unchanged in the LTI ( p = 0.660). The control group had no changes. These results demonstrate that the cost coefficient was successfully decreased following an alteration in the running technique towards a more anterior PFA. However , the energy consumption remained unchanged because of a simultaneous increase in rate of force generation due to a decreased contact time per step. The increased instability found during the short-term intervention and its neutralization after the long-term intervention indicates a role of motor control errors in the economy of running after acute alterations in habitual running execution.
