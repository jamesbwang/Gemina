  Highly luminescent CdS quantum dots capped with thioglycolic acid ( TGA@CdS QDs) were synthesized from cadmium chloride and thiourea as cadmium and sulfur sources via simple hydrothermal method. The room temperature photoluminescence ( RTPL) properties of TGA@CdS QDs were investigated. The results indicate that the polarity of the solvent and the surface trap state resulted in the broadness Stokes shift between the maximum absorption wavelength and the emission wavelength of TGA@CdS QDs. The Co
