  The genetic complexity , clinical variability , and inaccessibility of affected tissue in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders have largely prevented the development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics. A precision medicine approach that integrates genomics , deep clinical phenotyping , and patient stem cell models may facilitate identification of underlying biological drivers and targeted drug development.
