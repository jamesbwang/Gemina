  Skin cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the United States. Training medical students about the importance of sun-protective behaviors is critical to reducing skin cancer rates. However , minimal research has explored osteopathic medical students ' knowledge and behaviors with regard to the sun 's effect on skin health. To assess first-year osteopathic medical students ' knowledge about skin cancer and UV radiation , attitudes toward tanning , and sun-protective behaviors to establish baseline values. Using a descriptive , cross-sectional study design , the authors evaluated students ' knowledge , attitudes , and behaviors through a quiz. A total of 121 first-year osteopathic medical students completed the quiz. The mean ( SD) score was 74.6 % ( 11.5 %). Two-thirds of participants ( n = 82) correctly identified basal cell carcinoma as the most common skin cancer , and the majority identified the ABCDs ( asymmetry , border irregularity , color , and diameter) of melanoma detection ( 96 ( 79.3 %) , 106 ( 87.6 %) , 108 ( 89.3 %) , and 94 ( 77.7 %) , respectively). Most participants were aware that cloud cover and swimming underwater do not provide UV ray protection ( 121 ( 100 %) and 109 ( 90.1 %) , respectively) , a fact that is often misconceived. Forty participants ( 33.1 %) usually or always used some form of sun protection when outdoors. Forty-seven participants ( 38.8 %) believed that a tan makes one look healthy , and 43 participants ( 35.6 %) sunbathed with the intention of tanning. Physicians are uniquely positioned to counsel patients regarding sun-protective behaviors. Thus , a medical school curriculum that includes education about the sun 's effect on health is needed for the prevention and early recognition of skin cancer in future patients.
