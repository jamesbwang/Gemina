  Mendelian randomization studies and `` human knock-out '' studies of rare loss-of-function coding variants suggest that plasma levels of LDL-C , triglycerides and Lp ( a) are causally associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease , and therefore therapies directed against these targets should reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However , several therapies directed against these targets have failed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in large-scale randomized trials , thus suggesting that causality is not sufficient evidence to establish genetic target validation. Instead , the critical question that needs to be answered to improve drug discovery and development is how much a causal biomarker needs to be changed to produce a clinically meaningful benefit in a short-term trial. This review describes how to use naturally randomized genetic evidence to accurately anticipate the results of randomized trials evaluating current and future lipid lowering therapies , inform the design of randomized trials , and transform the drug discovery and development process.
