  Children with ependymoma are cured in less than 50 % of cases , with little improvement in outcome over the last several decades. Chemotherapy has not impacted survival in ependymoma , due in part to a lack of preclinical models that has precluded comprehensive drug testing. We recently developed two human ependymoma cell lines harboring high-risk phenotypes which provided us with an opportunity to execute translational studies. ependymoma and other pediatric brain tumor cell lines were subject to a large-scale comparative drug screen of ependymoma- approved oncology drugs for rapid clinical application. The results of this in vitro study were combined with in silico prediction of drug sensitivity to identify ependymoma- selective compounds , which were validated by dose curve and time course modelling. Mechanisms of ependymoma- selective antitumor effect were further investigated using transcriptome and proteome analyses. We identified three classes of oncology drugs that showed ependymoma- selective anti-tumor effect , namely ( i) fluorinated pyrimidines ( 5-fluorouracil , carmofur and floxuridine) , ( ii) retinoids ( bexarotene , tretinoin and isotretinoin) , and ( iii) a subset of small-molecule multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( axitinib , imatinib and pazopanib). Axitinib 's anti-tumor mechanism in ependymoma cell lines involved inhibition of PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta and was associated with reduced mitosis-related gene expression and cellular senescence. The clinically available , ependymoma- selective oncology drugs identified by our study have the potential to critically inform design of upcoming clinical studies in ependymoma , in particular for those children with recurrent ependymoma who are in the greatest need of novel therapeutic approaches.
