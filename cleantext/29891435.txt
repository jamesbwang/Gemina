  The aim was to identify the prevalence of inadequate health literacy in patients with arterial vascular disease. This was a cross sectional study. Patients with arterial vascular disease visiting the outpatient clinic between January 5 , 2015 and December 28 , 2016 , were randomly included and screened for inadequate health literacy with the Newest Vital Sign-Dutch ( NVS-D) , a validated health literacy assessment measure. A score of < 4 out of six identified individuals with inadequate health literacy. Age , gender , highest education level , and reason for consultation were also registered. Data analysis was performed using Student 's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. Logistic regression with backward elimination was applied to identify independent predictors. A total of 202 patients were included. The mean NVS-D score was 1.91 ( SD ± 1.948 , median 1). The prevalence of inadequate health literacy was 76.7 %. A significantly higher prevalence of inadequate health literacy was found in patients ≥ 65 years ( p < .001) and patients with a lower education level ( p < .001). No significant difference was found between female/male patients ( p = .056) , nor between participants with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( p = .116). Age ( OR 1.060; 95 % CI 1.017-1.104; p = .005) and education level ( OR 0.164; 95 % CI 0.078-0.346; p < .001) were identified as independent predictors of inadequate health literacy. This study shows a prevalence of inadequate health literacy of 76.7 % in patients with arterial vascular disease , with a significantly higher prevalence in patients ≥ 65 years and patients with a lower education level. The high prevalence of inadequate health literacy should be considered when information is provided , and suggests the need to further investigate the best methods to convey medical information to this group of vulnerable patients.
