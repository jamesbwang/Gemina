  The genetic contribution to the prognosis of ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) is poorly understood , and most currently known susceptibility loci are not associated with prognosis. To identify genetic variants influencing the prognosis of UC , we performed an Immunochip-based study using an extreme phenotype approach. Based on the finding that the only association Pdiscovery-meta < 1 × 10-4 was located in the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) , we focused our analyses on the HLA region. We performed the analysis using HLA imputation data from three independent discovery cohorts of 607 UC patients ( 243 poor-prognosis and 364 good-prognosis) , followed by replication in 274 UC patients ( 145 poor-prognosis and 129 good-prognosis). We found that rs9268877 , located between HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB , was associated with poor prognosis of UC at genome-wide significance ( odds ratio ( ORdiscovery) = 1.82; ORreplication = 1.55; ORcombined-meta = 1.72 , Pcombined-meta = 1.04 × 10-8) , with effect size ( OR) increasing incrementally according to worsening of prognosis in each of the three independent discovery cohorts and the replication cohort. However , rs9268877 showed no association with UC susceptibility ( ORcombined-meta = 1.07 , Pcombined-meta = 0.135). rs9268877 influenced 30 year clinical outcomes , and the presence of the rs9268877 risk allele had a sensitivity of 80.0 % and specificity of 38.1 % for colectomy. Our results provide new insights into prognosis-associated genetic variation in UC , which appears to be distinct from the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. These findings could be useful in identifying poor-prognosis patients who might benefit from early aggressive therapy.
