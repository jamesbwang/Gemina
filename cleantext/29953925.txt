  Apathy is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson 's disease ( PD). We aimed to explore its associated neural substrates changes via amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ( ALFF) and granger causality analysis ( GCA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs-fMRI) scans were performed in 20 PD patients with apathy ( PD-A) , 22 PD patients without apathy ( PD-NA) and 19 healthy volunteers. GCA , a new method exploring direction from one brain region to another , was based on brain regions showing alterations of neural activity as seeds , which were examined utilizing ALFF approach. The relationships between ALFF or GCA and apathetic symptoms were also assessed. Relative to PD-NA group , PD-A group indicated decreased ALFF in left orbital middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus ( SFG). Only ALFF values in right SFG were negatively correlated with Apathy Scale ( AS) scores. Then GCA with the seed of right SFG showed a positive feedback from right thalamus to ipsilateral SFG , which was positively correlated with AS scores. In conclusion , dysfunction in SFG and a positive feedback from thalamus to ipsilateral SFG contributed to presence of PD-related apathy , providing a new perspective for future studies on apathy in PD.
