  The host range of a plant virus is the number of species in which it can reproduce. Most studies of plant virus host range evolution have focused on the genetics of host-pathogen interactions. However , the distribution and abundance of plant viruses and their hosts do not always overlap , and these spatial and temporal discontinuities in plant virus-host interactions can result in various ecological processes that shape host range evolution. Recent work shows that the distributions of pathogenic and resistant genotypes , vectors , and other resources supporting transmission vary widely in the environment , producing both expected and unanticipated patterns. The distributions of all of these factors are influenced further by competitive effects , natural enemies , anthropogenic disturbance , the abiotic environment , and herbivory to mention some. We suggest the need for further development of approaches that ( i) explicitly consider resource use and the abiotic and biotic factors that affect the strategies by which viruses exploit resources; and ( ii) are sensitive across scales. Host range and habitat specificity will largely determine which phyla are most likely to be new hosts , but predicting which host and when it is likely to be infected is enormously challenging because it is unclear how environmental heterogeneity affects the interactions of viruses and hosts.
