  Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is a debilitating condition and more people are being diagnosed each year. T2D increases patients ' risk of developing disabling micro- and macrovascular complications , significantly reduces patients ' quality of life , and is a substantial global economic burden. The efficacy and safety of antihyperglycemic therapies have improved over the years and have increased the lifespan for these patients. Consequently , patients are living longer with the condition and the associated comorbidities , but with a lowered quality of life. Therefore , therapies should aim to provide both optimal glycemic control and improve quality of life. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1 RA) therapy improves glycemic control , reduces body<symptom> weight , and has a low risk for hypoglycemia. GLP-1 RAs are available as once-daily ( OD) , twice-daily ( BD) , or once-weekly ( OW) injectable formulations; OW injections may increase patients ' satisfaction and improve treatment adherence. In the last decade , concern has been raised about the cardiovascular ( CV) safety of antihyperglycemic therapies. Clinical data have been limited on CV outcomes among OW GLP-1 RAs. However , a post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN-6 trial suggested that semaglutide , the most recently US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)- approved OW GLP-1 RA therapy , may offer cardioprotection , addressing this previously unmet clinical need.
