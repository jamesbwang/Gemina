  Maple syrup urine disease ( MSUD) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder that affects branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA) metabolism. It is characterized by accumulation of BCAAs and corresponding branched-chain keto acids of leucine , isoleucine , and valine in plasma , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid. Leucine is toxic to brain cells , leading to cytotoxic edema<symptom> affecting the myelinated white matter , and involving the corticospinal tracts , thalami , globus palladi , midbrain , dorsal brain stem , and cerebellum. We present a neonate with the classic subtype of MSUD and its imaging features on magnetic resonance imaging.
