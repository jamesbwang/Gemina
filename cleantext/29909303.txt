  Improving Quality of Life ( QoL) is an important objective in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The aim of the current study was to examine to which extent resilience , internalized stigma , and psychopathology are correlated to QoL. We recruited 60 outpatients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder according to DSM-IV criteria and 77 healthy control subjects from the general community. In patients , symptoms were quantified by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( MADRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS) and internalized stigma by the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness ( ISMI) scale. In order to assess QoL and resilience , the Berliner Lebensqualitätsprofil ( BELP) and the Resilience Scale ( RS-25) were used in both patients and control subjects. Despite presenting with a very mild symptom level and relatively low internalized stigma , patients with bipolar I disorder indicated significantly lower QoL and resilience as compared to healthy control subjects. In patients , QoL correlated significantly with resilience , internalized stigma , and residual symptoms of depression<symptom> No significant correlations were observed between QoL and residual manic symptoms. The cross-sectional design and the relatively small sample size limit the generalizability of our results. Furthermore , levels of resilience and internalized stigma may change over the course of the illness and have different impacts on the long-term outcome of patients with bipolar disorder. Our results show that QoL of patients suffering from bipolar I disorder , even when only mildly ill , is strongly associated with the degree of resilience and internalized stigma , and that particularly residual depressive symptoms have a negative impact on QoL. In addition to drug treatment , psychotherapeutic approaches should be applied to strengthen resilience , to reduce internalized stigma , and , ultimately , to improve quality of life.
