  Sulfur mustard ( SM) is an incapacitating chemical warfare agent which causes acute and chronic toxicities in different body organs of affected individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the innate immune status of the Iranian veterans who were exposed to SM around 30 years earlier and had more than 25 % disabilities. In this regard , most functional and non-functional parameters of innate immunity were evaluated in 35 veterans. Phagocytic activity , nitroblue tetrazolium ( NBT) reduction assay and hemolytic complement activity ( HCA) in addition to routine hematological parameters , serum protein electrophoresis , complements C3 and C4 levels were studied. Measures of hematological parameters , serum proteins , C3 and C4 were almost within the normal range. Functional experiments like phagocytic activity , NBT reduction assay and HCA were normal as well. However , serum protein analysis revealed a fair decrease in percentages of Î±
