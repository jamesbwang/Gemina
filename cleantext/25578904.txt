  Cell-cell communication plays an important role in collective cell migration. However , it remains unclear how cells in a group cooperatively process external signals to determine the group 's direction of motion. Although the topology of signaling pathways is vitally important in single-cell chemotaxis , the signaling topology for collective chemotaxis has not been systematically studied. Here , we combine mathematical analysis and simulations to find minimal network topologies for multicellular signal processing in collective chemotaxis. We focus on border cell cluster chemotaxis in the Drosophila egg chamber , in which responses to several experimental perturbations of the signaling network are known. Our minimal signaling network includes only four elements: a chemoattractant , the protein Rac ( indicating cell activation) , cell protrusion , and a hypothesized global factor responsible for cell-cell interaction. Experimental data on cell protrusion statistics allows us to systematically narrow the number of possible topologies from more than 40,000,000 to only six minimal topologies with six interactions between the four elements. This analysis does not require a specific functional form of the interactions , and only qualitative features are needed; it is thus robust to many modeling choices. Simulations of a stochastic biochemical model of border cell chemotaxis show that the qualitative selection procedure accurately determines which topologies are consistent with the experiment. We fit our model for all six proposed topologies; each produces results that are consistent with all experimentally available data. Finally , we suggest experiments to further discriminate possible pathway topologies.
