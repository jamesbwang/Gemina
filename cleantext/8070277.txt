  Pheromones are odoriferous volatile chemical cues produced by animals for communication among conspecifics so as to regulate their social behaviors. In general , the odor compounds are recognized by receptors in the nasal cavity. Odorant-binding protein ( OBP) , a lipocalin family protein , mediates the air-borne odor cues to nasal receptors through nasal mucus. The presence of OBP in several mammalian species is well documented but to-date there is no report of a nasal OBP in buffalo. Hence , the present study was undertaken to investigate if OBP is present in buffalo nasal mucus. Uni- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the nasal mucus suggested the presence of OBP , which was confirmed using mass spectrometry. In silico homology model of the OBP was generated and its structural similarity with other mammalian OBPs was assessed. Finally , molecular-docking and- dynamics simulations analysis revealed the efficiency of buffalo nasal OBP ( bunOBP) to bind with buffalo pheromones as well as other reported chemical cues. Taken together , the occurrence of nasal OBP in buffalo and its putative role in odor binding are reported for the first time. The potential association of this protein with estrus-specific volatiles could be taken to advantage for non-invasive detection of estrus in buffaloes.
