  Many genetic conditions predispose affected individuals to opportunistic infections. A number of immunodeficiency<disease> diseases<disease> , including genetic defects termed Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease ( MSMD) , permit infection from many different strains of mycobacteria that would otherwise not cause disease. These include tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria , and bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine ( BCG). Patients may present with infections from other organisms that depend on macrophage function for containment. Defects in multiple genes in the IL-12 and NFKB signaling pathways can cause the MSMD phenotype , some of which include IL12RB1 , IL12B , IKBKG , ISG15 , IFNGR1 , IFNGR2 , CYBB , TYK2 , IRF8 , and STAT1. Multiple autosomal recessive and dominant , and 2 X-linked recessive gene defects resulting in the MSMD phenotype have been reported , and others await discovery. This review presents the known gene defects and describes clinical findings that result from the mutations. If MSMD is suspected , a careful clinical history and examination and basic immunodeficiency screening tests will narrow the differential diagnosis. A specific diagnosis requires more sophisticated laboratory investigation. Genetic testing permits a definitive diagnosis , permitting genetic counseling. Mild cases respond well to appropriate antibiotic therapy , whereas severe disease may require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
