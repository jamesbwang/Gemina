  Cationic and non-peptide small molecules containing a total of six positive charges arranged on one side and a long aliphatic tail on the other have been synthesized and tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The positive charges have been contributed by two aminophenol residues. These molecules have showed remarkable antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including multidrug-resistant strains. Our structure ‚Åª activity relationship studies demonstrated the importance of the length and flexibility of the hydrophobic tail for the antimicrobial activity. Importantly , these compounds are non-toxic to eukaryotic cells at the concentration affecting growth in bacteria , reflecting an acceptable margin of safety. The small size and easy synthetic accessibility of our molecules can be of interest for the further development of novel antimicrobials against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens , including multidrug-resistant strains.
