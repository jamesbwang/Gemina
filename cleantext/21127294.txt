  Adropin is a peptide highly expressed in the brain. Emerging evidence indicates that low plasma levels of adropin are closely associated with aging and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that aging reduces adropin levels in the brain , which correlates with reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) and increased oxidative stress associated with age-related endothelial dysfunction. Cortical brain tissue and plasma were collected from young ( 10-12 weeks old) and aged ( 18-20 months old) male Sprague-Dawley na√Øve rats. Using RT-qPCR , we quantified the mRNA levels of the
