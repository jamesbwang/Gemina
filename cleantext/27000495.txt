  Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF- & beta ;-RRB- is a pleiotropic cytokine produced in large amounts within cancer microenvironments that will ultimately promote neoplastic progression , notably by suppressing the host & rsquo; s T-cell immunosurveillance. This effect is mostly due to the well-known inhibitory effect of TGF- & beta; on T cell proliferation , activation , and effector functions. Moreover , TGF- & beta; subverts T cell immunity by favoring regulatory T-cell differentiation , further reinforcing immunosuppression within tumor microenvironments. These findings stimulated the development of many strategies to block TGF- & beta; or its signaling pathways , either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies , to restore anti-cancer immunity. Paradoxically , recent studies provided evidence that TGF- & beta; can also promote differentiation of certain inflammatory populations of T cells , such as Th17 , Th9 , and resident-memory T cells ( Trm) , which have been associated with improved tumor control in several models. Here , we review current advances in our understanding of the many roles of TGF- & beta; in T cell biology in the context of tumor immunity and discuss the possibility to manipulate TGF- & beta; signaling to improve cancer immunotherapy.
