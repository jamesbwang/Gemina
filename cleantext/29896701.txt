  In situ hybridization performed using whole fixed embryos provides accurate and detailed visualization of gene expression patterns. These patterns are useful for investigating spatial patterns of gene expression in normally developing embryos but can also be useful in investigating the effects of genetic or environmental changes on expression of genetic markers characteristic of particular tissues , organs , or genetic pathways. Our lab 's protocol for whole-mount in situ hybridization is presented.
