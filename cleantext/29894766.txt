  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system , which is characterized by movement disorders , such as static tremor<symptom> , rigidity , and bradykinesia<symptom> in advanced patients. Gastrointestinal ( GI) dysfunction , such as gastric dysmotility , constipation<symptom> , and anorectic dysfunction , is common non-motor symptom in the early stage of PD. The progression of PD includes the degenerative loss of dopaminergic ( DA) neurons and aggregation of α-synuclein in the substantia nigra ( SN). Interestingly , both of them are also present in the enteric nervous system ( ENS) of PD patients. In this review , we describe the relationship between non-motor symptoms particularly GI dysfunction<symptom> and the pathogenesis of PD , aiming to show the powerful evidences about the prion-like propagation of α-synuclein and support the hypothesis of gut-brain axis in PD. We then summarize the mechanism of the gut-brain axis and confirm α-synuclein as a potential target for drug design or new clinical treatment.
