  Novel 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate ( 6:2 Cl-PFESA) and legacy PFASs , such as perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS) , have been used to replace perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) , a known persistent organic pollutant. Thus , it is critical to understand these PFOS alternatives regarding their sources and concentrations in the natural environment. In this study , 41 surface water samples as well as edible aquatic organisms were collected from Baiyangdian Lake , the largest freshwater lake in Hebei Province , China. Perfluorooctanoate acid ( PFOA) and PFHxS were the predominant PFASs detected in the surface water , reaching concentrations of 8397.23 ng/L and 1478.03 ng/L , respectively , with PFHxS accounting for the greatest proportion ( âˆ¼ 80.00 %) in most water samples. PFHxS ( mean: 87.53 ng/g) and PFOS ( mean: 35.94 ng/g) were also the most prevalent compounds detected in aquatic organisms. Estimated daily intake ( EDI) values of PFOS ( 16.56 ng/kg bw/d) and PFHxS ( 16.11 ng/kg bw/d) via aquatic food and drinking water were the highest among PFASs , indicating potential exposure risks to residents. In addition , fish product consumption was the important exposure pathway for residents to PFOA , PFHxS , PFOS , and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate ( 6:2 Cl-PFESA). This study reports on the highest PFHxS levels ever recorded in surface water , suggesting that further quantification of PFHxS in human serum and assessment of its health risks to local residents are warranted and critical.
