  Ischemic mitral regurgitation ( IMR) is associated with increased mortality and recurrent congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> following coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG) surgery. While mitral surgery should be undertaken for severe MR during CABG , the treatment of moderate IMR remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the outcomes of CABG alone and combine with mitral valve repair ( MVr) in moderate IMR. A literature search was conducted by Pubmed , Ovid , and Embase , which included 643 articles. Eleven studies ( seven observational studies and four randomized controlled trials) with a total of 1406 patients were included ( CABG alone = 864 and CABG plus MVr = 542). There was no difference in operative mortality ( odds ratio 1.56 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.92-2.71) or long-term survival at 1 or 5 years ( hazard ratio 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.71-1.35 , P = 0.49) between the two groups , and little evidence of heterogeneity was found in the studies ( I Our results show that in the presence of moderate IMR , adding MVr to revascularization reduces MR grade on follow-up echocardiography and promotes ventricular remodeling , with no improvement in long-term survival or functional class.
