  Handwashing with soap at key times is an effective means of reducing pathogen transmission. In a low-income community in urban Dhaka , we piloted and evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of a shared handwashing intervention. This included promotion by community health promoters of a homemade solution of detergent powder mixed with water and stored in a 1.5-L reclaimed mineral water bottle. Community health promoters encouraged sharing of the recurrent detergent cost among compound members. Of 152 participating compounds , fieldworkers randomly selected 60 for qualitative assessment. Fieldworkers conducted 30 in-depth interviews and five focus group discussions among purposively selected compound members. The reclaimed bottles served as an easily accessible dispenser for the soapy water , which could feasibly be retained next to the toilet and kitchen areas for communal use. Bottles functioned as a positive reminder for handwashing at recommended key times. Most compounds ( 45/60 , 75 %) shared a common soapy water system and its associated costs. There was reluctance to prepare soapy water for shared use in the remaining 25 %. Soapy water was an acceptable hand cleaning agent , with the bottle as a feasible dispenser. It was simple in design , cost-effective , replicable , popular with intervention recipient , and neighboring nonrecipients , and commonly shared among nonrelated households. The need to share expenses and product preparation served as a barrier. Developing a sustainable maintenance system , therefore , is critical to ensuring the public health benefits of handwashing with soap.
