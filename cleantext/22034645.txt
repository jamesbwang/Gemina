  The goal of this review is to evaluate recent research related to the effects of plant-based diets on sleep patterns. We discuss plausible mechanisms for the link between plant-based diets and sleep , and provide suggestions for future research in this area. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality have been shown to negatively affect individual dietary habits , through enhanced appetite<symptom> , increased overall caloric intake , as well as lower diet quality. Emerging data also indicate a novel bi-directional association by which dietary choices may also influence sleep duration and quality , but little is known about dietary patterns and their influence on sleep. Epidemiological studies report associations between Mediterranean diet eating patterns and sleep quality , suggesting a benefit of plant-rich diet consumption on sleep. The high isoflavone and tryptophan content of these diets may be a mechanism by which plant foods may enhance sleep quality. Plant-based diets may provide additional benefits to health via their potential effects on sleep quality. Research is needed to establish a causal relation between a plant-rich dietary pattern and sleep health.
