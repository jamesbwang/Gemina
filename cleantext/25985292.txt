  Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases are the most common neurodegenerative diseases. They are characterized by protein aggregates and so can be considered as prion-like disease. The major components of these deposits are amyloid peptide and tau for Alzheimer 's disease , α-synuclein and synphilin-1 for Parkinson 's disease. Drugs currently proposed to treat these pathologies do not prevent neurodegenerative processes and are mainly symptomatic therapies. Molecules inducing inhibition of aggregation or disaggregation of these proteins could have beneficial effects , especially if they have other beneficial effects for these diseases. Thus , several natural polyphenols , which have antioxidative , anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties , have been largely studied , for their effects on protein aggregates found in these diseases , notably in vitro. In this article , we propose to review the significant papers concerning the role of polyphenols on aggregation and disaggregation of amyloid peptide , tau , α-synuclein , synphilin-1 , suggesting that these compounds could be useful in the treatments in Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases.
