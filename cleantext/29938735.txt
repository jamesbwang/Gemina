  Tailoring of phase transition temperatures of columnar liquid crystals by side chain variation is often associated with an undesired change in the mesophase type and/or geometry. To overcome this problem phenoxy-terminated side chains rather than alkyl side chains were grafted onto triphenylbenzenes , which resulted in reduced clearing points , while melting points were little affected. More importantly , helical columnar self-assembly was not compromised.
