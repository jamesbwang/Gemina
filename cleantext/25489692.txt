  The oncological effectiveness of preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer is unclear. We report a case of pathological complete response in a patient with locally advanced ascending colon cancer after preoperative radiotherapy following failure of chemotherapy. A 65-year-old Japanese woman presented with malaise<symptom> and hematochezia. A computed tomography ( CT) revealed a tumor in the ascending colon which seemed to infiltrate the adjacent structures. She was diagnosed with locally advanced ascending colon cancer stages T4b , N2a , M0 , and IIIC. We selected modified FOLFOX6 with panitumumab as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However , we discontinued the chemotherapy after the 8th cycle because of disease progression and severe adverse effects. The patient then underwent radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions , resulting in significant tumor size reduction. One month after the radiotherapy , we performed a right hemicolectomy with multivisceral resection without complications. Histopathologically , we found no residual cancer cells in the resected specimen. The patient remains alive and has not required additional therapies for 24 months , as there are no signs of recurrence. The present case suggests that preoperative radiotherapy might be an effective treatment options for locally advanced colon cancer.
