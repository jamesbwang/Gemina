  Globally , approximately a billion patients are estimated to suffer from neurological disorders. Although there are many therapeutic candidates for the central nervous system , treatment of brain disorders is restricted by the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) , which is a highly selective membrane that protects the brain from exogenous substances. This study was undertaken to develop a novel strategy to overcome the BBB and improve the efficiency of drug delivery to the brain by mechanical load increase using hypergravity. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were exposed three times to 20 min hypergravity ( 10g) , with a 20-min rest period between each exposure. The applied hypergravity reversibly decreased the cellular metabolic activity and increased the permeation rate of fluorescein sodium salt , fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran ( FD-4) , and fluorescein-labeled jacalin. Following the exposure to hypergravity , we also observed structural changes of the cytoskeleton and tight junctions , and an alteration in the expression levels of related genes. These results indicate that increased mechanical load due to the applied hypergravity affects the cytoskeletal arrangement and tight junctions , thereby weakening the cell barrier function and enhancing the permeability of the paracellular pathway. Thus , the mechanical load increase by hypergravity has the potential of being used as a novel strategy to overcome the BBB for brain drug delivery.
