  To classify the dietary patterns in preschoolers and explore the correlation between dietary patterns and executive functions. Between April 2014 and June 2015 , 12363 preschoolers were selected from 91 kindergartens of Ma ` anshan City. The classification of dietary patterns and executive functions by Brief-P were evaluated. Unconditional binary logistics regression model was used to analyze the effects of different dietary patterns and executive functions in preschool chidlren. The higher the parents ' education level , the lower the executive functions scores , the difference was statistically significant in preschoolers ( P < 0. 05). The less intake of `` processed model '' , `` drinks model `` and `` snacks model '' , the more `` vegetarian model `` and `` health model `` intake , executive functions score was lower , and the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis showed that dietary patterns of `` processed model '' ( OR = 1. 44 , 95 % CI 1. 20-1. 72) , `` drinks model '' ( OR = 1. 22 , 95 % CI 1. 03-1. 46) and `` snacks model '' ( OR = 1. 28 , 95 % CI 1. 08-1. 52) were risk factors of cognitive functions , and the dietary patterns of `` vegetarian model '' ( OR = 0. 80 , 95 % CI 0. 67-0. 95) and `` health model '' ( OR = 0. 84 , 95 % CI 0. 71-0. 98) were protective factors. The present study suggests that cognitive functions might be closely related with dietary pattern. The more `` vegetarian model `` and `` health model `` intake , the better cognitive functions developed in preschool children.
