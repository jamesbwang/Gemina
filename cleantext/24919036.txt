  Partial splenectomy ( PS) is a surgical option for splenic mass , in order to reduce postoperative complications and preserve the splenic function. Despite this , data in literature is still scarce. The present study aimed to reveal our recent experience and provide a comprehensive overview of the feasibility and complications related to various surgical approaches. Data of patients who underwent PS , between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Literature was searched for studies reporting all types of PS in adult or adolescent patients. Five PS were performed in our department: two ( 40 %) by laparoscopy and three ( 60 %) by laparotomy. Two ( 40 %) postoperative complications were detected , and in one of them , total splenectomy ( TS) by laparotomy was finally required. There were no deaths or complications at last follow-up. Twenty studies including 213 patients were identified in the literature search. The rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery was 3 % ( range , 5-50 %) and in 3 % of cases ( range , 7-10 %) PS was converted into total TS and the overall morbidity rate was 8 % ( range , 5-25 %). In comparison to laparotomy , the conversion rate of laparoscopic approach to TS was 3.5 % ( vs. 1.4 %) and a morbidity rate of 9.8 % ( vs. 4.3 %). The present review shows that PS is a viable procedure in selected cases. The mini-invasive approach seemed to be feasible despite the presence of higher rate of complications than the open technique. In future , further studies on this topic are needed by involving more patients. Furthermore , it is proposed that the development of robotic surgery could make this approach the new gold-standard technique for spleen-preserving surgery.
