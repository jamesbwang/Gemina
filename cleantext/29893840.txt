  Despite the huge progress made in the both understanding the mechanisms and the management of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) this arrhythmia still represents an important health and social burden. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is increasing in frequency and is a major cause of death , stroke , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , cognitive decline , and hospitalizations. New data have emerged emphasizing the multidisciplinary approach to better management of this common arrhythmia. Despite the availability of AF management guidelines , practice among European centres may differ from the current guideline recommendations. The scope of the current European Heart<symptom> Rhythm Association ( EHRA) survey is to evaluate the extent of the disparities between clinical practice and the 2016 AF European Society of Cardiology ( ESC) guidelines. Our survey examined important topics such as screening for AF , initial therapy , rhythm strategy , and stroke and bleeding risk assessment. In general , there was a high adherence to the new ESC AF guidelines among European cardiologists.
