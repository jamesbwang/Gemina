  Angiomyxomas are rare soft tissue neoplasms rich in myxoid matrix and blood vessels that typically present as nodules<symptom> on the trunk , head , and limbs in adults. They are classified as either cutaneous or aggressive based on histological findings and extent of local growth. There are less than 150 reported cases in the literature. In this case report we describe the first paratesticular case of a cutaneous angiomyxoma in a pediatric patient , who presented with a transilluminating paratesticular mass consistent with a hydrocele , but showed solid and vascular features on ultrasound.
