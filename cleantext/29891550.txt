  Huntington 's disease ( HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein ( Htt). Transcriptional dysregulation is an early event in the course of HD progression and is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis , but how mutant Htt causes transcriptional alterations and subsequent cell death in neurons is not well understood. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that expression of a mutant Htt fragment in primary cortical neurons leads to robust gene expression changes before neuronal death. Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 , which is essential for embryogenesis and is normally expressed at low levels in mature neurons , was substantially up-regulated in mutant Htt-expressing neurons in culture and in the brains of HD mouse models. Knockdown of Twist1 by RNAi in mutant Htt-expressing primary cortical neurons reversed the altered expression of a subset of genes involved in neuronal function and , importantly , abrogated neurotoxicity.
