  To evaluate the outcomes of surgical management for external snapping hip in terms of: ( 1) recurrence; ( 2) complications; and ( 3) return to pre-injury activities. A thorough review of 4 electronic databases- EMBASE , CINAHL Plus , PubMed , and Scopus was performed to find all relevant studies for this review that were published between January 2000 and January 2017 that addressed surgical treatment for external snapping hip. The following reports were excluded: ( 1) non-English manuscripts; ( 2) n â©½ 5; ( 3) clinical reviews; ( 4) surgical technique notes; ( 5) studies only analysing diagnosis; and ( 6) nonoperative management studies. After cross-referencing , a total of 7 reports were included. Each of these studies was analysed for the incidence of recurrence , revision surgery , complications , and return to pre-injury activity level. There was a recurrence rate of 7 % ( n = 8 of 113 hips) with only 1 requiring revision surgery ( 1 %). The cumulative complication rate was 9 % ( n = 10 of 113) with all complications being residual weakness<symptom>. Additionally , we found 98 % ( n = 58 of 59) of the patients returned to their pre-injury level of activity. We found operative treatment for external snapping hip to be both safe and efficacious for returning patients to their pre-injury activities. When recurrence does occur , it often is painless and does not require revision surgery. Future studies should be larger and evaluate different surgical techniques to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment for external snapping hip.
