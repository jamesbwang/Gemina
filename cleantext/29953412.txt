  Background We evaluated the inter-rater agreement between self-assessed Tanner staging and clinical examination and the intra-individual agreement of self-assessed information on various puberty markers in late adolescents from the longitudinal nationwide Puberty Cohort , a sub-cohort of the Danish National Birth Cohort ( DNBC). Methods We invited 715 children from the ongoing Puberty Cohort between June 2016 and January 2017. In total , 366 children ( 51 %) returned an add-on questionnaire identical to the questionnaire used to collect information on puberty markers , including Tanner staging , in the Puberty Cohort. Of these , 197 ( 54 %) also participated in a clinical examination with Tanner staging. We used percentage agreement and weighted kappa statistics to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-individual agreement. Results Due to late entry , more than 75 % of children were Tanner stage 4 or above at clinical examination. In girls , the inter-rater agreement for pubic hair and breast staging was 54 % and 52 % , respectively , yielding weighted kappas of fair strength. In boys , pubic hair and genital staging agreed in 55 % and 33 % , respectively , corresponding to weighted kappas of fair to moderate strength. Boys tended to underestimate genitalia staging consistently. The intra-individual agreement on Tanner staging was 75-77 % in girls and 69 % in boys , whereas the intra-individual agreement on axillary hair and acne was above 92 %. Conclusions Self-assessment of late stages of pubertal development may be misclassified , leading to random errors in studies of puberty timing. However , self-assessment continues to serve as an important time- and cost-saving tool in large prospective puberty cohorts.
