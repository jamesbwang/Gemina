  Studies of psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) typically encompass short follow-up periods , leading to a dearth of information on the long-term course of symptoms after treatment. We summarize existing long-term follow-up studies and highlight the issues making such research difficult. In this context , we report on a 2-year follow-up on a randomized treatment study comparing dialogical exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy for adults with PTSD after type I trauma. Many of the problems connected to long-term follow-up also pertained to this study. Attrition was high , and the recruited sample was not representative of the study completers. Gains made during therapy were mostly stable , with no significant differences between interventions. At least for an originally successful subset of patients , the gains made during both treatments in our study tended to stay stable 2 years after the end of treatment.
