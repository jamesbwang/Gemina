  Primary cilia are polarized organelles that allow detection of extracellular signals such as Hedgehog ( Hh). How the cytoskeleton supporting the cilium generates and maintains a structure that finely tunes cellular response remains unclear. Here , we find that regulation of actin polymerization controls primary cilia and Hh signaling. Disrupting actin polymerization , or knockdown of N-WASp/Arp3 , increases ciliation frequency , axoneme length , and Hh signaling. Cdc42 , a potent actin regulator , recruits both atypical protein pinase C iota/lambda ( aPKC) and Missing-in-Metastasis ( MIM) to the basal body<symptom> to maintain actin polymerization and restrict axoneme length. Transcriptome analysis implicates the Src pathway as a major aPKC effector. aPKC promotes whereas MIM antagonizes Src activity to maintain proper levels of primary cilia , actin polymerization , and Hh signaling. Hh pathway activation requires Smoothened- , Gli- , and Gli1-specific activation by aPKC. Surprisingly , longer axonemes can amplify Hh signaling , except when aPKC is disrupted , reinforcing the importance of the Cdc42-aPKC-Gli axis in actin-dependent regulation of primary cilia signaling.
