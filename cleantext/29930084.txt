  The fibrinolysis proteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA , also known as PLAT) triggers cell signaling and regulates cell physiology. In PC12 cells , Schwann cells and macrophages , the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDA-R) mediates tPA signaling. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI1 , also known as SERPINE1) is a rapidly acting inhibitor of tPA enzyme activity. Although tPA-initiated cell signaling is not dependent on its enzyme active site , we show that tPA signaling is neutralized by PAI1. In PC12 cells , PAI1 blocked the ERK1/2 activation mediated by tPA as well as neurite outgrowth. In Schwann cells , PAI1 blocked tPA-mediated ERK1/2 activation and cell migration. In macrophages , PAI1 blocked the ability of tPA to inhibit IκBα phosphorylation and cytokine expression. The cell signaling activity of tPA-PAI1 complex was rescued when the complex was formed with PAI1R
