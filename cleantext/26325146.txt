  As a special class of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries , pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/sulfur ( pPAN/S) can completely solve the polysulfide dissolution problem and deliver reliable performance. However , the applicable S contents of pPAN/S are usually lower than 50 weight % ( wt %) , and their capacity utilizations are not sufficient , both of which greatly limit their energy densities for commercial applications. We report a pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/selenium disulfide ( pPAN/SeS
