  The purpose of this article is to provide an updated review exploring the recent developments in the field of self-guided interventions and describe the state of knowledge. This article builds on a previous systematic review on self-guided interventions , finding that the recent literature demonstrates that evidence for these interventions is mixed. The field is limited by descriptions of these interventions , and it is not possible to ascertain what aspects of interventions are more successful. Development of a reporting framework whereby self-guided interventions could be clearly presented , would be a substantial contribution to understanding the evidence for these studies. Recent findings also support the need to understand patient adherence and engagement , which could be achieved within a reporting framework. Additionally , ensuring patient safety is paramount and all studies should develop strategies to ensure patients can engage with these studies in a way that allows them to access more help and support if required. Self-guided interventions have potential for implementation and further translation because of being cost-effective and requiring few resources; and a reporting framework has the capacity to lead to clearer definitions and descriptions; and significantly improve the quality of evidence for these studies.
