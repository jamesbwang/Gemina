  The in vivo lesion<symptom> morphologies and plaque components of coronary chronic total occlusion ( CTO) lesions<symptom> remain unclear.Methods and Results: We investigated 57 consecutive CTO lesions<symptom> in 57 patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention with intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) and coronary angioscopy ( CAS) examination. All CTO lesions<symptom> were classified according to the proximal angiographic lumen pattern; tapered-type ( T-CTO) and abrupt-type ( A-CTO). The differences in the intracoronary images of these lesion<symptom> types were evaluated according to the location within the CTO segment. A total of 35 lesions<symptom> ( 61.4 %) were T-CTO. T-CTO lesions<symptom> had higher frequencies of red thrombi ( proximal 71.4 %; middle 74.3 %; distal 31.4 %; P < 0.001) and bright-yellow plaques ( yellow-grade 2-3) ( 48.6 %; 74.3 %; 2.9 %; P < 0.001) at the proximal or middle than at the distal subsegment; A-CTO lesions<symptom> showed no significant differences among the 3 sub-segments. At the middle subsegment , T-CTO lesions<symptom> showed higher frequencies of positive remodeling ( 51.4 % vs. 18.2 % , P = 0.01) and bright-yellow plaques ( 74.3 % vs. 13.6 % , P < 0.001) compared with A-CTO lesions<symptom>. Multivariate analysis identified bright-yellow plaque as an independent predictor ( odds ratio , 7.25; 95 % confidence interval , 1.25-42.04; P = 0.03) of the occurrence of periprocedural myocardial necrosis<symptom>. The combination of IVUS and CAS analysis may be useful for identifying lesion<symptom> morphology and plaque components , which may help clarify the pathogenetic mechanism of CTO
