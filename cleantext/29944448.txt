  Exogenous application of salicylic acid may improve tolerance to salinity. To investigate whether exogenous salicylic acid application had similar protective effects when applied as a priming agent or concomitantly with NaCl , tomato seedlings primed or not with 10 µM salicylic acid were further treated with 125 mM NaCl , 10 µM salicylic acid or combined treatments. Both priming and concomitant application of salicylic acid increased plant growth of salt-stressed plants but their positive impact was not additive. The endogenous salicylic acid concentration increased in the leaves after concomitant application but not in response to priming , suggesting that salicylic acid accumulated during priming was metabolized subsequently. Priming increased Na
