  Temephos is considered the gold standard by the Ministry of Health for controlling the larvae of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The present study evaluated the effects of Temephos larvicide on the reproductive performance , embryo-fetal development and DNA integrity of Swiss mice. This study used 30 pregnant female mice: 10 were controls treated with drinking water at a dosage of 0.1 mL/10 g ( body<symptom> weight- b.w. , administered orally- a.o.) , and 20 were treated with Temephos at doses of 0.0043 mg/kg and 0.043 mg/kg ( b.w. , a.o.) during the gestational period. Statistical analysis showed that Temephos did not alter the biometric or reproductive parameters. Comparing the weight of the fetus to the stage of pregnancy demonstrated that the 0.0043 mg/kg dosage increased the size of the fetuses. No external malformations were detected. However , the 0.043 mg/kg dosage induced changes in the sternum , with the main change being the center of the sternum , xiphoid processes and absence of the manubrium. The other skeletal and visceral alterations did not differ from the control group and are considered variants of normality. The analysis of head measurements showed an increase in the anterior/posterior measurements of the glabella , the external occipital protuberance and the biauricular plane. The circumference and area of the head did not present significant differences. The micronucleus test showed only a 0.043 mg/kg increase in 48 h. Thus , it is considered that Temephos has a low teratogenic and genotoxic risk.
