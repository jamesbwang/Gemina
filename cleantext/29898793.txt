  Recent treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia ( CBT-I) have demonstrated effects on both sleep problems and depression<symptom> Two previous studies have indicated that the beneficial effect from CBT-I on depression<symptom> may come through improved sleep , although insomnia severity during treatment had not previously been investigated as a mediator. Our aim was to investigate if insomnia severity during treatment mediated between CBT-I and depression<symptom> severity after treatment , in a sample with co-morbid insomnia and depressive symptomology. We also examined whether depressive severity during treatment mediated between CBT-I and insomnia after treatment. The participants were recruited from advertisements and fulfilled criteria for insomnia diagnosis , and had depressive symptomatology ( Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory-second edition: BDI-II > 13). Two-thirds of the participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The participants received four biweekly group sessions of CBT-I or relaxation training ( active control). Insomnia severity ( Insomnia Severity Index) and depressive severity ( BDI-II) were measured at baseline , mid-treatment , post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. The mid-treatment measures were used as mediators. Mediational analyses demonstrated a significant reciprocal relationship between insomnia severity and depressive severity throughout CBT-I , although mid-treatment insomnia had a stronger effect on depression<symptom> than mid-treatment depression<symptom> had on insomnia. The results were similar for both post-treatment and follow-up. Some improvement in depressive severity after CBT-I is explained by improved sleep. The findings emphasize the importance of making comorbid insomnia a treatment focus in its own right.
