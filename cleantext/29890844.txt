  Background Elastography has been introduced as an additional diagnostic tool to ultrasonography ( US) which helps clinicians decide whether or not to perform biopsy on US-detected lesions<symptom>. Purpose To evaluate the role of strain elastography in downgrading Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ( BI-RADS) category 4a breast lesions<symptom> according to personal risk factors for breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Material and Methods Strain elastography features of a total of 255 asymptomatic category 4a lesions<symptom> were classified as soft and not soft ( intermediate and hard). Malignancy was confirmed by surgery or biopsy , and benignity was confirmed by surgery or biopsy with no change on US for at least six months. Malignancy rates of lesions<symptom> with soft and not soft elastography were calculated according to the presence of risk factors. Results Of 255 lesions<symptom> , 25 ( 9.8 %) were malignant and 230 ( 90.2 %) were benign. Of 195 lesions<symptom> in average-risk women , the malignancy rate of lesions<symptom> with soft elastography was 1.5 % ( 1/68) , which was significantly lower than the 14.2 % ( 18/127) of lesions<symptom> with not soft elastography ( P = 0.004). Of 60 lesions<symptom> in increased-risk women , the malignancy rate of lesions<symptom> with soft elastography was 15.0 % ( 3/20) , which was not significantly different from the 7.5 % ( 3/40) of lesions<symptom> with not soft elastography ( P = 0.390). Conclusion In average-risk women , category 4a lesions<symptom> with soft elastography could be followed up with US because of a low malignancy rate of 1.5 %.
