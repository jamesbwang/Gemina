  Peripheral venous access is the most common invasive procedure performed on patients in the UK and is traditionally the responsibility of nursing staff. In an emergency , intravenous therapy can be lifesaving. Approximately 11 % of adults have difficult venous access and are often subjected to repeated failed attempts , resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Eventually , rescue methods are used by a doctor , but this increases demand on their time and the workflow of emergency departments. This article explores whether training nurses to obtain venous access using ultrasound would have a positive effect on doctors ' workload and benefit adult patients with difficult veins. Research indicates that nurses can successfully use ultrasound to reduce the number of attempts , time to access and patient discomfort , and can prevent the insertion of unnecessary central lines. Ultrasound training programmes for nurses demonstrate benefits for patients and clinicians.
