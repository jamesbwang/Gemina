  A diver presented with total loss of vision in the left eye and right hemiparesis<symptom> following a routine no-stop scuba dive to 20 metres ' depth. A diagnosis of decompression illness ( DCI) with acute ophthalmic artery air embolism and left carotid artery insult causing acute anterior circulatory ischaemia was made. He underwent seven hyperbaric treatments leading to a full recovery. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed an underlying left anterior cerebral artery A1 segment hypoplasia. Making a prompt diagnosis and early hyperbaric oxygen treatment are crucial to halt further tissue damage from ischaemia in central nervous system DCI. In this case , the finding of a left A1 anterior cerebral artery segment hypoplasia variant may have increased the severity of DCI due to deficient collateral circulation.
