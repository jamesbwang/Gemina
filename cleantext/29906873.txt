  Inhomogeneous drift-wave turbulence can be modeled as an effective plasma where drift waves act as quantumlike particles and the zonal-flow velocity serves as a collective field through which they interact. This effective plasma can be described by a Wigner-Moyal equation ( WME) , which generalizes the quasilinear wave-kinetic equation ( WKE) to the full-wave regime , i.e. , resolves the wavelength scale. Unlike waves governed by manifestly quantumlike equations , whose WMEs can be borrowed from quantum mechanics and are commonly known , drift waves have Hamiltonians very different from those of conventional quantum particles. This causes unusual phase-space dynamics that is typically not captured by the WKE. We demonstrate how to correctly model this dynamics with the WME instead. Specifically , we report full-wave phase-space simulations of the zonal-flow formation ( zonostrophic instability) , deterioration ( tertiary instability) , and the so-called predator-prey oscillations. We also show how the WME facilitates analysis of these phenomena , namely , ( i) we show that full-wave effects critically affect the zonostrophic instability , particularly its nonlinear stage and saturation; ( ii) we derive the tertiary-instability growth rate; and ( iii) we demonstrate that , with full-wave effects retained , the predator-prey oscillations do not require zonal-flow collisional damping , contrary to previous studies. We also show how the famous Rayleigh-Kuo criterion , which has been missing in wave-kinetic theories of drift-wave turbulence , emerges from the WME.
