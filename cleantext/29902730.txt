  Throughout their lifetimes , all cells experience force. These forces are sensed by cell surface adhesion receptors , such as the cadherins and integrins. Much attention has focused on identifying how these adhesion receptors transmit force. In contrast , less is known regarding how these force-activated pathways are integrated with other cellular processes. In this review , we describe how cadherins and integrins transmit force , and discuss how these adhesion receptors are linked to cell metabolism. We focus on understanding this connection by highlighting how the cadherins and integrins interact with a master regulator of energy homeostasis , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) and its upstream activator , Liver Kinase B1 ( LKB1). We consider why there is a need for force transmission to be coupled to metabolism and highlight the major unanswered questions in the field.
