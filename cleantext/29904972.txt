  Evoked electrical muscle activity suppresses the transcription of mRNAs for acetylcholine receptors in extrajunctional myonuclei. Muscle denervation or disuse releases such inhibition and extrajunctional receptors appear. However , in soleus muscles paralysed with nerve-applied tetrodotoxin , a restricted perijunctional region has been described where myonuclei remain inhibited , a finding attributed to nerve-derived trophic factor ( s). Here , we reinvestigate extrajunctional acetylcholine receptor expression in soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles up to 90 days after denervation or up to 20 days of disuse , to clarify the role of trophic factors , if any. The perijunctional region of soleus muscles strongly expressed acetylcholine receptors during the first 2-3 weeks of denervation. After 2-3 months , this expression had disappeared. No perijunctional expression was seen after paralysis by tetrodotoxin or botulinum<pathogen> toxin A. In contrast , the extensor digitorum longus never displayed suppressed perijunctional acetylcholine receptor expression after any treatment , suggesting that it is an intrinsic property of soleus muscles. Soleus denervation only transiently removed the suppression , and its presence in long-term denervated soleus muscles contradicts any contribution from nerve-derived trophic factor ( s). In conclusion , our results confirm that evoked electrical activity is the physiological factor controlling the expression of acetylcholine receptors in the entire extrajunctional membrane of skeletal muscles.
