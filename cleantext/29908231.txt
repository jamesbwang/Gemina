  More than half of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation at our institution are ethnic or racial minorities , making the search for matched unrelated donors more challenging. Since the introduction of haploidentical bone<disease> marrow transplant ( haplo-BMT) into our pediatric BMT program in 2015 , 69.2 % of recipients have been minorities. Herein , we describe our experience with the first 13 pediatric and young adult patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone T cell-replete haplo-BMT after myeloablative conditioning ( MAC) at our institution. We have previously documented that in experimental haplo-BMT , post-transplant bendamustine ( PT-BEN) is at least as effective as post-transplant cyclophosphamide ( PT-CY) against graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) and elicits superior graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL) effects. We report on , for the first time in humans , 4 patients treated with PT-CY and PT-BEN after haplo-BMT as part of our ongoing institutional phase I/II study ( NCT02996773). The remaining 9 patients reviewed in this report received PT-CY. Our findings indicate that MAC haplo-BMT is well tolerated by children and young adults with advanced hematologic malignancies with no observed nonrelapse mortality or grades III to IV GVHD. All patients who underwent haplo-BMT remain alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 15.6 months ( range , 1.5 to 31.2). Preliminary findings from our ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that partial substitution of PT-BEN for PT-CY is feasible and safe after haplo-BMT as an immune modulatory strategy to alleviate GVHD and potentially more effectively preserve GVL.
