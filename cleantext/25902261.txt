  We identified patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial ( NTM) disease in the US Veterans Health Administration ( VHA) , examined the distribution of diseases by NTM species , and explored the association between NTM disease and the frequency of clinic visits and mortality. We combined mycobacterial isolate ( from natural language processing) with ICD-9-CM diagnoses from VHA data between 2008 and 2012 and then applied modified ATS/IDSA guidelines for NTM diagnosis. We performed validation against a reference standard of chart review. Incidence rates were calculated. Two nested case-control studies ( matched by age and location) were used to measure the association between NTM disease and each of 1) the frequency of outpatient clinic visits and 2) mortality , both adjusted by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) , other structural lung diseases , and immunomodulatory factors. NTM cases were identified with a sensitivity of 94 % , a specificity of > 99 %. The incidence of NTM was 12.6/ 100k patient-years. COPD was present in 68 % of pulmonary NTM. NTM incidence was highest in the southeastern US. Extra-pulmonary NTM rates increased during the study period. The incidence rate ratio of clinic visits in the first year after diagnosis was 1.3 ( 95 % CI 1.34-1.35). NTM patients had a hazard ratio of mortality of 1.4 ( 95 % CI 1.1-1.9) in the 6 months after NTM identification compared to controls and 1.99 ( 95 % CI 1.8-2.3) thereafter. In VHA , pulmonary NTM disease is commonly associated with COPD , with the highest rates in the southeastern US. After adjustment , NTM patients had more clinic visits and greater mortality compared to matched patients.
