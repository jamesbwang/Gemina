  A 14-year-old boy was diagnosed with an anomalous left coronary artery coursing between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery and associated with a single coronary ostium. Owing to the high risk of sudden cardiac death , surgery was performed although he was asymptomatic with no sign of myocardial ischemia. Reimplantation of an anomalous left coronary artery is generally considered difficult because an aortic cuff is unavailable for coronary anastomosis; however , we accomplished a successful direct reimplantation in this patient. This procedure offers another choice in the surgical treatment of anomalous left coronary artery.
