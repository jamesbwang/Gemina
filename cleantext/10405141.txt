  The close connection between neuronal activity and glucose consumption accounts for the clinical value of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ( FDG) imaging in neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless , brain metabolic response to starvation ( STS) might hamper the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT when the cognitive impairment results in a severe food deprivation. Thirty six-week-old BALB/c female mice were divided into two groups: `` control '' group ( n = 15) were kept under standard conditions and exposed to fasting for 6 h before the study; the remaining `` STS '' mice were submitted to 48 h STS ( absence of food and free access to water) before imaging. In each group , nine mice were submitted to dynamic micro-PET imaging to estimate brain and skeletal muscle glucose consumption ( C- and SM-MRGlu *) by Patlak approach , while six mice were sacrificed for ex vivo determination of the lumped constant , defined as the ratio between CMRGlu * and glucose consumption measured by glucose removal from the incubation medium ( n = 3) or biochemical analyses ( n = 3) , respectively. CMRGlu * was lower in starved than in control mice ( 46.1 ± 23.3 vs 119.5 ± 40.2 nmol × min STS markedly decreases brain glucose consumption without altering measured FDG SUV in mouse experimental models. This apparent paradox does not reflect any change in lumped constant. Rather , it might be explained by the metabolic response of the whole body: the decrease in FDG sequestration by the skeletal muscle is as profound as to prolong tracer persistence in the bloodstream and thus its availability for brain uptake.
