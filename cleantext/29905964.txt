  In situ drug release concurrent with radiation therapy has been proposed to enhance the therapeutic ratio of permanent prostate brachytherapy. Both brachytherapy sources and brachytherapy spacers have been proposed as potential eluters to release compounds , such as nanoparticles or chemotherapeutic agents. The relative effectiveness of the approaches has not been compared yet. This work models the physical dose enhancement of implantable eluters in conjunction with brachytherapy to determine which delivery mechanism provides greatest opportunity to enhance the therapeutic ratio. The combined effect of implanted eluters and radioactive sources were modeled in a manner that allowed the comparison of the relative effectiveness of different types of implantable eluters over a range of parameters. Prostate geometry , source , and spacer positions were extracted from treatment plans used for The enhanced effect of implanted eluters was calculated for prostate volumes from 14 to 45 cm Eluting brachytherapy spacers offer an opportunity to increase EUD during the routine brachytherapy process. Incorporating additional needle placements permits compound eluting spacer placement independent of source placement and thereby allowing a further increase in the therapeutic ratio. Additional work is needed to understand the in vivo spatial distribution of compound around eluters , and to incorporate time dependence of both compound release and radiation dose.
