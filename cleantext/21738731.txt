  Over the last decade , the number of viral genome sequences deposited in available databases has grown exponentially. However , sequencing methodology vary widely and many published works have relied on viral enrichment by viral culture or nucleic acid amplification with specific primers rather than through unbiased techniques such as metagenomics. The genome of RNA viruses is highly variable and these enrichment methodologies may be difficult to achieve or may bias the results. In order to obtain genomic sequences of human<pathogen> respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HRSV<pathogen>) from positive nasopharyngeal aspirates diverse methodologies were evaluated and compared. A total of 29 nearly complete and complete viral genomes were obtained. The best performance was achieved with a DNase I treatment to the RNA directly extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA) , sequence-independent single-primer amplification ( SISPA) and library preparation performed with Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit with manual normalization. An average of 633,789 and 1,674,845 filtered reads per library were obtained with MiSeq and NextSeq 500 platforms , respectively. The higher output of NextSeq 500 was accompanied by the increasing of duplicated reads percentage generated during SISPA ( from an average of 1.5 % duplicated viral reads in MiSeq to an average of 74 % in NextSeq 500). HRSV<pathogen> genome recovery was not affected by the presence or absence of duplicated reads but the computational demand during the analysis was increased. Considering that only samples with viral load â‰¥ E +06 copies/ml NPA were tested , no correlation between sample viral loads and number of total filtered reads was observed , nor with the mapped viral reads. The HRSV<pathogen> genomes showed a mean coverage of 98.46 % with the best methodology. In addition , genomes of human<pathogen> metapneumovirus<pathogen> ( HMPV) , human rhinovirus<pathogen> ( HRV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1-3 ( HPIV1-3) were also obtained with the selected optimal methodology.
