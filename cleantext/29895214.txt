  Afatinib , a second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor , is effective as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). We report 2 cases of EGFR-mutated locally advanced NSCLC treated in neoadjuvant setting with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor at University of Florence/Careggi Hospital. In both cases , afatinib was used for up to 3 months , until 1 week before surgery. Both patients achieved significant reduction ( downstaging) of the pulmonary mass and lymphadenopathies and after surgery , it was decided for both cases to restore afatinib treatment up to a further 4 months. Both patients experienced local and distant disease relapses after 9 and 10 months , respectively , and then we restored the afatinib treatment.
