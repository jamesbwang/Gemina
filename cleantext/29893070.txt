  Optical technologies may be applied to multiple facets of spinal surgery from diagnostics to intraoperative image guidance to therapeutics. In diagnostics , the current standard remains cross-sectional static imaging. Optical surface scanning tools may have an important role; however , significant work is required to clearly correlate surface metrics to radiographic and clinically relevant spinal anatomy and alignment. In the realm of intraoperative image guidance , optical tracking is widely developed as the current standard of instrument tracking , however remains compromised by line-of-sight issues and more globally cumbersome registration workflows. Surface scanning registration tools are being refined to address concerns over workflow and learning curves , and allow real-time update of tissue deformation; however , the line-of-sight issues plaguing instrument tracking remain to be addressed. In therapeutics , optical applications exist in both visualization , in the form of endoscopes , and ablation , in the form of lasers. Further work is required to extend the feasibility of laser ablation to multiple tissues , including disc , bone , and tumor , in a safe and time-efficient manner. Finally , we postulate some of the short- and long-term opportunities for future growth of optical techniques in the context of spinal surgery. Particular emphasis is placed on intraoperative image guidance , the area of the authors ' primary expertise.
