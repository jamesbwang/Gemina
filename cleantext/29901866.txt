  Three helicenes based on a borylated arylisoquinoline skeleton have been prepared in their enantiopure forms and characterized with respect to their photophysical properties , including the use of chiroptical spectroscopies. The dyes show varying charge-transfer characteristics and efficient emission ( quantum yields between 0.13 and 0.30 , in toluene) , which is governed by the electron-donor substitution ( p-MeO-phenyl , p-Me
