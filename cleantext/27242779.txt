  For most pathogens , vaccination reduces the spread of the infection and total number of cases; thus , public policy usually advocates maximizing vaccination coverage. We use simple mathematical models to explore how this may be different for pathogens , such as influenza<disease> , which exhibit strain variation. Our models predict that the total number of seasonal influenza<disease> infections is minimized at an intermediate ( rather than maximal) level of vaccination , and , somewhat counter-intuitively , further increasing the level of the vaccination coverage may lead to higher number of influenza<disease> infections and be detrimental to the public interest. This arises due to the combined effects of: competition between multiple co-circulating strains; limited breadth of protection afforded by the vaccine; and short-term strain-transcending immunity following natural infection. The study highlights the need for better quantification of the components of vaccine efficacy and longevity of strain-transcending cross-immunity in order to generate nuanced recommendations for influenza<disease> vaccine coverage levels.
