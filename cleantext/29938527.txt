  Objective Abnormal joint movement is associated with osteoarthritis ( OA). Previous studies using the controlling abnormal joint movement ( CAJM) model of OA reported delayed cartilage degeneration; however , none of them focused on gait performance and the localization of matrix metalloproteinase 13 ( MMP13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1) in chondrocytes. Therefore , we aimed to investigate the effect of controlling abnormal joint movement on gait performance and the localization of MMP13 and TIMP-1 , using kinematic and histological analyses. Design Rats were assigned to 2 groups: anterior cruciate ligament transection ( ACL-T) group and CAJM group ( n = 5/group); contralateral hind<symptom> limbs of ACL-T rats were designated as intact. After 1 , 2 , and 4 weeks , step length was analyzed , and after 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks , Safranin O-Fast Green<symptom> staining and immunohistochemical staining for MMP13 and TIMP-1 were performed. Results Step length did not differ significantly between the groups. However , degeneration of articular cartilage was higher in the ACL-T group than in the intact group ( P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the CAJM group at all time points. Immunohistochemical analysis of the MMP13/TIMP -1 relationship revealed a significant increase in the expression ratio of MMP13 after 4 weeks in the ACL-T group compared to the CAJM group ( P < 0.05). Conclusions Controlling abnormal joint movement may reduce mechanical stress owing to kinematic elements of small articulation including joint<symptom> instability<symptom> and delayed cartilage degeneration , despite the lack of kinematic change in step length.
