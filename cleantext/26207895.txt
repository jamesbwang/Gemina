  There is a great variation in the prevalence of cervical HPV infection worldwide with some of the highest rates being found in African women. Early onset of sexual activity ( â‰¤ 15 age) , multiparity and sexual promiscuity have been recognized as some of the significant risk factors for HPV infection. In Nigeria , there is scarcity of data on the degree of relationship between these factors and the prevalence of HPV infection. Thus , this study was designed to determine the prevalence of genital HPV infection with its potential risk factors among women in Southwest Nigeria. Cervical swab specimen was collected from 295 consenting women including those presenting for routine cervical cancer screening , STI clinic attendees and women who attended community based outreach programmes. Viral DNA was extracted from the swab samples using commercially available DNA extraction Kit and amplified by PCR using two set of consensus primers ( PGMY09/11 and degenerate GP-E6/ E7). Fifty-five samples were positive to HPV DNA giving a prevalence of 18.6 %. Risk factors such as lack of formal education ( P-value: 0.003) , divorcee ( P-value: 0.019) , polygamy ( P-value: 0.027) , unemployment ( P-value: 0.023) , low income earnings ( P-value: 0.018) , younger age ( < 18 years) at sexual debut ( P-value: 0.039) and passive smoking ( P-value: 0.017) were significantly associated with HPV infection. High HPV prevalence and associated risk factors observed in this study shows the continuous transmission of the virus in Southwest Nigeria. Hence , enlarged monitoring including intense public awareness and cervical cancer screening is urgently needed for prevention and control strategies.
