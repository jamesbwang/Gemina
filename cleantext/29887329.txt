  The loss of the modulator role of the endothelium could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications. Transition metal compounds , such as tungsten and vanadium , have been proposed as possible agents in the treatment of diabetes by simulating the effects of insulin. The mesenteric vascular bed intervenes in vascular resistance and is a source of vasoactive compounds , such as prostanoids. The aim of this work was to study the effects of sodium tungstate and vanadyl sulphate treatments on the metabolic parameters and the release of prostanoids of the mesenteric vascular bed in an experimental model of Streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In diabetic rats , a significant increase was observed in plasma levels of glucose , triglycerides and total cholesterol. On the other hand , there was a significant reduction in the release of vasodilator prostanoids , such as prostacyclin and prostaglandin E
