  Transition metal nanoparticles ( NPs) are promising materials for use as catalysts in many processes , although they are easily oxidized under ambient conditions. In this communication , a novel synthetic method is proposed for producing zero-valent iron ( Fe) NPs by laser ablation under atmospheric conditions using the reducing properties of a formate-based ionic liquid solvent. The valence state of Fe was confirmed using X-ray absorption near edge structure ( XANES) spectroscopy. The Fe NPs adopt a face centered cubic structure after synthesis , which gradually transforms to a body centered cubic structure after one month. The method can be extended to the synthesis of other transition metal NPs that are easily oxidized.
