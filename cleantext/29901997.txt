  As the field of anion exchange membranes<symptom> ( AEMs) employs an increasing variety of cations , a critical understanding of cation properties must be obtained , especially as they relate to membrane ion conductivity. Here , to elucidate such properties , metal cation-based AEMs , featuring bis ( norbornene) nickel , ruthenium , or cobalt complexes , were synthesized and characterized. In addition , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC) was used to probe counterion exchange thermodynamics in order to understand previously reported differences in conductivity. The ion conductivity data reported here further demonstrated that nickel-complex cations had higher conductivity as compared to their ruthenium and cobalt counterparts. Surprisingly , bulk hydration number , ion concentration , ion exchange capacity , and activation energy were not sufficient to explain differences in conductivity , so the thermodynamics of metal cation-counterion association were explored using ITC. Specifically , for the nickel cation as compared to the other two metal-based cations , a larger thermodynamic driving force for chloride counterion release was observed , shown through a smaller Î” H
