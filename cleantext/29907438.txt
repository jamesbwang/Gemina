  Sodium valproate ( VPA) has well-established neuroprotective effects and is recommended as treatment in bipolar disorder patients. The neural effects of VPA in pediatric bipolar disorder ( PBD) have yet to be established. This preliminary study explored the effects of VPA on brain structure in PBD. Fourteen PBD patients ( 10 males; mean = 13.43 Â± 3.05 years old) underwent a structural MRI before and after a 6-week VPA treatment period. Bayesian linear mixed modeling explored seven brain region volumes as a function of dichotomous pre/post time. Results showed a decrease in amygdala volume over time. These findings need to be confirmed by large-scale , longitudinal studies.
