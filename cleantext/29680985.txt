  Previous recommendations to limit dietary cholesterol intake have been eliminated for most adults. Questions remain about whether dietary cholesterol has adverse cardiovascular effects among individuals with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes ( IFG/T2DM). We used data for 993 adults ( 40.9 % female) , ages 35 ‚Åª < 65 years , with prevalent IFG/T2DM in the prospective Framingham Offspring Study to address this question. Dietary cholesterol was assessed using 3-day diet records at exams 3 and 5 and used to classify subjects into sex-specific tertiles of mean cholesterol intake. Outcomes included fasting lipid levels over 20 years and incident cardiovascular disease ( CVD). Statistical analyses included repeated measures mixed regression models and Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for confounding. Among adults with T2DM/IFG , there was no consistent association between dietary cholesterol intake and fasting low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) , LDL/HDL ratio , or triglycerides over 20 years of follow-up. In longitudinal analyses , the adjusted hazard ratio for CVD in the highest ( vs. lowest) sex-specific tertile of cholesterol intake was 0.61 ( 95 % CI: 0.41 , 0.90). These analyses provide no evidence of an adverse association between dietary cholesterol and serum lipid levels or atherosclerotic CVD risk among adults with prevalent IFG/T2DM.
