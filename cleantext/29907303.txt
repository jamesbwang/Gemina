  Since the dawn of modern biotechnology public and private enterprise have pursued the development of a new breed of drought tolerant crop products. After more than 20 years of research and investment only a few such products have reached the market. This is due to several technical and market constraints. The technical challenges include the difficulty in defining tractable single-gene trait development strategies , the logistics of moving traits from initial to commercial genetic backgrounds , and the disconnect between conditions in farmer 's fields and controlled environments. Market constraints include the significant difficulty , and associated costs , in obtaining access to markets around the world. Advances in the biology of plant water management , including response to water deficit reveal new opportunities to improve crop response to water deficit and new genome-based tools promise to usher in the next era of crop improvement. As biotechnology looks to improve crop productivity under drought conditions , the environmental and food security advantages will influence public perception and shift the debate toward benefits rather than risks.
