  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( HIT) is a prothrombotic disorder initiated by antibodies to platelet factor 4 ( PF4)/ heparin complexes. PF4 released from platelets binds to surface glycosaminoglycans on hematopoietic and vascular cells that are heterogenous in composition and differ in affinity for PF4. PF4 binds to monocytes with higher affinity than to platelets , and depletion of monocytes exacerbates thrombocytopenia<symptom> in a murine HIT model. Here we show that the expression of PF4 on platelets and development of thrombocytopenia<symptom> are modulated by the ( re) distribution of PF4 among hematopoietic and endothelial cell surfaces. Binding of PF4 to platelets in whole blood in vitro varies inversely with the white cell count , likely due to the greater affinity of monocytes for PF4. In mice , monocyte depletion increased binding of PF4 to platelets two-three fold. Induction of HIT in mice caused a transient > 80-fold increase in binding of HIT antibody to monocytes versus 3.5-fold increase to platelets , and rapid , transient monocytopenia. Normalization of monocyte counts preceded the return in platelet counts. Exposure of blood<symptom> to endothelial cells also depletes PF4 from platelet surfaces. These studies demonstrate a dynamic interchange of surface-bound PF4 among hematopoetic and vascular cells that may limit thrombocytopenia<symptom> at the expense of promoting prothrombotic processes in HIT.
