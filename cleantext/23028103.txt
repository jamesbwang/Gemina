  Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( sHPT) is a frequently occurring severe complication of advanced kidney disease. Its clinical consequences include extraskeletal vascular and valvular calcifications , changes in bone metabolism resulting in renal osteodystrophy , and an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Calcimimetics are a cornerstone of parathyroid hormone ( PTH)- lowering therapy , as confirmed by the recently updated 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes chronic kidney disease- mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guidelines. Contrary to calcitriol or other vitamin D-receptor activators , calcimimetics reduce PTH without increasing serum-calcium , phosphorus , or FGF23 levels. Etelcalcetide is a new second-generation calcimimetic that has been approved for the treatment of sHPT in adult hemodialysis patients. Whereas the first-generation calcimimetic cinacalcet is taken orally once daily , etelcalcetide is given intravenously thrice weekly at the end of the hemodialysis session. Apart from improving drug adherence , etelcalcetide has proven to be more effective in lowering PTH when compared to cinacalcet , with an acceptable and comparable safety profile. The hope for better gastrointestinal tolerance with intravenous administration did not come true , as etelcalcetide did not significantly mitigate the adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with cinacalcet. Enhanced adherence and strong reductions in PTH , phosphorus , and FGF23 could set the stage for a future large randomized controlled trial to demonstrate that improved biochemical control of mineral metabolism with etelcalcetide in hemodialysis patients translates into cardiovascular and survival benefits and better health-related quality of life.
