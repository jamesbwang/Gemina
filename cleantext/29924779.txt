  Presented herein are the results of using Detralex in conservative treatment of women suffering from pelvic varicose veins. Our open prospective study included a total of 30 women with various forms of the course of the disease. All patients took Detralex prescribed at a daily dose of 1,000 mg for 60 days. Dynamic assessment of clinical manifestations of pelvic varicose veins in this cohort of patients was carried out with the help of a specialized quality-of-life questionnaire , an adapted clinical scale of determining disease severity , as well as a visual analogue scale for assessment of the main symptoms of the disease manifestations. The questionnaires and scales were filled in before the beginning of taking the drug and immediately after stopping it. The obtained findings objectively confirmed efficacy of conservative therapy in the majority of the responders. Reported was a decrease in the average index of quality of life from 46.77 ± 13.25 to 36.87 ± 8.53 points ( p = 0.001). The mean score of the clinical scale of disease severity regressed from 10.8 ± 5.06 to 6.97 ± 3.9 points ( p = 0.002). The average composite score for the degree of the main symptoms of the disease according to the visual analogue scale decreased from 32.9 ± 21.26 to 19.16 ± 16.04 points ( p = 0.006). We observed a dramatic decrease in severity of manifestations of the main clinical symptoms and improvement of quality of life of women on the background of taking the drug , thus suggesting its efficacy for the pathological condition concerned. The obtained results make it possible to recommend routine prescription of Detralex to all women with detected pelvic varicose veins as one of the main components of basic pharmacotherapy.
