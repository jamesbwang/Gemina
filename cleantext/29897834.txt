  RcsB , a response regulator of the FixJ/NarL family , is at the center of a complex network of regulatory inputs and outputs. Cell surface stress is sensed by an outer membrane lipoprotein , RcsF , which regulates interactions of the inner membrane protein IgaA , lifting negative regulation of a phosphorelay. In vivo evidence supports a pathway in which histidine kinase RcsC transfers phosphate to phosphotransfer protein RcsD , resulting in phosphorylation of RcsB. RcsB acts either alone or in combination with RcsA to positively regulate capsule synthesis and synthesis of small RNA ( sRNA) RprA as well as other genes , and to negatively regulate motility. RcsB in combination with other FixJ/NarL auxiliary proteins regulates yet other functions , independent of RcsB phosphorylation. Proper expression of Rcs and its targets is critical for success of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> commensal strains , for proper development of biofilm , and for virulence in some pathogens. New understanding of how the Rcs phosphorelay works provides insight into the flexibility of the two-component system paradigm.
