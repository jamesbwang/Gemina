  We aimed to evaluate glucose and prolactin monitoring in children and adolescents initiating antipsychotic therapy using a nationwide claims database. A retrospective 15-month cohort study was conducted using the National Database of Health Insurance Claim Information and Specified Medical Checkups in Japan. Patients aged â‰¤ 18 years , who were newly prescribed antipsychotics between April 2014 and March 2015 , were followed up for 450 days. Outcomes were the use of glucose and prolactin testing through 15 months after drug initiation ( index date) with consideration of persistence with antipsychotic therapy. The incidence proportion of patients monitored was assessed within the following four time windows: baseline ( between 30 days before the index date and the index date) , at 1-3 months ( between 1 and 90 days after the index date) , at 4-9 months ( between 91 and 270 days after the index date) , and at 10-15 months ( between 271 and 450 days after the index date). Of 43,608 new users in 6620 medical institutions , the percentage of persistent antipsychotic users was 46.4 % at 90 days , 29.7 % at 270 days , and 23.8 % at 450 days after the index date. The proportion of patients who received monitoring within the baseline period was 13.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 13.2-13.8) for glucose and 0.6 % ( 95 % CI , 0.5-0.6) for prolactin , respectively. The proportion of patients who received glucose monitoring at all time windows decreased to 0.9 %. The proportion of patients who received prolactin monitoring by the second time window decreased to 0.1 %. Our study shows that monitoring for glucose and prolactin is infrequent in children and adolescents initiating antipsychotic therapy. Strategies for physicians , patients , and guardians are needed to overcome the barriers in glucose and prolactin monitoring.
