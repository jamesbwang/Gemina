  Finding optimal chiral ligands for transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions using trial-and-error methods is often time-consuming and costly , even if the details of the reaction mechanism are already known. Although modern computational analyses allow the prediction of the stereoselectivity , there are only very few examples for the attempted design of chiral ligands using a computational approach for the improvement of the stereoselectivity. Herein , we report a systematic method for the design of chiral ligands for the enantioselective Markovnikov hydroboration of aliphatic terminal alkenes based on a computational and experimental evaluation sequence. We developed a three-hindered-quadrant P-chirogenic bisphosphine ligand that was designed in accordance with the design guidelines derived from this method , which allowed the Markovnikov hydroboration to proceed with high enantioselectivity ( up to 99 % ee).
