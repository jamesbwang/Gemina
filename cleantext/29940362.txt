  Membrane biofouling , due to Soluble Microbial Products ( SMP) and Extracellular Polymeric Substances ( EPS) deposition , results in reduction of the performance of Membrane Bioreactors ( MBRs). However , recently , a new method of biofouling control has been developed , utilizing the interference of the bacterial inter- and intra-species ' communication. Bacteria use Quorum Sensing ( QS) to regulate the production of SMP and EPS. Therefore , disruption of Quorum Sensing ( Quorum Quenching: QQ) , by enzymes or microorganisms , may be a simple mean to control membrane biofouling. In the present study , a novel QQ-bacterium , namely Lactobacillus<pathogen> sp.. SBR04MA , was isolated from municipal wastewater sludge and its ability to mitigate biofouling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in critical flux and transmembrane pressure , along with the production of EPS and SMP , in a lab-scale MBR system treating synthetic wastewater. Lactobacillus<pathogen> sp.. SBR04MA showed great potential for biofouling control , which was evidenced by the ∼ 3-fold increase in critical flux ( 8.3 → 24.25 L/m
