  Function-guided navigation is commonly used when assessing cortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS). However , the required accuracy , stability and the effect of a change in coil positioning are not entirely known. This study investigates the accuracy of function-guided navigation for determining the hotspot. Furthermore , it evaluates the effect of a change in coil location on the single and paired pulse excitability measures: motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitude , TMS evoked potential ( TEP) and long intracortical inhibition ( LICI) , and of a change in coil orientation on LICI. Eight healthy subjects participated in the single pulse study , and ten in the paired pulse study. A robot-guided navigation system was used to ensure accurate and stable coil positioning at the motor hotspot as determined using function-guided navigation. In addition , we targeted four locations at 2 mm and four at 5 mm distance around the initially defined hotspot , and we increased and decreased the coil orientation by 10 Â°. In none of the subjects , the largest MEP amplitudes were evoked at the originally determined hotspot , resulting in a poor accuracy of function-guided navigation. At the group level , a change in coil location had no significant effect on the MEP amplitude , TEP , or LICI , and a change in coil orientation did not significantly affected LICI. However , at the subject level significant effects on MEP amplitude , TEP , and LICI were found for changes in coil location or orientation , although absolute differences were relatively small and did not show a consistent pattern. This study indicates that a high accuracy in coil positioning is especially required to measure cortical excitability reliably in individual subjects using single or paired pulse TMS.
