  Patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) are at a greater risk of cardiovascular ( CV) morbidity and mortality than their counterparts without diabetes. Worsening glycemic control is associated with increasing risk of CV events and mortality , but glycemic control alone does not appear sufficient to improve CV outcomes. Furthermore , some glucose-lowering drugs have been associated with an increased risk of CV events. As a result , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) issued guidance in 2008 for the investigation of CV risk with new diabetes therapies. Numerous CV outcomes trials have since been initiated for drugs in the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4) inhibitors , sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 ( SGLT-2) inhibitors , and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1 RA) classes. CV safety has been confirmed for a number of drugs. More recently , CV benefits have been shown for some SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs. Primary care physicians should consider medications that can lower CV risk alongside favorable efficacy and safety profiles for treatment of patients with T2D at high CV risk.
