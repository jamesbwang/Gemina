  The insect transformer2 ( tra2) gene has a prevalent role in cooperating with the sex determining gene transformer ( tra) to direct female differentiation. Here , we report the identification and characterization of Btau-tra2 , the tra2 ortholog of the pumpkin fruit fly , Bactrocera tau , an invasive agricultural pest. The Btau-tra2 gene produces three transcript variants. However , only two transcripts can be examined; one is present at all developmental stages in the soma and germline of both sexes and the other one is specific to embryo and the germline. Knocking down the function of Btau-tra2 produced a male biased sex ratio and some intersexes. Consistent with a role in sex determination , the obtained intersexual and male sterility phenotypes express a mix of male and female splice variants of the tra and doublesex ( dsx) orthologs , indicating that Btau-tra2 has a conserved splicing regulatory function and acts together/upstream of tra and dsx. In addition , some males obtained from the knock down are fertile but their fertilities are extremely reduced. Moreover , almost all surviving RNAi males harbor testes having some defects in their external morphologies. Most notably , the body size of a few surviving RNAi flies was two to three folds increased with respect to the normal size. Our findings suggest that Btua-tra2 is involved in male fertility and may also have an unprecedented role in body size control besides its conserved role in sex determination.
