  To evaluate the time course of sensorimotor integration processes involved in balance<symptom> capability during 1-year follow-up after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) reconstruction. To evaluate whether an association exists between balance<symptom> performance and semitendinosus muscle morphometry features. Twenty-seven patients ( mean age 29.6 ± 10.8 years) were prospectively followed with stabilometry and ultrasound at 3 months ( T0) , 6 months ( T1) , and 1 year ( T2) after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Body sway and sensorimotor integration processes were evaluated by calculating the percentage difference of sway ( PDS) on two surface conditions. A significant difference in PDS was observed over time ( p < 0.001). The interaction `` Time × Condition '' showed significant differences ( p = 0.02) , with worse performance on the compliant than the firm surface. There was a significant difference in CSA ( p < 0.001) , MT ( p < 0.001) , and % HRD ( p < 0.001) over time. The interaction `` Time * side '' was significant for CSA ( p = 0.02) and % HRD ( p = 0.01). A negative correlation between PDS on compliant surface and CSA was measured at 3- ( r =- 0.71 , n = 27 , p < 0.001) and 6-month post-surgery ( r =- 0.47 , n = 27 , p = 0.013). Balance<symptom> was regained within the first 6 months after surgery , while morphometry of the semitendinosus muscle improved mostly between 6 and 12 months in patients who returned to sports activities. Balance<symptom> capabilities paralleled semitendinosus muscle morphometry improvements. The instrumental assessment of sensorimotor integration processes is relevant in clinical practice as screening tests for primary and secondary prevention of ACL injury.
