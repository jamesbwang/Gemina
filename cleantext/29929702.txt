  Routine implant removal is frequently performed although evidence-based guidelines are lacking. But routinely planned implant removal has significant economic implications and shows considerable complication rates. In general , clinical outcome seems to improve but pain relief after operation is often unpredictable. Even in patients reporting implant-related pain , implant removal does not guarantee relief and may be associated with further complications. The intra- and postoperative complication rate remains very high. Implant removal demonstrates a significant learning curve and unsupervised junior surgeons tend to cause more complications. The need for implant removal may be questioned. Even with the implant in place , contact activities can be resumed. However , a new adequate trauma can create a new fracture independently if there is an implant in-situ or not. It is important to understand the complications and outcomes to be expected with hardware removal to carefully evaluate its indication.
