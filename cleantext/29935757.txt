  Post-stroke depression<symptom> ( PSD) and post-stroke apathy ( PSA) are both associated with adverse outcome after stroke. This study aimed to examine whether personality traits predict the course of PSD and PSA. In this prospective cohort study , 240 stroke patients completed the NEO Five Factor Inventory , Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale , and Apathy Evaluation Scale at 3 months post-stroke. Neuropsychiatric assessment was repeated at 6- and 12-month follow-up after initial testing. Linear mixed models showed that high neuroticism scores were associated with higher depression<symptom> levels at baseline , and this association remained stable at follow-up. High extraversion scores and high conscientiousness scores were associated with lower apathy levels at baseline. For neuroticism , a significant interaction with time was found , with higher neuroticism scores at baseline being associated with an increase in apathy scores from 6-month to 12-month follow-up. Prospective analyses showed that high extraversion predicted low apathy levels at 6-month and 12-month follow-up independent of its relations with baseline depression<symptom> and apathy. High neuroticism predicted high apathy levels at 12-month follow-up , whereas high agreeableness and high openness predicted high apathy levels and low apathy levels , respectively , at 6-month follow-up. None of the personality traits predicted depression<symptom> scores at follow-up. Personality traits are associated with the development and sustainability of PSD and PSA. The traits associated with PSD and PSA were different , providing support for the independence of these constructs. The findings highlight the importance to take personality traits into account as a potential vulnerability factor for PSD and PSA.
