  Radiofrequency ( RF) ablation of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias ( IVA) from the coronary venous system ( CVS) has been increasingly performed , but real effect of ablation lesions<symptom> from CVS on epicardial myocardium has not been studied. To compare effects of RF delivered inside the distal CVS during ablation of IVAs originating from left ventricular summit ( LVS) with IVAs ablated from right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT) using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI). Twenty consecutive patients with IVAs who underwent acutely successful RF ablation at initial appropriate sites , i.e. , distal CVS ( Group 1 , n = 10) or RVOT ( Group 2; n = 10) were enrolled. Detailed contrast-enhanced CMRI of each patient was performed 3 months later. Presence and location of scars , distance of CVS to epicardial ventricular myocardium were measured and analyzed. Group 1 consisted of 10 and Group 2 consisted of 10 patients. Three months after the ablation , only three patients in Group 1 had detectable late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE) on CMRI while nine out of 10 patients in Group 2 had evident LGE on CMRI ( P: 0.02). The mean distance of distal CVS to epicardial anterobasal myocardium was measured to be 8.8 ± 1.6 mm in Group 1. In three cases that had detectable scar on superior anterobasal LV epicardium , the mean distance was 7.4 ± 1.1 mm. RF delivery inside the CVS is less likely to produce detectable LGE on CMRI compared to RVOT. This may partially explain less than ideal long-term results after ablation of LVS IVAs from within the great cardiac vein/anterior interventricular vein.
