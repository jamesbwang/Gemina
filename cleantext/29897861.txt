  Postural assessment is often recommended as a component of post-concussion examination; however , a reliable , objective approach to identify and monitor the recovery of postural deficits is still needed. Degani et al. ( 2017) suggest that effects of concussion on postural control can be identified at the group level through spatio-temporal , frequency , and dynamic characteristics of balance<symptom>. In contrast , Wright et al. ( 2017) propose additional vestibular and oculomotor assessments to identify processing deficits that impair balance<symptom> following concussion in individuals.
