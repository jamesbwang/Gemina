  The squamate fossil record from Kanapoi reveals generic to higher-order similarities with modern East African herpetofaunas. The record is derived from surface collection and screen washing , and consists primarily of isolated vertebrae with a few maxillary and mandibular elements. The most abundant remains are vertebrae of large-bodied Python that are morphologically similar to extant Python sebae , and vertebrae of Varanus cf. ( Varanus niloticus + Varanus exanthematicus). Additional cranial and vertebral remains indicate the presence of lygosomine skinks , indeterminate Varanus , Viperidae , cf. Atractaspididae , and multiple colubrine morphotypes in the Kanapoi ecosystem. Despite similarities with modern herpetofaunas , the Kanapoi record lacks taxa common to other East African records , including agamids , chamaeleonids , amphisbaenians , the elapid Naja , and typhlopids. The overall composition of the Kanapoi squamate record is consistent with paleoenvironments similar to modern shrub savanna habitats. There are no indicators of canopied forest<disease> environments in squamate faunal composition. The fossil record of Kanapoi suggests that assembly of squamate faunas of modern East Africa was well underway by the late Neogene.
