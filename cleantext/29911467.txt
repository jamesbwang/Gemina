  We aimed at designing a nomogram , a prediction tool , to predict the individual 's risk of conversion to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS) at the time of multiple sclerosis ( MS) onset. One derivation and three validation cohorts were established. The derivation cohort included 8825 relapsing-onset MS patients in Sweden. A nomogram was built based on a survival model with the best statistical fit and prediction accuracy. The nomogram was validated using data from 3967 patients in the British Columbia cohort , 176 patients in the ACROSS and 2355 patients in FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II extension studies. Sex , calendar year of birth , first-recorded Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS) score , age at the first EDSS and age at disease onset showed significant predictive ability to estimate the risk of SPMS conversion at 10 , 15 and 20 years. The nomogram reached 84 % ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs): 83-85) internal and 77 % ( 95 % CI: 76-78) , 77 % ( 95 % CI: 70-85) and 87 % ( 95 % CI: 84-89) external accuracy. The SPMS nomogram represents a much-needed complementary tool designed to assist in decision-making and patient counselling in the early phase of MS. The SPMS nomogram may improve outcomes by prompting timely and more efficacious treatment for those with a worse prognosis.
