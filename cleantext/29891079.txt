  The terminology of nonprogressive congenital ataxia<symptom> ( NPCA) refers to a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by congenital or early-onset ataxia<symptom> , but no progression or even improvement on follow-up. Ataxia<symptom> is preceded by muscular hypotonia and delayed motor ( and usually language) milestones. We exclude children with prenatal , perinatal , and postnatal acquired diseases , malformations other than cerebellar hypoplasia , and defined syndromic disorders. Patients with NPCA have a high prevalence of cognitive and language impairments , in addition to increased occurrence of seizures<symptom> , ocular signs ( nystagmus<symptom> , strabismus) , behavior changes , and microcephaly. Neuroimaging is variable , ranging from normal cerebellar anatomy to reduced cerebellar volume ( hypoplasia in the proper sense) , and enlarged interfolial spaces , potentially mimicking atrophy. The latter appearance is often called `` hypoplasia '' as well , in view of the static clinical course. Some patients had progressive enlargement of cerebellar fissures , but a nonprogressive course. There is no imaging-clinical-genetic correlation. Dominant , recessive , and X-linked inheritance is documented for NPCA. Here , we focus on the still rather short list of dominant and recessive genes associated with NPCA , identified in the last few years. With future advances in genetics , we expect a rapid expansion of knowledge in this field.
