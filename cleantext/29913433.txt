  This paper introduces an universal and structure-preserving regularization term , called quantile sparse image ( QuaSI) prior. The prior is suitable for denoising images from various medical imaging modalities. We demonstrate its effectiveness on volumetric optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and computed tomography ( CT) data , which show different noise and image characteristics. OCT offers high-resolution scans of the human retina but is inherently impaired by speckle noise. CT on the other hand has a lower resolution and shows high-frequency noise. For the purpose of denoising , we propose a variational framework based on the QuaSI prior and a Huber data fidelity model that can handle 3-D and 3-D + t data. Efficient optimization is facilitated through the use of an alternating direction method of multipliers ( ADMM) scheme and the linearization of the quantile filter. Experiments on multiple datasets emphasize the excellent performance of the proposed method.
