  Background There has been no systematic study assessing nickel release from surgical instruments and equipment used within the operating suite. This equipment represents important potential sources of exposure for nickel-sensitive patients and hospital staff. To investigate nickel release from commonly used surgical instruments and operating room equipment. Using the dimethylglyoxime nickel spot test , a variety of surgical instruments and operating room equipment were tested for nickel release at our institution. Of the 128 surgical instruments tested , only 1 was positive for nickel release. Of the 43 operating room items tested , 19 were positive for nickel release , 7 of which have the potential for direct contact with patients and/or hospital staff. Hospital systems should be aware of surgical instruments and operating room equipment as potential sources of nickel exposure.
