  Myocardial infarction ( MI) with non-obstructive coronary arteries ( MINOCA) is a recently recognized condition where biomarkers and prognosis are less well studied than in MI with obstructive coronary artery disease ( MI-CAD). We therefore aimed to investigate the one-year prognostic value of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT) levels in MINOCA in comparison to MI-CAD. In this registry-based cohort study , we used data from patients with a discharge diagnosis of MI , admitted between 2009 and 2013 to Swedish hospitals using the hs-cTnT assay. Only patients without previously known coronary artery disease were considered. Patients with and without coronary stenosis > 50 % were regarded to have MI-CAD and MINOCA , respectively. Assessed outcomes included all-cause mortality , cardiovascular ( CV) mortality and major CV events ( MACE) , defined as the composite of CV death or admissions for non-fatal MI , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) or ischemic stroke. The study cohort consisted of 1639 MINOCA and 17,304 MI-CAD patients. In adjusted analyses , hs-cTnT ( ln) in MINOCA patients predicted all-cause mortality ( HR 1.32 ( 95 % CI 1.11-1.56)) , CV mortality ( HR 2.11 ( 95 % CI 1.51-2.96)) and MACE ( HR 1.44 ( 95 % CI 1.20-1.72)). Hs-cTnT ( ln) also predicted readmissions for HF ( HR 1.51 ( 95 % CI 1.51-2.96)) but not non-fatal MI or stroke. Interaction analyses suggested that hs-cTnT ( ln) was at least as prognostic in patients with MINOCA compared to MI-CAD. Hs-cTnT levels in MINOCA patients are strong and independent predictors of adverse outcome. Consideration of hs-cTnT levels is important for risk assessment of MINOCA patients.
