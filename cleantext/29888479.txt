  Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors are novel antidiabetes drugs that act via inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption. This action causes osmotic diuresis , reduces intravascular volume and is associated with various adverse effects. In the present paper , we describe the first report on the unmasking of underlying polycythemia vera by canagliflozin in a person with Type 2 diabetes mellitus , which was temporally related to the use of the drug. A 51-year-old obese man with Type 2 diabetes was prescribed canagliflozin 100 mg for control of his glycaemia. He presented 6 months later with asymptomatic elevation of his haemogram measurements ( haemoglobin: 16.9 g/dl; haematocrit: 55 %; red cell number: 8.1 million/mm This report brings to light unmasking of a new adverse effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in clinical practice caused by volume loss , apart from hypotension<symptom> and falls.
