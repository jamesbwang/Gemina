  This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of everolimus , a mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) inhibitor , on cisplatin chemotherapy-induced ovarian toxicity. Eighty sexually mature , virgin , female , 7-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: control , cisplatin ( Cis) , everolimus ( mTORi) , and everolimus plus cisplatin ( mTORi + Cis). Mice in the Cis and mTORi + Cis groups were intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg/kg of cisplatin for 15 d. Mice in the mTORi and mTORi + Cis groups were orally administered 2.5 mg/kg of everolimus for 29 d , from one week before the first cisplatin injection to one week after the last cisplatin injection. Histological examinations were performed 24 h after the last everolimus administration. The primordial , primary , and antral follicles were significantly depleted in the Cis group compared with that in the control group , confirming the gonadotoxicity of cisplatin. The number of primordial , secondary , and antral follicles was significantly higher in the mTORi + Cis group than in the Cis group , thereby displaying the effect of mTORi-treatment on ovarian protection. Primordial , secondary , and antral follicle counts were similar in the mTORi + Cis and the control groups. The results of this study indicate a protective effect of an mTOR inhibitor against cisplatin chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity in the ovarian reserve in an in vivo mouse model.
