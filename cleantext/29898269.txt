  Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( mPDAC) is a lethal disease with a poor 5-year survival. Systemic treatments can be used to control symptoms and prolong life. Cytotoxic chemotherapies are commonly administered , with combination treatments , such as fluorouracil , folinic acid , irinotecan and oxaliplatin ( FOLFIRINOX) or nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine showing the largest clinical benefits. Newer genomic classifications of PDAC may provide a rationale for targeted therapies or immunotherapies , although at present these remain largely experimental. This review discusses the evidence behind the currently used regimens , while introducing the potential future of pancreatic cancer care.
