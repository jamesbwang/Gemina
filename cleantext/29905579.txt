  Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ( ALCL) was first described in 1985 by Stein et al and is a clinically , morphologically , and immunophenotypically heterogeneous neoplasm characterized by ALK expression , rearrangement of the ALK gene , and most characteristically its occurrence in children. Clinically , cutaneous ALK + ALCL can be divided into primary ( cutaneous forms) and the much more common , secondary dissemination by a systemic lymphoma. Systemic ALK + ALCL represents 10 % -15 % of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma and generally presents with advanced systemic<disease> disease<disease>. Here , we describe a case of a 9-year-old girl who presented with a solitary ulcerated nodule<disease> on the elbow that clinically resembled a pyogenic granuloma<disease> yet showed ALK , CD30 , and myeloperoxidase expression. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with a break-apart probe for ALK revealed the presence of an ALK gene rearrangement. The initial workup showed no evidence of extracutaneous malignancy , and a diagnosis of primary cutaneous ALK + ALCL was favored. Subsequent imaging studies revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy<disease> , compatible with a systemic form of T-cell lymphoma , treated subsequently with chemotherapy. This report highlights the importance of an adequate systemic evaluation on the presentation of a cutaneous form of ALK + ALCL.
