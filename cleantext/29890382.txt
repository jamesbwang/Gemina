  We examined the role of social frailty in the association between hearing problems and mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) , and investigated which cognitive impairment domains are most strongly involved. Participants were 4251 older adults ( mean age 72.5 Â± 5.2 years , 46.1 % male) who met the study inclusion criteria. Hearing problems were measured using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly. Social frailty was identified using responses to five questions. Participants were divided into four groups depending on the presence of social frailty and hearing problems: control , social frailty , hearing problem , and co-occurrence. We assessed memory , attention , executive function , and processing speed using the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology-Functional Assessment Tool. Participants were categorized into normal cognition , single- and multiple-domain MCI , depending on the number of impaired cognitive domains. Participants with multiple-domain MCI exhibited the highest odds ratios ( OR) of the co-occurrence group ( OR: 3.89 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI): 1.96-7.72) , followed by the social frailty ( OR: 2.65 , 95 % CI: 1.49-4.67) , and hearing problem ( OR: 1.90 , 95 % CI: 1.08-3.34) groups , compared with the control group. However , single-domain MCI was not significantly associated with any group. Cognitive domain analysis revealed that impaired executive function and processing speed were associated with the co-occurrence , hearing problem , and social frailty groups , respectively. Social frailty and hearing problems were independently associated with multiple-domain MCI. Comorbid conditions were more strongly associated with multiple-domain MCI. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the causal role of social frailty in the association between hearing impairment and MCI.
