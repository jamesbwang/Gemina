  The present study was aimed to characterize the electrophysiology of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC-CMs). IMR90-4 cells were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes by temporal modulation of regulators of canonical Wnt signaling. The protein expression of cardiac troponin T ( cTnT) was detected by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry , and the differentiation rate of hiPSC-CMs was calculated. The action potentials ( APs) of hiPSC-CMs were recorded by patch clamp and used to classify different types of cardiomyocytes. The electrophysiological characteristics of hiPSC-CMs were further analyzed. The results showed that the cTnT positive rate of hiPSC-CMs was above 95 %. hiPSC-CMs were differentiated into 3 types of cardiomyocytes based on the properties of AP: ventricular- , atrial- and nodal-like cells. In comparison with the other two types of cells , the APs of ventricular-like cells exhibited longer duration , higher amplitude and higher dV/dt
