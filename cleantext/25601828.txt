  Consciousness<symptom> is determined both by level ( e.g. , being awake versus being anesthetized) and content ( i.e. , the qualitative aspects of experience). Subcortical areas are known to play a causal role in regulating the level of consciousness<symptom> ( 1-9) , but the role of the cortex is less well understood. Clinical and correlative data have been used both to support and refute a role for prefrontal and posterior cortices in the level of consciousness<symptom> ( 10-22). The prefrontal cortex has extensive reciprocal connections to wake-promoting centers in the brainstem and diencephalon ( 23 , 24) , and hence is in a unique position to modulate level of consciousness<symptom>. Furthermore , a recent study suggested that the prefrontal cortex might be important in regulating level of consciousness<symptom> ( 25) but causal evidence , and a comparison with more posterior cortical sites , is lacking. Therefore , to test the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex plays a role in regulating level of consciousness<symptom> , we attempted to reverse sevoflurane anesthesia by cholinergic or noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal prelimbic cortex and two areas of parietal cortex in rat. General anesthesia was defined by loss of the righting reflex , a widely used surrogate measure in rodents. We demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation of prefrontal cortex , but not parietal cortex , restored wake-like behavior , despite continuous exposure to clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane anesthesia. Noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal and parietal areas resulted in electroencephalographic activation but failed to produce any signs of wake-like behavior. We conclude that cholinergic mechanisms in prefrontal cortex can regulate the level of
