  Complex<pathogen> I ( NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) uses the reducing potential of NADH to drive protons across the energy-transducing inner membrane and power oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian mitochondria. Recent cryo-EM analyses have produced near-complete models of all 45 subunits in the bovine , ovine and porcine complexes and have identified two states relevant to complex I in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here , we describe the 3.3-Å structure of complex I from mouse heart mitochondria , a biomedically relevant model system , in the ` active ' state. We reveal a nucleotide bound in subunit NDUFA10 , a nucleoside kinase homolog , and define mechanistically critical elements in the mammalian enzyme. By comparisons with a 3.9-Å structure of the ` deactive ' state and with known bacterial structures , we identify differences in helical geometry in the membrane domain that occur upon activation or that alter the positions of catalytically important charged residues. Our results demonstrate the capability of cryo-EM analyses to challenge and develop mechanistic models for mammalian complex I.
