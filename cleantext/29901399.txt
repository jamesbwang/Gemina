  A method for protecting organic azides from click reactions with alkynes is reported. Treatment of azides with Amphos affords phosphazides , which are stable under click reaction conditions and are easily converted back to azides by treatment with elemental sulfur. Thus , the method allows for facile modification of azide compounds via site-selective click reactions.
