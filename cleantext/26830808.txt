  Magnetochiral phenomena may be responsible for the selection of chiral states of biomolecules in meteoric environments. For example , the Supernova Amino Acid Processing ( SNAAP) Model was proposed previously as a possible mode of magnetochiral selection of amino acids by way of the weak interaction in strong magnetic fields. In earlier work , this model was shown to produce an enantiomeric excess ( ee) as high as 0.014 % for alanine. In this paper we present the results of molecular quantum chemistry calculations from which ees are determined for the Î±-amino acids plus isovaline and norvaline , which were found to have positive ees in meteorites. Calculations are performed for both isolated and aqueous states. In some cases , the aqueous state was found to produce larger ees reaching values as high as a few percent under plausible conditions.
