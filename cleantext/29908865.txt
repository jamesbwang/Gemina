  This study aimed to answer the following research question: What is the knowledge , opinion , and experience of trauma surgeons with respect to shared decision making ( SDM)? An online survey was sent out in September 2016 to all 257 surgeons registered as a trauma surgeon with the Dutch Association of Trauma Surgery , to gather demographic , knowledge , and practice based information regarding their use of SDM. Results were presented according to the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys ( CHERRIES). The questionnaire was filled out by 112 ( 44 %) trauma surgeons. Opinions about what SDM entails differed , but 27 % described a process that was clearly discordant with current consensus. Eighty-six percent of trauma surgeons regarded SDM as ( very) relevant for providing good care. Sixty-two percent reported to encounter problems in achieving SDM. The general opinion of Dutch trauma surgeons towards SDM is very positive , but many lack the understanding of what SDM really implies and surgeons report SDM to be difficult to accomplish. To improve the occurrence of SDM in trauma surgery , there is an obvious need for education and training in SDM skills for surgeons.
