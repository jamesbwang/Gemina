  To assess whether variables from a postural control test relate to and predict falls efficacy in prosthesis users. Twelve-month within and between subjects repeated measures design. Participants performed the Limits of Stability ( LOS) test protocol at study baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Participants also completed the Falls Efficacy Scale-International ( FES-I) questionnaire , reflecting the fear of falling , and reported the number of falls monthly between study baseline and 6-month follow-up , and additionally at 9- and 12-month follow-ups. University biomechanics laboratories. A group of active unilateral transtibial prosthesis users of primarily traumatic etiology ( PROS) ( n = 12) with at least one year of prosthetic experience and age and gender matched control participants ( CON) ( n = 12). Not applicable. Postural control variables derived from centre of pressure data obtained during the LOS test , which was performed on and reported by the Neurocom Pro Balance<symptom> Master , namely; reaction time ( RT) , movement velocity ( MVL) , endpoint ( EPE) and maximum ( MXE) excursion and directional control ( DCL). Number of falls and total FES-I scores. During the study period , the PROS group had higher FES-I scores ( U = 33.5 , p = 0.02) , but experienced a similar number of falls , compared to the CON group. Increased FES-I score were associated with decreased EPE ( R = -0.73 , p = 0.02) , MXE ( R = -0.83 , p < 0.01) and MVL ( R = -0.7 , p = 0.03) in the PROS group , and DCL ( R = -0.82 , p < 0.01) in the CON group , all in the backwards direction. Study baseline measures of postural control , in the backwards direction only , are related to and potentially predictive of subsequent 6-month FES-I scores in relatively mobile and experienced prosthesis users.
