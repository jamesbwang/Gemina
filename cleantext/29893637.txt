  Charlotte Zolotow 's 1972 storybook William 's Doll introduced us to a young boy who wanted nothing more than a baby doll of his own to hug , cuddle , and love. Since that time other children 's picture books featuring gender non-conforming boys have been published , telling stories about boys who dance , cook , and prefer to wear dresses. This qualitative research examines 20 of these books , published between 1972 and 2014. We analyze the themes and messages found in these books , paying particular attention to how the portrayals have changed over time. Research findings focus on historical shifts in the ways that gender non-conformity is depicted , the role that parents and peers play in these books , and how the books frame gender non-conformity as a problem that needs to be resolved.
