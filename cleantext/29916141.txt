  After retrotranslocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm , calreticulin is modified by the enzyme arginyltransferase-1 ( ATE1). Cellular levels of arginylated calreticulin ( R-CRT) are regulated in part by the proteasomal system. Under various stress conditions , R-CRT becomes associated with stress granules ( SGs) or reaches the plasma membrane ( PM) , where it participates in pro-apoptotic signaling. The mechanisms underlying the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis induced by specific drugs remain unclear. We evaluated the regulatory role of R-CRT in apoptosis of human glioma cell lines treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( BT). Two cell lines ( HOG , MO59K) displaying distinctive susceptibility to apoptosis induction were studied further. BT efficiency was found to be correlated with a subcellular distribution of R-CRT. In MO59K ( apoptosis-resistant) , R-CRT was confined to SGs formed following BT treatment. In contrast , HOG ( apoptosis-susceptible) treated with BT showed lower SG formation and higher levels of cytosolic and PM R-CRT. Increased R-CRT level was associated with enhanced mobilization of intracellular Ca
