  To test if Ki67 expression is prognostic for biochemical recurrence ( BCR) after radical prostatectomy ( RP). Ki67 immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from specimens obtained from 464 men undergoing RP at the Durham and West LA Veterans Affairs Hospitals. Hazard ratios ( HR) for Ki67 expression and time to BCR were estimated using Cox regression. Ki67 was associated with more recent surgery year ( p < 0.001) , positive margins ( p = 0.001) and extracapsular extension ( p < 0.001). In center-stratified analyses , the adjusted HR for Ki67 expression and BCR approached statistical significance for west<disease> LA ( HR: 1.54; p = 0.06) , but not Durham ( HR: 1.10; p = 0.74). This multi-institutional ` real-world ' study provides limited evidence for the prognostic role of Ki67 in predicting outcome after RP.
