  Potentially lethal cardiac channelopathies/cardiomyopathies may underlie a substantial portion of sudden unexplained death in the young ( SUDY). The whole-exome molecular autopsy represents the latest approach to postmortem genetic testing for SUDY. However , proper variant adjudication in the setting of SUDY can be challenging. From January 2012 through December 2013 , 25 consecutive cases of SUDY from 1 to 40 years of age ( average age at death 27 Â± 5.7 years; 13 white , 12 black) from Cook County , Illinois , were referred after a negative ( n = 16) or equivocal ( n = 9) conventional autopsy. A whole-exome molecular autopsy with analysis of 99 sudden death-susceptibility genes was performed. The predicted pathogenicity of ultrarare , nonsynonymous variants was determined using the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Overall , 27 ultrarare nonsynonymous variants were seen in 16/25 ( 64 %) victims of SUDY. Among black individuals , 9/12 ( 75 %) had an ultrarare nonsynonymous variant compared with 7/13 ( 54 %) white individuals. Of the 27 variants , 10 were considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic in 7/25 ( 28 %) individuals in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 5/16 ( 31 %) of autopsy-negative cases and in 2/6 ( 33 %) victims of SUDY with equivocal findings of cardiomyopathy. Overall , 6 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 4/25 ( 16 %) cases were congruent with the phenotypic findings at autopsy and therefore considered clinically actionable. Whole-exome molecular autopsy with gene-specific surveillance is an effective approach for the detection of potential pathogenic variants in SUDY cases. However , systematic variant adjudication is crucial to ensure accurate and proper care for surviving family members.
