  Numerous studies have characterized the pain reported by patients with advanced illness in terms of descriptors such as severity , but few have measured pain-related distress. Distress may be important in the clinical approach to pain. To evaluate pain-related distress among adult patients with advanced illness and pain following enrollment in an urban , specialist-level , community-based palliative care program. In a retrospective cross-sectional analysis , data were extracted from the electronic health records of all patients who were able to complete the pain item from the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale at the start of care. Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated the associations between distress and both sociodemographics and disease-related information. The 506 patients completing the pain item had a mean ( SD) age of 70.7 years ( 13.8); 64.2 % were women , 32.1 % were Hispanic , 32.6 % were white , and 27.7 % were black. Of the 503 patients who indicated some level of distress on a 0-4 scale , 221 ( 43.7 %) had high distress , defined as a score â‰¥ 3 ( `` quite a bit '' or `` very much ''). Cancer diagnosis and poor performance status ( unable to care for self) were predictors of high pain-related distress ( both p < 0.05). Significance of resultsAmong patients with advanced illness who reported pain at the start of care by a specialist palliative care program , high pain-related distress was common , particularly among those with cancer or poor physical function. Further studies are needed to explore the extent to which pain-related distress should inform the assessment and management of pain.
