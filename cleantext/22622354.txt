  Nephroblastomatosis is an uncommon pathologic process characterized by the presence of persistent embryonic nephrogenic rests. Progression to Wilms tumour occurs in an estimated 35 % of patients. Cure rates are based on histologic findings and disease stage and have improved from 10 % in the 1920s to over 90 % today. We report a case of a 9-month-old female presenting with a 2-month history of abdominal distension. Ultrasonographic and computed tomographic assessments demonstrated features consistent with bilateral , diffuse , hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis ( DHPLNB) for which she underwent chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging 6 weeks following commencement of chemotherapy revealed a mass concerning for unilateral Wilms tumor for which she underwent partial nephrectomy. Pathology confirmed DHPLNB with a unilateral Wilms tumor. 3.5 year radiographic follow up demonstrates complete recovery. To our knowledge , there are no similar cases with imaging depiction recently published. With potential for malignant transformation into Wilms tumour and low survival rate for late diagnosed Wilms tumors , it is important to recognize nephroblastomatosis early , both clinically and radiographically to improve overall patient prognosis.
