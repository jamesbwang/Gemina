  Natural selection can shape the genetic architecture of complex traits. In human populations , signals of positive selection at genetic loci have been detected through a variety of genome-wide scanning approaches without the knowledge of how genes affect traits or fitness. In the past decade , genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) have provided unprecedented insights into the genetic basis of quantitative variation in complex traits. Summary statistics generated from these GWAS have been shown to be an extraordinary data source that can be utilized to detect and quantify natural selection in the genetic architecture of complex traits. In this review , we focus on recent discoveries about selection on genetic variants associated with human complex traits based on GWAS-facilitated methods.
