  Illness perception is significantly related to several outcome measures in different medical conditions. However , little is known about headache-related causal attributions and cognitive and emotional representations in patients with migraine. To examine perceived causes of headache<symptom> and demographic , clinical , and psychological correlates and predictors of illness perception in patients with migraine attending a tertiary care headache<symptom> centre. A sample of 143 patients with migraine ( 85.3 % women , mean age 44.0 Â± 12.1 years) completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire ( Brief IPQ) , the Symptom Questionnaire ( SQ) , and the Migraine Disability Assessment ( MIDAS) Questionnaire. A set of demographic and clinical characteristics was also collected. Stress , heredity , and nervousness were the most frequent perceived causes of headache<symptom> Female gender was significantly related to higher Brief IPQ `` consequences '' and `` emotional response '' scores. Increased psychological distress and a poorer clinical course were significantly associated with more negative illness representations. In multiple regression analysis , a longer illness duration , increased depressive symptoms , and higher levels of headache-related disability and painfulness of headache<symptom> attacks independently predicted a worse illness perception. In patients with migraine , depressive symptoms and a worse disease status , characterized by a longer history of suffering , higher disability and more painful<symptom> headache<symptom> attacks , may negatively affect illness perception. It could also be that dysfunctional illness representations lead to depressive symptoms and decrease patients ' motivation to adhere to treatments , resulting in a worse outcome. Future studies should examine whether the improvement of illness perception through specific psychological interventions may promote a better adaptation to migraine.
