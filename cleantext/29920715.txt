  Despite the frequency of hospital readmissions , there is still a relatively incomplete understanding of the broader array of factors pertaining to readmission in older persons. Few studies have explored how older persons experience readmission and their perceptions of circumstances affecting the course of care. Research indicates that males experience poorer health outcomes and are at higher risk of readmission compared to women. To explore life conditions and critical incidents pertained to hospital readmission from the perspective of older males. The study used a qualitative explorative design using the Critical Incident Technique. A purposive sample of four males aged 65-75 were recruited from two internal medical wards. Data were collected through narrative double interviews. The study was registered by the North Denmark Region 's joint notification of health research ( ID 2008-58-0028). The analysis revealed four themes of life conditions: ` Ambiguity of ageing ' , ` Living with the burden of illness ' , ` Realisation of dependency ' and ` Growing sense of vulnerability and mortality '. Critical incidents comprised four areas: ` Balancing demands and resources in everyday life ' , ` Back home again- a period of recovery ' , ` Care interaction ' and ` Navigating within and between healthcare system ( s) '. This study illustrated the interconnectedness , dynamics and complexity of life conditions and critical incidents that over time and across diverse healthcare sectors affected the course of care in older persons. Hospital readmissions seem related to a complex web of interacting life conditions and critical incidents rather than growing age or specific illnesses.
