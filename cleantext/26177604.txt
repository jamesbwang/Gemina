  Recently , the field of tissue engineering has made numerous advances towards achieving artificial tendon substitutes with excellent mechanical and histological properties , and has had some promising experimental results. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy of tissue engineering in the treatment of tendon injuries. We searched MEDLINE , Embase , and the Cochrane Library for the time period 1999 to 2016 for trials investigating tissue engineering used to improve tendon healing in animal models. The studies were screened for inclusion based on randomization , controls , and reported measurable outcomes. The RevMan software package was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 388 references were retrieved and 35 studies were included in this systematic review. The different biomaterials developed were analyzed and we found that they improve the biomechanical and histological characteristics of the repaired tendon. At meta-analysis , despite a high heterogeneity , it revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of the maximum load , the maximum stress , and the Young 's modulus between experimental and control groups. In the forest<disease> plot , the diamond was on the right side of the vertical line and did not intersect with the line , favouring experimental groups. This review of the literature demonstrates the heterogeneity in the tendon tissue engineering literature. Several biomaterials have been developed and have been shown to enhance tendon healing and regeneration with improved outcomes.
