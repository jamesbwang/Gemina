  There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during pregnancy , however , little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep. This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing , sleep quality , sleep duration and supine sleep position , as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight , growth , preterm birth and stillbirth<symptom>. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea , sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth , gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion , there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However , existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the physical , emotional , and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to maternal sleep.
