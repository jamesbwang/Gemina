  Evidence is conflicting on the prognostic value of A systematic review of the literature was conducted. A meta-analysis was performed of studies providing estimates of relative risk ( RR) for the association between semiquantitative metabolic parameters and efficacy outcome measures. The analysis included 25 studies , for a total of 2,223 subjects. The most frequent primary tumour site was the oropharynx ( 1,150/ 2,223 patients , 51.7 %). According to the available data , the majority of patients had stage III/IV disease ( 1,709/ 1,799 , 94.9 %; no information available in four studies) and were treated with standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( 1,562/ 2,009 patients , 77.7 %; only one study without available information). A total of 11 , 8 and 4 independent studies provided RR estimates for the association between baseline FDG PET metrics and overall survival ( OS) , progression-free survival ( PFS) and locoregional control ( LRC) , respectively. High pretreatment metabolic tumour volume ( MTV) was significantly associated with a worse OS ( summary RR 1.86 , 95 % CI 1.08-3.21) , PFS ( summary RR 1.81 , 95 % CI 1.14-2.89) and LRC ( summary RR 3.49 , 95 % CI 1.65-7.35). Given the large heterogeneity ( I FDG PET has prognostic relevance in the context of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pretreatment MTV is the only metabolic variable with a significant impact on patient outcome. Because of the heterogeneity and the lack of standardized methodology , no definitive conclusions on optimal cut-off values can be drawn.
