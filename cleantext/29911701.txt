  A recent discovery of anionic redox activity in Li-rich layered compounds opens a new direction for the design of high-capacity cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Here using extensive ab initio calculations , the thermodynamic existence of the Li-rich phase in LiFePO4 to form Li1 + xFe1-xPO4 with x not exceeding 12.5 % has been proved. Anionic redox activity and structural stability during delithiation are further investigated. Interestingly , it is found that Li1 + xFe1-xPO4 can not be delithiated completely and thus can not achieve extra capacity by anionic redox activity , because the local oxygen-ion redox will cause the fracture of the rigid framework formed by phosphate tetrahedral polyanions. Although an extra capacity can not be realized , the excess Li-ions at Fe sites can enhance the Li-ion diffusivity along the adjacent ( 010) channel and contribute to the shift from 1D to 2D/3D diffusion. This study provides a fresh perspective on olivine-type LiFePO4 and offers some important clues on designing Li-rich cathode materials with high energy density.
