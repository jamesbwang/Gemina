  This paper presents a complete scheme for research on the three degrees of freedom model and response model of the vector propulsion of an unmanned surface vehicle. The object of this paper is & ldquo; Lanxin & rdquo; , an unmanned surface vehicle ( 7.02 m & times; 2.6 m) , which is equipped with a single vector propulsion device. First , the & ldquo; Lanxin & rdquo; unmanned surface vehicle and the related field experiments ( turning test and zig-zag test) are introduced and experimental data are collected through various sensors. Then , the thrust of the vector thruster is estimated by the empirical formula method. Third , using the hypothesis and simplification , the three degrees of freedom model and the response model of USV are deduced and established , respectively. Fourth , the parameters of the models ( three degrees of freedom model , response model and thruster servo model) are obtained by system identification , and we compare the simulated turning test and zig-zag test with the actual data to verify the accuracy of the identification results. Finally , the biggest advantage of this paper is that it combines theory with practice. Based on identified response model , simulation and practical course keeping experiments are carried out to further verify feasibility and correctness of modeling and identification.
