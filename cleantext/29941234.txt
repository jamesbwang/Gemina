  Youth and children in agriculture are highly vulnerable to the health hazards associated with agricultural work and the rural environment. The purpose of this study was to conduct a national needs assessment for developing a continuing education unit that increases the knowledge of pediatric nurse practitioners ( PNPs) on safety in an agricultural environment using the Google family of products. This was a cross-sectional , one-group design descriptive-correlational study. Surveys were received from 315 participants. On Day 1 , 57 % of responses were received , and 91 % were received within Week 1. The use of the free Google Forms and Google Sheets facilitated this researcher to obtain a sample size , saving research expense dollars , and entering data file into SPSS. In addition , a pattern of survey return rates was demonstrated. Second , clinical implications indicate that agricultural safety is missing from PNP curricula: PNPs are not knowledgeable about existing resources and would be interested in a continuing education unit.
