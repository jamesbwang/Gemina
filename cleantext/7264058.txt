  The current research examined whether carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele ( in SLC6A4) , who have been shown to selectively attend to negative information , exhibit a bias towards negative self-referent processing. The self-referent encoding task ( SRET) was used to measure self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives. Ratcliff 's diffusion model isolated and extracted decision-making components from SRET responses and reaction times. Across the initial ( N = 183) and replication ( N = 137) studies , results indicated that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers more easily categorized negative adjectives as self-referential ( i.e. , higher drift rate). Further , drift rate was associated with recall of negative self-referential stimuli. Findings across both studies provide further evidence that genetic variation may contribute to the etiology of negatively biased processing of self-referent information. Large scale studies examining the genetic contributions to negative self-referent processing may be warranted.
