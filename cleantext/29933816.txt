  Unhealthy substance use is common in primary care populations and is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Two key strategies to address unhealthy substance use in primary care are the process of screening , brief intervention , and referral to treatment ( SBIRT) , and integration of treatment for substance use disorders into primary care. Implementation of SBIRT requires buy-in from practice leaders , careful planning , and staff and primary care provider training. Primary care-based treatment of opioid and alcohol use disorders can be effective; more data are needed to better understand the benefits of these models and identify means of treating other substance use disorders in primary care.
