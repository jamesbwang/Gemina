  The unique architecture of the human connectome is defined initially by genetics and subsequently sculpted over time with experience. Thus , similarities in predisposition and experience that lead to similarities in social , biological , and cognitive attributes should also be reflected in the local architecture of white matter fascicles. Here we employ a method known as local connectome fingerprinting that uses diffusion MRI to measure the fiber-wise characteristics of macroscopic white matter pathways throughout the brain. This fingerprinting approach was applied to a large sample (
