  To evaluate the relation between yogurt consumption as well as cheese , milk , and total dairy , and high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( HBP) in two Nurses ' Health Study cohorts ( NHS , n = 69 298) , NHS II ( n = 84 368) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study ( HPFS , n = 30 512). NHS , NHS II , and HPFS participants were followed for incident HBP for up to 30 , 20 , and 24 years , respectively. Hazard ratios were calculated using time-dependent multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Pooled risk estimates were derived from fixed effects meta-analyses. Participants consuming at least five servings per week ( vs. < 1 serving per month) of yogurt in NHS , NHS II , and HPFS had 19 % ( 95 % CI 0.75-0.87) , 17 % ( 95 % CI 0.77-0.90) , and 6 % ( 95 % CI 0.83-1.07) lower HBP risks , respectively. In pooled analyses of these cohorts , higher yogurt consumption was linked with 16 % ( 95 % CI 0.80-0.88) lower HBP risk; higher total dairy ( 3 to < 6 vs. < 0.5 servings/day) , milk ( 2 to < 6/day vs. < 4/week) and cheese ( 1 to 4/day vs. < 1/week) were associated with 16 % ( 95 % CI 0.81-0.87) , 12 % ( 95 % CI 0.86-0.90) , and 6 % ( 95 % CI 0.90-0.97) lower HBP risks , respectively. After controlling for BMI as a possible causal intermediate , total dairy , yogurt , milk , and cheese were associated with 13 , 10 , 8 , and 8 % lower HBP risks , respectively. The combination of higher yogurt intake and higher DASH ( ` Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ') diet scores was associated with 30 % ( 95 % CI 0.66-0.75) lower HBP risk compared with lower levels of both factors. Higher total dairy intake , especially in the form of yogurt , was associated with lower risk of incident HBP in middle-aged and older adult men and women.
