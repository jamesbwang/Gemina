  Although athletes are typically at low risk for developing venous thromboembolism ( VTE) , injured and noninjured athletes alike can be exposed to many acquired risk factors , including intense training , dehydration<symptom> , trauma , immobilization , oral contraceptive use , and long-distance travel. Additionally , the risk of developing VTE might be increased by unidentified genetic clotting disorders. Due to the potential for fatal outcomes , knowledge of VTE pathoetiology and recognition of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) presentation should be an inherent part of the evaluation process for all who attend to athletes , regardless of age and apparent risk profile. To present an exploration clinical case series consisting of 2 otherwise healthy , college-aged female athletes who , despite their ages and relative low risk profiles , experienced DVTs after lower extremity trauma. Each case will be discussed relative to known clinical prediction rules ( CPRs) and published evidence. Collectively , both cases reinforce the need for the attending clinicians to perform a thorough history and pay attention to subtle clinical findings , regardless of the relatively low risk in college-aged athletes. Although the Wells ' CPRs for DVT can be used as a diagnostic guideline in the general population , it might not fully address the risks inherent in a young , otherwise healthy athletic population. We propose a risk-screening tool that is based on and modified from our experiences with these 2 patients and the known prediction rules and positive probability influences.
