  Currently , genetic risk score ( GRS) model has been a widely used method to evaluate the genetic effect of cancer risk prediction , but seldom studies investigated their discriminatory power , especially for colorectal cancer ( CRC) risk prediction. In this study , we applied both simulation and real data to comprehensively compare the discriminability of different GRS models. The GRS models were fitted by logistic regression with three scenarios , including simple count GRS ( SC-GRS) , logistic regression weighted GRS ( LR-GRS , including DL-GRS and OR-GRS) and explained variance weighted GRS ( EV-GRS , including EV_DL-GRS and EV_OR-GRS) models. The model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves and area under curves ( AUC) metric , net reclassification improvement ( NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement ( IDI). In real data analysis , as DL-GRS and EV_DL-GRS models were carried with serious over-fitting , the other three models were kept for further comparison. Compared to unweighted SC-GRS model , reclassification was significantly decreased in OR-GRS model ( NRI = -0.082 , IDI = -0.002 , P < 0.05) , while EV_OR-GRS model showed negative NRI and IDI ( NRI = -0.077 , IDI = -5.54 E-04 , P < 0.05) compared to OR-GRS model. Besides , traditional model with smoking status ( AUC = 0.523) performed lower discriminability compared to the combined model ( AUC = 0.607) including genetic ( i.e. , SC-GRS) and smoking factors. Similarly , the findings from simulation were all consistent to real data results. It is plausible that SC-GRS model could be optimal for predicting genetic risk of CRC. Moreover , the addition of more significant genetic variants to traditional model could further improve predictive power on CRC risk prediction.
