  Musical performance is a highly complicated task , requiring precise regulation and organization of sensorimotor system under high order cognitive functions of the human brain. The recent development of non-invasive measurements of brain structure and function , such as magnetic resonance imaging , in addition to conventional assessments , such as electrophysiology , and behavioral or cognitive tasks allows us to study short- and long-term brain plasticity associated with musical training. This article focuses on cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of musicians and indivisuals participating in music classes , reviews findings in terms of plastic and meta-plastic changes in the human brain induced by musical training over short and long period of time , and describes studies revealing transfer learning effects of musical training.
