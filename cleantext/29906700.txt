  The objective of this study was to determine patient characteristics and antiepileptic drug ( AED) treatment patterns in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy in a United States ( US) population followed for ≥ 180 days. In this retrospective cohort study , Commercial , Supplemental Medicare , and Medicaid insurance claims from US-based Truven Health MarketScan ® claims database were analyzed for incident epilepsy cases ( index date: January 2010-June 2013; prior baseline of 2 years ( 1 year for ages 1 to < 2 years; none for those < 1 year)). Cases met epilepsy criteria consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy diagnostic guidelines , with continuous medical and pharmacy enrollment without an epilepsy or seizure<symptom> diagnosis or AED prescription during baseline. Treatment was classified as monotherapy ( one AED for ≥ 90 continuous days) , polytherapy ( at least two AEDs for ≥ 90 days) , or untreated ( no AED claims but other pharmacy or healthcare claims). Treatment pattern comparisons used matched cohorts across seizure<symptom> types. Of 58,757 incident cases , 50,838 had a follow-up of ≥ 180 days. The median ( range) follow-up duration was 529 ( 180-1096) days. Patient characteristics were similar across seizure<symptom> types ( matched focal vs. generalized epilepsy , N = 9949 each). At 6 and 12 months post-index , 46.8 % and 52.2 % of patients , respectively , had received AED treatment. Of 29,226 patients receiving treatment , 74.7 % and 1.6 % received monotherapy and polytherapy for ≥ 90 days , respectively , as first-line treatment; remaining patients received AED for < 90 days and were excluded. The probability of remaining on initial treatment after 1 year was 61.0 % for monotherapy and 36.5 % for polytherapy. The most common first-line AEDs were levetiracetam ( 44.4 %) , phenytoin ( 6.5 %) , valproic acid ( 6.4 %) , lamotrigine ( 6.3 %) , oxcarbazepine ( 5.7 %) , topiramate ( 5.5 %) , and gabapentin ( 5.3 %). Although the majority of treated patients received AED monotherapy consistent with guidelines , suboptimal rates of AED treatment and persistence of first-line treatment after initial epilepsy diagnosis suggest that efforts are needed to improve patient care.
