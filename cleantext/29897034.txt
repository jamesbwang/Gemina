  Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and stress/trauma exposure are cross-sectionally associated with advanced DNA methylation age relative to chronological age. However , longitudinal inquiry and examination of associations between advanced DNA methylation age and a broader range of psychiatric disorders is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine if PTSD , depression<symptom> , generalized anxiety<symptom> , and alcohol-use disorders predicted acceleration of DNA methylation age over time ( i.e. an increasing pace , or rate of advancement , of the epigenetic clock). Genome-wide DNA methylation and a comprehensive set of psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses were assessed in 179 Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans who completed two assessments over the course of approximately 2 years. Two DNA methylation age indices ( Horvath and Hannum) , each a weighted index of an array of genome-wide DNA methylation probes , were quantified. The pace of the epigenetic clock was operationalized as change in DNA methylation age as a function of time between assessments. Analyses revealed that alcohol-use disorders ( p = 0.001) and PTSD avoidance and numbing symptoms ( p = 0.02) at Time 1 were associated with an increasing pace of the epigenetic clock over time , per the Horvath ( but not the Hannum) index of cellular aging. This is the first study to suggest that posttraumatic psychopathology is longitudinally associated with a quickened pace of the epigenetic clock. Results raise the possibility that accelerated cellular aging is a common biological consequence of stress-related psychopathology , which carries implications for identifying mechanisms of stress-related cellular aging and developing interventions to slow its pace.
