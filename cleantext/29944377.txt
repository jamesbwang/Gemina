  Superhydrophobic surfaces have gained a reputation to show a self-cleaning behavior ( `` Lotus effect '') as drops rolling off the surface take along loosely adhering dust particles. However , this self-cleaning process reaches its limits when such surfaces are brought in contact with sticky contaminants such as oils and smaller particles. Once intimate contact is established between the surface and a small particle , it will be almost impossible to remove it because of strong surface interactions. Such contaminations , however , lead to contact line pinning and destroy the superhydrophobic effect. Because the fragility of the micro- and nanostructures prohibits any mechanical cleaning , the sample is usually doomed. Here , we report a universal method for restoring superhydrophobicity: by simple dip-coating , a conformal ultrathin layer ( â‰ˆ 10 nm) of a highly hydrophobic and photoreactive fluoropolymer is deposited. Through short UV irradiation ( 5 min) , this thin layer is cross-linked and chemically attached to the underlying surface by C,H-insertion cross-linking , thus covering the contaminant like a thin veil. We use this `` cover-up '' strategy of masking the contaminants to restore superhydrophobicity. We demonstrate this principle by deliberately soiling the surface with various model contaminants , such as oily substances and particles , and study the repair process.
