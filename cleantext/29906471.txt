  Plant bioactives can potentially benefit herbivores through their effects on health and nutrition. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of polyphenols and terpenes on the ability of lambs to self-select these compounds when challenged by a parasitic infection and the subsequent impact on their health and productivity. Thirty-five lambs were housed in individual pens and assigned to five treatment groups ( 7 animals/group) , where they received: 1) A basal diet of beet pulp: soybean meal ( 90:10) ( CONTROL); 2) The same diet , but containing 0.3 % of bioactive natural plant compounds extracted from grape , olive and pomegranate ( BNP); 3) A simultaneous offer of the diets offered to the Control and BNP groups ( Choice-Parasitized; CHP-1); 4) The Control diet , and when lambs developed a parasitic infection , the choice described for CHP-1 ( CHP-2); and 5) The same choice as CHP-1 , but animals did not experience a parasitic burden ( Choice-Non-Parasitized; CHNP). Lambs , except CHNP , were dosed with 10,000 L
