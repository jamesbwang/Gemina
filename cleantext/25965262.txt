  Galaxy HiCExplorer is a web server that facilitates the study of the 3D conformation of chromatin by allowing Hi-C data processing , analysis and visualization. With the Galaxy HiCExplorer web server , users with little bioinformatic background can perform every step of the analysis in one workflow: mapping of the raw sequence data , creation of Hi-C contact matrices , quality assessment , correction of contact matrices and identification of topological associated domains ( TADs) and A/B compartments. Users can create publication ready plots of the contact matrix , A/B compartments , and TADs on a selected genomic locus , along with additional information like gene tracks or ChIP-seq signals. Galaxy HiCExplorer is freely usable at: https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu and is available as a Docker container: https://github.com/deeptools/docker-galaxy-hicexplorer.
