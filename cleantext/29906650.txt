  Premature chromosome condensation ( PCC) involves induction of near-chromosome-like morphology to interphase chromatin. Experimental induction of PCC was achieved by somatic cell hybridization ( SCH) , an approach which evolved into a chemical-induction process. PCC presents most probably the only way in which cytogenetic assessment of damages can be analyzed in special situations such as availability of limited numbers of sample cells and for cells which have lost their ability to divide. Initial experiments on PCC were reported in late 1960s and the technique has evolved into one with wide range of applications owing to its increased efficiency in detecting primary DNA damages. Biodosimetry remains as the primary area which utilizes PCC technique to the maximum efficiency with several multiple-groups participating in collaborative exercises for biodosimetric applications. However , in spite of the advantages that the technique offers , it is yet to reach its full potential. This is due to the inherent limitations of the manner in which PCC is induced currently; by the somatic cell hybridization and chemical-induction processes. An approach which combines these two would sure help in taking PCC to its highest potential as the preferred technique for assessment of primary DNA damages. We present the chronological events of evolution of the PCC technique along with its applications. Also , the limitations of the technique along with the suggestions for further refinement of the PCC technique are discussed.
