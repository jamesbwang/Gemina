  Placement of inferior vena cava ( IVC) filters is a controversial focus of medical malpractice. Clinicians currently have little information to guide them regarding key issues and outcomes in litigation. In this retrospective legal case review , we analyzed the factors associated with malpractice actions involving IVC filters. The legal databases LexisNexis and Westlaw were searched from 1967 to 2016 for all published legal cases in the United States involving placement of IVC filters. Keywords included `` IVC , '' `` inferior vena cava , '' `` filter , '' and `` malpractice. '' Social Security Disability claims , product liability actions , and hospital employment contract disputes were excluded. There were 310 search results eligible for initial review. After application of exclusion criteria , 29 cases involving medical malpractice were included in final analysis. The majority of excluded cases were insurance disputes and tax revenue cases. Overall , private practitioners were most often sued ( 11/29 ( 37.9 %)) , whereas 24.1 % of defendants were academic hospitals ( 7/29) , 20.7 % were prisons ( 6/29) , and 17.2 % were community hospitals ( 5/29). The most common specialty named was vascular surgery ( 8/29) , whereas interventional radiologists were named only twice. The most common indications for IVC filter placement were hypercoagulable state ( 8/29 ( 29.6 %)) , recurrent pulmonary embolism ( PE; 6/29 ( 22.2 %)) , and trauma ( 5/29 ( 18.5 %)). The most common underlying allegations involved failure to insert IVC filter when indicated ( 14/29 ( 48.3 %)) , intraprocedural negligence ( 5/29 ( 17.2 %)) , and failure to timely remove device ( 5/29 ( 17.2 %)). Common complications included failure to prevent occurrence of PE ( 14/29 ( 48.3 %)) , device migration ( 4/29 ( 13.8 %)) , and perforation of organs or vasculature ( 3/29 ( 10.3 %)). Death of the patient occurred in 41.4 % of total cases ( 12/29). In cases in which the patient died , the most common indications for filter placement were trauma ( 4/12 ( 33.3 %)) and deep venous thrombosis ( 3/12 ( 25.0 %)) , and the most common complication in those patients who died was the failure to prevent a subsequent PE ( 9/12 ( 75.0 %)). Available verdicts favored defendants ( 13/14 ( 92.9 %)). In cases with defense verdicts , the most common indications for filter placement similarly were trauma ( 4/13 ( 30.8 %)) and deep venous thrombosis ( 3/13 ( 23.1 %)) , and the most common complication was failure to prevent PE ( 9/14 ( 64.3 %)). Analysis of malpractice cases involving IVC filters revealed key factors associated with litigation. Overall , verdicts favored defendants. Private practitioners were most commonly sued , and the most common reasons for bringing suit were failure to insert filter , intraprocedural complications , and failure to remove filter. Deeper awareness of issues related to malpractice litigation can inform clinical practice and improve patient care and safety.
