  Lymphoedema is a frequent condition after surgical treatment for breast cancer. Lymphoedema causes great discomfort for the patients and is primarily treated conservatively with compression garments and physical therapy. Recently , surgical interventions have gained popularity in the form of lympho-lymphatic anastomoses , lympho-venous anastomoses and autologous lymph node transplantation , either as stand-alone treatment or in combination with secondary breast reconstruction. In Denmark , lympho-venous anastomoses is currently the primary surgical treatment for lymphoedema.
