  RUNX1 overlapping RNA ( RUNXOR) is a long non-coding RNA that has been indicated as a key regulator in the development of myeloid cells by targeting runt-related transcription factor 1 ( RUNX1). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of immature granulocytes and monocytes with immunosuppression. However , the impact of lncRNA RUNXOR on the development of MDSCs remains unknown. Both the expressions of RUNXOR and RUNX1 in the peripheral blood were measured by qRT-PCR. Human MDSCs used in this study were isolated from tumor tissue of patients with lung cancer by FCM or induced from PBMCs of healthy donors with IL-1Î² + GM-CSF. Specific siRNA was used to knockdown the expression of RUNXOR in MDSCs. In this study , we found that the lncRNA RUNXOR was upregulated in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients. In addition , as a target gene of RUNXOR , the expression of RUNX1 was downregulated in lung cancer patients. Finally , the expression of RUNXOR was higher in MDSCs isolated from the tumor tissues of lung cancer patients compared with cells from adjacent tissue. In addition , RUNXOR knockdown decreased Arg1 expression in MDSCs. Based on our findings , it is illustrated that RUNXOR is significantly associated with the immunosuppression induced by MDSCs in lung cancer patients and may be a target of anti-tumor therapy.
