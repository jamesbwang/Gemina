  Membrane-bound sialidases in the mouse thymus are unique and mysterious because their activity at pH 6.5 is equal to or higher than that in the acidic region. The pH curve like this has never been reported in membrane-bound form. To clarify this enzyme , we studied the sialidase activities of crude membrane fractions from immature-T , mature-T and non-T cells from C57BL/6 mice and from SM/J mice , a strain with a defect in NEU1 activity. Non-T cells from C57BL/6 mice had high activity at pH 6.5 , but those from SM/J mice did not. Neu1 and Neu3 mRNA was shown by real-time PCR to be expressed in T cells and also in non-T cells , whereas Neu2 was expressed mainly in non-T cells and Neu4 was scarcely expressed. However , the in situ hybridization study on the localization of four sialidases in the thymus showed that Neu4 was clearly expressed. We then focused on a sialidase on the thymocyte surface because the possibility of the existence of a sialidase on thymocytes was suggested by peanut agglutinin ( PNA) staining after incubation of the cells alone in PBS. This activity was inhibited by NEU1-selective sialidase inhibitor C9-butyl-amide-2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid. The natural substrate for the cell surface sialidase was identified as clustered differentiation 5 ( CD5) by PNA-blot analysis of anti-CD5 immunoprecipitate. We conclude that NEU1 exists on the cell surface of mouse thymocytes and CD5 is a natural substrate for it. Although this is not the main reaction of the membrane-bound thymus-sialidases , it must be important for the thymus.
