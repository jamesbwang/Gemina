  Alzheimer 's disease , the most common cause of dementia , is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by amyloid-beta deposits in extracellular plaques , intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated tau , synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. There are no cures for AD and current medications only alleviate some disease symptoms. Transgenic rodent models to study Alzheimer 's mimic features of human<disease> disease<disease> such as age-dependent accumulation of abnormal beta-amyloid and tau , synaptic dysfunction , cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration. These models have proven vital for improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and for identifying promising therapeutic approaches. However , modelling neurodegenerative disease in animals commonly involves aging animals until they develop harmful phenotypes , often coupled with invasive procedures.
