  Dietary fiber may play a role in obesity prevention through reduction of body<symptom> weight and control of appetite<symptom> , however , not all fibers are created equally , and characteristics of fiber such as viscosity , fermentability and solubility may affect appetite<symptom> differently. Although early studies supported that fructan fibers , including inulin , fructooligosaccharides , and oligofructose affected satiety , more recent studies are less supportive. We found that a higher dose of fiber such as oligofructose ( 16 g/day) is needed and for a longer duration ( 12-16 weeks) to detect differences in appetite<symptom> and subsequent energy intake , whereas , practical amounts of fructooligosaccharides , less than 10 g/day , generally do not affect satiety or food intake. It should be noted that there are many sources of fructan fibers , both in native foods , chicory roots , agave , and Jerusalem artichokes and isolated forms that vary in chain length. Fructan fibers , which include fructooligosaccharides , oligofructose , and inulin , provided in low doses ( < 10 g/day) , generally do not affect measures of human appetite<symptom> including satiety or food intake and should not be recommended as a fiber with sole satiating power.
