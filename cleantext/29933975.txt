  To evaluate transgender patient care , gender inclusivity , and transgender health-related policies at breast imaging facilities across the United States. A survey on breast imaging facilities ' policies and practices regarding transgender care was distributed to the membership of the Society of Breast Imaging , consisting of approximately 2,500 breast radiologists across the United States. The survey was conducted by e-mail in January 2018. There were 144 survey respondents. Responses showed that 78.5 % of facilities have gender-neutral patient bathrooms , 9.0 % have a separate waiting area for transgender patients , and 76.4 % do not have dominant pink hues in their facilities , although 54.2 % have displays with female gender content. Also , 58.0 % of intake forms do not ask patients to provide their gender identity , although 25.9 % automatically populate with female phrases. Within the electronic health record , 32.9 % lack a distinct place to record patients ' preferred names and 54.9 % lack a distinct place to record patients ' gender pronouns. The majority ( 73.4 %) do not have explicit policies related to the care of transgender patients. Only 14.7 % of facilities offer lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender training. Our national survey demonstrates that many breast imaging facilities do not have structures in place to consistently use patients ' preferred names and pronouns , nor provide inclusive environments for transgender patients. All breast imaging facilities should recognize the ways in which their practices may intensify discrimination , exclusivity , and stigma for transgender patients and should seek to improve their transgender health competencies and foster more inclusive environments.
