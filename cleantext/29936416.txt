  Peritoneal B1a cells attenuate atherosclerosis by secreting natural polyclonal immunoglobulin M ( IgM). Regulatory B cells expressing T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 ( TIM-1) expanded through TIM-1 ligation by anti-TIM-1 monoclonal antibody ( RMT1-10) induces immune tolerance. We examined the capacity of RMT1-10 to expand peritoneal B1a cells to prevent atherosclerosis development and retard progression of established atherosclerosis. RMT1-10 treatment selectively doubled peritoneal B1a cells , tripled TIM-1 RMT1-10 treatment attenuates atherosclerosis development and progression by selectively expanding IgM producing atheroprotective B1a cells. Antibody-based in vivo expansion of B1a cells could be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis.
