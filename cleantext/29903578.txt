  In general , stable type B ankle fractures are treated conservatively with cast immobilization or a walking boot during six weeks. Some disadvantages of casting are joint stiffness , muscle wasting and lack of comfort. This study was designed to evaluate whether functional treatment with a removable brace is a safe and more comfortable alternative. Randomized controlled trial. In the period March 2013- May 2015 , 44 patients visiting the emergency department due to a stable type B ankle fracture were included. During the first week both groups received a splint. After one week the patients were randomized: one group received a cast , the other a removable brace. For outcome Olerud & Molander Ankle Score , Visual Analogue Score for comfort and pain , American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS) Foot and Ankle score questionnaire , EuroQol-5D and range of motion were used. 44 patients participated ( 21 cast , 23 brace). There were no differences in baseline characteristics. After 6 weeks , VAS for comfort ( cast vs brace; 5.74 vs 7.21; p = 0.02) and total range of motion ( 40 ° vs 49 °; p = 0.00) showed significant differences in favour of the brace. VAS pain ( 3.15 vs 2.05; p = 0.16) , OMA-score ( 51.75 vs 61.32; p = 0.22) en EuroQoL-5D ( 7.26 vs 6.74; p = 0.33) did not show significant differences. Week 52 showed no significant differences at OMA-score ( 89.29 vs 96.18; p = 0.16) , EuroQoL-5D ( 6.00 vs 5.35; p = 0.15) , VAS pain ( 1.07 vs 0.82; p = 0.69) and AAOS score ( 91.71 vs 96.06; p = 0.21). No complications occurred in both groups. Functional bracing showed significant differences for the VAS comfort score and range of motion at 6 weeks compared to casting. After a year no significant differences were found. Treatment with a brace is a safe and more comfortable option for stable type B ankle fractures.
