  Cell division is a fundamental biological process governed by molecular networks that are initiated in the apical meristems of plants. l-ascorbic acid ( AsA) commonly known as vitamin C is a crucial molecular modulator involved in cell proliferation. In this study , we used AsA application to Arabidopsis and four AsA pathway mutants to investigate the influence of AsA on the root apical meristem ( RAM) and root growth. Treatment of seeds of wild-type Col-0 with AsA prior to sowing showed a significant increase in the activity of cell division of the RAM , root growth rate and root length when compared with untreated seeds. Seedlings of the AsA pathway mutant vtc1-1 showed a significant reduction in the level of AsA and a significant increase in the number of quiescent cells in the RAM when compared with Col-0. Cell proliferation was reduced in the AsA pathway mutants vtc1-1 , dhar1 , vtc5-1 , apx1 , respectively , however , root growth decreased significantly only in vtc1-1 when compared with Col-0. In addition , hydrogen peroxide ( H
