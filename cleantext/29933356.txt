Influence of different treadmill inclinations on V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max and ventilatory thresholds during maximal ramp protocols. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Ramp protocols for cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET) lack precise recommendations , including optimal treadmill inclination. This study investigated the impact of treadmill grades applied in ramp CPETs on maximal oxygen uptake ( V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max) , ventilatory thresholds ( VT1/VT2) , and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 vs. workload relationship. Twenty-one healthy men ( age 33 ± 8 years; height 176.6 ± 5.8 cm; body mass 80.4 ± 8.7 kg; and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max 44.9 ± 5.7 ml · kg · min) and 12 women ( age 29 ± 7 years; height 163.3 ± 6.7 cm; body mass 56.6 ± 6.3 kg; and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max 39.4 ± 4.9 ml · kg · min) underwent ramp CPETs with similar speed increments and different treadmill grades: CPET0 % , CPET2 % , CPET3 .5 % , and CPET5 .5 %. The V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max was similar across protocols ( 42.8-43.2 ml · kg · min , p = 0.76) , albeit duration of CPETs shortened when treadmill inclination increased ( CPET0 % 12.7 minutes; CPET2 % 9.1 minutes; CPET3 .5 % 8.0 minutes; and CPET5 .5 % 6.6 minutes; p < 0.01). The % V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max corresponding to VT1 was slightly lower in CPET0 % ( 63.6 %) and higher in CPET5 .5 % ( 75.8 %) vs. CPET2 % ( 67.8 %) and CPET3 .5 % ( 69.5 %; p < 0.05) , whereas VT2 was not affected by treadmill inclination ( 95.1-95.8 % V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max; p > 0.05). V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max and ventilatory thresholds were similar in CPETs performed with different treadmill inclinations and similar initial/final speeds. However , linear regressions between workload and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 were closer to the identity line in CPETs performed with smaller ( CPET0 % and CPET2 %) than with greater ( CPET3 .5 % and CPET5 .5 %) inclinations. These data suggest that in healthy young adults , ramp CPETs performed with inclinations of 0-2 % degree should be preferred over protocols with greater inclinations.
