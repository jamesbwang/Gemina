  The neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES) parameters that optimally modulate torque output during prolonged stimulation protocols are not well-established. The purpose of this study was to compare torque output between low-frequency and high-frequency NMES protocols while increasing stimulation intensity. Eleven healthy young individuals received a repetitive , intermittent low-frequency ( 20 Hz) and high-frequency ( 60 Hz) NMES over the quadriceps muscles. Stimulation intensity was increased throughout the protocol to achieve a submaximal target torque output. Mean torque , peak torque and torque-time integral ( TTI) were measured. The 20 Hz protocol produced a higher mean torque ( P = 0.001) and TTI ( P = 0.008) compared to the 60 Hz protocol. The stimulation intensity required to achieve target torque during NMES was not different between frequencies ( P > 0.0001). When the goal is to optimize torque output during prolonged submaximal NMES , such as during functional electrical stimulation , low-frequency stimulation may be preferred.
