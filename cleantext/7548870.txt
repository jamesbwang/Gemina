  Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( Three studies were conducted to evaluate AVP for prescription of one voxel: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. First , we evaluated how robust AVP was to ` extreme ' subject head positions/angulations within the scanner head coil. Second , subjects ( N = 13) were recruited and underwent MR scans. Manual voxel prescription ( n = 5) was contrasted with AVP ( n = 8). A subset of AVP subjects ( n = 4) completed a second scan. Third , ongoing data collection ( n = 16; recruited for a separate study) helped evaluate AVP. Voxel placement accuracy was quantified as 3D geometric voxel overlap percentage between each subject 's voxel and the template voxel. Reliability was quantified as 3D geometric voxel overlap percentage across subjects at each time point and within subjects who completed two scans. Results demonstrated that AVP was robust to ` extreme ' head positions ( 97.5 %- 97.9 % overlap with the template voxel). AVP was significantly more accurate ( baseline and follow-up: 96.2 % ± 3.0 % and 97.6 % ± 1.4 % overlap) than manual voxel placement ( 67.7 % ± 22.8 % overlap; These pilot studies demonstrated that AVP was feasible , accurate , and reliable method for automated single voxel coregistration.
