  The aim of the study was to determine the correlation and concordance between the primary glomerular filtration rate estimated by the MDRD-6 ( Modification of Diet in Renal Disease , ( mL/min/1 .73 m2) equation and the creatinine clearance in 24-hour urine ( DCr.mL/ min) by conventional method. Retrospective , observational and comparative study. We studied 180 patients , were quantified in serum: creatinine ( Cr) , urea nitrogen ( BUN) albumin ( Alb) and , in urine for 24 hours: creatinine ( Cr). The calculation of the primary glomerular filtration was made with the equation MDRD-6 ( mL/min/1 .73 m2) and for the creatinine clearance in urine and 24 hours the equation of the conventional method ( mL/min). The comparison of methods was calculated with the correlation coefficient of Person and the agreement with the unweighted Kappa test using the Landis and Koch classification. The correlation obtained between both methods was r2 = 0.4238 with a value p = < 0.0001 , the strength of agreement between both Kappa methods = 0.1631. The primary glomerular filtration estimated by the MDRD-6 equation ( mL/min/1 .73 m2) and the creatinine clearance in urine of 24 hours estimated by the conventional method equation ( mL/min) have a poor correlation and poor agreement.
