  Five Pinto bean peptides with α-amylase and angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitory activities were successfully identified using the integrated bioinformatics approach. By using PEAKS studio , 511 peptide sequences were first shortlisted based on their de novo sequence property and average local confidence ( ALC) yield of ≥ 60 %. Subsequently , only five peptides were found to have high potential ( score ≥ 0.80) for contributing bioactivy. The important sites which were potentially bound by the peptides: ( a) Trp58 , Trp59 , Tyr 62 , Asp96 , Arg195 , Asp197 , Glu233 , His299 , Asp300 and His305 for α-amylase; ( b) His353 , Ala354 , His383 , Glu384 , His387 , Glu411 , Lys511 , His513 , Tyr520 and Tyr523 for ACE had corresponded to the catalytic and substrate binding sites of the two enzymes. A validation assay was then conducted and IC
