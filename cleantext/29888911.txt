  This work describes the development of an integrated analytical system that enables high-throughput density measurements of diamagnetic particles ( including cells) using magnetic levitation ( MagLev) , 96-well plates , and a flatbed scanner. MagLev is a simple and useful technique with which to carry out density-based analysis and separation of a broad range of diamagnetic materials with different physical forms ( e.g. , liquids , solids , gels , pastes , gums<symptom> , etc.); one major limitation , however , is the capacity to perform high-throughput density measurements. This work addresses this limitation by ( i) re-engineering the shape of the magnetic fields so that the MagLev system is compatible with 96-well plates , and ( ii) integrating a flatbed scanner ( and simple optical components) to carry out imaging of the samples that levitate in the system. The resulting system is compatible with both biological samples ( human erythrocytes) and nonbiological samples ( simple liquids and solids , such as 3-chlorotoluene , cholesterol crystals , glass beads , copper powder , and polymer beads). The high-throughput capacity of this integrated MagLev system will enable new applications in chemistry ( e.g. , analysis and separation of materials) and biochemistry ( e.g. , cellular responses under environmental stresses) in a simple and label-free format on the basis of a universal property of all matter , i.e. , density.
