  A diastereoselective approach for the synthesis of the hydroperoxide-keto form of ( Â±)- steenkrotin B ( 2 ') is described. The key features of the strategy involve a Diels-Alder cycloaddition , a titanium ( III)- catalyzed reductive annulation , and a regio- and diastereoselective hydroperoxidation.
