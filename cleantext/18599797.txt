  Trails aimed at raising high density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol concentration failed to make better cardiovascular outcomes. HDL particles may be better biomarkers reflecting properties of HDL. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relation between blood HDL particles level and cardiovascular events. PubMed and other databases were searched for eligible studies and NewCastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale ( NOS) was used to assess the quality of included studies. A random or fixed-effect model was applied to calculate the pooled hazard ratio ( HR). Twelve studies were finally included. The pooled HR ( 95 % confidence interval) for per standard deviation ( SD) increment and top quartile versus bottom quartile were 0.79 ( 0.72,0.86) and 0.65 ( 0.57,0.75) , respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that HR was significantly lower in subjects with a cardiovascular disease ( CVD) history than that of people without established CVD. Subclass analysis indicated that HRs for per SD increment of small ( 0.85) and medium ( 0.84) HDL particles were significantly lower than that of large HDL particles ( 0.96). HDL particle level in blood was inversely related to CVD events , indicating that HDL particles maybe a protective factor in patients with CVD , thus making HDL particles a potential biomarker and therapy target.
