  Scarred uterus is caused by cesarean section surgery , and this condition affects further gestation and delivery in patients. Previous evidence suggested that resveratrol , a polyphenol compound , presents beneficial outcomes for patients with scarred uterus. Therefore , the aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of resveratrol in the treatment of patients with scarred uterus. The efficacy of resveratrol in the formation of new vessels and re-epithelialization of the endometrium was analyzed. The present results demonstrated that resveratrol treatment reduced uterus scarring in the majority of patients ( 87.36 %) compared with the control. It was also observed that the plasma levels of Î²-human chorionic gonadotropin were downregulated by resveratrol treatment in patients with scarred uterus. Furthermore , resveratrol treatment promoted the remodeling of the scarred uterus , the regeneration of the endometrium and improved pregnancy outcomes. In conclusion , the findings of the current study indicate that resveratrol treatment may be a potential strategy for the treatment of scarred uterus patients , which contributes to the improvement of pregnancy outcomes.
