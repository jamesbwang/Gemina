  Expanded newborn screening ( ENBS) utilizing tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS) for inborn metabolic diseases ( IMDs) , such as organic acidemias ( OAs) , fatty acid oxidation disorders , ( FAODs) , and amino acid disorders ( AAs) , is increasingly popular but has not yet been introduced in many Asian countries. This study aimed to determine the incidence rates of OAs , FAODs , and AAs in Asian countries and Germany using selective screening and ENBS records. Selective screening for IMDs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and MS/MS was performed among patients suspected to be afflicted in Asian countries ( including Japan , Vietnam , China , and India) between 2000 and 2015 , and the results from different countries were compared. Similarly , ENBS results from Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , and Germany were compared. Additionally , the results of selective screening and ENBS in Japan were compared. Among 39,270 patients who underwent selective screening , IMDs were detected in 1170. Methylmalonic acidemia was frequently identified in several countries , including Japan ( 81/377 diagnosed IMDs) , China ( 94/216 IMDs) , and India ( 72/293 IMDs). In Vietnam , however , Î²-ketothiolase deficiency was particularly frequent ( 33/250 IMDs). ENBS yielded differences in overall IMD rates by country: 1:8557 in Japan , 1:7030 in Taiwan , 1:13,205 in South Korea , and 1:2200 in Germany. Frequently discovered diseases included propionic acidemia ( PPA) and phenylketonuria ( PKU) in Japan , 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency ( MCCD) and PKU in Taiwan , MCCD and citrullinemia type I in South Korea , and PKU and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in Germany. Furthermore , in Japan , selective screening and ENBS yielded respective PPA frequencies of 14.7 % and 49.4 % among all organic acidemias. The incidence rates of IMDs vary by country. Moreover , the disease spectra of IMDs detected via selective screening differ from those detected via ENBS.
