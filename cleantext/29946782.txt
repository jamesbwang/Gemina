  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) , a major component of the tumor microenvironment ( TME) , play an important role in cancer initiation , progression , and metastasis. Recent findings have demonstrated that the TME not only provides physical support for cancer cells , but also directs cell-to-cell interactions ( in this case the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs). As cancer progresses , the CAFs also co evolve-- transitioning from an inactivated state to an activated state. The elucidation and understanding of the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs will pave the way for new cancer therapies ( 1-- 3). The TME is a heterogeneous environment consisting of fibroblasts , tumor-associated macrophages , adipocytes , an extracellular matrix , and mesenchymal stem cells ( 4). The exact composition of each stroma varies depending on cancer and tissue type. To add to this variation , there is heterogeneity even within the CAF population itself. Different CAFs express different markers and influence stromal pro-tumorigenic capacity and cancer progression in diverse ways ( 5 , 6).
