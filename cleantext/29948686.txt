  Vegetation restoration is one of the most effective measures to restore degraded ecosystem in mining wasteland. A field experiment was conducted to study the effects of some site treatments ' three different approaches on the benefits of selective vegetation in the manganese mine. Three different approaches included ( 1) exposed tailings , the control treatment ( tailing site); ( 2) soil covering of 10-cm thickness ( external-soil site) , and ( 3) soil covering of 10-cm thickness , soil ameliorating ( adding fowl dung) , and seeding propagation of Cynodon dactylon ( Linn.) Pers. ( rehabilitation site). The results indicated that 18 herb species were taken from 8 families and 4 woody plants in three sites after 1 year. After 3 years , 29 species from 14 families were observed in 3 sites. Meanwhile , compared with tailing site , the plant species of rehabilitation site was more than tailing site , and the plant abundance of external-soil site was similar to rehabilitation site. It was worthy to be mentioned that the plant species of external-soil site and rehabilitation site had a better effect on the plant community coverage of herb layer as compared with tailing site. In summary , the plant species of rehabilitation site had the most species diversity and could be recommended as the ve-restoration modes in manganese tail wasteland.
