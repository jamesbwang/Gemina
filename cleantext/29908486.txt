  Radiation therapy has been widely utilized as an effective method to eliminate malignant tumors and cancerous cells. However , subjection of healthy tissues and the related networks of blood vessels adjacent to the tumor area to irradiation is inevitable. The aim of this study was to investigate the consequent effects of fractionation radiotherapy on the mechanical characteristics of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) through alterations in cytoskeleton organization and cell and nucleus morphology. In order to simulate the clinical condition of radiotherapy , the HUVECs were exposed to the specific dose of 2 Gy for 1-4 times among four groups with incremental total dose from 2 Gy up to 8 Gy. Fluorescence staining was performed to label F-actin filaments and nuclei. Micropipette aspiration and standard linear solid model were employed to evaluate the elastic and viscoelastic characteristics of the HUVECs. Radiotherapy significantly increased cell elastic moduli. Due to irradiation , instantaneous and equilibrium Young 's modulus were also increased. Radiotherapy diminished HUVECs viscoelastic behavior and shifted their creep compliance curves downward. Furthermore , gamma irradiation elevated the nuclei sizes and to a lesser extent the cells sizes resulting in the accumulation of F-actin filaments within the rest of cell body. Endothelial stiffening correlates with endothelial dysfunction , hence the results may be helpful when the consequent effects of radiotherapy are the focus of concern.
