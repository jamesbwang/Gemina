  A 76-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to massive gingival bleeding following teeth extraction. Laboratory findings suggested disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( DIC). Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging disclosed multiple hypervascular liver masses of 2-6 cm in diameter , the largest of which displaying an irregular enhancement pattern. We considered that her DIC was caused by the multiple liver masses and commenced repeated erythrocyte/fresh frozen plasma infusi√≥n and gabexate mesilate administration. However , the DIC proved uncontrollable and trans-arterial embolization could not be attempted. The patient eventually died 4 months after admission due to spontaneous hepatic tumor rupture and hepatic failure. Post-mortem hepatic tumor biopsy led to a final diagnosis of hepatic angiosarcoma with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon ( KMP). Among the 7 cases of hepatic angiosarcoma representing KMP found in the literature , mortality occurred within 4 months of the appearance of bleeding tendency primarily due to abdominal<symptom> bleeding<symptom> and hepatic failure. The possibility of hepatic angiosarcoma should be considered in patients with DIC and hypervascular liver tumors. Since treatment is uncertain and prognosis is poor , novel diagnostic and therapeutic advances are needed for angiosarcoma.
