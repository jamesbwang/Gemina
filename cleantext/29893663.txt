  Genetic variants associated with dietary intake may be important as factors underlying the development of obesity. We investigated the associations between the obesity candidate genes ( fat mass and obesity-associated ( FTO) , melanocortin-4 receptor ( MC4R) , leptin ( LEP) and leptin receptor) and total energy intake and percentage of energy from macronutrients and ultra-processed foods before and during pregnancy. A sample of 149 pregnant women was followed up in a prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. A FFQ was administered at 5-13 and 30-36 weeks of gestation. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR. Associations between polymorphisms and the outcomes were investigated through multiple linear regression and ANCOVA having pre-pregnancy dietary intake as a covariate. The A-allele of FTO-rs9939609 was associated with a -6 · 5 % ( 95 % CI -12 · 3 , -0 · 4) decrease in the percentage of energy from protein and positively associated with the percentage of energy from carbohydrates before pregnancy ( β = 2 · 6; 95 % CI 0 · 5 , 4 · 8) and with a 13 · 3 % ( 95 % CI 0 · 7 , 27 · 5) increase in the total energy intake during pregnancy. The C-allele of MC4R-rs17782313 was associated with a -7 · 6 % ( 95 % CI -13 · 8 , -1 · 0) decrease in the percentage of energy from protein , and positively associated with the percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods ( β = 5 · 4; 95 % CI 1 · 1 , 9 · 8) during pregnancy. ANCOVA results revealed changes in dietary intake from pre-pregnancy to pregnancy for FTO-rs9939609 ( percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods , P = 0 · 03) , MC4R-rs17782313 ( total energy intake , P = 0 · 02) and LEP-rs7799039 ( total energy intake , P = 0 · 04; percentage of energy from protein , P = 0 · 04). These findings suggest significant associations between FTO-rs9939609 , MC4R-rs17782313 and LEP-rs7799039 genes and the components of dietary intake in pregnant women.
