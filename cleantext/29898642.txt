  Both glycolysis and mitochondrial energetics are targets of interest for developing antiproliferative cancer therapeutics. We developed a novel multiple-read assay based on long-term expression in K562 cells of a genetically encoded intramolecular FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer sensor for adenosine triphosphate ( ATP). The assay , conducted in a fluorescent plate reader , can identify compounds that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production , glycolysis , or both after short-term treatment. We screened a National Cancer Institute ( NCI) compound library , identifying inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production and glycolysis. Three glycolysis inhibitors blocked hexokinase activity , demonstrating that our assay can serve as the initial step in a workflow to identify compounds that inhibit glycolysis via a defined desired mechanism. Finally , upon reviewing the literature , we found surprisingly little evidence that inhibiting glycolysis with small molecules is antiproliferative. Using NCI data on proliferation of K562 cells , we found that inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation-dependent ATP production were no more antiproliferative than the overall library , whereas all glycolysis inhibitors were in the top third of most effective antiproliferative compounds. Our results thus present a powerful new way to screen for compounds that affect cellular metabolism and also provide important support for the idea that blocking glycosis is antiproliferative.
