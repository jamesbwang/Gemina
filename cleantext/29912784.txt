  Despite an increase in the proportion of nonagenarians in demographic structure , there is still a paucity of data on the utilization and outcome of percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCIs) in this population. Also , very old patients are under-represented in randomized clinical trials and their treatment is still an emerging challenge. Thus , we sought to compare patient profiles and periprocedural outcomes of PCI in nonagenarians and patients younger than 90 years. Data were based on the Polish National Registry of PCI ( ORPKI). A total of 651080 consecutive patients with stable angina ( SA) ( n = 260920) or acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) ( n = 390160) undergoing PCI with at least one stent implanted were included. Patients were stratified according to age ( < 90 and â‰¥ 90 years). Of all included patients , 4413 ( 0.7 %) were older than or equal to 90 years. A similar rate of periprocedural complications was observed in both groups. However , cardiac arrest during both angiography and PCI occurred more often in nonagenarians ( 0.21 vs. 0.83 %; 0.42 vs. 1.07 % , respectively , for both P = 0.001). Similarly , periprocedural mortality was higher in patients older than or equal to 90 years ( 0.27 vs. 1.88 %; P = 0.001). There were no differences in periprocedural outcomes between groups in the SA setting. However , a higher rate of periprocedural cardiac arrest ( 1971 ( 0.51 %) vs. 43 ( 1.15 %); P = 0.001) and mortality ( 1622 ( 0.42 %) vs. 83 ( 2.2 %); P = 0.001) were observed in nonagenarians compared with younger counterparts admitted with ACS. Nonagenarians undergoing PCI because of SA may have similar outcomes as patients younger than 90 years. In ACS presentation , they may have worse outcomes than younger counterparts.
