  Chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU) is a challenging condition to treat and it significantly affects quality of life. Bacterial , viral , parasitic , and fungal infections have been associated with triggering and/or perpetuating urticaria in certain individuals. There is a paucity of literature on CSU associated with Malassezia<pathogen> infection. We present a case series of five patients with CSU without angioedema in whom we observed temporal association of Malassezia infection with CSU. The presence of Malassezia was confirmed by clinical examination , Wood 's lamp , and KOH examination. The patients with CSU experienced improvement after specific antifungal therapy. Malassezia<pathogen> infection may be associated with recurrent and chronic urticaria in a certain group of susceptible patients and thus specific targeted therapy against it might result in complete remission of urticaria along with clearing of the infection.
