  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and causes of spontaneous remission of obstructive jaundice in rats. Healthy male and female Wistar rats ( 180-220 g) were randomly assigned to receive common bile duct ligation ( CBDL) and transection ( group A) , CBDL only ( group B) , or CBD dissection without ligation or transection ( control group C; n = 36 in each group). There was a difference in eye and skin jaundice prevalence between groups A and B from 14 days after surgery. The level of total bilirubin ( TB) did not continue to increase in group A and began to decrease in the majority of rats in group B ( P < 0.05 vs. group B). At day 21 after surgery , the TB level returned to normal in group B and no significant difference was observed compared with group C. At day 21 after surgery , significant dilatation of bile ducts above the ligature was observed in group A following cholangiography with 38 % meglumine diatrizoate and this contrast agent did not spread to other sites. Slight dilatation of the proximal bile ducts was observed in group B and the contrast agent entered the intestinal lumen through the omental ducts adhering to the porta hepatis. After 14 days of surgery , there were 36 rats in group A and B , and 17 rats exhibited spontaneous regression of jaundice. Overall , 47.2 % ( 17/36) of rats experienced spontaneous remission of obstructive jaundice , 82.4 % ( 14/17) of which underwent ligation only. The spontaneous remission of jaundice may have been caused by shunting through very small bile ducts or omental ducts adhering to the porta hepatis. If a model of biliary obstruction is to be established in future research , a model of CBDL and transection is preferable. In this case , jaundice reduction surgery should be performed 14 days after establishment of the model.
