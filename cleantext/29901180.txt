  Multidrug resistance ( MDR) is a major impediment to cancer therapy. MG‑132 has been identified to be effective against MDR in several types of cancer. However , the mechanism of MG‑132 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas remains unknown. Based on our previous study , the present detected P‑gp and P‑gp expression in hypopharyngeal carcinoma FaDu cells , revealing that their expression was lower than that observed in the MDR cell line FaDu/T. To reverse the MDR of FaDu/T cells , the present study introduced MG‑132 and demonstrated that the high expression of P‑gp/ P‑gp in FaDu/T cells was attenuated in a time‑dependent manner. MG‑132 also strengthened the sensitivity of FaDu/T cells to multidrugs. c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase ( JNK) activation was further observed in FaDu/T cells. However , P‑gp/ P‑gp did not decrease when FaDu/T cells were pretreated with SP600125. These results indicated that MG‑132 reversed the MDR of hypopharyngeal carcinoma by downregulating P‑gp/ P‑gp , and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the activation the of the JNK signaling pathway.
