  Hepatic cysts<symptom> are the most frequent , innocuous , space-occupying lesions<symptom> of the liver. The majority of solitary liver cysts<symptom> are nonsymptomatic. When liver cysts<symptom> reach a large size , there are some complications , including infection , rupture , spontaneous hemorrhage<symptom> , obstructive jaundice , and neoplastic degeneration. Percutaneous aspiration , fenestration , hepatic resection , and liver transplantation have been proposed for symptomatic patients. In this case report , we describe a 41-year-old woman who presented with persistent liver dysfunction , indolent xanthochromia , and skin<symptom> itching<symptom> for 3 months. After a series of tests , she has a 5.0 Ã— 5.3 cm hepatic cyst<symptom> with many separations in the left medial liver lobe. The obstructive jaundice was caused by a large pedunculated lump protruding into the common bile duct from the left hepatic duct. She was treated with laparotomy and this lump was completely removed from the root by choledochoscopic needle-knife electrotomy with a good clinical response. Postoperative pathology of the lump suggested a hepatic cyst<symptom> wall without heterocysts or tumor cells. Hepatic cyst<symptom> wall protruding into the common bile duct can form capsular lump and result in indolent jaundice. Choledochoscopic high-frequency needle-knife electrotomy could be considered as a simple , safe and effective complementary approach for benign mass on the bile duct wall.
