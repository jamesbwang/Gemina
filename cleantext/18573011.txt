  It has been established that there is an interaction between audition and vision in the appraisal of our living environment , and that this appraisal is influenced by personal factors. Here , we test the hypothesis that audiovisual aptitude influences appraisal of our sonic and visual environment. To measure audiovisual aptitude , an auditory deviant detection experiment was conducted in an ecologically valid and complex context. This experiment allows us to distinguish between accurate and less accurate listeners. Additionally , it allows to distinguish between participants that are easily visually distracted and those who are not. To do so , two previously conducted laboratory experiments were re-analyzed. The first experiment focuses on self-reported noise annoyance in a living room context , whereas the second experiment focuses on the perceived pleasantness of using outdoor public spaces. In the first experiment , the influence of visibility of vegetation on self-reported noise annoyance was modified by audiovisual aptitude. In the second one , it was found that the overall appraisal of walking across a bridge is influenced by audiovisual aptitude , in particular when a visually intrusive noise barrier is used to reduce highway traffic noise levels. We conclude that audiovisual aptitude may affect the appraisal of the living environment.
