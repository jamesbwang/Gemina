  Lipid nanoparticles ( LNPs) are one of the leading technologies for the in vivo delivery of short interfering RNA ( siRNA). Cationic lipids are an important component for efficient endosomal escape via membrane fusion followed by release of siRNAs in cytosol where the site of action is located. A high cationic lipid/siRNA charge ratio is usually necessary for maximizing the gene silencing activity of the siRNA-loaded LNPs. However , high levels of cationic lipids are known to cause cytotoxicity through interactions with negatively charged biocomponents. A strategy for solving this dilemma is important , in terms of producing clinically applicable LNPs with a wide therapeutic window. We herein report on the development of LNPs with a high gene silencing activity and a low cationic lipid/siRNA charge ratio , which we refer to as low lipid core-nanoparticles ( LLC-NPs). The negative charges of the siRNAs were neutralized by protamines , cationic proteins , to reduce the net dose of cationic lipid , YSK05 , which was developed in our laboratory , for endosomal escape , resulting in preserved fusogenic activity and gene silencing activity , both in vitro and in vivo factor VII mouse model. In addition , the LLC-NPs showed an improved hepatotoxicity compared to conventional LNPs , which have a relatively higher cationic lipid/siRNA charge ratio. The concept of the LLC-NPs helps to realize clinically applicable LNPs with a wide therapeutic window and has the potential for use in various applications and for the delivery of different classes of nucleic acid.
