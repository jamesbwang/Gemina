  Qualitative research should strive for knowledge translation toward the goal of closing the gap between knowledge and practice. However , it is often a challenge in nursing to identify knowledge translation strategies able to illustrate the usefulness of qualitative results in any given context. This article defines storytelling and uses pragmatism to examine storytelling as a strategy to promote the knowledge translation of qualitative results. Pragmatism posits that usefulness is defined by the people affected by the problem and that usefulness is promoted by modalities , like storytelling , that increase sensitivity to an experience. Indeed , stories have the power to give meaning to human behaviors and to trigger emotions , and in doing so bring many advantages. For example , by contextualizing research results and appealing to both the reason and the emotions of audiences , storytelling can help us grasp the usefulness of these research results. Various strategies exist to create stories that will produce an emotional experience capable of influencing readers ' or listeners ' actions. To illustrate the potential of storytelling as a knowledge translation strategy in health care , we will use our story of discovering this strategy during a qualitative study in a nursing home as an example.
