  Undergraduate introductory biology students struggle when communicating quantitative data. This activity provides students with a real-world research experience to improve their quantitative literacy in science communication. Students were provided with a national sports media report that described a professional football athlete requiring 9,000 calories daily. Students were then asked to determine whether , based on their own research and calculations , the reporter had correctly calculated the total calories coming from the reported foods. Students discovered that their different sources of caloric information provided very different ( albeit accurate) calculated totals , ranging from 6,000 to 11,000 calories. Importantly , the students generated professional letters outlining their calculated differences and sent them to the sports reporter. The professional letters to the reporter were assessed via rubric for accuracy of calculations , appropriate research evidence , professionalism , and readability for a nonexpert. A majority of the students provided accurate calculations; however , students scored lower on their professional writing skills , ability to cite appropriate research evidence , and readability for a nonexpert. Additionally , summative quantitative problems were individually completed and assessed , and activity cohorts achieved significantly higher on these problems compared with the non-activity cohort. Finally , surveyed students indicated that the activity helped prepare them for quantitative problems on the summative exam and helped them identify major course learning objectives. In conclusion , given an authentic research activity , students can take ownership of their learning and practice their communication to the general public about quantitative scientific information.
