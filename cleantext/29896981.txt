  Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the renoprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of astragaloside IV ( AS-IV) in streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic mice. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with STZ at 200 mg/kg body<symptom> weight. AS-IV was administered for 8 consecutive weeks , beginning 1 week after STZ injection. Body<symptom> weight , 24-hour urinary albumin excretion , and fasting blood glucose were measured. Kidney tissues were examined by histopathological analyses. Total levels and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 ( MEK1/2) , extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2) , and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 ( RSK2) were determined by Western blotting analysis. Results AS-IV treatment significantly reduced albuminuria and serum creatinine levels , ameliorated mesangial matrix expansion and greater foot process width , and decreased the levels of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin , and transforming growth factor-beta 1 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. AS-IV also inhibited renal cortical phosphorylation of MEK1/2 , ERK1/2 and RSK2. Conclusion Our results suggest that AS-IV attenuates renal injury in STZ-induced diabetic mice. This effect might be partially associated with inhibition of the activation of the MEK1/2-ERK 1/2-RSK 2 signaling pathway.
