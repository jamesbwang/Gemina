  Cigarette smoke is a strong and independent risk factor for esophageal cancer , while the consumption of cow 's milk has been proposed as a protective factor. The mechanistic role of milk in preventing cancer , however , has not been clarified. We focused our study on acrolein , an abundant unsaturated aldehyde present in cigarette smoke. Acrolein is a highly toxic compound and a putative carcinogen. Using a cell culture system , we found that ( 1) acrolein caused necrosis<symptom> in Ramos Burkitt 's lymphoma cells , ( 2) the necrosis<symptom> was inhibited by preincubation of acrolein with milk , and ( 3) acrolein formed adducts with milk proteins. These results indicated the protective effects of cow 's milk against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity via protein-acrolein adduct formation.
