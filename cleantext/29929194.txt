  Experimental studies have reported the antineoplastic effects of statins in thyroid carcinoma; however , observational studies suggested that statins might increase the risk of thyroid carcinoma. Therefore , this study evaluated the antineoplastic effects of statins in both in vitro studies and animal models , as well as the epidemiological evidence. Databases-PubMed , Cochrane Library , SinoMed , CNKI , Wanfang , and clinical trial registries- were searched. A meta-analysis was performed with sufficiently homogeneous studies. Eighteen articles were involved. In in vitro studies , statins showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell line growth ( weighted mean difference -34.68 , 95 % confidence interval -36.53 to -32.83). A significant efficacy of statin-induced apoptosis was observed ( weighted mean difference ( 95 % confidence interval): 24 h , 57.50 ( 55.98-59.03); 48 h , 23.43 ( 22.19-24.66); 72 h , 51.29 ( 47.52-55.07)). Early apoptosis was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In in vivo antitumor studies , lovastatin inhibited tumor growth , as shown by a reduction in tumor volume. However , two clinical studies showed discordant results from the experimental studies. Experimental studies revealed the antineoplastic efficacy of statins but statins were associated with thyroid carcinoma in clinical studies. This discrepancy may be due to the different concentrations of statins used and the effects of hyperlipidemia interventions , and thus further study is required.
