  The USP Apparatus 3 is a compendial dissolution Apparatus that has been mainly used to assess the performance of modified-release drug products. However , this Apparatus can be applied to dissolution testing of immediate-release tablets as well , with several advantages such as lower consumption of dissolution media , reduced setup time in quality control routine , and minimized hydrodynamic issues. In this work , three immediate-release ( IR) tablets containing antihypertensive drugs of different Biopharmaceutic Classification System ( BCS) classes were evaluated in order to assess the possible interchangeability between the official dissolution method using typical USP Apparatus 1 or 2 and the proposed methods using USP Apparatus 3. Depending on the selection of the appropriate operational conditions , such as dip rate and sieve mesh size , it was observed that USP Apparatus 3 could provide similar dissolution profiles compared to USP Apparatus 1 or 2 to the drug products tested. In addition , USP Apparatus 3 avoided conning issues related to USP Apparatus 2. The successful application of USP Apparatus 3 in dissolution tests for IR drug products depends on the definition of specific test conditions for each product , considering all the equipment variables , as well as drug and formulation characteristics.
