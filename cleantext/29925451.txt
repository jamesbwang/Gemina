  CLINICIAN 'S CAPSULE What is known about this topic? Gathering visual information effectively is an important task of a physician leader when managing a resuscitation case. What did this study ask? Are there particular visual information-gathering patterns associated with performance in simulated resuscitation scenarios? What did this study find? Certain visual patterns ( e.g. , focusing on case-specific clinically relevant stimuli) are associated with better performance in a simulated resuscitation setting. Why does this study matter to clinicians? The ability to characterize physician visual patterns across a competence continuum has implications for trainee assessment and medical education.
