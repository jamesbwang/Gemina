  Topical photodynamic therapy ( PDT) is an established treatment option for low-risk basal cell carcinoma ( BCC). Compare efficacy , cosmesis and tolerability of PDT for BCC with alternative treatments. MEDLINE/PubMed/EMBASE/ CENTRAL databases were searched from inception until 1 September 2017. Included studies were randomised controlled trials ( RCTs) of PDT for nodular ( n) and superficial ( s) BCC reporting at least one of the outcomes: clearance at 3 months , and sustained at 1 or 5 years; recurrence at â‰¥ 1 year; cosmesis; adverse events; tolerability. From 2,331 search results , 15 RCTs ( 2,327 patients; 3,509 BCCs) were included. PDT efficacy ( 5-year sustained clearance) was high although inferior to excisional surgery ( nBCC pooled RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.63-0.91) , and without re-treatment of partially-responding lesions<symptom> , was modestly inferior to imiquimod ( sBCC: RR 0.81; 95 % CI 0.70-0.95) and similar to fluorouracil ( sBCC: RR 0.88; 95 % CI 0.75-1.04). Five-year sustained clearance was inferior with conventional versus fractionated PDT ( sBCC: RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.68-0.84). PDT cosmesis was superior to surgery ( sBCC: RR 1.68; 95 % CI 1.32-2.14; nBCC: RR 1.82; 95 % CI 1.19-2.80) and cryosurgery ( BCC: RR 3.73; 95 % CI 1.96-7.07) , and without re-treatment of partially-responding lesions<symptom> was similar to imiquimod ( sBCC: RR 1.01; 95 % CI 0.85-1.19) and fluorouracil ( sBCC: RR 1.04; 95 % CI 0.88-1.24). Peak pain was higher but of shorter duration with PDT than topical treatments. Serious adverse reactions were rarer with PDT than imiquimod ( sBCC: RR 0.05; 95 % CI 0.00-0.84) and fluorouracil ( sBCC: RR 0.11; 95 % CI 0.01-2.04). Combination PDT regimens demonstrated reduced recurrence and improved cosmesis; however , results from these small studies were often non-significant. PDT is an effective treatment for low-risk BCC , with excellent cosmesis and safety. Imiquimod has higher efficacy than single-cycle PDT though more adverse effects. Highest efficacy is with excisional surgery. Fractionated and combination PDT options warrant further study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
