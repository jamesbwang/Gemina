  To evaluate the accuracy of pupil fields and determine the normative pupillary response data by age using a newly developed head-mounted perimeter. A total of 100 healthy subjects ( 20-68 ▒ y of age) were enrolled. The newly developed head-mounted perimeter `` imo '' was used to measure the percentage pupil constriction ( PPC) as response to a stimulus at all 36 test points of the visual field. Goldmann size III and V stimuli at 0 , 8 , and 11 decibels ( dB) under 31.4 , 6 , and 3 apostilbs ( asb) background were presented. The PPC correlations of the right and left eyes ( r) were examined. Reproducibility was determined with the coefficient of variation ( CV) and a Bland-Altman plot. Mean PPC were analyzed as normative data in all 36 test points. Excellent correlation between both eyes was obtained for Goldmann size V stimuli , target luminance of 0 ▒ dB , and a background luminance of 31.4 asb ( r = 0.83 , P < 0.001). From the test-retest CV peripheral areas have low reproducibility compared with central areas. With a Goldmann size V target , there was a steeper decline of the PPC from the center to the periphery field , and the temporal field PPC was larger than the nasal. No major differences were observed between the PPC data and the age groups by decade ( e.g. , center 3 ° , P = 0.223-0.913). Normative PPC data might well be useful for assessing objective visual fields with the newly developed head-mounted perimeter.
