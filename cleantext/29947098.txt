  Studies were conducted to develop methods to assess the effects of a complex mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) in the domestic chicken ( Gallus domesticus). Treatments were administered by egg injection to compare embryonic effects of an environmentally relevant PCB congener mixture in the domestic chicken over a range of doses. Chicken eggs were injected with a PCB mixture ( PCB mix) with a profile similar to that found in avian eggs collected on the Upper Hudson River , NY at doses that spanned 0- 98 µg/g egg. Eggs were hatched in the laboratory to ascertain hatching success. In the domestic chicken , the median lethal dose was 0.3 µg/g ( LD
