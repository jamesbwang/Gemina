  Biomass fast pyrolysis oils contain molecules having a large variety of chemical functions and a wide range of molecular weights ( from several tens to several thousand grams per mole). The good knowledge of their complex composition is essential for optimizing the conversion of bio-oils to biofuels , thereby requiring powerful separation techniques. In this work , we investigate the interest of centrifugal partition chromatography ( CPC) as a first dimension for the analysis of a bio-oil. A CPC method is proposed to separate oxygen containing compounds according to their partition coefficients in the solvent system. This approach is a powerful and easy-to-use technique that enables fractionation of a bio-oil at a semi-preparative scale , without any sample loss related to adsorption on the stationary phase. Collected fractions are then injected in liquid chromatography as a second dimension of separation. Contour plot representations of the CPC Ã— LC separation are established to discuss the potential of this approach. These representations can be used as a veritable fingerprint in the comparison of different samples or samples at different steps of a conversion process but also as a powerful tool to identify new compounds and describe the entire composition of the bio-oil.
