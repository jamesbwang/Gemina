  We present a generic theoretical model ( MICROWEB) that simulates the transfer of microplastics and hydrophobic organic chemicals ( HOC) in food webs. We implemented the model for an Arctic case comprised of nine species including Atlantic cod and polar bear<pathogen> as top predator. We used the model to examine the effect of plastic ingestion on trophic transfer of microplastics and persistent HOCs ( PCBs) and metabolizable HOCs ( PAHs) , spanning a wide range of hydrophobicities. In a scenario where HOCs in plastic and water are in equilibrium , PCBs biomagnify less when more microplastic is ingested , because PCBs biomagnify less well from ingested plastic than from regular food. In contrast , PAHs biomagnify more when more microplastic is ingested , because plastic reduces the fraction of PAHs available for metabolization. We also explore nonequilibrium scenarios representative of additives that are leaching out , as well as sorbing HOCs , quantitatively showing how the above trends are strengthened and weakened , respectively. The observed patterns were not very sensitive to modifications in the structure of the food web. The model can be used as a tool to assess prospective risks of exposure to microplastics and complex HOC mixtures for any food web , including those with relevance for human health.
