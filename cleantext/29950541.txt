  Accumulating studies have shown that metabolic syndrome<disease> is involved in the disturbance of bone and calcium metablism. Main pathophysiological conditions , such as visceral fat obesity and insulin resistance , may cause abnormal bone metabolism and bone quality deterioration. Moreover , recent studies have reported that components of metabolic syndrome<disease> , such as diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , and hypertension , are associated with increased fracture risk. Therefore , we should consider the posibility that patients with metabolic syndrome<disease> have bone quality deterioration even if they have normal bone mineral density , and evaluate their fracture risk in clinical settings.
