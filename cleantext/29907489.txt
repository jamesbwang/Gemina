  To report cancer control rates and adverse events ( AEs) of curative-intent , extended-field chemoradiation therapy administered to patients with squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) of the anal canal presenting with distant metastasis limited to the para-aortic ( PA) lymph nodes. This was a retrospective review of patients with SCC of the anal canal metastatic to the PA lymph nodes at initial diagnosis who were treated with curative-intent , extended-field chemoradiation therapy between September 2002 and February 2016 at two tertiary care centers. Outcomes assessed included treatment-related AEs ( Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.0) , disease control ( cumulative incidence estimates) , and survival ( Kaplan-Meier estimates). Thirty patients were included. Involved and elective PA nodes were treated to median doses of 51 Gy ( range 45-57.6) and 45 Gy ( range 30.6-50.4) in 29 fractions ( range 17-32). All patients received one of these concomitant regimens: 6 weekly cycles of cisplatin with 5-fluoruracil/capecitabine ( 5-FU) ( n = 22) , 2 cycles of mitomycin-C with 5-FU ( n = 7) , or daily capecitabine ( n = 1). After a median follow-up period of 3.1 years , 18 patients ( 60 %) remained alive and 17 patients were without evidence of anal cancer after definite and salvage treatments. Overall and disease-free survival at 3 years was 67 % ( 95 % CI 49 % -89 %) and 42 % ( 95 % CI 25 % -69 %). Fifteen ( 50 %) patients experienced a recurrence at a median of 0.9 year ( range 0.5-3.5 years). The predominant site of recurrence was distant metastases , with a 3-year cumulative incidence of 50 % ( 95 % CI 20 % -68 %). There was no acute grade 5 AE. Grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal , dermatologic , and hematologic AEs occurred in 30 % , 27 % , and 20 % of patients respectively. Extended-field chemoradiation therapy is a potentially curative treatment option for patients presenting with SCC of the anal canal with metastases limited to the PA lymph nodes.
