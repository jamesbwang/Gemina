  Schizophyllum<pathogen> commune<pathogen> is a filamentous basidiomycete which can degrade complex organic macromolecules like lignin by the secretion of a large repertoire of enzymes. One of these white rot enzymes , laccase , exhibits a broad substrate specificity and is able to oxidize a variety of substances including carbonaceous rocks. To investigate the role of laccase in bioweathering , laccase gene lcc2 was overexpressed , and the influence on weathering of black slate , originating from a former alum mine in Schmiedefeld , Germany , was examined. The metal release from the rock material was enhanced , associated with a partial metal accumulation into the mycelium. A sequestration of metals could be shown with fluorescent staining methods , and an accumulation of Zn , Cd , and Pb was visualized in different cell organelles. Additionally , we could show an increased metal resistance of the laccase overexpressing strain.
