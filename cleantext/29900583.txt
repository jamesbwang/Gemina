  The amount of proteins and peptides can be estimated with amide proton transfer ( APT) imaging. Previous studies demonstrated the usefulness of APT imaging to predict tumor malignancy. We determined whether APT imaging can predict the tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer ( LARC). Seventeen patients with LARC who underwent a pretherapeutic magnetic resonance examination including APT imaging and NAC ( at least two courses) were enrolled. The APT-weighted imaging ( WI) signal intensity ( SI) ( %) was defined as magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry ( MTR The mean APTWI SI of the low-response group ( n = 12; 3.05 ± 1.61 %) was significantly higher than that of the high-response group ( n = 5; 1.14 ± 1.13 %) ( P = 0.029). The area under the curve for predicting the tumor response using the APTWI SI was 0.87. When ≥ 2.75 % was used as an indicator of low-response status , 75 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity of the APTWI SI were obtained. Pretherapeutic APT imaging can predict the tumor response to NAC in patients with LARC.
