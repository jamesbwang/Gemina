  Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor which is particularly common in the developing world , mostly in older males. Although gene expression analyses had been performed previously , to our best knowledge , systemic co-expression analysis for this disease is still lacking to date. In this study , we built the co-expression modules with the help of Weighted Correlation Network Analysis ( WGCNA) and investigated the function enrichment of co-expression genes from important modules by bioinformatics analysis. A total of 10 co-expression modules were conducted for 4500 genes from 167 oral squamous cell carcinoma samples. Number of genes for each module ranged from 52 to 1112 , with the mean of 450. Interaction relationships of hub-genes between pairwise modules showed great differences , suggesting the high confidence of modules. Functional enrichments of the co-expression modules exhibited great differences. Furthermore , genes in the module ME blue and module ME magenta significantly enriched in hsa05332 ( Graft-versus-host disease) and hsa05330 ( Allograft rejection) , and the two pathways were associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma. Together , our findings provided the framework of co-expression gene modules of oral squamous cell carcinoma and further understanding of these modules at functional aspect.
