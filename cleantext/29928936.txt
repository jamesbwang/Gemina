  Ensuring patient comfort and compliance by emphasizing reduced time frame for image acquisition , without compromising image quality is the key aspect with functional MRI examination. Multiband resting state fMRI ( MB-rsfMRI) is a fairly new technique that potentially shortens MR image acquisition time by providing increased number of time points. The study aims to compare signal characteristics as well as the functional connectivity using conventional resting-state fMRI ( rsfMRI) with that of MB-rsfMRI technique. 9 healthy volunteers have prospectively undergone conventional resting-state fMRI and Multiband rsfMRI scanning technique in a 3T GE scanner ( Discovery MR750w â„¢). We compared the temporal SNR ( tSNR) of conventional rs-fMRI with that of MB-rsfMRI. We looked at the language network connectivity and small world network characteristics from graph theoretical measures to compare the two techniques. We computed the tSNR of conventional resting-state fMRI ( rsfMRI) and MB-rsfMRI technique. A strong positive correlation was seen between graph theoretical measures from MB-rsfMRI and conventional rsfMRI ( Pearson Correlation , r = 0.99). Both techniques showed similar small world network characteristics in healthy controls. The present study demonstrates negligible differences between the conventional-rsfMRI and MB-rsfMRI acquisitions on the computed graph theoretic measures. Accordingly current analysis proves that MB-rs-fMRI may be used as a time reducing acquisition technique that enables mapping of functional connectivity with similar outcome as conventional rs-fMRI in healthy subjects.
