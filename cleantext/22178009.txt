  The psychosocial environment of the workplace has received less attention in terms of occupational health. Trust , social network and social cohesion at the workplace ( that is , factors related to social capital) may have effects on employee health. Thus , the objective of this study was to examine the association between workplace social capital and mental health among Iranian workers. In this cross-sectional study , data were obtained from 5 factories in Babol , Northern Iran , in 2016 , where 280 workers responded to a survey on social capital at work and psychosocial distress. Approximately 23.6 % of the workers had psychological distress , and 23.4 % had low social capital in the workplace. There was a significant relationship between mental health and individual workplace social capital ( p = 0.025) and aggregated workplace social capital ( p = 0.027). After controlling for each individual 's characteristics , the prevalence ratio of psychological distress was 2.11 ( 95 % CI: 1.43-3.17) times higher among workers with low individual social capital , and low aggregated workplace social capital was associated with 2.64 ( 95 % CI: 1.28-5.45) times higher odds of psychological distress. Higher social capital is associated with a reduced risk of psychological distress. The promotion of social capital can be considered as a means to increase workplace mental health among workers.
