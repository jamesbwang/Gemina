  In the molecular world , molecular ratchets can realize the unidirectional movement in molecular machines. However , construction of artificial molecular ratchets has been still a great challenge. In this study , we investigate the formation of pseudo-rotaxane of a newly designed two-station axis molecule with α-cyclodextrin ( α-CD) and the deuteration of acidic protons in the axis in D
