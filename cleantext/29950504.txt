  A global loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP; encoded by the Fmr1 gene) leads to sensory dysfunction and intellectual disabilities. One underlying mechanism of these phenotypes is structural and functional deficits in synapses. Here , we determined the autonomous function of postsynaptic FMRP in circuit formation , synaptogenesis , and synaptic maturation. In normal cochlea nucleus , presynaptic auditory axons form large axosomatic endbulb synapses on cell bodies of postsynaptic bushy neurons. I
