  Minimal-invasive gastrectomy has been established as commonly used method for the early gastric cancer in Korea and Japan. From the first laparoscopic cancer gastrectomy in 1992 in Japan , numerous prospective randomized trials from these two countries have gained the evidence for non-inferiority or even specific benefits compared to open surgery. In Korea , the `` Korean Laparoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgical Study Group '' ( KLASS group) founded , in 2004 , successfully gained evidence not only in regards of oncological safety of laparoscopic gastrectomy , but also for the impact of different reconstruction methods and alternative extents of luminal resection on postoperative outcome and quality of life. Awaited results of latest studies from Korea , Japan , and China may suggest laparoscopic approaches as an option even in advanced gastric cancers. These studies could potentially be the starting point to find the role of laparoscopic gastrectomy in the west<disease> , where the incidence of gastric cancer is rather lower; the cancers are mostly diagnosed in advanced stages , and often , a perioperative chemotherapy is applied. Robotic (- assisted) gastrectomy was not shown to be superior to laparoscopic resection in Korea , but new technological developments should continuously be evaluated in clinical trials regarding a potentially favorable learning curve , which might play a key role in regards of the limited case load per center of gastric cancer in the west<disease>. This review summarizes the history of laparoscopic cancer gastrectomy in Asia and points out the important steps of establishing a nation-wide scientific network to support the surgical routine by the necessary evidence with a focus on Korea.
