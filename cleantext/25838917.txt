  In 2005 , Nigeria changed its antimalarial drug policy to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies ( ACTs) for the treatment of malaria<disease> infection , and it is imperative for prescribers to strictly comply with this guideline to harmonize malaria<disease> management practices within the country. This study aims to evaluate prescribers ' adherence with the National Antimalarial Treatment Guideline ( NATG) in the treatment of malaria<disease> infections and to describe the determinants of antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. A cross-sectional , retrospective study of antimalarial drug prescriptions of one-year period of 2013 was conducted. A simple method for assessing the quality of drug prescribing ( DU90 %) was adopted. Logistic regression was used to predict antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics. Overall , 95.8 % of the total prescriptions contained ACTs , out of which 80.8 % were Artemether/Lumefantrine. However , adherence to NATG was 88.2 % with an adjusted value of 100.0 %. Age was the only predictor for antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics. This study showed high concordance with NATG at the studied hospital. Age less than 5 years is a significant risk factor for antimalarial drugs coprescription with antibiotics.
