  Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract have limited available treatments and are often associated with a poor prognosis. Clinical trials and translational work associated with these trials provide the opportunity to increase understanding of the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy in these diseases. In this review we discuss the rationale for intensive translational work within the context of academic clinical trials and the successes and challenges which have been associated with translational work at our institution over the past number of years. We reflect on tissue , plasma and radiological biomarker work including a novel patient derived organoid programme and discuss the iterative application of previous results to next generation trial design.
