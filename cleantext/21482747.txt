  High-fat diet ( HFD)- fed mouse models have been widely used to study early type 2 diabetes. Decreased β-cell glucokinase ( GCK) expression has been observed in HFD-induced diabetes. However , owing to its crucial roles in glucose metabolism in the liver and in islet β-cells , the contribution of decreased GCK expression to the development of HFD-induced diabetes is unclear. Here , we employed a β-cell-targeted gene transfer vector and determined the impact of β-cell-specific increase in GCK expression on β-cell function and glucose handling
