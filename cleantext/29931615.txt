  This study evaluated the long-term tumor control rate ( TCR) and symptomatic outcomes of patients treated with gamma knife radiosurgery ( GKRS) for trigeminal schwannomas ( TSs). Thirty-two patients with TS who underwent GKRS between January 1994 and January 2013 with at least 2 years of follow-up were enrolled in the study. Clinical charts and surgical records were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate factors affecting TCR and symptomatic outcomes. The median patient age was 57.5 years ( max = 81 , interquartile range ( IQR) = 51-67) , and the median tumor volume was 3.55 cm At a median follow-up of 90.5 months ( max = 281 months , IQR = 49-139.75 months) , the actuarial 3- , 5- , and 10-year TCR were 93.8 , 86.2 , and 80.8 % , respectively. Our data and multivariate analysis indicated that the target volume was the only significant factor determining TCR and that larger tumors ( > 5 cm GKRS can be a safe and effective treatment modality for TS with long-term follow-up , especially for small tumors. An extended period of follow-up observation is required to conclude the clinical response to GKRS.
