  To explore cost-efficiency , safety and acceptability of trans-disciplinary advanced allied health ( AH) practitioners for acute adult general medicine inpatients. Quasi-experimental feasibility study. Three acute general medical units in an Australian urban hospital. Two hundred and fifty-six acute hospital inpatients. Cost-efficiency measures included AH service utilization and length of stay ( LOS). Patient outcomes were functional independence , discharge destination , adverse events , unplanned admissions within 28 days , patient satisfaction and quality of life data on admission , and 30 days post-discharge. Ward staff were surveyed regarding satisfaction with the service model , and advanced health practitioners ( AHPs) rated their confidence in their own ability to meet the performance standards of the role. Patients allocated to AHPs ( n = 172) received 0.91 less hours of AH intervention ( adjusted for LOS) ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI): -1.68 to -0.14; P = 0.02) and had 1.76 days shorter LOS relative to expected ( 95 % CI: 0.18-3.34; P = 0.03) compared with patients receiving standard AH ( n = 84). There were no differences in patient outcomes or satisfaction. AHPs demonstrated growth in job satisfaction and skill confidence. Trans-disciplinary advanced AH roles may be feasible and cost-efficient compared with traditional roles for acute general medical inpatients. Further development of competency frameworks is recommended.
