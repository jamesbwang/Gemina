  Glioma , the most prevalent malignancy in brain , is classified into four grades ( I , II , III , and IV) , and grade IV glioma is also known as glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM). Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs) , including platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR) , are frequently observed in glioma. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDGFR plays critical roles during glioma development and progression and is a promising drug target for GBM therapy. However , PDGFR inhibitor ( PDGFRi) has failed in clinical trials , at least partially , due to the activation of other RTKs , which compensates for PDGFR inhibition and renders tumor cells resistance to PDGFRi. Therefore , identifying the RTKs responsible for PDGFRi resistance might provide new therapeutic targets to synergetically enhance the efficacy of PDGFRi. In this study , we analyzed the TCGA glioma database and found that the mRNA expressions of three RTKs , i.e. ERBB3 , IGF1R , and TGFBR2 , were positively correlated with that of PDGFR. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated novel interactions between the three RTKs and PDGFR in GBM cells. Moreover , concurrent expression of PDGFR with ERBB3 , IGF1R , or TGFBR2 in GBM cells attenuated the toxicity of PDGFRi and maintained the activation of PDGFR downstream targets under the existence of PDGFRi. Thus , ERBB3 , IGF1R , and TGFBR2 might participate in PDGFRi resistance of GBM cells. Consistent with this notion , combination of PDGFRi with inhibitor targeting either ERBB3 or IGF1R more potently suppressed the growth of GBM cells than each inhibitor alone. The positive correlations of PDGFR with ERBB3 , IGF1R , and TGFBR2 were further confirmed in 66 GBM patient samples. Intriguingly , survival analysis showed that ERBB3 predicted poor prognosis in GBM patients with high PDGFRA expression. Altogether , our work herein suggested that ERBB3 , IGF1R , and TGFBR2 were responsible for PDGFRi resistance and revealed that ERBB3 acted as potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GBM with high PDGFRA expression.
