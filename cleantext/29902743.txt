  Rural practice presents unique challenges and skill requirements for midwives. New Zealand and Scotland face similar challenges in sustaining a rural midwifery workforce. This paper draws from an international multi-centre study exploring rural midwifery to focus on the education needs of student midwives within pre-registration midwifery programmes in order to determine appropriate preparation for rural practice. The mixed-methods study was conducted with 222 midwives working in rural areas in New Zealand ( n = 145) and Scotland ( n = 77). Midwives ' views were gathered through an anonymous online survey and online discussion forums. Descriptive analysis was used for quantitative data and thematic analysis was conducted with qualitative data. ` Future proofing rural midwifery practice ' using education was identified as the overarching central theme in ensuring the sustainability of rural midwives , with two associated principle themes emerging ( i) ` preparation for rural practice ' and ( ii) ` living the experience and seeing the reality '. The majority of participants agreed that pre-registration midwifery programmes should include a rural placement for students and rural-specific education with educational input from rural midwives. This study provides insight into how best to prepare midwives for rural practice within pre-registration midwifery education , in order to meet the needs of midwives and families in the rural context.
