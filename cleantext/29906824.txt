  In this paper , we study how the permeability of solid foam is modified by the presence of membranes<symptom> that close partially or totally the cell windows connecting neighboring pores. The finite element method ( FEM) simulations computing the Stokes problem are performed at both pore and macroscopic scales. For foam with fully interconnected pores , we obtain a robust power-law relationship between permeability and aperture size. This result is due to the local pressure drop mechanism through the aperture as described by Sampson for fluid flow through a circular orifice in a thin plate. Based on this local law , pore-network simulation of simple flow is used and is shown to reproduce FEM results. Then this low computational cost method is used to study in detail the effect of an open window fraction on the percolation properties of the foam pore space. The results clarify the effect of membranes<symptom> on foam permeability. Finally , Kirkpatrick 's model is adapted to provide analytical expressions that allow for our simulation results to be successfully reproduced.
