  A cross-sectional study was carried out between November 2015 and January 2016 to determine the seroprevalence of Brucella antibodies in cattle raised under communal , fenced farms and tethering systems and the associated factors. Seven hundred twenty-eight bovine sera were collected and tested with rose Bengal test as a screening test and the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a confirmatory test. Animal- and herd-level data were collected and binary logistic regression was used to assess the potential risk factors. True animal- and herd-level prevalence was highest in the fenced farms ( 4.5 % ( 95 % CI , 2.3-6.9) and 19.5 % ( 95 % CI , 8.2-32.7) respectively). The risks for natural brucellosis<disease> infection were sharing water with wild animals ( OR = 0.21 , 95 % CI , 0.104-0.83) , herd size ( medium: OR = 0.089 , 95 % CI 0.017-0.449; large: OR = 0.024 , 95 % CI 0.003-0.203) , fenced farms ( OR = 3.7 , 95 % CI , 1.7-7.9) , sex ( OR = 0.03 , 95 % CI , 0.01-0.079) , and lactation ( OR = 0.013 , 95 % CI , 0.004-0.049). Changes in rangeland tenure and the shift towards intensive cattle production have influenced brucellosis<disease> epidemiology. Future studies should aim at identifying the infecting Brucellae and examining the role of wildlife in brucellosis<disease> epidemiology.
