  BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer is a common type of malignant neoplasm. Its prognosis is poor because the disease is not well understood. Abnormal lipometabolism in peroxisomes is involved in tumor progression and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 2 ( HSDL2) , localized in peroxisomes , might be a regulatory factor in lipometabolism. However , the role of HSDL2 in ovarian cancer progression remains unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS HSDL2 expression was detected by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in ovarian tumor samples and qPCR in human ovarian cancer cell lines. Cell proliferation was measured by Celigo and MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. Giemsa staining was used for analyzing colony formation. Cell motility was performed using Transwell migration and invasion assays. Tumorigenesis in nude mice was also detected. RESULTS HSDL2 expression was upregulated in human ovarian cancer samples and in 3 human ovarian cancer cell lines: SKOV3 , HO8910 , and OVCAR-3. Higher expression of HSDL2 in ovarian tumor samples was associated with more progressed tumors ( P = 0.03) and lymphatic metastases ( P = 0.03). HSDL2 down-regulation by lentiviral-mediated HSDL2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation , colony formation , and cell motility , while it promoted cell apoptosis and resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and SKOV3. HSDL2 knockdown also inhibited tumorigenesis in mouse models. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that HSDL2 upregulation is associated with ovarian cancer progression. HSDL2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation , colony formation , motility , and tumorigenesis. It induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and might therefore serve as a potential target for ovarian cancer therapy.
