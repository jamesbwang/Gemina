  This study is aimed to explore the effect of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium combined application on the active components of Rhodiola crenulata. R. crenulata was used as the research object , `` 3414 '' fertilization experiment were conducted with regular fertilization of NPK ( N 60 kg · hm ⁻² , P ₂ O ₅ 100 kg · hm ⁻² , KCl 160 kg · hm ⁻²) to study the effect of different rates of NPK fertilization on the total amount of 4 phenolic constituents of gallic acid , salidroside , tyrol and ethyl gallate through field test. The results show that the content of salidroside was higher in the treatment of N ₁ P ₂ K ₁ and N ₁ P ₂ K ₂ , andthe total amount of four phenols was higher in the treatment of N ₁ P ₂ K ₂ and N ₂ P ₂ K ₂. The suitable level of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium promoted the accumulation of the 4 kinds of phenols.The amount of fertilizer recommended by the three factor fertilizer effect equation , ( N 0 kg · hm ⁻² , P ₂ O ₅ 150 kg · hm ⁻² , KCl 31.71 kg · hm ⁻²) obtained the highest content of salidroside , and it was 1.54 %. （ N 35.54 kg · hm ⁻² , P ₂ O ₅ 150 kg · hm ⁻² , KCl 237.73 kg · hm ⁻² ） obtained the highest content of 4 kinds of phenolic compounds , and it was 1.93 %. This study provides a reference for the standardization of artificial planting of endangered Tibetan medicine.
