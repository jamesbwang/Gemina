  Poly ( methyl methacrylate) ( PMMA)- based bone cements are the most commonly used injectable orthopedic materials due to their excellent injectability and mechanical properties. However , their poor biocompatibility and excessive stiffness may cause complications such as aseptic implant loosening and stress shielding. In this study , we aimed to develop a new type of partially biodegradable composite bone cement by incorporating magnesium ( Mg) microspheres , known as `` Mg sacrifices '' ( MgSs) , in the PMMA matrix. Being sensitive to the physiological environment , the MgSs in PMMA could gradually degrade to produce bioactive Mg ions and , meanwhile , result in an interconnected macroporous structure within the cement matrix. The mechanical properties , solidification , and biocompatibility , both in vitro and in vivo , of PMMA ⁻ Mg bone cement were characterized. Interestingly , the incorporation of Mg microspheres did not markedly affect the mechanical strength of bone cement. However , the maximum temperature upon setting of bone cement decreased. This partially biodegradable composite bone cement showed good biocompatibility in vitro. In the in vivo study , considerable bony ingrowth occurred in the pores upon MgS degradation. Together , the findings from this study indicate that such partially biodegradable PMMA ⁻ Mg composite may be ideal bone cement for minimally invasive orthopedic surgeries such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
