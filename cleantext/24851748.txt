  To evaluate the perioperative risk factors for 30-day complications of the Kasai procedure in a large , cross-institutional , modern dataset. The 2012-2015 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database was used to identify patients undergoing the Kasai procedure. Patients ' characteristics were compared by perioperative blood transfusions and 30-day outcomes , including complications , reoperations , and readmissions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors predictive of outcomes. Propensity matching was performed for perioperative blood transfusions to evaluate its effect on outcomes. 190 children were included with average age of 62 days. Major cardiac risk factors were seen in 6.3 %. Perioperative blood transfusions occurred in 32.1 %. The 30-day post-operative complication rate was 15.8 % , reoperation 6.8 % , and readmission 15.3 %. After multivariate analysis , perioperative blood transfusions ( OR 3.94; p < 0.01) and major cardiac risk factors ( OR 7.82; p < 0.01) were found to increase the risk of a complication. Perioperative blood transfusion ( OR 4.71; p = 0.01) was associated with an increased risk of reoperation. Readmission risk was increased by prematurity ( OR 3.88; p = 0.04) and 30-day complication event ( OR 4.09; p = 0.01). After propensity matching , perioperative blood transfusion was associated with an increase in complications ( p < 0.01) and length of stay ( p < 0.01). Major cardiac risk factors and perioperative blood transfusions increase the risk of post-operative complications in children undergoing the Kasai procedure. Further research is warranted in the perioperative use of blood transfusions in this population. IV.
