  The chromatin remodeling factor SMARCAD1 , an SWI/SNF ATPase family member , has a role in 5 ' end resection at DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) to produce single-strand DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) , a critical step for subsequent checkpoint and repair factor loading to remove DNA damage. However , the mechanistic details of SMARCAD1 coupling to the DNA damage response and repair pathways remains unknown. Here we report that SMARCAD1 is recruited to DNA DSBs through an ATM-dependent process. Depletion of SMARCAD1 reduces ionizing radiation ( IR)- induced repairosome foci formation and DSB repair by homologous recombination ( HR). IR induces SMARCAD1 phosphorylation at a conserved T906 by ATM kinase , a modification essential for SMARCAD1 recruitment to DSBs. Interestingly , T906 phosphorylation is also important for SMARCAD1 ubiquitination by RING1 at K905. Both these post-translational modifications are critical for regulating the role of SMARCAD1 in DNA end resection , HR-mediated repair , and cell survival after DNA damage.
