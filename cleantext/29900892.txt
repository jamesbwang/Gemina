  Rifampicin is one of the important components in the multidrug therapy ( MDT)- World Health Organization regimen for leprosy<disease> Clarithromycin is one of the alternative therapies of rifampicin. This clinical pilot study was to compare the efficacy of 2,000 mg clarithromycin to 600 mg rifampicin in combination with dapsone and clofazimine for 3 months in multibacillary ( MB) leprosy<disease> patients. They were divided into an MDT-MB regimen group that consists of rifampicin-dapsone-clofazimine and clarithromycin-dapsone-clofazimine ( CDC) regimen group , each group consisted of seven patients. The morphological index ( MI) was reduced insignificantly after 3 months therapy in MDT-MB group ( P = 0.248). While in the CDC group , the MI decrement showed a significant result ( P = 0.004). The comparison of MI reduction in MDT-MB and CDC groups showed an insignificant difference ( P = 0.130). Skin discoloration was occurred in both groups , whereas mild-nausea was presented in the CDC group , in addition , red-colored urine was developed in the MDT-MB group. We concluded that 2,000 mg clarithromycin is as effective as 600 mg rifampicin in combination with dapsone and clofazimine regimen in MB leprosy<disease> patients. Hence , clarithromycin can be considered as an alternative therapy for leprosy<disease> patients who resistance and/or allergy to rifampicin.
