  Large amounts of peptides are naturally generated in foods through the proteolysis phenomena taking place during processing. Such proteolysis is carried out either by endogenous enzymes in ripened foods or by the combined action of endogenous and microbial enzymes when fermented. Food proteins can also be isolated and hydrolysed by peptidases to produce hydrolysates. endo-peptidases act first followed by the successive action of exo-peptidases ( mainly , tri- and di-peptidylpeptidases , aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases). The generated peptides may be further hydrolysed through the gastrointestinal digestion resulting in a pool of peptides with different sequences and lengths , some of them with relevant bioactivity. However , these peptides should be absorbed intact through the intestinal barrier and reach the blood stream to exert their physiological action. This manuscript is reporting the enzymatic routes and strategies followed for the generation of bioactive peptides.
