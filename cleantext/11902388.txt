  Over the past decades , Bangladesh has made substantial progress in improving higher education , and in part , this was achieved by promoting residence based higher education in public universities. University residency is considered a crucial period for students to develop healthy eating habits and adopt nutritious intake , which comprise a strong foundation for good health throughout life. Although , there is extensive literature on eating behaviors and dietary intake internationally , there appears to be relatively scarce research and analysis concerning Bangladesh. This study aims to address this , by investigating the factors that influence eating behavior and dietary intake. Adopting a qualitative approach , we conducted 25 in-depth interviews and 13 focus group discussions with students of various disciplines and semesters. We used thematic analysis to analyze the textual data , and methodological triangulation to validate the information provided. Student eating behavior and dietary intake are influenced by a variety of factors. Individual factors ( cooking skills , food taste , food taboos , and knowledge and perceptions) , societal factors ( influence of peers and social norms) , factors related to university ( campus culture and frequency of examination) , and environmental factors ( availability of cooking resources and facilities and food prices) emerged as the key aspects that determine students ' eating behavior and dietary intake. This is the first study that explored factors influencing nutritional behavior and dietary intake among resident graduates in a Bangladeshi university. The results suggest that resident students have a poor dietary intake that might have a harmful impact on their health , well-being , and academic performance. Therefore , multilevel nutritional interventions may be beneficial to promote healthy eating behavior and dietary intake among university students.
