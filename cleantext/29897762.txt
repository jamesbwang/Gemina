  Methionine ( Met) is one of the essential amino acids of which the transport system L is overexpressed in various tumor cells. In this study , a near-infrared fluorescent dye ( IR-780) and methionine were conjugated through a piperazin-polyamines linker to form Cy-Met. The successful synthesis of Cy-Met was validated by optical characterization , NMR , and MS spectra. The absorption peak of Cy-Met was at 680 nm , and the fluorescence peak was at 790 nm. The cytotoxicity assay and cell imaging studies indicated that Cy-Met had good biocompatibility and specific affinity to tumor cells. The dynamic distribution and clearance investigations showed that Cy-Met was eliminated by the liver-intestine pathway. Notably , Cy-Met displayed tumor-targeting ability in U87 , H22 , and EAC tumor-bearing mice with an evident long circulation time. The results implied that Cy-Met could act as a promising fluorescence probe specialized for long-term tumor monitoring.
