  Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is a metabolic disorder requiring intensive self-care to maintain optimal glycemic control. Sleep disturbance is common in T2D patients and likely impairs glycemic control. Our aim was to examine the relationship between sleep disturbance and self-care in adults with T2D. This study used a correlational design. Sixty-four adults with T2D were recruited. Validated instruments were used to measure self-care , subjective sleep disturbance , and covariates ( e.g. , diabetes distress , self-efficacy , fatigue<symptom> , and daytime sleepiness). Over an 8-day period , the ActiGraph-wGT3X was used to measure objective sleep outcomes ( e.g. , total sleep time and number of awakenings). Bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The mean age of the participants was 60.6 ( SD 6.8) years ( range 50-78) , and 51.6 % were women. Controlling for covariates , subjective sleep disturbance ( β =- 0.26) , diabetes distress ( β =- 0.39) , and daytime sleepiness ( β =- 0.21) were strong predictors of diabetes self-care ( R Subjective sleep disturbance and frequent nocturnal awakenings are associated with worse diabetes self-care in adults with T2D. Healthcare providers are recommended to include comprehensive sleep assessment at every clinical visit. Diabetes educators may consider including sleep-related education in their diabetes self-management classes and/or counseling sessions.
