  This study describes the kinetics of furan and furfural generation in a cake model , for the first time. These process-induced compounds impact safety and sensory aspects of baked products. Understanding their generation with regards to process dynamics will serve food quality design. However , the complexity of real products makes this task challenging. This work provides a novel approach to understand and model chemical reactivity by implementing an inert cake model ( starch , water and cellulose) , specifically designed for mimicking a sponge cake structure. The addition of reaction precursors ( glucose and leucine) to follow Maillard and caramelization reactions , resulted in browning and generated considerable levels of furanic compounds ( up to 17.61 ng/g for furan and 38.99 Î¼g/g for furfural , dry basis). Multiresponse data modeling resulted in a kinetic model which adequately describes experimental concentrations and makes it possible to estimate the degradation of precursors and the behavior of two hypothetic intermediates.
