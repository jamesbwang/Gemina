  The association between serum uric acid levels and human<disease> disease<disease> has garnered intense interest over the last decade including chronic kidney disease. Animal studies have provided evidence for a potential mechanistic role of uric acid in promoting progression of chronic kidney disease. Epidemiologic studies have also suggested an association between elevated serum uric acid levels and worsening renal function in the general population as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease. However , there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of uric acid-lowering therapy to delay progression of chronic kidney disease in this patient population. Adequately powered , randomized , placebo-controlled trials are required to more precisely evaluate the risk and benefits of uric acid-lowering therapy in pediatric patients.
