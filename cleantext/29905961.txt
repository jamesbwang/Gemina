  Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) has shown promising results in the treatment of tumors with high expression of somatostatin receptors such as neuroendocrine tumors ( NETs) and meningioma. However , PRRT potentially produces high renal and red marrow ( RM) toxicity , the kidneys usually being the dose-limiting organ. Previously , it was shown that an improved therapeutic index can be achieved by choosing an optimal combination of injected activity and peptide molar amount. The aim of this work was to develop a clinically applicable algorithm for treatment planning in PRRT. To demonstrate the applicability and possible advantages of the algorithm thus developed , an in silico clinical trial applying the algorithm to An algorithm for treatment planning in PRRT was developed , which simultaneously considers multiple tumor lesions<symptom> , maximum tolerated biologically effective doses ( BEDs) for multiple organs at risk ( OARs) and a maximum achievable molar activity. The algorithm , subject to the abovementioned constraints , aims at maximizing the total number of killed tumor cells in the considered lesions/metastases. An in silico clinical trial was conducted with nine virtual patients. For each virtual patient , simulations increasing the molar dose of The conducted in silico clinical trial yielded optimal molar doses and activities ranging from 24 to 512 nmol and from 6 to 30 GBq , respectively. Tumor BEDs ranged from 2 to 107 Gy The algorithm presented can derive plans with higher tumor control than the typically delivered plan. Therefore , we propose this algorithm for clinical validation and possibly future implementation in treatment planning in molecular radiotherapy.
