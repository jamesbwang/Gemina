  When in vitro dissolution profile variability prohibits the use of the F2 metric , there currently is no satisfactory alternative available. Published reports evaluating alternative approaches such as Multivariate Statistical Distance and use of a bootstrap F2 identify sources of bias that can limit the utility of these alternatives. Within veterinary medicine , an additional complication is the potential magnitude of interlot variability associated with dosage forms containing `` natural '' ingredients. In situations when both interlot and intralot variability need to be factored in the test and reference profile comparison , we designed a method that integrates such concepts as F2 , USP S1 and S2 criteria and statistical tolerance limits. Unlike F2 , this alternative approach integrates a statistical confidence into the determination through the use of tolerance limits about the reference product profile. Moreover , while differences in product variability , along with differences in mean profiles , will influence the comparability assessment , this method does not impose the need to confirm homogeneity of variances: there is not direct statistical comparison of test versus reference dissolution data. For more typical situations when interlot variability is not a concern , the F2 component can be omitted from the profile comparison. Lastly , by being a model-independent approach , we avoid the potential for introducing error into the comparability determination due either to model misspecification or problems associated with a lack of collinearity. This manuscript details this alternative approach and the results of performance characterization efforts to illustrate its behavior under a range of potential situations.
