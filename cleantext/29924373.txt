  In Canada , hypertension control is significantly less likely in older women taking antihypertensive medication than in older men. This study examines factors that may explain some of the differences in hypertension control between women and men. The analysis is based on data collected for 2,111 adults aged 60 to 79 who were treated for hypertension in the first four cycles of the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Hypertension , treatment and control were estimated based on measured systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and on the Drug Identification Numbers of antihypertensive medications. Risk factors included health behaviours , comorbidities and a family history of hypertension. Sex-specific logistic regression models examined associations between risk factors and hypertension control. The systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of women taking antihypertensive medication was higher than that of men , regardless of hypertension control. For women , older age and diabetes were significantly associated with poorer hypertension control , while older age , ethnicity , diabetes , no cardiovascular disease , and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were significant for men. Based on current blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> targets , women and men aged 60 to 79 taking antihypertensive medication in Canada continue to differ in control and factors associated with control. Further research to better understand the underlying cause of these associations may help reduce disparities in hypertension control rates between women and men in Canada.
