  In each somatic cell of a female mammal one X chromosome is transcriptionally silenced via X-chromosome inactivation ( XCI) , initiating early in development. Although XCI events are conserved in mouse and human postimplantation development , regulation of X-chromosome dosage in preimplantation development occurs differently. In preimplantation development , mouse embryos undergo imprinted form of XCI , yet humans lack imprinted XCI and instead regulate gene expression of both X chromosomes by dampening transcription. The long non-coding RNA Xist/XIST is expressed in mouse and human preimplantation and postimplantation development to orchestrate XCI , but its role in dampening is unclear. In this review , we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of Xist in X chromosome dosage compensation in mouse and human.
