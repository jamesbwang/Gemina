  A 31-year-old man presented with a subacute cerebellar syndrome<disease> of unknown aetiology. Investigations including a paraneoplastic antibody screen were negative and a working diagnosis of possible vasculitis was concluded. After 1 month , he re-presented with worsening of his symptoms and a neck lump. He was diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase , negative non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome<disease>. A more extensive paraneoplastic antibody screen found patient to be Tr ( delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor) antibody positive. After a period of chemotherapy and steroid treatments , his symptoms are now stable in terms of cerebellar function. This case report summarises a very rare diagnosis of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration with a positive onconeuronal antibody associated with anaplastic non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma.
