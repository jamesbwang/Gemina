  Presumably , progression of developmental retinal vascular disorders is mainly driven by persistent ischemia/hypoxia. An investigation into vision-threatening retinal ischemia remains important. Our aim was to evaluate , in relation to retinal ischemia , protective effects and mechanisms of Dendrobium nobile Lindley ( DNL) and its bibenzyl component moscatilin. The therapeutic mechanisms included evaluations of levels of placental growth factor ( PLGF) and Norrie disease protein ( NDP). An oxygen glucose deprivation ( OGD) model involved cells cultured in DMEM containing 1 % O When compared with cells cultured in DMEM containing DMSO ( DMSO+DMEM) , cells subjected to OGD and pre-administrated with DMSO ( DMSO+OGD) showed a significant reduction in the cell viability and NDP expression. Moreover , cells that received OGD and 1 h pre-administration of 0.1 μM moscatilin ( Pre-OGD Mos 0.1 μM) showed a significant counteraction of the OGD-induced decreased cell viability. Furthermore , compared with the DMSO+OGD group ( 44.54 ± 3.15 %) , there was significant elevated NDP levels in the Pre-OGD Mos 0.1 μM group ( 108.38 ± 29.33 %). Additionally , there were significant ischemic alterations , namely reduced ERG b-wave , less numerous retinal ganglion cells , decreased inner retinal thickness , and reduced/enhanced amacrine 's ChAT/Müller 's GFAP or vimentin immunolabelings. Moreover , there were significantly increased protein levels of HIF-1α , VEGF , PKM2 , RBP2 and , particularly , PLGF ( pg/ml; Sham vs. Vehicle: 15.11 ± 1.58 vs. 39.53 ± 5.25). These ischemic effects were significantly altered when 1.0 g/Kg/day DNL ( DNL1 .0 + I/R or I/R + DNL1 .0) was applied before and/or after ischemia , but not vehicle ( Vehicle + I/R). Of novelty and significance , the DNL1 .0 action mechanism appears to be similar to that of the anti-PLGF Eylea ( PLGF ( pg/ml); DNL1 .0 vs. Eylea + I/R: 19.93 ± 2.24 vs. 6.44 ± 0.60). DNL and moscatilin are able to protect against retinal ischemic/hypoxic changes respectively by downregulating PLGF and upregulating NDP. Progression of developmental retinal vascular disorders such as Norrie disease due to persistent ischemia/hypoxia might be thus prevented.
