  Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) accounts for 90 % of all ovarian cancer. Initially , approaching 80 % of EOC patients respond to standard therapeutic strategy , cytoreduction combining with postoperative auxiliary platinum-based chemotherapy. However , relapse is approximately inevitable because of drug-resistance for high-grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC). Recently , the nuclear enzyme poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) represents a strikingly novel target in EOC treatment. PARP inhibitors , currently mainly including Olaparib , Niraparib , Velaparib , Rucaparib , and Talazoparib , have demonstrated promising activity in EOC treatment. Especially , studies of Olaparib accelerated it to be approved in Europe and USA. Here , this review focuses on the pre-clinical data , current clinical trials , the development of PARP inhibitors in the last decade and their future roles in clinical treatment for EOC patients.
