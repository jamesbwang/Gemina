  Bioluminescence imaging ( BLI) demonstrates cellular events as a light signal at the single-cell level using a highly sensitive , cooled CCD camera. However , BLI signals are relative values and thus , images taken on different days or using different equipment can not be compared directly. We established a reference LED light source that was characteristic of the total flux and light distribution and calibrated the BLI system as an absolute light signal. This calibrated BLI system revealed that the average light signal of beetle luciferase was at an attowatt level per sec at the single cell level.
