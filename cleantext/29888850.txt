  Entomopathogenic Beauveria bassiana has been used as a biocontrol agent for insect pests , but its effect at the molecular level on the hosts has not been studied in detail. Herein , we performed transcriptome analysis of bean bug , Riptortus pedestris ( Hemiptera: Alydidae) in response to infection with a highly virulent strain of B. bassiana JEF-007 ( Bb JEF-007). Based on RNA-seq data from R. pedestris infected with Bb JEF-007 compared with non-infected bean bugs , infection was assumed to strongly activate 1) the energy production pathway by expressing dehydrogenases , 2) metabolic pathways by expressing secreted proteins , GTPase , MBF2 transcription factor family , pigment-dispersing factor , antioxidants , and cuticle proteins , and 3) the immune response pathway by expressing serine-threonine kinase in Toll pathway of bean bug. We have established the platform for functional studies of the genes required for an immune response against entomopathogenic fungi<pathogen> like B. bassiana in the bean bug , R. pedestris. Moreover , this study also paves the way for genetic modification of B. bassiana to combat with the defense mechanism of R. pedestris. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
