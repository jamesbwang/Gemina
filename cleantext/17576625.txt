  Urban family physician program ( UFPP) was launched in Fars province of Iran in 2012. We aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of people toward this 5-year-old program. In this population-based study , through a multistage random sampling from 6 cities of Fars province , 1350 people older than 18 years were interviewed. For data collection , a questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic characteristics and items about knowledge and practice toward UFPP was used. The mean age of the interviewees was 42.4 ± 14.2 years; male ( 674; 49.9 %)- to-female ( 651; 48.2 %) ratio was 1.03. Mean score of knowledge was 4.2 ± 1.7 ( out of 14) , while 961 ( 71.1 %) had < 50 % of the desirable knowledge. Mean score of practice was 4.4 ± 1.3 ( out of 9) , while only 443 ( 32.8 %) had a good performance toward this program. Knowledge and practice did not show a significant correlation ( After 5 years of implementation of UFPP , knowledge and practice of people toward UFPP are not satisfactory. This finding calls for a serious revision in some aspects of UFFP.
