  Determining neuropathic pain component ( NPC) among patients with chronic low back pain-radicular pain ( CLBP-RP) and the adjustment between scales of neuropathic pain. One hundred and one patients with CLBP-RP were included in the study. The severity of CLBP-RP was evaluated by visual analogue scale ( VAS). The Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions ( DN4) and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Scales ( LANSS) were used to evaluate the NPC. The mean score of CLBP-RP assessed by VAS was 80 mm. NPC was detected a rate of 65.3 % by DN4 and 40.6 % by LANSS. NPC was 75.4 % in females and 47.2 % in males according to DN4 , and 52.3 % in females and 19.4 % in males according to LANSS. The female gender , occupation , and VAS scores were determined to be significant factors contributing to presence of NPC according to logistic regression analyses ( p < 0.01 , p < 0.05 , p < 0.05). A medium degree accordance was established between DN4 and LANSS scales according to kappa coefficient ( Kappa = 0.532 , p < 0.05). CLBP is among the diseases causing mixed type pain accompanied by nociceptive and neuropathic pain. NPC was detected in a considerable part of patients with radicular pain. Identifying the character of radicular pain is significant to develop proper management strategies.
