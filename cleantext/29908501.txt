  Traffic emissions are a complex and variable cocktail of toxic chemicals. They are the major source of atmospheric pollution in the parts of cities where people live , commute and work. Reducing exposure requires information about the distribution and nature of emissions. Spatially and temporally detailed data are required , because both the rate of production and the composition of emissions vary significantly with time of day and with local changes in wind , traffic composition and flow. Increasing computer processing power means that models can accept highly detailed inputs of fleet , fuels and road networks. The state of the science models can simulate the behaviour and emissions of all the individual vehicles on a road network , with resolution of a second and tens of metres. The chemistry of the simulated emissions is also highly resolved , due to consideration of multiple engine processes , fuel evaporation and tyre wear. Good results can be achieved with both commercially available and open source models. The extent of a simulation is usually limited by processing capacity; the accuracy by the quality of traffic data. Recent studies have generated real time , detailed emissions data by using inputs from novel traffic sensing technologies and data from intelligent traffic systems ( ITS). Increasingly , detailed pollution data is being combined with spatially resolved demographic or epidemiological data for targeted risk analyses.
