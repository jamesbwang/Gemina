  Many efforts have been done to reduce leptospirosis<disease> infections in Malaysia especially among high risk groups including town service workers. Town service workers are more likely to be exposed to the leptospiral infection resulting from their occupational activities. A cross sectional study was conducted in northeastern Malaysia involving 321 town service workers who were subjected to answer an interviewer-guided validated questionnaire which consists of sociodemographic , knowledge , attitude and practice information. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS Version 20. All of the respondents were Malay with mean ( SD) age of 40.6 ( 10.28) years old. The mean ( SD) duration of employment was 12.1 ( 9.62) years. Fifty four respondents ( 16.8 %) had never heard of leptospirosis<disease> Among the respondents , 215 ( 67.0 %) of them had poor knowledge on leptospirosis<disease> Meanwhile , 167 ( 52.0 %) and only 128 ( 39.9 %) of them had satisfactory attitude and practice respectively. It was found that knowledge on risk factors for leptospirosis<disease> was lacking. There were high risk attitudes such as drinking habit and protective equipment used during working with the favourable answers ranged from 67.3 % to 89.1 %. The weakest area identified in their practice was also on the use of protective equipment. The workers ' level of knowledge and practice were relatively poor despite an overall good practice on leptospirosis<disease> This finding might expose them to an increased risk of contracting leptospirosis<disease> Identified weak areas in their knowledge , attitude and practice will assist the policy makers to develop a focused and well-directed intervention program on leptospirosis<disease> infection.
