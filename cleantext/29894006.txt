  Two-dimensional ( 2D) in-plane p-n junctions with a continuous interface have great potential in next-generation devices. To date , the general fabrication strategies rely on lateral epitaxial growth of p- and n-type 2D semiconductors. An in-plane p-n junction is fabricated with homogeneous monolayer Te at the step edge on graphene/6H-SiC ( 0001). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals that Te on the terrace of trilayer graphene is p-type , and it is n-type on monolayer graphene. Atomic-resolution images demonstrate the continuous lattice of the junction , and mappings of the electronic states visualize the type-II band bending across the space-charge region of 6.2 nm with a build-in field of 4 Ã— 10
