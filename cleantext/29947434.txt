  There is currently no widely accepted classification system of intra-articular damage in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI). The goal of this study is to correlate the Scoring Hip Osteoarthritis with Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( SHOMRI) system with arthroscopic findings in symptomatic FAI patients to justify its use in this setting. Symptomatic FAI patients scheduled for hip arthroscopy were prospectively enrolled. Prior to surgery , radiographs , and an MRI were obtained of the affected hip and all patients completed the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( HOOS) questionnaire. Each MRI was graded using the SHOMRI system. Intraoperatively , cartilage and labral injury grades were recorded. SHOMRI scores were then correlated with the intraoperative cartilage and labral grades as well as preoperative radiographic findings and HOOS scores. Forty-three patients were analyzed ( mean age 35.7 years , 58.1 % male). SHOMRI total scores correlated with intraoperative femoral cartilage grade ( ρ = 0.42; p = 0.002) , acetabular cartilage grade ( ρ = 0.30; p = 0.046) , and labral tear grade ( ρ = 0.42; p = 0.003) as well as with preoperative Tönnis grade ( ρ = 0.37 , p = 0.013) , HOOS pain score ( ρ = -0.33; p = 0.039) , HOOS ADL score ( ρ = -0.39; p = 0.007) , and HOOS sports score ( ρ = -0.30; p = 0.037). In conclusion , total scores from the SHOMRI system showed significant correlation with arthroscopic findings as well as radiographic gradings and clinical symptoms in patients with FAI. Use of this quantitative system to assess the burden of chondrolabral damage in FAI appears valid. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals , Inc.. J Orthop Res.
