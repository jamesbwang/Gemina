  Intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair ( IPOM) of incisional hernia is performed by laparoscopic and open access. The aim of the present study is to compare open versus laparoscopic surgery specifically using an IPOM technique for incisional hernia repair. A propensity score-matched observational single center study of patients that underwent IPOM between 2004 and 2015 was conducted. The primary outcome was hernia recurrence; secondary outcomes include length of stay , surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSI) , complications , and localization of recurrence. Among 553 patients with incisional hernia repair , 59 % underwent laparoscopic and 41 % open IPOM. A total of 184 patients completed follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 5.5 years recurrence rate was 20 % in laparoscopic and 19 % in open repair ( p = 1.000). Patients undergoing laparoscopic IPOM had significantly reduced operation time ( median 120 vs. 180 min , p < 0.001) , shorter hospital stays ( 6 vs. 8 days , p = 0.002) , less complications ( 10 vs. 23 % , p = 0.046) , and fewer SSI ( 1 vs. 21 % , p < 0.001). Laparoscopic IPOM is associated with reduced morbidity compared to open IPOM for incisional hernia repair.
