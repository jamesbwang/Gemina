  Maternal obesity during pregnancy can impact long-term health , predisposition to disease , and risk of neurological disorders in offspring. This may arise from disruption to epigenetic processes during offspring brain development. Using a maternal high fat diet ( mHFD) mouse model , we investigated the expression of genes encoding epigenetic regulators in the brains of gestational day ( GD) 17.5 mHFD offspring. We found significant , regionally unique changes in expression of epigenetic regulators in the developing brain of mHFD offspring compared to controls , with Gadd45b downregulated in medial prefrontal cortex , Mecp2 downregulated in amygdala , and sex-specific downregulation of Crebbp , Dnmt3b , and Mecp2 in male mHFD hippocampus. Decreased Mecp2 in the amygdala was associated with significant upregulation of the Mecp2-repressed gene , Tbr1 , and an increased number of TBR1
