  Soluble adenylate cyclase ( sAC) is a non-plasma membrane-bound isoform of the adenylate cyclases signaling via the canonical second messenger , 3 ' ,5 '- cyclic AMP ( cAMP). sAC is involved in key physiological processes such as insulin release , sperm motility , and energy metabolism. Thus , sAC has attracted interest as a putative drug target and attempts have been made to develop selective inhibitors. Since sAC has a binding constant for its substrate , ATP , in the millimolar range , reductions in mitochondrial ATP production may be part of the mechanism-of-action of sAC inhibitors and the potential of these compounds to study the physiological outcomes of inhibition of sAC might be severely hampered by this. Here , we evaluate the effects of two commonly employed inhibitors , 2-OHE and KH7 , on mitochondrial ATP production and energy metabolism. For comparison , we included a recently identified inhibitor of sAC , bithionol. Employing mitochondria isolated from mouse brain , we show that all three compounds are able to curb ATP production albeit via distinct mechanisms. Bithionol and KH7 mainly inhibit ATP production by working as a classical uncoupler whereas 2-OHE mainly works by decreasing mitochondrial respiration<symptom>. These findings were corroborated by investigating energy metabolism in acute brain slices from mice. Since all three sAC inhibitors are shown to curb mitochondrial ATP production and affect energy metabolism , caution should be exercised when employed to study the physiological roles of sAC or for validating sAC as a drug target.
