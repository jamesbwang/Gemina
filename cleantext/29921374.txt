  The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms of vitamin D receptor ( VDR) and Genistein ( Gen) on the regulation of bone metabolism of phytoestrogens from cellular and epidemiological perspectives. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with different concentrations of Gen , and the cell-proliferation rate was detected by an MTT colorimetric assay. The effect of the VDR receptor blocker ZK159222 on the Gen effect was then observed; after adding Gen to MC3T3-E1 cells , we detected the expression of VDR protein via Western blotting. After adding estrogen receptor α-blocker MPP and estrogen receptor β-blocker PHTPP , we observed the effect of Gen on the regulation of the VDR protein. DNA was extracted from the blood samples of 200 postmenopausal women in the early epidemiological survey , and the restriction fragment length polymorphism of VDR gene Apa I and Bsm I in each sample was observed. The results were analyzed using dietary survey and bone mineral density examination. The results show that 10-8mol/ L Gen can promote the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells ( P less than 0.05). This effect can be canceled by the VDR blocker ZK159222. By analyzing the Apa I and Bsm I genotypes of VDR restriction sites , we discovered no significant difference in bone mineral density ( BMD) between different genotypes ( P > 0.05). In addition , there was no significant correlation between dietary phytoestrogen intake and BMD in different genotypes ( P > 0.05). In conclusion , VDR can mediate the effect of Gen on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The up-regulated expression of VDR protein in Gen is not mediated by the estrogen receptor. Moreover , the VDR gene polymorphism is not related to the BMD in various parts and is not related to the bone metabolism effect of the dietary plant estrogen intake.
