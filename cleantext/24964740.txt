  According to the principle of horizontal equity , individuals with similar need may have the same possibility of access to health services. The aim of this study is to identify patterns of diagnostic services utilization , in people with , and without chronic<disease> disease<disease> in Italy. Secondary analysis of data from the national survey on Health and use of health care in Italy , carried out in 2013 , including 99,497 participants. Multilevel analysis has been used to study the variables associated to diagnostic services utilization. 13.78 % of participants have had one diagnostic testing in the four weeks before the interview. In healthy people , utilization of diagnostic testing is reduced in people with low educational level ( OR 0.75; 95 % CI 0.67-0.84) , in housewives ( OR 0.66; 95 % CI 0.51-0.87) , or in those unable to work ( OR 0.48; 95 % CI 0.26-0.87) , while increased in those perceiving a worse health status ( up to OR 4.00 , 95 % CI 2.00-8.01 in very bad health). In people afflicted with chronic<disease> disease<disease> , access to diagnostic assessment is impaired by educational level ( OR 0.69; 95 % CI 0.61-0.78) and low household income ( OR 0.75; 95 % CI 0.58-0.97) , while it is increased in the presence of a ticket exemption ( OR 1.55 , 95 % CI 1.42-1.68) , and fixed-term occupation ( OR2 .28 , 95 % CI 1.31-3.95). Being former-smokers in associated to an increased utilization of services in both groups. Despite a universal and theoretically egalitarian , public , health care system , variations in diagnostic services utilization are still registered in Italy , both in healthy people and those afflicted by chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , on socio-economic/occupational basis , and self-perceived health status. Moreover , this significant effect of occupation on healthcare utilization , suggests the need for a comprehensive evaluation of economics in occupational health.
