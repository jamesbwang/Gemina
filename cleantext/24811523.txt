  The present study proposes a workflow to extract vegetation height for urban areas from Pl√©iades stereo and tri-stereo satellite imagery. The workflow was applied on a stereo image pair for Szeged , Hungary and on tri-stereo imagery for Salzburg , Austria. Digital surface models ( DSMs) of the study areas were computed using the semi-global matching algorithm. Normalised digital surface models ( nDSMs) were then generated. Objects of vegetation and non-vegetation were delineated based on the spectral information of the multispectral images by applying multi-resolution segmentation and support vector machine classifier. Mean object height values were then computed from the overlaid pixels of the nDSMs and assigned to the objects. Finally , the delineated vegetation was classified into six vegetation height classes based on their assigned height values by using hierarchical classification. The vegetation discrimination resulted in very high accuracy , while the vegetation height extraction was moderately accurate. The results of the vegetation height extraction provided a vertical stratification of the vegetation in the two study areas which is readily applicable for decision support purposes. The elaborated workflow will contribute to a green monitoring and valuation strategy and provide input data for an urban green accessibility study.
