  US and European guidelines recommend budesonide for the treatment of mild-to-moderate active ileocolic Crohn 's disease ( CD). However , budesonide has not been approved , and mesalazine is widely used as first-line treatment in Japan. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of budesonide in patients with mild-to-moderate active CD in Japan. In this phase 3 noninferiority study ( NCT01514240) , 112 patients with a baseline Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI) score of 180-400 were randomized to budesonide or mesalazine for 8 weeks. Assessments included remission rate ( CDAI score â‰¤ 150) at weeks 2 , 4 , and 8 , change in CDAI score , health-related quality of life ( measured using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ)) , and tolerability. The remission rate at week 8 was numerically higher in the budesonide group ( 30.4 %) than in the mesalazine group ( 25.0 %) , and the noninferiority of budesonide to mesalazine was shown. The mean total CDAI score decreased to a greater extent with budesonide than with mesalazine. Mean IBDQ scores improved from baseline to weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , and 10 in both groups; improvements were numerically higher with budesonide than with mesalazine. No safety concerns were found. Budesonide is comparably effective to mesalazine in the treatment of Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate active CD.
