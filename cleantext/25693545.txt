  Scientists are increasingly called upon to communicate with the public , yet most never receive formal training in this area. Public understanding is particularly critical to maintaining support for undervalued resources such as biological collections , research data repositories , and expensive equipment. We describe activities carried out in an inquiry-driven organismal biology laboratory course designed to engage a diverse student body using biological collections. The goals of this cooperative learning experience were to increase students ' ability to locate and comprehend primary research articles , and to communicate the importance of an undervalued scientific resource to nonscientists. Our results indicate that collaboratively created , research-focused informational posters are an effective tool for achieving these goals and may be applied in other disciplines or classroom settings.
