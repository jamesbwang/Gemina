  The transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) superfamily signaling pathway contains two general branches , known as TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) , that regulate development in animals. It is well known that TGF-β superfamily signaling participates in the regulation of dauer ( lifespan extension) in Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> , but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lifespan extension in the pathway. Diapause , a programmed developmental arrest in insects , is similar to dauer in C. elegans<pathogen>. In this study , we find that TGF-β superfamily signaling regulates Helicoverpa armigera diapause via a novel mechanism. Both TGF-β and BMP signals are weaker in the brains of diapause-destined pupae than in nondiapause-destined pupae , and the levels of p-Smad1 , POU , TFAM , and mitochondrial activity are decreased in diapause pupae. Development in nondiapause pupae is delayed by an injection of TGF-β or BMP receptor inhibitors. Both TGF-β and BMP signals can activate a common target , Smad1. ChIP and EMSA assays indicate that Smad1 can bind to the POU promoter to regulate its expression. POU can improve the transcription of TFAM , which regulates mitochondrial activity. This is the first report showing that both TGF-β and BMP signals regulate development or diapause through the Smad1-POU-TFAM-mitochondrial activity in insects.
