  SURF1 is an assembly factor of mitochondrial complex IV , and its mutations are the primary cause of Leigh syndrome<symptom> in infants. To date , over 100 SURF1 mutations have been reported worldwide , but the spectrum of the SURF1 mutations in China remains unclear. Here , using next-generation sequencing targeting mitochondrial protein-coding sequences , we sequenced 178 patients suspected to have mitochondrial diseases. Fifteen SURF1 mutations were identified in 12 Leigh syndrome<symptom> patients , of which three , c. 465_466delAA , c. 532A > T , and c. 826_827ins AGCATCTGCAGTACATCG , were newly described. The percentage of SURF1 frameshift mutations ( 6/28 , 21.4 %) we detected in Chinese population is higher than other studies ( 21/106 , 19.8 %) with different populations , however , the percentage of missense mutations is lower in this study than others ( 4/28 , 14.3 % VS. 25/106 , 23.6 %). Since complex IV can be detected in cells carrying missense mutations ( 3/8) but not in cells carrying null mutations ( 0/4) by using cell model-based complementation assay , our results indicate that SURF1 mutations may be associated with worse clinical outcome in Chinese patients than other populations. However , studies with larger size samples are needed to verify this conclusion. Additionally , we found that the frameshift mutations resulting in protein truncation closer to the C-terminus are not associated with better disease prognosis. Lastly , we found that determining the levels of complex IV assembly using cell models or lymphocyte<symptom> analysis rather than invasive muscle and skin fibroblast biopsy , may help predict disease progression in Leigh syndrome<symptom> patients.
