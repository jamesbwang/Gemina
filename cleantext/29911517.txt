  Electron and proton microprobes , along with electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD) analysis were used to study the microstructure of the contemporary Al-Cu-Li alloy AA2099-T8. In electron probe microanalysis , wavelength and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry were used in parallel with soft X-ray emission spectroscopy ( SXES) to characterize the microstructure of AA2099-T8. The electron microprobe was able to identify five unique compositions for constituent intermetallic ( IM) particles containing combinations of Al , Cu , Fe , Mn , and Zn. A sixth IM type was found to be rich in Ti and B ( suggesting TiB2) , and a seventh IM type contained Si. EBSD patterns for the five constituent IM particles containing Al , Cu , Fe , Mn , and Zn indicated that they were isomorphous with four phases in the 2xxx series aluminium alloys including Al6 ( Fe , Mn) , Al13 ( Fe , Mn) 4 ( two slightly different compositions) , Al37Cu2Fe12 and Al7Cu2Fe. SXES revealed that Li was present in some constituent IM particles. Al SXES mapping revealed an Al-enriched ( i.e. , Cu , Li-depleted) zone in the grain boundary network. From the EBSD analysis , the kernel average misorientation map showed higher levels of localized misorientation in this region , suggesting greater deformation or stored energy. Proton-induced X-ray emission revealed banding of the TiB2 IM particles and Cu inter-band enrichment.
