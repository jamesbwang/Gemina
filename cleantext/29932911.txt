  F-type ATP synthases are extraordinary multisubunit proteins that operate as nanomotors. The Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) enzyme uses the proton motive force ( pmf) across the bacterial plasma membrane to drive rotation of the central rotor subunits within a stator subunit complex. Through this mechanical rotation , the rotor coordinates three nucleotide binding sites that sequentially catalyze the synthesis of ATP. Moreover , the enzyme can hydrolyze ATP to turn the rotor in the opposite direction and generate pmf. The direction of net catalysis , i.e. synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP , depends on the cell 's bioenergetic conditions. Different control mechanisms have been found for ATP synthases in mitochondria , chloroplasts and bacteria. This review discusses the auto-inhibitory behavior of subunit Îµ found in F
