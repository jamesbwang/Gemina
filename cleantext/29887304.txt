  Understanding and producing embedded sequences in language , music , or mathematics , is a central characteristic of our species. These domains are hypothesized to involve a human-specific competence for supra-regular grammars , which can generate embedded sequences that go beyond the regular sequences engendered by finite-state automata. However , is this capacity truly unique to humans? Using a production task , we show that macaque monkeys can be trained to produce time-symmetrical embedded spatial sequences whose formal description requires supra-regular grammars or , equivalently , a push-down stack automaton. Monkeys spontaneously generalized the learned grammar to novel sequences , including longer ones , and could generate hierarchical sequences formed by an embedding of two levels of abstract rules. Compared to monkeys , however , preschool children learned the grammars much faster using a chunking strategy. While supra-regular grammars are accessible to nonhuman primates through extensive training , human uniqueness may lie in the speed and learning strategy with which they are acquired.
