  Carbon-based composite materials with tunable , ordered mesoporous structures were prepared via the hydrothermal carbonization/soft-template method , with nickel nitrate as the doping source , straw as the carbon source , and F127 as the soft template. By adjusting the additive amounts of Ni and F127 , the mesoporous structure was controllable , and results were obtained that varied from an irregular stripe-like hexagonal , a regular stripe-like hexagonal , mixed hexagonal and cubic , to cubic. With a specific surface area in the range of 339-963 m
