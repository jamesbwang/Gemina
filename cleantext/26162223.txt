  The aftermath of war-related trauma may entail psychological devastation and is typically accompanied by various deleterious phenomena. These include , but are not limited to , high rates of loneliness. However , trauma may also result in positive outcomes such as personal , spiritual , and relational prosperity , which are typically considered under the conceptual framework of post-traumatic growth ( PTG). PTG may theoretically contribute to either loneliness amelioration ( e.g. , via increasing one 's appreciation of close relationships) or exacerbation ( e.g. , by increasing one 's sense of undergoing experiences that others do not share). Loneliness , on the other hand , may potentially hinder PTG by fostering negative social cognitions and behaviors , or otherwise lead to personal growth. The relations between the two phenomena , however , have yet to be investigated. Filling this gap , the current study examined the aforementioned potentialities by utilizing an autoregressive cross-lagged modeling strategy ( ARCL) with a cohort of 260 Israeli combat veterans assessed 30 , 35 , and 42 years after their participation in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Results indicated that higher rates of PTG were consistently related to higher rates of loneliness both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Loneliness , however , did not longitudinally predict PTG rates. It is suggested that these findings may be understood in light of the observation that veterans ' loneliness is primarily related to the experience of being experientially out of sync with people who have not endured war experiences. It is suggested that this
