  Lichens and their algal partners are desiccation-tolerant organisms and as such survive after the complete loss of water. This trait is the consequence of several physiological , biochemical and structural features , including specific mechanisms dissipating excess light to avoid photooxidative stress. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II ( PSII; F
