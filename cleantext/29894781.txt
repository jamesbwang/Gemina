  Autophagy , a highly conserved self-digestion process , is initially regarded as non-selectively sequestering and degradation cytoplasmic contents. Nowadays , many kinds of selective autophagy have been found in response to various physiological cues such as mitophagy , reticulophagy and glycophagy. Glycophagy , as a selective autophagy , plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in many tissues including heart , liver and skeletal muscles. Moreover , glycophagy is highly regulated by many signal pathways like the cyclic AMP protein kinase A/protein kinase A , PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR and Calcium. Latest studies have demonstrated that glycophagy is triggered by STBD1 , which tethers glycogen to membranes<symptom> via binding itself to the cognate autophagy protein GABARAPL1. More importantly , glycophagy might act as a protective role in coping with the accumulation of glycogen-rich lysosomes in infant patients with Pompe disease. However , glycophagy might aggravate diabetic cardiomyopathy via FoxO1 signal pathway. In this review , we focus on some findings about the occurrence and development , as well as the regulatory mechanism of glycophagy. We also analyze the role of glycophagy in Pompe disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Targeting glycophagy may open a new avenue of therapeutic intervention to these diseases.
