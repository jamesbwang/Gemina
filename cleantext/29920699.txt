  Research has suggested that military spouses experience increased depressive symptoms and parenting stress during a military member 's deployment. A relationship between maternal depressive symptoms , parenting stress , and child attachment security has been found in the general population , as has an indication that social support may provide a buffering effect. While there appears to be an association between the emotional well-being of military spouses and child emotional well-being during deployment , data are limited regarding the association between maternal emotional well-being and child attachment security. The current study explores the association between deployment status and child attachment to the nonmilitary parent ( i.e. , the mother in this study) in a sample of 68 Canadian military families. Results revealed a significant impact of deployment status on maternal depressive symptoms and on quality of child attachment. The impact of deployment status on attachment was not mediated through the maternal variables , and despite a main effect of social support on the maternal variables , there was no moderating effect. Thus , our results suggest that deployment may affect child attachment independently of maternal well-being.
