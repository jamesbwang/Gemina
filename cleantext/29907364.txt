  The emission of volatile sulfur compounds ( VSCs) causing strong odors is a major problem in municipal sewage sludge composting plants ( MSSACPs). Improving the knowledge on characteristics of VSCs emission in MSAACPs is of particular significance to elimate odors , but the studies conducted on-site to identify them are scarce. To this purpose , characteristics of VSCs emission were studied on-site from a MSSACP during different ambient temperatures corresponding with seasonal variations. Results reveal that ( 1) the total emission of VSCs which included methyl disulfide ( DMDS) , methyl sulfide ( DMS) , carbon disulfide , methyl mercaptan , and hydrogen sulfide ( H
