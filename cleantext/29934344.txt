  Epithelial-resident T lymphocytes , such as intraepithelial lymphocytes ( IELs) located at the intestinal barrier , can offer swift protection against invading pathogens. Lymphocyte<symptom> activation is strictly regulated because of its potential harmful nature and metabolic cost , and most lymphocytes are maintained in a quiescent state. However , IELs are kept in a heightened state of activation resembling effector T cells but without cytokine production or clonal proliferation. We show that this controlled activation state correlates with alterations in the IEL mitochondrial membrane , especially the cardiolipin composition. Upon inflammation<symptom> , the cardiolipin composition is altered to support IEL proliferation and effector function. Furthermore , we show that cardiolipin makeup can particularly restrict swift IEL proliferation and effector functions , reducing microbial containment capability. These findings uncover an alternative mechanism to control cellular activity , special to epithelial-resident T cells , and a novel role for mitochondria , maintaining cells in a metabolically poised state while enabling rapid progression to full functionality.
