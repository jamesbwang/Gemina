  In immunocompromised patients , reactivation of latent BK polyomavirus<pathogen> ( BKPyV) can cause disease with lytic infections of the kidneys and the lower urinary tract. Emerging evidence also links BKPyV to oncogenesis and high-grade intrarenal and transitional cell carcinomas. These neoplasms strongly express polyomavirus<pathogen> large-T antigen as a defining feature; that is , they are ` large-T-positive carcinomas '. Such neoplasms arise in immunocompromised patients , typically in renal allograft recipients , and preferentially in tissues harbouring latent BKPyV. In recent articles in this journal , it was shown that tumour cells harbour replication-incompetent clonal BKPyV. The virus can be truncated and randomly integrated into the genome , and/or it can be mutated in an episomal state. Truncation and/or deletions in the BKPyV non-coding control region can hamper late viral gene expression , replication , and cell lysis , while facilitating overexpression of early genes , including that encoding large-T. Biologically active fusion proteins or alterations in human tumour suppressor or promoter function have not been described so far , making uncontrolled large-T gene expression in non-lytically infected cells a prime suspect for neoplastic transformation. Current concepts of BKPyV-induced disease , including recent reports from this journal , are discussed , and evolving paradigms of BKPyV-associated oncogenesis are highlighted. Â© 2018 The Authors.
