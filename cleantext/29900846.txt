  Upon infection , our ability to eliminate pathogens depends mostly on our immune system. However , recent studies have shown that the nervous system plays a role in controlling infectious and inflammatory processes. Bidirectional functional interactions are established between the nervous and immune systems to protect tissue integrity. The skin is one of the first lines of defense against external threats and has a particularly well-developed neuroimmune system. Challenges to the skin activate neurons specialized in pain perception , which regulate immune cell functions and recruitment to tissues. We illustrate the importance of such neuroimmune regulation here , through the example of several skin diseases.
