  For efficient conversion of light into useful energy sources , it is very important to study and describe the first steps of primary charge-transfer process in natural structures and artificial devices. The time scale of these processes in artificial photosynthetic and photovoltaic devices is on the order of femto- to picoseconds and involves vibronic coupling of electrons and nuclei and also nuclear alleviation to enhance charge separation. Here we present an atomistic description of the photoexcited electron dynamics in a noncovalently bonded system formed by an hydrogenated nanodiamond as donor and a perylene diimide as an acceptor. The complex shows extremely fast charge transfer , separation , and stabilization within 90 fs. This stabilization is purely electronic in nature. To the best of our knowledge , these results show for the first time that it is possible to stabilize charge without polaron formation or nuclear relaxation , reaching a steady state enhanced by a pure electronic reorganization.
