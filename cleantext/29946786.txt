  Postoperative nosocomial pneumonia<disease> is a common immediate complication following lung resection. However , the incidence and mortality of pneumonia<disease> developing after discharge ( PDAD) for lung-resected patients during long-term observation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features of PDAD in patients with resected lung cancer. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 357 consecutive patients with lung cancer who had undergone lung resection at a single institution , between April 2007 and December 2016. The clinical characteristics , pathological features , and overall survival were analyzed. Propensity score matched analysis was used for the evaluation of overall survival between PDAD and non-PDAD groups with adjusted relevant confounding factors. PDAD was observed in 66 patients ( 18.5 %). The cumulative incidence of PDAD was 14.9 % at 3 years and 21.6 % at 5 years. Mortality of PDAD was 30.3 %. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the risk factors for PDAD were age ( OR 1.07; P = 0.005) , oral steroid use ( OR 5.62; P = 0.046) , and lower-lobe resection ( OR 1.87; P = 0.034). After propensity score matching , 52 patients with PDAD and 52 patients without it were compared. The incidence of PDAD resulted in a worse 5-year overall survival ( 56.1 vs. 69.3 %; P = 0.024). The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that PDAD was associated with poor overall survival ( HR 1.99 , P = 0.027). Our findings revealed a high incidence and mortality of PDAD among patients who had undergone lung resection with long-term follow-up. Therefore , PDAD could be associated with poorer overall survival.
