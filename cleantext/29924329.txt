  The effects of feeding different dietary fat sources with modified distillers grains plus solubles ( MDGS) on beef display life were evaluated. Steers ( n = 256) were fed for 134 d on either a corn , 40 % full-fat MDGS , 40 % de-oiled MDGS , or 38 % de-oiled MDGS plus 2 % corn oil diet. Twenty-four United States Department of Agriculture Choice carcasses ( 3 head/pen) were randomly selected within each dietary treatment and strip loins were collected and aged for 2 , 9 , 16 , or 23 d. Steaks from each aging period were placed under retail display ( RD) conditions for 0 , 4 , and 7 d. Stearic acid was predominant ( C18: 0; P = 0.03) in beef from the de-oiled MDGS plus oil treatment in comparison with all other dietary treatments. Feeding MDGS increased linoleic acid ( C18: 2; P < 0.01) and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA; P = 0.01) in comparison to the corn diet. The de-oiled MDGS plus oil group had greater C18: 3 content ( P = 0.03) when compared to corn , but no differences were observed between all other diets. There were no differences among dietary treatments for L * ( P = 0.74) and b * ( P = 0.25) values. The de-oiled MDGS group had lower a * values than all other treatments ( P < 0.01) at day 5 of RD. The corn treatment had greater a * values ( P ≤ 0.05) than de-oiled MDGS and de-oiled MDGS plus oil at day 6 and 7 of RD. Strip loin steaks from cattle fed full-fat MDGS tended to have lower a * values ( P = 0.10) than steaks from cattle fed corn at day 7 of RD. Feeding de-oiled MDGS resulted in greater discoloration ( P ≤ 0.05) at days 5 , 6 , and 7 of RD when compared to corn. Steaks from the de-oiled MDGS plus oil and full-fat MDGS groups had greater discoloration scores at day 7 of RD in comparison to corn ( P ≤ 0.05). Strip loin steaks from cattle fed corn tended to have lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ( TBARS) values ( P ≤ 0.10) in comparison to de-oiled MDGS and de-oiled MDGS plus oil at day 7 of RD. Results suggest that feeding MDGS to cattle reduces color and lipid stability in addition to increasing C18: 2 and PUFA content of beef. Addition of corn oil to de-oiled MDGS decreased redness and increased discoloration and lipid oxidation in comparison to corn diets.
