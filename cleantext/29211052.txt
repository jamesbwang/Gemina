  Enterotoxigenic In the present study , recombinant LTB protein was expressed in It showed the successful cloning of a 313 bp DNA fragment encoding LTB protein in the pET28a vector. Over-expression in BL21 ( DE3) led to the formation of corresponding 15.5 kDa protein bands in the SDS-PAGE gel. Western blotting by using anti-CTX confirmed the purified LTB. Protein-entrapped NPs had a spherical shape with the size of 238 nm mean diameter and 85 % entrapment efficiency. Immunological analyses showed the production of a high titer of specific IgG antibody in immunized animals. The neutralizing antibody in the sera of immunized animals was approved by GM1 binding and Ileal loop assays. The results indicate the efficacy of the entrapped LTB protein as an effective immunogen which induces the humoral responses.
