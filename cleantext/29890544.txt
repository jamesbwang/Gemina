  O-linked-β-N-Acetylglucosaminylation ( O-GlcNAcylation) , a reversible post-translational modification involved in diabetic complications , is regulated by only two enzymes , O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase ( OGT) and β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase ( OGA). Increased OGA expression has been described previously in blood cells from patients with diabetes and was interpreted as an adaptative response to hyperglycemia-induced O-GlcNAcylation. OGA expression was thus proposed to have potential utility as a diagnostic marker. The present work was undertaken to determine whether determination of OGA enzymatic activity in blood cells could constitute a more rapidly accessible marker than OGA expression level measurements.Blood samples were obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes from the Department of Diabetology of the Cochin Hospital and healthy volunteers from the French blood Agency. OGA enzymatic activity and OGA mRNA expression levels were evaluated in leucocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes and from healthy donors.OGA activity was higher in leucocytes from patients with diabetes compared to control individuals. Surprisingly , OGA activity was not correlated hyperglycaemia markers ( blood glucose , fructosamine , HbA
