  An increased risk for Systemic Autoimmune Diseases ( SAID) has been reported in Libby , Montana , where extensive exposures to fibrous amphiboles occurred due to mining and use of asbestos-laden vermiculite. In addition , positive antinuclear autoantibody tests are associated with exposure to Libby Asbestiform Amphiboles ( LAA) in both humans and mice. Among 6603 subjects who underwent health screening at the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases ( CARD , Libby MT) , 13.8 % were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease , with prevalence values for the most common SAID being significantly higher than expected in the United States. Among the CARD screening population , serological and clinical profiles are diverse , representing symptoms and autoantibodies reflective of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) , scleroderma , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , and other rheumatic syndromes<disease> , including undifferentiated connective tissue disease ( UCTD). Based upon screening of medical records by physicians with rheumatology expertise , the evolving nature of rheumatological disease in these patients is often atypical , with mixed diagnostic criteria and with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio. Through the Libby Epidemiology Research Program , cases were identified that illustrate clinical autoimmune outcomes with LAA exposure. Our goal was to better characterize SAID in Libby , MT in order to improve recognition of autoimmune outcomes associated with this exposure. In view of recent discoveries of widespread exposure to fibrous minerals in several areas of the U.S. and globally , it is critical to evaluate rheumatologic manifestations in other cohorts so that screening , surveillance , and diagnostic procedures are able to detect and recognize potential autoimmune outcomes of asbestos exposure.
