  Laboratory-based surveillance is fundamental to effective rabies<pathogen> prevention and control. The direct fluorescent antibody ( AB) test ( FAT) is the gold standard for rabies<pathogen> diagnosis. Recently , additional tests besides the FAT have been developed , such as the direct rapid immunohistochemical test ( DRIT). In this study , our objective was to further refine technical aspects of the DRIT using a combination of two monoclonal ABs ( MABs) , 502 and 802 , conduct additional testing among rabies<pathogen> reference laboratories using a diversity of animal species and rabies<pathogen> virus ( RV) variants and compare the potential utility of the DRIT for end users via proficiency testing ( PT) against the FAT. Considering the ideal molar ratios of biotin to AB in formulation of the DRIT conjugate , 3.9 was found to be superior to 7.4 , for detection of RV antigens in the brain of a naturally infected raccoon. Optimization of the DRIT conjugate may also be dependent upon the apparent choice of specific viral antigens for testing , as a gray fox RV variant reacted less strongly than a raccoon RV variant in determining the working dilution of the MAB cocktail. Using the same MABs and protocol , the DRIT was compared to the FAT using more than 800 samples of mammalian brains , representative of more than 25 taxa , including in excess of 250 animal rabies<pathogen> cases from Europe and North<pathogen> America. Sensitivity was determined at 98 % ( 96 ⁻ 100 % , 95 % CI) and specificity was calculated at 95 % ( 92 ⁻ 96 % , 95 % CI). In a comparison among end users , PT of laboratory personnel resulted in values of 77 ⁻ 100 % sensitivity and 86-100 % specificity. Based upon these and previously reported results , the DRIT appears to be a suitable alternative to the FAT for use in lyssavirus<pathogen> diagnosis.
