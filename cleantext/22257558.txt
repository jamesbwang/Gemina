  This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of biopsy-proven lupus nephritis ( BPLN) , including those relating to its prevalence and prognosis. A literature search for relevant studies was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed , Google Scholar , Embase , and Cochrane trial register. The following search terms were used for original articles published between January 1982 and April 2016: `` lupus nephritis '' or systemic lupus erythematosus ( ` SLE ') or ` systemic lupus erythematous ' and `` pathology '' or ` epidemiology ' or prevalence or incidence. Pooled estimates with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Nineteen studies were included ( mean age of SLE patients at renal biopsy: ~ 30 years). Of total BPLN patients , 85 % were females. BPLN developed in 29 % of SLE patients , and accounted for 60 % of secondary glomerular diseases in renal biopsy databases. BPLN prevalence among SLE patients was higher in Saudi Arabia compared with pooled Europe/USA data ( 43 % vs 26 % , p < 0.05). Pooled BPLN prevalence among secondary glomerular diseases patients was higher in Asian/Latin American countries than in Europe ( 63 % vs 34 % , p < 0.05). Overall five- , 10- and 20-year survival rates of BPLN patients were 94 % , 86 % , and 71 % , respectively , which were higher than those before 1995 ( 84 % , 72 % , and 52 % , respectively) and lower than those after 1995 ( 96 % , 89 % , and 80 % , respectively) ( all p < 0.05). Class IV nephritis , present in 40 % of BPLN patients , was a risk factor for renal<symptom> failure<symptom> that contributed to poor prognosis. Lupus nephritis is a common complication of young female patients with SLE , and the most prevalent etiology of secondary glomerular diseases. Attention should be paid to class IV nephritis due to its high frequency and association with poor prognosis.
