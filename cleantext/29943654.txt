  This study was designed to cross-validate previously published performance validity cutoffs embedded within the Complex Ideational Material ( CIM) and the Boston Naming Test-Short Form ( BNT-15). Seventy healthy undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a control condition ( n = 40) and instructed to perform to the best of their ability or an experimental malingering ( n = 30) condition and instructed to feign cognitive impairment while avoiding detection. All participants were administered the same battery of neuropsychological tests. Previously published validity cutoffs within the CIM ( raw score ≤ 9 or T-score ≤ 29) and BNT-15 ( ≤ 12) produced good classification accuracy using both experimental malingering and psychometrically defined invalid responding as criterion variable. However , a BNT-15 completion time ≥ 85 s produced a better signal detection profile than BNT-15 accuracy scores. Results support the clinical utility of existing cutoffs. Given the relatively high base rate of failure even in the control group ( 5-15 %) , and the perfect specificity of CIM ≤ 9 and BNT-15 ≤ 11 to noncredible responding , relabeling this range of performance as `` Abnormal '' instead of `` Impaired '' would better capture the uncertainty in its clinical interpretation.
