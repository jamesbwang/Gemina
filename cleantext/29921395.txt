  It has been shown that focused ultrasound ( FUS) can be effectively used for brain tumor therapy , and as a noninvasive , targeted drug delivery technique combined with microbubbles. In this study , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) was used to measure the kinetics of Gadolinium diethylenetriamine Penta acetic acid ( Gd-DTPA) in glioma-bearing rats. Ten glioma-bearing rats ( 9-12 weeks , 290-340 g weight) were used in the study. After the use of dynamic contrast enhancement ( DCE)- MRI , the spatial permeability of FUS-induced blood-brain barrier disruption ( BBB-D) was evaluated , and the kinetic parameters by the general kinetic model ( GKM) were calculated. The results show that mean trans K of the contralateral tumor was significantly lower than the mean trans K of sonicated tumor. Moreover , the transfer constant trans K in ultrasound tumors was closely related to tissue extravasation ( R = 0.95) , suggesting that DCE-MRI can determine drug accumulation in the brain. Except for a few small red blood cell extravasations , there was no macroscopic damage according to the histologic analysis. The study showed that the DCE-MRI can be a valuable tool in quantifying BBB permeability in tumors and monitor the kinetics of FUS-induced BBB-D processes.
