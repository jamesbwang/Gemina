  El Niño and Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) is a natural forcing that affects global climate patterns , thereon influencing freshwater quality and security. In the advent of a strong El Niño warming event in 2016 which induced an extreme dry weather in Malaysia , water quality variation was investigated in Kampar River which supplies potable water to a population of 92,850. Sampling points were stratified into four ecohydrological units and 144 water samples were examined from October 2015 to March 2017. The Malaysian Water Quality Index ( WQI) and some supplementary parameters were analysed in the context of reduced precipitation. Data shows that prolonged dry weather , episodic and sporadic pollution incidents have caused some anomalies in dissolved oxygen ( DO) , total suspended solids ( TSS) , turbidity and ammoniacal nitrogen ( AN) values recorded and the possible factors are discussed. The month of March and August 2016 recorded the lowest precipitation , but the overall resultant WQI remained acceptable. Since the occurrence of a strong El Niño event is infrequent and far between in decadal time scale , this paper gives some rare insights that may be central to monitoring and managing freshwater resource that has a crucial impact to the mass population in the region of Southeast Asia.
