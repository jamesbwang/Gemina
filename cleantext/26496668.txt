  Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) is a cytokine that plays an important role in both normal joints and joints affected by osteoarthritis ( OA) , the most common joint disease. However , the role of this pleiotropic cytokine in a normal healthy joint is very different from its role in an OA joint. In a normal synovial joint , active TGF-β is only present after joint loading and only for a short period. In contrast , permanent and high levels of active TGF-β are detected in OA joints. Due to this difference in levels and exposure period of joint cells to active TGF-β , the function of TGF-β is strikingly different in normal and OA joints. The consequences of this difference in TGF-β levels on joint homeostasis and pathological changes in OA joints are discussed in this review.
