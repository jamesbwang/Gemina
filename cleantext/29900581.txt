  In a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) , association between genotype and phenotype at autosomal loci is generally tested by regression models. However , X-chromosome data are often excluded from published analyses of autosomes because of the difference between males and females in number of X chromosomes. Failure to analyze X-chromosome data at all is obviously less than ideal , and can lead to missed discoveries. Even when X-chromosome data are included , they are often analyzed with suboptimal statistics. Several mathematically sensible statistics for X-chromosome association have been proposed. The optimality of these statistics , however , is based on very specific simple genetic models. In addition , while previous simulation studies of these statistics have been informative , they have focused on single-marker tests and have not considered the types of error that occur even under the null hypothesis when the entire X chromosome is scanned. In this study , we comprehensively tested several X-chromosome association statistics using simulation studies that include the entire chromosome. We also considered a wide range of trait models for sex differences and phenotypic effects of X inactivation. We found that models that do not incorporate a sex effect can have large type I error in some cases. We also found that many of the best statistics perform well even when there are modest deviations , such as trait variance differences between the sexes or small sex differences in allele frequencies , from assumptions.
