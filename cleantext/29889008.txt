  While early medical treatment has proven effective in MS , early-phase MS rehabilitation has not gained much attention in MS research and clinical practice. Exercise therapy is one of the most promising treatment strategies in MS rehabilitation. Here , we provide a topical review investigating when exercise therapy is initiated in existing MS studies , showing that exercise is initiated at a rather late disease stage , where it predominantly serves as a symptomatic treatment. Recent findings in MS suggest that exercise may have neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects. Such findings along with the findings from medical trials that an early-stage `` window of opportunity '' exists leads to the proposal that early exercise therapy should be an increased focus in research and clinical practice for persons with MS. A further perspective relates to other rehabilitation interventions that are also initiated at a later disease stage , as these may also take advantage of an early-phase approach.
