  Human activity recognition and pedestrian dead reckoning are an interesting field because of their importance utilities in daily life healthcare. Currently , these fields are facing many challenges , one of which is the lack of a robust algorithm with high performance. This paper proposes a new method to implement a robust step detection and adaptive distance estimation algorithm based on the classification of five daily wrist activities during walking at various speeds using a smart band. The key idea is that the non-parametric adaptive distance estimator is performed after two activity classifiers and a robust step detector. In this study , two classifiers perform two phases of recognizing five wrist activities during walking. Then , a robust step detection algorithm , which is integrated with an adaptive threshold , peak and valley<disease> correction algorithm , is applied to the classified activities to detect the walking steps. In addition , the misclassification activities are fed back to the previous layer. Finally , three adaptive distance estimators , which are based on a non-parametric model of the average walking speed , calculate the length of each strike. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy is about 99 % , and the accuracy of the step detection is 98.7 %. The error of the estimated distance is 2.2 ‚Åª 4.2 % depending on the type of wrist activities.
