  We examined the association between vitamin K status and physical functioning over 13 years in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Longitudinal cohort study of 633 community-dwelling adults from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam ( LASA) aged 55-65 years ( 54 % women). At baseline ( 2002-2003) , plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein ( dp-ucMGP) was measured with a sandwich ELISA as a marker of vitamin K status. The outcome measures handgrip strength , calf circumference , self-reported functional limitations and functional performance were obtained at baseline and four follow-up examinations. We used generalized estimating equations to determine the relationship between dp-ucMGP tertiles and the various outcome measurements after adjusting for potential confounders. The lowest dp-ucMGP tertile reflects a high vitamin K status and was the reference. Mean dp-ucMGP was 376 Â± 233 pmol/L and mean follow-up was 11.1 years. Participants showed a decline in the outcome measures over time. Compared with the lowest tertile , the highest dp-ucMGP tertile had: lower handgrip strength , 1.1 kg ( 95 % confidence interval ( -2.1 , -0.1; P-trend < 0.001); smaller calf circumference , -0.5 cm ( -0.9 -0.1; P-trend = 0.018); and , only among women , a 0.7-point poorer functional performance score ( -1.1 , -0.3; P-interaction = 0.002). Dp-ucMGP was not related to self-reported functional limitations. No interaction effects between time and dp-ucMGP were observed. Low vitamin K status was associated with lower handgrip strength , smaller calf circumference , and , in women only , with poorer functional performance score. A low vitamin K status was however not related to the 13-year decline in these measures.
