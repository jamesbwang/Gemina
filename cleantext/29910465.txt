  To characterize the neural breathing pattern in preterm infants supported with non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ( NIV-NAVA). Single-center prospective observational study. The electrical activity of the diaphragm ( EAdi) was periodically recorded in 30-second series with the Edi catheter and the Servo-n software ( Maquet , Solna , Sweden) in preterm infants supported with NIV-NAVA. The EAdi 291 observations were analyzed in 19 patients with a mean GA of 27.3 weeks ( range 24-36 weeks) , birth weight 1028 g ( 510-2945 g) , and a median ( IQR) postnatal age of 18 days ( 4-27 days). The distribution of respiratory patterns was phasic without tonic activity 61.9 % , phasic with basal tonic activity 18.6 , tonic burst 3.8 % , central apnea 7.9 % , and mixed pattern 7.9 %. In addition , 12 % of the records showed apneas of > 10 seconds , and 50.2 % one or more `` sighs '' , defined as breaths with an EAdi The neural breathing patterns in preterm infants supported with NIV-NAVA are quite variable and are characterized by the presence of significant tonic activity. Central apneas and sighs are common in this group of patients. The nTi seems to be shorter than the mechanical Ti commonly used in assisted ventilation.
