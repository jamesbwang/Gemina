  Radiation exposure is a necessary component of minimally invasive spine procedures to augment limited visualization of anatomy. The surgeon 's exposure to ionizing radiation is not easily recognizable without a digital dosimeter-something few surgeons have access to. The aim of this study was to identify an easy alternative method that uses the available radiation dose data from the C-arm to accurately predict physician exposure. The senior surgeon wore a digital dosimeter during all minimally invasive spine fusion procedures performed over a 12-month period. Patient demographics , procedure information , and radiation exposure throughout the procedure were recorded. Fifty-five minimally invasive spine fusions utilizing 330 percutaneous screws were included. Average radiation dose was 0.46 Rad/screw to the patient. Average radiation exposure to the surgeon was 1.06 ± 0.71 μSv/screw , with a strong positive correlation ( r = 0.77) to patient dose. The coefficient of determination ( r Intra-operative radiation exposure to the patient , which is easily identifiable as a continuously updated fluoroscopic monitor , is a reliable predictor of radiation exposure to the surgeon during percutaneous screw placement in minimally invasive spinal fusion surgery and therefore can provide an estimate of exposure without the use of a dosimeter. With this , a surgeon can better understand the magnitude of their exposure on a case-by-case basis rather than on a quarterly basis , or more likely , not at all.
