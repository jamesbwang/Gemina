  Clinical risk prediction tools for gestational diabetes ( GDM) may be enhanced by measuring biomarkers in early pregnancy. To evaluate a two-step GDM risk prediction tool incorporating fasting glucose ( FG) and serum biomarkers in early pregnancy. High molecular weight ( HMW) adiponectin , omentin-1 and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) were measured at 12-15 weeks gestation in women with high risk of GDM from a randomised trial using a clinical risk prediction tool. GDM diagnosis ( 24-28 weeks) was evaluated using 1998 Australian Diabetes in Pregnancy ( ADIPS) criteria and newer International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups ( IADPSG) criteria. Associations between biomarkers and development of GDM were examined using multivariable regression analysis. Area under the receiver-operator curve ( AUC) , sensitivity and specificity were calculated to determine classification ability of each model compared to FG and maternal characteristics. HMW adiponectin improved prediction of ADIPS GDM ( AUC 0.85 , sensitivity 50 % , specificity 96.2 % , P = 0.04) , compared to FG and maternal factors ( 0.78 , 35 % and , 98.1 % , respectively). HMW adiponectin < 1.53 Î¼g/mL further improved the model ( AUC 0.87 , sensitivity 75 % , specificity 88.2 % , P = 0.01). HMW adiponectin did not improve prediction of IADPSG GDM ( AUC 0.84 , sensitivity 64 % , specificity 97.9 % , P = 0.22) compared to FG and maternal factors ( 0.79 , 56 % , 93.8 %). Omentin-1 and IL-6 did not significantly improve classification ability for GDM. A two-step approach combining FG and HMW adiponectin to a validated clinical risk prediction tool improved sensitivity and predictive ability for ADIPS GDM. Further research is required to enhance GDM prediction using IADPSG criteria for application in clinical practice.
