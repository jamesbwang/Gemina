  Organic solar cells ( OSCs) have gained attention of the scientific community from the last decade and are now considered as one of the most important source for low-cost power production. The recent rapid progress in non-fullerene acceptors in BHJ indicates that they have potential to compete with fullerene-based BHJ OSCs. The present review addressed the systematic comparison among various acceptors ( diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP) , benzothiadiazole ( BTD) and perylenediimide ( PDI) based acceptors) in order to design and improve the performance of small molecules based non-fullerene acceptors. This review focuses on the performance of small molecule non-fullerene acceptors based on DPP , BTD and PDI for OSCs with respect to the change in molecular structures , energy levels , and PCE. A systematic comparison on the effect of molecular architecture , side chains on their performance is provided with the intention of evaluating the challenge to make highly efficient acceptors for the next generation organic photovoltaics.
