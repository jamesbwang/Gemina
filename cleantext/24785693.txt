  The current project evaluated the impact of a short-term , supported funding initiative that allowed staff from allied health ( AH) professions to undertake research activity within rostered employment time. Specifically , the project will report on outcomes pertaining to individual research capacity , research output , and overall satisfaction with the initiative. Sixteen AH clinicians ( n = 16) from six AH professions participated in the evaluation of the initiative , with data being collected within a service improvement framework. Clinicians received up to 4 weeks of protected time relieved from their clinical duties to undertake research activities , including writing for publication , undertaking a systematic review , data analysis , and preparation of ethics applications. An AH Research Fellow provided additional support and mentorship , including the development of an implementation plan. Evaluation included pre-post measures of individual research capacity using a 15-item self-report Research Capacity and Culture ( RCC) survey , a post-implementation satisfaction survey , and monitoring of research output achieved. Statistically significant improvements ( The preliminary findings support the feasibility of implementing a local , clinical funding model to promote individual research capacity and research output for AHPs. The short-term funding should be supported by local mentorship and guidance. Local barriers and suggestions to optimize implementation , including integrating within existing research infrastructure and using flexible `` backfill '' options , will also be described.
