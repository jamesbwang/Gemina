  Ontario delisted high-strength fentanyl , hydromorphone and morphine from the public drug formulary for non-palliative care prescribers on 31 January , 2017. Our aim is to assess the early impact of this policy on prescribing patterns and to examine whether this impact varied by prescriber type , opioid type and opioid strength. We conducted a population-based , cross-sectional study on palliative and non-palliative care patients dispensed fentanyl , hydromorphone or morphine through the Ontario public drug program between 1 January , 2014 , and 31 July , 2017. For each month during the study period , we reported the total number of high-strength opioid recipients stratified by prescriber type , and the total volume of each drug dispensed , stratified by strength. We used interventional autoregressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA) models to assess the policy 's impact on prescribing patterns. We observed a 98 % decrease in the total number of publicly funded recipients of high-strength opioids between December 2016 and July 2017 ( 5930 to 133 recipients) for all prescribers. The policy led to a significant decline in the total volume of all three opioids dispensed: hydromorphone from 20 374 621 to 16 952 097 mg ( p < .01); morphine from 40 644 190 to 33 555 480 mg ( p < .03); and fentanyl from 9 604 913 to 5 842 405 mcg/h ( p < .01). For both fentanyl and hydromorphone , this reduction generally corresponded to an increase in the number of low-strength opioids dispensed. Delisting high-strength opioids substantially reduced the number of highstrength opioid recipients and reduced the overall volume of long-acting opioids dispensed in Ontario through the public drug program. Future studies should examine its impact on patient outcomes.
