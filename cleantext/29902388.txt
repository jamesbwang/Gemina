  Phthisis bulbi denotes end-stage eye disease characterized by shrinkage and disorganization of the eye with the resultant functional loss. The major factors associated with the pathogenesis of phthisis are hypotony , deranged blood-ocular barriers , and inflammation<symptom>. Common causes include trauma , surgery , infection , inflammation<symptom> , malignancy , retinal detachment , and vascular lesions<symptom>. A phthisical globe shows a small squared off shape , opaque and thickened cornea , thickened sclera<symptom> , neovascularization of iris , cataract , cyclitic membrane , ciliochoroidal detachment , and retinal detachment. Microscopic features include internal disorganization , inflammatory reaction , a reactive proliferation of various cells , calcification , and ossification. Early treatment of the causative etiology is the best strategy available to avoid an eye from going into phthisis. A phthisical eye has no visual potential and cosmetic rehabilitation or symptomatic relief of pain remains the mainstay in the management. The authors present a comprehensive review of the etiopathogenesis , pathology , clinical features , and management of the end-stage ocular disease.
