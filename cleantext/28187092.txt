  Venous thromboembolism after open gynecologic surgery is not uncommon , especially in the presence of other risk factors such as obesity , prolonged surgical time or gynecologic malignancy. We present the case of a 62 y.o. patient who underwent open hysterectomy and surgical staging for uterine serous carcinoma. She was readmitted with lower extremity edema<symptom>. During her workup , she underwent cardiovascular arrest secondary to saddle pulmonary embolus requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. After systemic and catheter directed thrombolysis , and a long hospitalization , she was discharged home in stable condition. Saddle pulmonary embolus is a potentially catastrophic and fatal postoperative complication. This case demonstrates a successful implementation of directed thrombolysis , veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and multidisciplinary management in a case of postoperative saddle pulmonary embolus. We report a case of an endometrial cancer patient who sustained a massive postoperative pulmonary embolus and was successfully resuscitated using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
