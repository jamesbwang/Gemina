  Interruptions during handover may compromise continuity of care and patient safety. Interruptions occur frequently during handovers in the intensive care unit. A quality improvement study was undertaken to improve nursing team leader handover processes. The frequency , source , and reason interruptions occurred were recorded before and after a handover intervention. The intervention involved relocating handover from the desk to bedside and using a printed version of an evidence-based electronic minimum data set. These strategies were supported by education , champions , reminders , and audit and feedback. Forty handovers were audiotaped before , and 49 were observed 3 months following the intervention. Sixty-four interruptions occurred before and 52 after the intervention , but this difference was not statistically significant. Team leaders were frequently interrupted by nurses discussing personal or work-specific matters before and after the intervention. Further work is required to reduce interruptions that do not benefit patient care.
