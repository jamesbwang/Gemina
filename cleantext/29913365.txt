  The most common rodent control method worldwide is anticoagulant rodenticides ( ARs) , which cause death by internal bleeding. ARs can transfer to non-target predators via secondary exposure , i.e. by consuming contaminated rodents. Here we quantify the prevalence of seven AR substances in the liver tissues of altogether 17 mammalian or avian predator or scavenger species in Finland. In addition , we identify the environmental and biological factors potentially linked to secondary AR poisoning<disease>. No previous AR screenings have been conducted in the country , despite the widespread use of ARs and their potential impacts on the high levels of the ecosystem food chain. ARs were detected ( ≥ 0.3 μg/kg) in 82 % of the 131 samples. The most prevalent and the AR with highest concentrations was bromadiolone ( 65 % of samples). In 77 % of the positive samples more than one ( 2-5) different ARs were detected. Of the environmental variables , we only found a weakly positive relationship between the coumatetralyl concentration and the livestock farm density. Conversely , overall AR concentration and number , as well as the concentration of three separate ARs ( coumatetralyl , difenacoum and bromadiolone) differed among the three species groups tested , with the group `` other mammals '' ( largely represented by red fox and raccoon dog) having higher values than the groups presented by mustelids or by birds. ARs are authorized only as biocides in Finland and a national strategy on risk management ( e.g. for minimising secondary poisoning<disease> of non-target species) of ARs was adopted in 2011. Based on these results it appears that the risk mitigation measures ( RMMs) either have not been followed or have not been effective in preventing wide scale secondary exposure. Continued monitoring of AR residues in non-target species is needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of current RMMs and a need for new ones to reduce the risk of secondary
