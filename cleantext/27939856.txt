  The dissociation between a subjective-criterion performance and forced performance in a sensory detection can provide critical insights into the neural correlates of sensory awareness. Here , we established a behavioral task for rats to test their spatial-visual cue detection ability , using a two alternative choice task with and without a third choice option where animals get rewards only in the objective absence of a visual cue. In the trials without the third option , spatial choice accuracy decreased from near perfect to near chance levels as the visual cue brightness decreased. In contrast , with the third option , the rats exhibited > 90 % spatial choice accuracy regardless of the cue brightness. The rats chose the third choice option less frequently when the cue was brighter , suggesting that rats have a generalized strategy to make spatial choices only when their internal detection criterion is met. Interestingly , even when the animals chose the third option , they could still significantly and correctly choose the direction of the visual stimuli if they were forced. Our data suggest that the rats ' variable detection performance with identical set of stimuli is derived from stochastic processing of visual signals with a certain internal detection threshold rather than general motivational threshold.
