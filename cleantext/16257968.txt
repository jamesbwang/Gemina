  Recently it has been demonstrated that Fetuin-A , an anti-inflammatory protein synthesized by the liver , is produced also in bone by an FGF23-regulated pathway. FGF23 has been also demonstrated to induce inflammatory cytokine production in the liver. This study aimed to explore if FGF23 plays a role in the Fetuin-A production in the liver cells too and the possible relationships with FGF23 pro-inflammatory effects. FGF23 and Fetuin-A were studied in liver , kidney and in plasma with immunochemistry , immunoprecipitation , western blot , chromatin immunoprecipitation , duolink , ELISA , qrtPCR methodology. FGF23 is produced , but not secreted by the liver cells. In hepatocytes and circulation , FGF23 was present only strictly linked to Fetuin-A , while Fetuin-A was found also in unbounded form. No link was observed in the kidney. FGF23 up to 600 pg/ml stimulates , while , at higher concentrations , reduces Fetuin-A expression. Notably , overall the range of concentrations , FGF23 stimulates Fetuin-A promoter , TNFα and IL6 expression. In the nucleus , FGF23 seems to act as a direct transcription factor of Fetuin-A promoter. These results suggest that FGF23 played a direct regulatory role in Fetuin-A expression in liver cells with a biphasic effect: Fetuin-A progressively increases when FGF23 increases up to 400-600 pg/mL , and declines at higher FGF23 concentrations. These results lead us to hypothesize: a) a possible epigenetic post-transcriptional regulation; b) a possible counter-regulatory effect of FGF23 induced inflammatory cytokines ( TNFα/ NF-κB mechanism). This study could add an additional key for the interpretation of the possible mechanisms linking FGF23 , Fetuin-A and inflammation<symptom> in CKD patients and suggests a role for FGF23 as transcription factor.
