  Extracellular proTGF-β is covalently linked to `` milieu '' molecules in the matrix or on cell surfaces and is latent until TGF-β is released by integrins. Here , we show that LRRC33 on the surface of microglia functions as a milieu molecule and enables highly localized , integrin-αVβ8-dependent TGF-β activation. Lrrc33
