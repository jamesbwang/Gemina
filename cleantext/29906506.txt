  Neprilysin is a transmembrane M13 zinc metalloprotease responsible for the degradation of several biologically active peptides including insulin , enkephalin , substance P , bradykinin , endothelin-1 , neurotensin and amyloid-β. The protein has received attention for its role in modulating blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> responses with its inhibition producing an antihypertensive response. To date , several inhibitor bound crystal structures of the human neprilysin extracellular domain have been determined , but , a structure free of bound inhibitor or substrate has yet to be reported. Here , we report the first crystal structure free of substrate or inhibitor for the extracellular catalytic domain of human neprilysin at 1.9 Å resolution. This structure will provide a reference point for comparisons to future inhibitor or substrate bound structures. The neprilysin structure also reveals that a closed protein conformation can be adopted in protein crystals absent of bound substrate or inhibitor.
