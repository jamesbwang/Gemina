  A systematic review of current evidence using various electronic databases was conducted. Studies were appraised using a recognised clinical appraisal tool. Seven studies published between 1998 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria. There is some evidence that difficulties with fine motor skills , visual motor integration , and balance<symptom> skills persist in people who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol. Most studies did not focus on adolescent or adult participants in isolation , making it difficult to generalise results. Varied methodological designs made it difficult to compare studies as few used common standardised assessments Conclusion: A review of functional difficulties in each individual would be required to determine if a motor assessment is warranted. Further research is required using assessments recommended in diagnostic guidelines to determine the common motor difficulties seen in adolescents and adults.
