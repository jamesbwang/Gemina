  A rise in incivility has been documented in medicine , with implications for patient care , organizational effectiveness , and costs. This study explored organizational factors that may contribute to incivility at one academic medical center and potential systems-level solutions to combat it. The authors completed semi-structured individual interviews with full-time faculty members of the department of medicine ( DOM) at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine , Toronto , Canada , with clinical appointments at six affiliated hospitals , between June and September 2016. They asked about participants ' experiences with incivility , potential contributing factors , and possible solutions. Two analysts independently coded a portion of the transcripts until a framework was developed with excellent agreement within the research team , as signified by the Kappa coefficient. A single coder completed analysis of the remaining transcripts. Forty-nine interviews with physicians from all university ranks and academic position descriptions were completed. All participants had collegial relationships with colleagues but had observed , heard of , or been personally affected by uncivil behavior. Incivility occurred furtively , face-to-face , or online. The participants identified several organizational factors that bred incivility including physician non-employee status in hospitals , silos within the DOM , poor leadership , a culture of silence , and the existence of power cliques. They offered many systems-levels solutions to combat incivility through prevention , improved reporting , and clearer consequences. Existing strategies to combat incivility have focused on modifying individual behavior but opportunites may exist to reduce incivility through a greater understanding of the role of health care organizations in shaping workplace culture.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
