  Few studies have assessed patient-reported quality of life ( QoL) in patients with glioma undergoing surgery , and even fewer have provided longitudinal data. Accordingly , there is little knowledge about the changes of QoL over time in patients with glioma. We sought to explore perioperative and postoperative development of generic QoL during the first 6 months after primary glioma surgery. A total of 136 adult patients undergoing primary surgery for high-grade glioma ( HGG) or low-grade glioma ( LGG) were prospectively included in this explorative longitudinal study. Patient-reported QoL was measured with the generic tool EQ-5D 3L preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months after surgery. At group level , there was no difference in EQ-5D index values in patients with HGG compared with patients with LGG at baseline or at 1 month. At 6 months , EQ-5D index values in patients with HGG had deteriorated significantly ( P < 0.001) but remained stable in patients with LGG. Individual level QoL development was more diverse. American Society of Anesthesiologists class â‰¥ 3 , resection grades other than gross total resection , and HGG were identified as independent predictors for negative development of QoL between 1 and 6 months after surgery. At group level , development of generic QoL between baseline and 1 and 6 months postoperatively seems to follow the natural disease trajectories of LGG and HGG , with deterioration in patients with HGG at 6 months. Individual development of QoL is heterogeneous. HGG , resection grades other than gross total resection , and preoperative comorbidity are predictors of postoperative impairment of QoL.
