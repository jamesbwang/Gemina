  Methylglyoxal ( MGO) and glyoxal ( GO) are attracting considerable attention because of their role in the onset of diabetes symptoms. Therefore , to comprehend the molecular fundamentals of their pathological actions is of the utmost importance. In this study , the molecular interactions between resveratrol ( RES) and human serum albumin ( HSA) and the ability of the stilbene to counteract the oxidative damage caused by pathological concentrations of MGO and GO to the human plasma protein , was assessed. The oxidation of Cys34 in HSA as well as the formation of specific protein semialdehydes AAS ( α-aminoadipic) , GGS ( γ-glutamic) and the accumulation of Advanced Glycation End-products ( AGEs) was investigated. Resveratrol was found to neutralize both α-dicarbonyls by forming adducts detected by HESI-Orbitrap-MS. This antioxidant action was manifested in a significant reduction of AGEs. However , RES-α-dicarbonyl conjugates oxidized Cys34 and lysine , arginine and/or proline by a nucleophilic attack on SH and ε-NH groups in HSA. The formation of specific semialdehydes in HSA after incubation with GO and MGO at pathological concentrations was reported for the first time in this study , and may be used as early and specific biomarkers of the oxidative stress undergone by diabetic patients. The pro-oxidative role of the RES-α-dicarbonyl conjugates should be further investigated to clarify whether this action leads to positive or harmful clinical consequences. The biological relevance of human protein carbonylation as a redox signaling mechanism and/or as a reflection of oxidative damage and disease should also be studied in future works.
