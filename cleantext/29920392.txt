  Essential tremor<symptom> ( ET) is a common movement disorder. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive neuroimaging method acquired in absence of task. Our study aimed to correlate pretherapeutic ventrolateral thalamus functional connectivity ( FC) with clinical results 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy ( SRS-T) for drug-resistant ET. Data from 12 healthy control individuals were additionally included. Resting state was acquired for 17 consecutive ( right-handed) patients , before and 1 year after left unilateral SRS-T. Standard tremor<symptom> scores were evaluated pretherapeutically and 1 year after SRS-T. Tremor<symptom> network was investigated using region of interest , left ventrolateral ventral ( VLV) cluster , obtained from pretherapeutic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Seed-based FC was obtained as correlations between the time courses of the VLV and that of every other voxel. The seed-connectivity maps were obtained pretherapeutically and correlated across all patients with clinical outcome 1 year after SRS-T. One-year magnetic resonance signature volume was always located inside VLV and did not correlate with reported seed-FC measures ( P > 0.05). We report statistically significant correlations between pretherapeutic VLV FC with clinical outcome for 1) right visual association area ( Brodmann area , BA19) predicting 1 year activities of daily living decrease ( P Our results suggest that pretherapeutic resting-state seed-FC of left VLV predicts tremor<symptom> arrest after SRS-T for ET. Visual areas are identified as the main regions in this correlation.
