  Loss of PTEN is a common genomic aberration in castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) and is frequently concurrent with ERG rearrangements , causing resistance to next-generation hormonal treatment ( NGHT) including abiraterone. The relationship between PTEN loss and docetaxel sensitivity remains uncertain. To study the antitumor activity of docetaxel in metastatic CRPC in relation to PTEN and ERG aberrations. Single-centre , retrospective analysis of PTEN loss and ERG expression using a previously described immunohistochemistry ( IHC) binary classification system. Patients received docetaxel between January 1 , 2006 and July 31 , 2016. Response correlations were analyzed using Pearson 's Ï‡ Overall , 215 patients were eligible. Established metastatic CRPC prognostic factors were well balanced between PTEN loss ( 39 %) and normal patients ( 61 %). PTEN loss was associated with shorter median OS ( 25.4 vs 34.7 mo; hazard ratio ( HR) 1.66 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.18-2.13; Our findings suggest that metastatic CRPC with PTEN loss might benefit more from docetaxel than from NGHT. In this study we found that metastatic prostate cancer with loss of the PTEN switch may benefit more from docetaxel than from abiraterone.
