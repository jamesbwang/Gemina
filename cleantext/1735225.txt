  Limb length inequality results from many types of musculoskeletal disorders. Asymmetric weight bearing from a limb length discrepancy of less than 2 % can have debilitating consequences such as back problems and early-onset osteoarthritis. Existing treatments include invasive surgeries and/or drug regimens that are often only partially effective. As a noninvasive alternative , we previously developed a once daily limb-heating model using targeted heat on one side of the body for 2 weeks to unilaterally increase bone length by up to 1.5 % in growing mice. In this study , we applied heat for 1 week to determine whether these small differences in limb length are functionally significant , assessed by changes in hindlimb weight bearing. We tested the hypothesis that heat-induced limb length asymmetry has a functional impact on weight bearing in mouse hindlimbs. Female 3-week-old C57BL/6 mice (
