  Seven aromatic glycosides ( 1-7) , including four phenylethanol glycosides , one phenylmethanol glycoside , one phenylpropane glycoside and one benzoside , were isolated from the methanolic extract of Uighur Medicine Elaeagnus angustifolia flowers. Their structures were elucidated based on the analysis of spectroscopic data ( 1D , 2D NMR and HR-MS). Compound 1 is a new compound , named as angustifol A. Six known compounds were identified as 2-phenylethyl-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 2) , salidroside ( 3) , vanillic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 4) , vanilloloside ( 5) , ( Z)- isoconiferin ( 6) , 2-phenylethyl-6-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 7). Compounds 2-7 were isolated from the genus Elaeagnus for the first time. In vitro anti-inflammatory assays revealed that none of these compounds showed good COX inhibitory activities.
