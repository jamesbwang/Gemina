  An emerging approach to limit rice uptake and grain As targets the shared root-uptake pathway between As ( III) and Si. We amended rice paddy mesocosms with Si-rich rice residues ( husk and husk char) or silicate fertilizer to evaluate the impact of different Si sources on rice uptake of Si and As including As speciation in grain under background soil As. For a systems-approach , we also measured plant biomass , rice yield , porewater chemistry , mesocosm-scale CH
