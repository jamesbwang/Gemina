  Tramadol , a preferred analgesic due to its less respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom>. It also has a central action that blocks the reuptake and enhances the release of serotonin at spinal antinociceptive pathways. Ondansetron , an antiemetic is a serotonin receptor antagonist. Due to the contradictory actions of the two drugs , co-administration of these drugs resulted in higher usage of tramadol. All these studies were done in the postoperative period. The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of tramadol infusion versus tramadol plus ondansetron infusion in Medical Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) patients. After Institutional Ethical Committee approval , 50 patients who experience pain other than postoperative pain were enrolled and randomized into two groups. Both the groups initially received 50 mg of tramadol intravenously over 10 min followed by Group T+O received 10 mg/h tramadol + 0.4 mg/h ondansetron as an infusion. Group T received 10 mg/h tramadol as infusion. Hemodynamic parameters along with pain assessment using Verbal Rating Scale ( VRS) were analyzed at 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 h. Rescue analgesia was administered if VRS > 4. Side effects were noted by condition scoring criteria ( CSC) scale. Rescue analgesia was administered at 3 h , for three patients in T+O Group and 1 patient in T Group , but this is not statistically significant ( We conclude that co-administration of tramadol and ondansetron can be practiced in medical ICU patients without any higher requirement in dosage of tramadol.
