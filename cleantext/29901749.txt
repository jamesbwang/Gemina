  Two experiments of the same design were conducted to determine the influence of phytase on performance and apparent ileal digestibility ( AID) of amino acids in broilers fed graded concentrations of digestible sulfur amino acids ( dgM + C). Cobb 400 male broilers were allocated to 1 of 10 diets consisting of 5 basal diets formulated at 75 , 82 , 89 , 96 , or 103 % of the Cobb 400 dgM + C requirements for each feeding phase. Phytase was included in each basal diet at 0 or 2,000 FTU/kg. In experiment 1 , 33 birds/pen from hatch to day 42 were fed a 2-phase feeding program with 10 replicate pens/diet. In experiment 2 , there were 26 birds/pen from hatch to day 21 and 8 replicate pens/diet. Data were analyzed as a 5 × 2 factorial and means separated using orthogonal contrasts. In experiment 1 , overall ( hatch to day 42) feed intake ( FI) decreased ( linear , P < 0.05) , body<symptom> weight gain ( BWG) increased ( quadratic , P < 0.05) , and feed conversion ratio ( FCR) was improved ( quadratic , P < 0.05) as dgM + C increased to ≥ 96 % in the diet. Phytase increased ( P < 0.05) BWG and improved ( P < 0.05) FCR , regardless of the percent dgM + C in the diet. In experiment 2 , overall ( hatch to day 21) BWG increased ( quadratic , P < 0.05) , and FCR was improved ( quadratic , P < 0.05) as dgM + C increased to ≥ 96 % in the diet. Phytase increased FI ( P < 0.05) and BWG ( P < 0.05) and improved FCR ( P < 0.05) , regardless of the percent dgM + C in the diet. In the absence of phytase , the AID of all amino acids was greatest ( quadratic , P < 0.05) in birds fed between 89 and 96 % dgM + C. However , in the presence of phytase the AID of all amino acids was greatest ( quadratic , P < 0.05) in birds fed 82 % dgM + C and greater at all levels of dgM + C than birds fed diets without phytase ( dgM + C × phytase , P < 0.05). In conclusion , phytase improved AID of all amino acids and improved growth performance regardless of the level of dgM + C in the diet.
