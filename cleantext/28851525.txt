  The glycosylated protein vasorin physically interacts with the transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-β1) and functionally attenuates its fibrogenic signaling in the vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) of the arterial wall. Angiotensin II ( Ang II) amplifies TGF-β1 activation in the VSMCs of the arterial wall with aging. In this study , we hypothesized that a reduced expression of the protein vasorin plays a contributory role in magnifying Ang II-associated fibrogenic signaling in the VSMCs of the arterial wall with aging. The current study shows that vasorin mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased both in aortic wall and VSMCs from old ( 30 mo) vs. young ( 8 mo) FXBN rats. Exposing young VSMCs to Ang II reduced vasorin protein expression to the levels of old untreated cells while treating old VSMCs with the Ang II type AT1 receptor antagonist Losartan upregulated vasorin protein expression up to the levels of young. The physical interaction between vasorin and TGF-β1 was significantly decreased in old vs. young VSMCs. Further , exposing young VSMCs to Ang II increased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase type II ( MMP-2) activation and TGF-β1 downstream molecules p-SMAD-2/ 3 and collagen type I production up to the levels of old untreated VSMCs , and these effects were substantially inhibited by overexpressing vasorin. Administration of Ang II to young rats ( 8 mo) for 28 days via an osmotic minipump markedly reduced the expression of vasorin. Importantly , vasorin protein was effectively cleaved by activated MMP-2 both
