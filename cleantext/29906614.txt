  During the past decade of conflict , numerous casualties sustained injuries requiring the formation of an ostomy. However , outcomes in those casualties undergoing ostomy reversal have yet to be analyzed. We review the experience and identify risk factors for complications after ostomy reversal in a series of combat casualties at our military treatment facility. A retrospective review of combat casualties managed with a diverting ostomy who underwent ostomy reversal at our military treatment facility over a 13 year period. Demographic and clinical data collected for all patients and post-operative complications identified. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for complications following reversal. Complication rates were calculated for 90 day periods of time following ostomy creation and best fit curve analysis conducted. 99 patients were identified who underwent ostomy reversal. 40 patients ( 40.4 %) suffered a post-reversal complication. On multivariate analysis , older age ( OR = 1.11/ year; p = 0.038) , severe perineal injury indication for diversion ( OR = 4.37; p = 0.028) , and increased time interval between ostomy creation and reversal ( OR = 1.005/ day; p = 0.037) , were independently associated with post-operative complications. A cubic regression best fit quarterly complication rate data ( R Ostomy reversal in the combat wounded is a major undertaking with a high complication rate. The finding of a shorter interval from ostomy creation to reversal independently associated with a reduction in complications provides a modifiable risk factor to guide future practice and potentially reduce complications. Our modeling suggests reversal in the three to six month time frame may have the lowest rate of complications. Future research to reduce complications is indicated , especially in the older patient with perineal
