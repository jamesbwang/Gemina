  Second order susceptibility ( SOS) microscopy is used to image and characterize chondrogenesis in cultured human mesesnchymal stem cells ( hMSCs). SOS analysis shows that the second order susceptibility tensor ratios can be used to characterize type I and II collagens in living tissues and that both collagen types are produce at the onset of chondrogenesis. Time-lapse analysis shows a modulation of extracellular matrix results in an higher rate in increase of type II collagen , as compared to type I collagen. With time , type II collagen content stabilizes at the composition of 70 % of total collagen content. SOS microscopy can be used to continuously and non-invasively monitor the production of collagens I and II. With additional development , this technique can be developed into an effective quality control tool for monitoring extracellular matrix production in engineered tissues.
