  To describe the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension based on the value from mercury sphygmomanometer and converted electronic sphygmomanometer among adults 18 years old and over in China 2010-2012. Data was from the Chinese Nutrition and Health Surveillance in 2010-2012. The total number was 120 428 which selected through the method of multi-stage stratified cluster randomization sampling and probability proportion to size ( PPS). The study objects were adults aged 18 and over in 31 Provinces and 150 sites in China Mainland. There were four categories areas: large cities , medium and small cities , general rural areas and poor rural areas. An average of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> value was calculated though three systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> readings taken by mercury sphygmomanometer. The value of converted electronic sphygmomanometer was from a survey. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 90 mmHg and/or use of antihypertensive drug in the past two weeks. Age-standardized result were calculated incorporating a complex sample weighting using the population data from the National Bureau of Statistics in 2009. The overall adjusted prevalence of hypertension based on the value of mercury sphygmomanometer among Chinese adults aged18 and over was 22. 8 % ( 95 % CI 21. 3 % -24. 3 %) in 2011-2012. It was 24. 1 % ( 95 % CI 22. 3 % -26. 0 %) in men and 21. 4 % ( 95 % CI 20. 0 % -22. 9 %) in women. It showed 9. 7 % ( 95 % CI 8. 6 % -10. 9 %) , 32. 7 % ( 95 % CI 30. 8 % -34. 5 %) and52. 6 % ( 95 % CI 51. 0 % -54. 3 %) in 18-44 , 45-59 and 60 + age groups. Hypertension was 24. 5 % ( 95 % CI 22. 4 % -26. 7 %) in urban and 21. 1 % ( 95 % CI19. 0 % -23. 2 %) in rural. The prevalence of hypertension based on the value of converted electronic device was 25. 2 % ( 95 % CI 23. 6 % -26. 7 %). It was 26. 2 % ( 95 % CI 24. 4 % -27. 9 %) in men and 24. 1 % ( 95 % CI 22. 6 % -25. 6 %) in women. 10. 6 % ( 95 % CI 9. 4 % -11. 8 %) , 35. 7 % ( 95 % CI 34. 0 % -37. 5 %) and 58. 9 % ( 95 % CI57. 0 % -60. 7 %) was found in 18-44 , 45-59 and 60 + age groups. Prevalent hypertension was 26. 8 % ( 95 % CI 24. 7 % -28. 8 %) in urban and 23. 5 % ( 95 % CI21. 2 % -25. 8 %) in rural area. Prevalence of hypertension among the adults in China is increasing. The prevalence of hypertension from mercury sphygmomanometer is lower than that of converted electronic value. Both kinds of value have similar characteristics. More men than women have a hypertension. There is a higher prevalence as growth of age. There is a decreasing prevalence of hypertension in large cities , medium and small cities , general rural areas and poor rural areas.
