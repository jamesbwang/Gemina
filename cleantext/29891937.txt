  The average age of patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is increasing , but a limited number of reports have described therapy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor for elderly RCC patients. Hence , we analysed the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years with advanced RCC. Data were extracted from < 75-year-old and ≥ 75-year-old patient groups , matching those demographics considered to affect prognosis. Differences in patients ' characteristics , dose modification , adverse events , tumour response , progression-free survival , and renal function ( glomerular filtration) were evaluated between the groups. From 2536 and 703 patients aged < 75 and ≥ 75 years , respectively , 397 pairs were matched. Median daily dose was higher and duration of treatment longer in patients < 75 years; however , progression-free survival and tumour response were similar in both age groups. Incidence of all adverse events was not significantly different between groups. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment was higher in patients ≥ 75 years , but there was no significant difference between groups in the number patients discontinuing due to adverse events. For patients aged ≥ 75 years , sorafenib treatment had minimal additional negative impact compared to younger patients and showed similar efficacy and safety without reducing renal function.
