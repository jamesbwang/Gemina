  Tiller angle in cereals is a key shoot architecture trait that strongly influences grain yield. Studies in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) have implicated shoot gravitropism in the regulation of tiller angle. However , the functional link between shoot gravitropism and tiller angle is unknown. Here , we conducted a large-scale transcriptome analysis of rice shoots in response to gravistimulation and identified two new nodes of a shoot gravitropism regulatory gene network that also controls rice tiller angle. We demonstrate that HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2D ( HSFA2D) is an upstream positive regulator of the LAZY1-mediated asymmetric auxin distribution pathway. We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes , WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6 ( WOX6) and WOX11 , are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle. These findings define upstream and downstream genetic components that link shoot gravitropism , asymmetric auxin distribution , and rice tiller angle. The results highlight the power of the high-temporal-resolution RNA-seq dataset , and its use to explore further genetic components controlling tiller angle. Collectively these approaches will identify genes to improve grain yields by facilitating the optimization of plant architecture.
