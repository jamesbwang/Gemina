  Telomere shortening is associated to sarcopenia leading to functional impairment during aging. There are mechanisms associated with telomere attrition , as well to its protection and repair. Physical training is a factor that attenuates telomere shortening , but little is known about the effects of different exercise intensities on telomere biology. Thus , we evaluated the effects of exercise intensity ( moderate vs. high-intensity domain) on gene expression of senescence markers Checkpoint kinase 2 and tumor suppressor (
