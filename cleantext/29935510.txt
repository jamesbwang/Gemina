  We report a computational strategy to obtain the charges of individual dielectric particles from experimental observation of their interactions as a function of time. This strategy uses evolutionary optimization to minimize the difference between trajectories extracted from the experiment and simulated trajectories based on many-particle force fields. The force fields include both Coulombic interactions and dielectric polarization effects that arise due to particle-particle charge mismatch and particle-environment dielectric contrast. The strategy was applied to systems of free falling charged granular particles in a vacuum , where electrostatic interactions are the only driving forces that influence the particles ' motion. We show that when the particles ' initial positions and velocities are known , the optimizer requires only an initial and final particle configuration of a short trajectory in order to accurately infer the particles ' charges; when the initial velocities are unknown and only the initial positions are given , the optimizer can learn from multiple frames along the trajectory to determine the particles ' initial velocities and charges. While the results presented here offer a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed ideas , the proposed strategy could be extended to more complex systems of electrostatically charged granular matter.
