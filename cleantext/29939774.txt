  Purpose/aim of the study: In the retina , defects in pericytes ( PCs) function/loss are associated with various complications; however , the exact pathological mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Following the behavior of retina-resident PCs during health and disease will reveal new insights for both the understanding of pathological mechanisms and the development of new regenerative therapies for the treatment of retinopathies. The main goal of this study is to determine whether the NG2-reporter mouse ( NG2CreER Vascular development-dependent reporter induction in retinal PCs was evaluated at different time points ( ( a) > P21 , ( b) < P21 , and ( c) P1 to > P21)) and additionally four different modes of application were tested. Reporter expression was evaluated by enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP) immunofluorescence by confocal microscopy and induction efficiency was calculated by analyzing NG2-expressing PCs in comparison to eGFP-labeled PCs in the three capillary layers. eGFP-positive PCs were detected in the three retinal capillary layers at all time points and administration routes tested. Multiple tamoxifen ( TAM) applications in adult ( > P21) NG2CreER Despite low recombination efficiency in the used PC-specific fate mapping mouse model , changes in NG2 promoter activity of PCs during vascular development are indicated by single and multiple TAM inductions at different developmental time points. Nevertheless , these findings need further confirmation in up-coming studies by using homozygous NG2CreER
