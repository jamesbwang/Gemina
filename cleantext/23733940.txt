  The Three-River Headwaters region ( TRHR) of China is an important part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Although the TRHR is rich in grassland resources , the ecosystem of this area is extremely fragile. Natural and artificial interference have been key to the development of grassland ecosystem spatiotemporal heterogeneity , although the intensity and mode of their influence on ecological processes varies depending on scale; analyses in this area are therefore also scale-dependent. We use multi-scale nested data to analyze the mechanisms underlying the influence of climate change and human activities on grassland net primary productivity ( NPP) by applying a multi-level modeling approach. The results of this study show that: ( 1) The annual grassland NPP of the TRHR has risen in a wavelike pattern over time , increasing by 39.88 % overall; ( 2) Differences of 54.9 % and 41.1 % in temporal grassland NPP can be attributed to variations between these watersheds as well as county characteristics , and; ( 3) Although the ` warm and moist ' climate trend seen over the course of this study has proved beneficial in enhancing grassland NPP , the rate of increase has tended to be faster in relatively dry and warm regions. Economic development and population growth have both exerted negative impacts on grassland NPP.
