  To investigate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids therapy in adult critical ill patients with septic shock<symptom>. The PUBMED , EMBASE , Web of Science , Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to March 24 , 2018. To identify randomized controlled trials that evaluating the role of corticosteroids therapy in adult critical ill patients with septic shock<symptom>. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The second outcomes included 90-day mortality , ICU mortality , In-hospital mortality , length of stay in ICU , length of stay in hospital , reversal of shock<symptom> and superinfection. A total of eighteen randomized controlled trials involving 8128 adult critical ill patients with septic shock<symptom> fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The outcomes of this meta-analysis showed that corticosteroids therapy did n't significantly reduce the 28-day mortality ( RR = 0.94; 95 % CI , 0.84 to 1.05; Z = 1.07 ( P = 0.285)). However , corticosteroids therapy was associated with a significantly shorter length of stay in ICU ( WMD = -1.55; 95 % CI , -2.19 to -0.91; Z = 4.74 ( P = 0.000)). 90-day mortality , ICU mortality , In-hospital mortality , length of stay in hospital , reversal of shock<symptom> and superinfection had no significantly difference between the corticosteroids therapy and placebo therapy ( p > 0.05). Similar results were obtained in subgroups of trials stratified according to the dose of corticosteroids ( high dose or low does). Based on the results of this meta-analysis , corticosteroids therapy was associated with a significantly shorter length of stay in ICU among adult cirtical ill patients with septic shock<symptom>. The mortality was similar between the corticosteroids therapy and placebo.
