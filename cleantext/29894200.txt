  Texturized Vegetable Protein ( TVP) , as the meat analogues , has aroused the attention due to the advantages of health and nutrition. During the extrusion process of TVP , under the comprehensive effects of temperature , shear force , and pressure , complex conformational changes and molecular interactions amongst protein , carbohydrate , lipid , and other components occur , which determine the quality of TVP. Control of the extrusion process is still a big challenge. Therefore , this review summarized the development and current status of food extrusion technology for the production of TVP and gave detailed descriptions about the conformational changes of the main components during the extrusion process , focusing on the effects of barrel temperature , moisture content , feed rate and screw speed on TVP quality. Lastly , we discussed the approaches to characterize the extrusion process and proposed a new system analysis model.
