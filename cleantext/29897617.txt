  With the aim of exploring the effect of steric constraints imposed on the metal-metal interaction of bis-carbene analogues of thallium by the linking scaffold , seven dinuclear thallium diyls with a series of rigid , semirigid , and flexible bridging scaffolds were synthesized. The solid-state molecular structures were determined for four of these compounds by single-crystal XRD and compared with the results of DFT calculations , which were performed for all substances. These compounds serve as models to investigate the metal-metal distance in the absence of co-coordinated molecules ( additional ligands , solvent molecules). In addition , the effect of the metal ( I) precursor , and more specifically the counterion , on the synthetic access to bis-carbene analogues of indium and thallium was investigated. For indium , only InI yields the desired dinuclear indium diyl. With InBr no reaction was observed , and using InCl gave rise to a mononuclear indium ( III) compound. For thallium , both TlI and TlBr allow access to the related bis-carbene analogue , although the yield with the latter is significantly lower. In contrast , no reactions were observed with TlCl and TlBF
