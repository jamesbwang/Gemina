  Cardiac perforation by a transvenous lead is an uncommon but serious complication. We herein present a case of very late perforation of a Riata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead , which occurred 8 years after implantation. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous lead extraction using an excimer laser. Lead perforation should be considered , even after years from implantation.
