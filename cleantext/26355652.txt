  Altered expression of ataxin-3 ( AT3) can modify DNA repair capacity and is observed in human<disease> diseases<disease>. The genetic polymorphisms of this gene in aflatoxin B1 ( AFB1)- related liver cirrhosis ( LC) have not yet been elucidated. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study , including 384 patients with LC and 851 controls without any liver diseases , to assess the association between 264 polymorphisms in AT3 and AFB1-related LC risk. Genotype were tested using TaqMan-PCR or sequencing technique. We found three differentially distributed SNPs ( rs8021276 , rs7158733 , and rs10146249) via the screening analysis; however , only rs8021276 polymorphism was further identified to modify the risk of LC. Compared with the homozygote of rs8021276 A alleles ( rs8021276-AA) , the genotypes of rs8021276 G alleles ( rs8021276-AG or- GG) increased LC risk ( OR: 2.48 and 6.98; 95 % CI: 1.84-3.33 and 4.35-11.22 , respectively). Significant interactive effects between risk genotypes and AFB1 exposure status were also observed in the joint effects analysis. Additionally , rs8021276 polymorphism was also associated with down-regulation of AT3 mRNA expression and increasing AFB1-DNA adducts in liver tissues with cirrhosis. These results suggest AT3 polymorphisms may be risk biomarkers of AFB1-related LC , and rs8021276 is a potential candidate.
