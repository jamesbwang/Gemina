  Second harmonic Kelvin probe force microscopy is a robust mechanism for subsurface imaging at the nanoscale. Here we exploit resonance-enhanced detection as a way to boost the subsurface contrast with higher force sensitivity using lower bias voltages , in comparison to the traditional off-resonance case. In this mode , the second harmonic signal of the electrostatic force is acquired at one of the eigenmode frequencies of the microcantilever. As a result , high resolution subsurface images are obtained in a variety of nanocomposites. To further understand the subsurface imaging detection upon electrostatic forces , we use a finite element model that approximates the geometry of the probe and sample. This allows the investigation of the contrast mechanism , the depth sensitivity and lateral resolution depending on tip-sample properties.
