  Given the need to reduce the number of unnecessary laparoscopies , this study aimed to calculate the threshold values of contralateral testicular volume in unilateral non-palpable cryptorchidism to optimize diagnosis and surgical strategy. From 2010 to 2016 , contralateral testicular volume was prospectively evaluated in 78 patients aged under nine years with unilateral non-palpable cryptorchidism. The volume of healthy testes was calculated by multiplying length * width * height * 0.71. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised 41 ( 52.6 %) children with inguinal or intra-abdominal testes , who underwent orchiopexy for undescended testis. The second group consisted of 37 ( 47.4 %) patients with severely hypoplastic testes that needed to be removed , or with testicular aplasia. In both groups , we matched the age ( in months) at the time of surgery and the volume of the contralateral testis. Logistic regression was used to develop the diagnostic model. For the model , the ROC-curve ( Receiver Operating Characteristic) was constructed , and the threshold of the contralateral testicular volume was selected. All patients with contralateral testicular volume greater than 2.25 ml had testicular aplasia , or hypoplasia ( sensitivity 100.0 % , specificity 73.0 %). All patients with a contralateral testicular volume less than or equal to 1.04 ml had inguinal or intra-abdominal testes ( specificity of 100 % , the sensitivity of 34 %). The area under the ROC curve calculated to assess the quality of the model was 92.6 % , suggesting the high predictive power of the model. Revision scrototomy is indicated in patients with testicular volume exceeding 2.26 ml , while diagnostic laparoscopy is the optimal primary intervention in patients with the contralateral testicular volume of less than or equal to 1.04 ml.
