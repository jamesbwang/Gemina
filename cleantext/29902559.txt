  To study inter-fractional organ changes during MR-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR) for adrenal metastases and to evaluate the dosimetric advantages of online plan adaptation. Seventeen patients underwent a total of 84 fractions of video-assisted , respiration-gated MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy to deliver either 50 Gy ( 5 fractions) , 60 Gy ( 8 fractions) or 24 Gy ( 3 fractions). An MR scan was repeated prior to each fraction , followed by rigid co-registration to the GTV on the pre-treatment MR scan. Contour deformation , PTV ( GTV +3 mm) expansion and online plan re-optimization were then performed. Re-optimized plans were compared to baseline treatment plans recalculated on the anatomy-of-the-day ( ` predicted plans '). Inter-fractional changes in OARs were quantified according to OAR volume changes within a 3 cm distance from PTV surface , centre of mass ( COM) displacements and the Dice Similarity Coefficient ( DSC). Plan quality evaluation was based on target coverage ( GTV and PTV) , and also high dose sparing of all OARs ( V Substantial COM displacements were observed for stomach , bowel and duodenum of 17 , 27 and 36 mm , respectively. Maximum volume changes for the stomach , bowel and duodenum within 3 cm of PTV were 23.8 , 20.5 and 20.9 cc , respectively. DSC values for OARs ranged from 0.0 to 0.9 for all fractions. Baseline plans recalculated on anatomy-of-the-day revealed underdosage of target volumes , and variable OAR sparing , leading to a failure to meet institutional constraints in a third of fractions. Online re-optimization improved target coverage in 63 % of fractions , and reduced the number of fractions not meeting the V Significant inter-fractional changes in OARs positions were observed despite breath-hold SABR delivery under MR-guidance. Online re-optimization of treatment plans led to significant improvements in target coverage and OAR sparing.
