  Tendons are ineffective at repairing sub-rupture fatigue<symptom> injuries. Accordingly , we evaluated whether an exercise protocol that we have previously found to decrease structural damage kinks in fatigue<symptom> damaged tendons , leads to improvement in mechanical properties. We hypothesized that exercise that promotes repair of fatigue<symptom> damage will decrease apoptosis and increase the population of myofibroblasts. Rat patellar tendons underwent in vivo fatigue<symptom> loading for 500 or 7200 cycles. Animals resumed cage activity for 2-weeks , then either remained cage active or began treadmill running until sacrifice at 4- or 10-weeks post-fatigue loading. Exercise following fatigue<symptom> damage increased the stiffness back towards naïve levels , decreased apoptosis and increased the population of myofibroblasts. Next , proteins associated with inhibition of apoptosis ( Collagen VI) or activation of myofibroblast ( pSmad 2/3 , fibrillin , integrin subunits αV and α5) were evaluated. Data suggests that collagen VI may not be integral to inhibition of apoptosis in this context. Exercise increased pSmad 2/3 and fibrillin in the insertion region for the 7200-cycles group. In addition , exercise decreased integrin αV and increased integrin α5 in fatigue<symptom> damaged tendons. Data suggests that a decrease in apoptosis and an increase in population of myofibroblasts may be integral to remodeling of fatigue<symptom> damaged tendons.
