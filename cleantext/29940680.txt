  Most paranasal sinus mucoceles are unilateral and affect one or at most two contiguous sinuses. We describe the case of a 44-year-old woman with bilateral maxillary sinus mucoceles who presented clinically with left malar pain , right-sided swelling , and proptosis of the right eye. The diagnostic workup included computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In addition , because of the atypical bilateral presentation , we analyzed mucosal sinonasal tissue samples by electron microscopy. Microscopic analysis revealed an absence of one of the microtubule doublets in three of the outer doublets of the axoneme , thereby establishing a diagnosis of isolated ciliary dysfunction. To the best of our knowledge , ciliary dysfunction as a cause of bilateral mucoceles has not been previously reported in the literature. The patient underwent successful surgery for removal of the mucoceles , and she exhibited no evidence of recurrence at the 18-month follow-up. When a diagnosis of bilateral mucocele formation is made , we suggest that ciliary dysfunction be considered in the differential diagnosis and that electron microscopy of the sinonasal mucosa be performed in the workup.
