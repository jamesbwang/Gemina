  The prevalence of malignant hyperthermia<symptom> ( MH) in Germany is 1:2000-1:3000 and therefore more common than previously assumed , so that anesthesia personnel will more often be confronted with susceptible patients in the clinical setting. After the initial treatment with 2.5 mg/kg body<symptom> weight dantrolene , further therapy using up to 10 mg/body weight dantrolene can be indicated for 24 h. Under these circumstances it is important to have a sufficient amount of water available for injection purposes. For outpatient anesthesia a stockage of dantrolene is not necessary as long as the use of MH trigger substances in general is strictly avoided. The introduction of Ryanodex Â® ( Eagle Pharmaceuticals , Woodcliff Lake , NJ , USA) , a preparation of dantrolene with clearly improved pharmacological properties , in the clinical practice has not yet been realized in Germany.
