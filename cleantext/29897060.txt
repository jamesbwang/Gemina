  The first total synthesis of phyllostictine A ( PA) is reported , which confirms the structure of this fungal metabolite and its ( 6S ,7 R ,8 S)- stereochemistry. Both synthetic PA and an analogue containing the 5-methylene-1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one nucleus exhibit Î¼M inhibitory activity in root growth assays against Arabidopsis thaliana , indicating that this heterocyclic subunit is key to the herbicidal activity of the natural product.
