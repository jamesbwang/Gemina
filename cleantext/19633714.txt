  Zooplankton dominate the abundance and biomass of multicellular animals in pelagic marine environments; however , traditional methods to characterize zooplankton communities are invasive and laborious. This study compares zooplankton taxonomic composition revealed through metabarcoding of the cytochrome oxidase I ( COI) and 18S rRNA genes to traditional morphological identification by microscopy. Triplicates of three different sample types were collected from three coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary: ( 1) 1 L surface seawater samples prefiltered through 3
