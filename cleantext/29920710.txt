  Moringa oleifera ( MO) Lam ( Moringaceae) is commonly used as food supplement and as medicine in most African countries where malaria<disease> is also endemic. Therefore , co-administration of MO with antimalarials is a possibility. This study investigated the effects of MO leaves powder on the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine ( AQ) in human subjects. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited for the 3-period study. In the first period , a single dose of AQ tablet ( 10 mg/kg) was administered orally after an overnight fast. After a 7-day washout period , AQ was co-administered with MO.. For the third period , each subject took 3 g MO once daily for 7 days and on the 8th day , MO was co-administered with AQ. The plasma concentrations of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine ( DEAQ) were simultaneously determined using a validated HPLC method. The results showed a significant decrease ( P = .037) in the Cmax of AQ after concurrent administration ( CA) with MO , whereas after pretreatment ( PT) , there was a 32 % decrease in the C The study established pharmacokinetic interaction between AQ and MO when given together or following a long period of ingestion of MO.. This may have clinical implications for malaria<disease> therapy.
