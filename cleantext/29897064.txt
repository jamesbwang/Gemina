  The performance of water oxidation catalysis by a Cu-based polypyridyl complex , ( CuII ( TPA) ( OH2)) 2 + ( 1H; TPA = tris- ( pyridylmethyl) amine) , has been investigated in neutral aqueous solution by electrochemical methods. Compared with our previously reported binuclear catalyst , ( ( BPMAN) ( CuII) 2 ( Î¼-OH)) 3 + ( 2; BPMAN = 2,7- ( bis ( 2-pyridylmethyl) aminomethyl) -1,8-naphthyridine) , mononuclear catalyst 1 has a higher overpotential and lower catalytic activity toward water oxidation under the same conditions. Experimental results revealed that the O-O bond formation occurred via a water nucleophilic attack mechanism in which formal CuIV ( O) is proposed as a key intermediate for the mononuclear catalyst 1H. In contrast , for the binuclear catalyst , O-O bond formation was facilitated by bimetallic cooperation between the two CuIII centers.
