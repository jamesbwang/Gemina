  The leading cause of death in cancer patients is metastasis , for which an effective treatment is still necessary. During metastasis , cancer cells aberrantly express several glycans that are correlated with poor patient outcome. This study was aimed toward exploring the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on membranous N-glycans that are associated with the progression of cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA). Global O-GlcNAcylation in CCA cells was depleted using specific siRNA against O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT) , which transfers GlcNAc to the acceptor proteins. Using an HPLC-Chip/Time-of-Flight ( Chip/TOF) MS system , the N-glycans associated with O-GlcNAcylation were identified by comparing the membranous N-glycans of siOGT-treated cells with those of scramble siRNA-treated cells. In parallel , the membranous N-glycans of the parental cells ( KKU-213 and KKU-214) were compared with those of the highly metastatic cells ( KKU-213L5 and KKU-214L5). Together , these data revealed that high mannose ( Hex
