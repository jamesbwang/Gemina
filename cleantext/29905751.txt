  Even though the surface-assisted dehalogenative coupling constitutes the most abundant protocol in on-surface synthesis , its full potential will only become visible if selectivity issues with polybrominated precursors are comprehensively understood , opening new venues for both organometallic self-assembly and on-surface polymerization. Using the 3,3 ' ,5,5 '- tetrabromo-2,2 ' ,4,4 ' ,6,6 '- hexafluorobiphenyl ( Br4F6BP) at Ag ( 111) , we demonstrate a remote site-selective functionalization at room temperature and a marked temperature difference in double- vs. quadruple activation , both phenomena caused by conformational mechanical effects of the precursor-surface ensemble. The submolecularly resolved structural characterization was achieved by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy , the chemical state was quantitatively assessed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy , and the analysis of the experimental signatures was supported through first-principles Density-Functional Theory calculations. The non-planarity of the various structures at the surface was specifically probed by additional Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure experiments. Upon progressive heating , Br4F6BP on Ag ( 111) shows the following unprecedented phenomena: ( 1) formation of regular organometallic 1D chains via remote site-selective 3,5 '- didebromination; ( 2) a marked temperature difference in double- vs. quadruple activation; ( 3) an organometallic self-assembly based on reversibility of C-Ag-C linkages with a thus far unknown polymorphism affording both hexagonal and rectangular 2D networks; ( 4) extraordinary thermal stability of the organometallic networks. Controlled covalent coupling at the previously Br-functionalized sites was not achieved for the Br4F6BP precursor , in contrast to the comparatively studied non-fluorinated analogue.
