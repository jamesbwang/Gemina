  Proton detection and fast magic-angle spinning have advanced biological solid-state NMR , allowing for the backbone assignment of complex protein assemblies with high sensitivity and resolution. However , so far no method has been proposed to detect intermolecular interfaces in these assemblies by proton detection. Herein , we introduce a concept based on methyl labeling that allows for the assignment of these moieties and for the study of protein-protein interfaces at atomic resolution.
