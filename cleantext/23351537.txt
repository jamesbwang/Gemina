  In a challenging scenario , such as in the aftermath of a natural disaster , minimum standards of care must be in place from the moment surgical care activities are launched. Natural disasters cause destruction and human suffering , especially in low- and middle-income countries , which suffer the most when exposed to their consequences. Health systems can quickly get overwhelmed and can collapse under the burden of injured patients during this event , while qualified surgical care remains crucial. Medécins Sans Frontières ( MSF) has a vast experience providing surgical care after natural disasters , and quality is assured through the Donabedian model. Minimum structure standards are put in place from the beginning of an emergency response , together with standard operating procedures providing guidance to professionals working in challenging conditions. MSF believes that it is always possible to deliver surgical care , ensuring the best possible quality guaranteeing adequate levels of structure and process. The `` do no harm '' principle must always be respected as adherence to medical ethics is a must in any context , even a challenging one.
