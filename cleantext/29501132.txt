  In this paper , a novel feature selection and fusion framework is proposed to enhance the discrimination ability of gas sensor arrays for odor identification. Firstly , we put forward an efficient feature selection method based on the separability and the dissimilarity to determine the feature selection order for each type of feature when increasing the dimension of selected feature subsets. Secondly , the K-nearest neighbor ( KNN) classifier is applied to determine the dimensions of the optimal feature subsets for different types of features. Finally , in the process of establishing features fusion , we come up with a classification dominance feature fusion strategy which conducts an effective basic feature. Experimental results on two datasets show that the recognition rates of Database I and Database II achieve 97.5 % and 80.11 % , respectively , when
