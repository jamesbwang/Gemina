  MicroRNA-34a ( miR-34a) , as a tumor-suppressive miRNA , has been found to induce cell apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). However , the diagnostic and prognostic significance of miR-34a in AML remains largely unknown. We aimed to explore its associations with clinical characteristics and prognosis of AML patients. This study detected serum miR-34a level in 117 diagnosed AML patients and 60 control subjects by using qRT-PCR , and results were compared to clinical features and patient outcome. Since cytogenetically-normal AML ( CN-AML) has a good uniformity of cytogenetics and provides a perfect platform for detection of AML biomarkers , we further analyzed miR-34a expression in 56 CN-AML subjects. We found that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in AML and CN-AML patients. MiR-34a underexpression was commonly observed in AML patients with intermediate/poor risk cytogenetic , and M5 subtype. ROC analysis demonstrated that serum miR-34a could well identify AML/CN-AML patients from healthy individuals. More importantly , miR-34a expression was found negatively correlated with aggressive clinical variable , and served as an independent prognostic indicator. In addition , AML/CN-AML patients with low miR-34a expression displayed shorter overall and recurrence free survival. Altogether , miR-34a might have an application as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator for AML patients.
