  Previous work in our laboratories has identified a series of peptidomimetic 2-pyridone molecules as modulators of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn) fibrillization in vitro. As a first step toward developing molecules from this scaffold as positron emission tomography imaging agents , we were interested in evaluating their blood-brain barrier permeability in nonhuman primates ( NHP) in vivo. For this purpose , 2-pyridone 12 was prepared and found to accelerate α-syn fibrillization in vitro. Acid 12 , and its acetoxymethyl ester analogue 14 , were then radiolabeled with
