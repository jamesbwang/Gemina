  In oncology clinical trials , crossover is used frequently but may lead to uncertainties regarding treatment effects. To investigate the handling of evidence from crossover trials by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA) and the German Federal Joint Committee ( G-BA). For oncology medicines with early benefit assessments before January 2015 , presence of crossover , clinical data , EMA requests for additional data , and G-BA benefit ratings/evidence levels were analyzed from manufacturers ' dossiers , G-BA appraisals , European Public Assessment Reports , and original publications. Eleven of 21 benefit assessments included crossover trials. Significant intergroup differences ( P < 0.05) in overall survival ( OS) were noted in 7 of 11 trials with and 7 of 10 without crossover. For 6 of 11 medicines with crossover , these were demonstrated before crossover. Treatment effects generally worsened with increasing proportions of crossover. The EMA requested additional data more frequently if crossover was performed , particularly if no OS data were available before crossover. The G-BA granted a considerable benefit to 73 % of medicines with crossover and 40 % of those without. Evidence levels were intermediate for 50 % and 75 % , respectively. None of the medicines received the highest evidence level. In G-BA appraisals , oncology medicines with crossover received better additional benefit ratings , but were assigned lower evidence levels , than those without. The five medicines with crossover after progression were assigned lower evidence levels than the six medicines with crossover after demonstration of superior OS , indicating that the way in which crossover is implemented may be one factor influencing the assignment of evidence levels by the G-BA.
