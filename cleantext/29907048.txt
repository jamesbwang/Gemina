  Monovalent salt solutions have strongly coupled interactions with biopolymers , from large polyelectrolytes to small RNA oligomers. High salt concentrations have been known to induce transitions in the structure of RNA , producing non-canonical configurations and even driving RNA to precipitate out of solution. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations , we model a monovalent salt species ( KCL) at high concentrations ( 0.1-3m) and calculate the equilibrium distributions of water and ions around a small tetraloop-forming RNA oligomer in a variety of structural arrangements: folded A-RNA ( canonical) and Z-RNA ( non-canonical) tetraloops and unfolded configurations. From these data , we calculate the ion preferential binding coefficients and Donnan coefficients for the RNA oligomer as a function of concentration and structure. We find that cation accumulation is highest around non-canonical Z-RNA configurations at concentrations below 0.5 m , while unfolded configurations accumulate the most co-ions in all concentrations. By contrast , canonical A-RNA structures consistently show the lowest accumulations for all ion species. Water distributions vary markedly with RNA configuration but show little dependency on KCL concentration. Based on Donnan coefficient calculations , the net charge of the solution at the surface of the RNA decreases linearly as a function of salt concentration and becomes net-neutral near 2.5-3m KCL for folded configurations , while unfolded configurations still show a positive solution charge. Our findings show that all-atom molecular dynamics can describe the equilibrium distributions of monovalent salt in the presence of small RNA oligomers at KCL concentrations where ion correlation effects become important. Furthermore , these results provide valuable insights into the distributions of water and ions near the RNA oligomer surface as a function of structural configuration.
