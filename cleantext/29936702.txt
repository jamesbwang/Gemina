  Situation awareness is a key construct in human factors and arises from a process of situation assessment ( SA). SA comprises the perception of information , its integration with existing knowledge , the search for new information , and the prediction of the future state of the world , including the consequences of planned actions. Causal models implemented as Bayesian networks ( BNs) are attractive for modeling all of these processes within a single , unified framework. We elicited declarative knowledge from two Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF) fighter pilots about the information sources used in the identification ( ID) of airborne entities and the causal relationships between these sources. This knowledge was represented in a BN ( the declarative model) that was evaluated against the performance of 19 RAAF fighter pilots in a low-fidelity simulation. Pilot behavior was well predicted by a simple associative model ( the behavioral model) with only three attributes of ID. Search for information by pilots was largely compensatory and was near-optimal with respect to the behavioral model. The average revision of beliefs in response to evidence was close to Bayesian , but there was substantial variability. Together , these results demonstrate the value of BNs for modeling human SA.
