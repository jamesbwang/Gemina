  The comparative pharmacokinetics of ivermectin ( IVM) , between healthy and in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) injected sheep , was investigated after an intravenous ( IV) administration of a single dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Ten Suffolk Down sheep , 55 ± 3.3 kg , were distributed in two experimental groups: Group 1 ( LPS): treated with three doses of 1 μg LPS/kg bw at -24 , -16 , and -0.75 hr before IVM; group 2 ( Control): treated with saline solution ( SS). An IV dose of 0.2 mg IVM/kg was administered 45 min after the last injection of LPS or SS. Plasma concentrations of IVM were determined by liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on non-compartmental modeling. In healthy sheep , the values of the pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: elimination half-life ( 2.85 days) , mean residence time ( MRT) ( 2.27 days) , area under the plasma concentration curve over time ( AUC , 117.4 ng day
