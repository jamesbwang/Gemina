  Archaeological evidence suggests that dogs were introduced to the islands of Oceania via Island Southeast Asia around 3,300 years ago , and reached the eastern islands of Polynesia by the fourteenth century AD. This dispersal is intimately tied to human expansion , but the involvement of dogs in Pacific migrations is not well understood. Our analyses of seven new complete ancient mitogenomes and five partial mtDNA sequences from archaeological dog specimens from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific suggests at least three dog dispersal events into the region , in addition to the introduction of dingoes to Australia. We see an early introduction of dogs to Island Southeast Asia , which does not appear to extend into the islands of Oceania. A shared haplogroup identified between Iron Age Taiwanese dogs , terminal-Lapita and post-Lapita dogs suggests that at least one dog lineage was introduced to Near Oceania by or as the result of interactions with Austronesian language speakers associated with the Lapita Cultural Complex. We did not find any evidence that these dogs were successfully transported beyond New Guinea. Finally , we identify a widespread dog clade found across the Pacific , including the islands of Polynesia , which likely suggests a post-Lapita dog introduction from southern Island Southeast Asia.
