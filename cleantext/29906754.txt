  In order to develop promising sorbents for value-added application of solid wastes , low-cost aluminum-enriched biochar was prepared from abandoned Tetra Pak used to hold milks<symptom> , a paper-polyethylence-Al foil laminated package box , after acid pretreatment and subsequent slow pyrolysis under an oxygen-limited environment at 600 Â°C. The basic physicochemical properties of the resultant biochar were characterized and the sorption performance of aqueous As ( III) and As ( V) was investigated via batch and column sorption experiments. Carbon ( 49.1 %) , Ca ( 7.41 %) and Al ( 13.5 %) were the most abundant elements in the resultant biochar; and the specific surface area and the pH value at the point of zero charge ( pHPZC) were 174 m
