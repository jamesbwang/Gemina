  New natural products , designated pochoniolides A and B , were isolated from the cultured broth of fungal strain FKI-7537 using a physicochemical screening methodology. Strain FKI-7537 was isolated from a soil sample collected at Niijima , Tokyo , Japan and identified as Pochonia chlamydosporia var. spinulospora by morphological characteristics and DNA sequence analysis. The chemical structures of pochoniolides A and B were elucidated by NMR and mass spectra and found to be new compounds consisting of a muconolactone moiety connected with a chromone unit. Pochoniolides A and B were identified as racemate mixtures using data on optical rotation and circular dichroism spectra. Furthermore , enantiomers of pochoniolide B , pochoniolides B
