  Recent investigations have shown that xerophilic fungi<pathogen> may pose a biodeterioration risk by threatening objects of cultural heritage including many types of materials , including wood , paint layers , organic glues or leather and even metal. Historic-- and also new built-- pipe organs combine all those materials. In this study , halotolerant aspergilli and penicillia with low optimal temperatures were shown to be the most frequent invaders of pipe organs. The fungi<pathogen> form white mycelia on the organic components of the organs with a clear preference for the bolus paint of the wooden pipes , the leather-made hinges of the stop actions and all parts fixed by organic glue. Physiological tests showed that the strains isolated from the instruments all show a halotolerant behavior , although none was halophilic. The optimum growth temperature is below 20 & deg; C , thus the fungi<pathogen> are perfectly adapted to the cool and relatively dry conditions in the churches and organs respectively. The
