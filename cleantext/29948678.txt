  This study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of lycopene on reproductive toxicity induced by in utero exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA) in offspring mice. Pregnant mice in the BPA model group were given orally 500 mg/kg/day BPA from pregnant day ( PD) 8 to PD14. Mice of lycopene group were gavaged with 20 mg/kg/day lycopene from PD1 to PD7 and then given 500 mg/kg/day BPA from PD8 to PD14. Results showed that lycopene reduced the elevated mortality in offspring mice of the mother exposed to BPA. BPA lowered the levels of testosterone , luteinizing hormone , and follicle-stimulating hormone while lycopene treatment increased the levels significantly. BPA elevated estradiol while lycopene lowered estradiol in the offspring. BPA caused testicular damage as shown by less Leydig cells and ovarian injury as shown by less corpus granules in adult offspring , while lycopene decreased the damages. Maternal exposure to BPA increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 in testicular and ovary tissues in the offspring mice. Lycopene decreased Bax in testis and ovary and increased Bcl-2 in ovary tissues in the offspring mice. These findings suggest lycopene has protective effects on in utero BPA exposure-induced reproductive toxicity in offspring mice.
