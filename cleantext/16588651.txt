  High Al Low-density steels could have a transformative effect on the light-weighting of steel structures for transportation. They can achieve the desired properties with the minimum amount of Ni , and thus are of great interest from an economic perspective. In this study , the mechanical properties of two duplex low-density steels , Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8 C-5Ni and Fe-15Mn-10Al-0.8 C ( wt. %) were investigated through nano-indentation and simulation through utilization of ab-initio formalisms in Density Functional Theory ( DFT) in order to establish the hardness resulting from two critical structural features ( κ-carbides and B2 intermetallic) as a function of annealing temperature ( 500-1050 °C) and the addition of Ni. In the Ni-free sample , the calculated elastic properties of κ-carbides were compared with those of the B2 intermetallic Fe3Al-L1
