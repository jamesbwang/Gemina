  Both short and long sleep duration have been consistently studied as a risk factor for obesity , hyperglycemia and hypertension. In this cross-sectional study , we provide an updated analysis of the Health Examinees ( HEXA) study on the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) occurrence among Koreans age 40-69 year olds. A total of 133,608 subjects ( 44,930 men , 88,678 women) were enrolled in the HEXA study 2004-2013. Sleep duration was categorized into 4 sleep categories ( < 6 h , 6 to < 8 h , 8 to < 10 h , â‰¥ 10 h). MetS criterion was based on the National Cholesterol Education Program , Adult Treatment Panel III. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Compared with individuals sleeping 6 to < 8 h per day , less than 6 h of sleep was associated with MetS ( multivariable adjusted OR: 1.12 , 95 % CI: 1.05-1.19) and elevated waist circumference ( 1.15 , 1.08-1.23) among men; with elevated waist circumference ( 1.09 , 1.04-1.14) among women. Greater than 10 h of sleep was associated with MetS ( 1.28 , 1.08-1.50) and elevated triglycerides ( 1.33 , 1.14-1.56) among men; with MetS ( 1.40 , 1.24-1.58) , elevated waist circumference ( 1.14 , 1.02-1.27) , elevated triglycerides ( 1.41 , 1.25-1.58) , reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) ( 1.24 , 1.12-1.38) , and elevated fasting glucose ( 1.39 , 1.23-1.57) among women. Less than 6 h of sleep is associated with elevated waist circumference among both men and women and with MetS among men only. Greater than 10 h of sleep is associated with MetS and elevated triglycerides among both men and women and with elevated waist circumference , reduced HDL-C , and elevated fasting glucose among women only.
