  Adherent invasive The adhesion , invasion and intramacrophage replication capabilities ( AIEC phenotype) of 61 intestinal Out of 61 intestinal strains , 13 ( 21 %) exhibit the AIEC phenotype , 7 are from human origin and 6 are from animal origin. Prevalence of AIEC strains is about 24 and 19 % in healthy humans and animals respectively. These strains are highly genetically diverse as they are distributed among the main described phylogroups. Among Our study described for the first time AIEC strains isolated from the feces of healthy humans and animals.
