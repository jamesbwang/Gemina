  Tetraspanins ( Tspans) are a family of four-span transmembrane proteins , known as plasma membrane `` master organizers. '' They form Tspan-enriched microdomains ( TEMs or TERMs) through lateral association with one another and other membrane proteins. If multiple microdomains associate with each other , larger platforms can form. For infection , viruses interact with multiple cell surface components , including receptors , activating proteases , and signaling molecules. It appears that Tspans , such as CD151 , CD82 , CD81 , CD63 , CD9 , Tspan9 , and Tspan7 , coordinate these associations by concentrating the interacting partners into Tspan platforms. In addition to mediating viral attachment and entry , these platforms may also be involved in intracellular trafficking of internalized viruses and assist in defining virus assembly and exit sites. In conclusion , Tspans play a role in viral<disease> infection<disease> at different stages of the virus replication cycle. The present review highlights recently published data on this topic , with a focus on events at the plasma membrane. In light of these findings , we propose a model for how Tspan interactions may organize cofactors for viral<disease> infection<disease> into distinct molecular platforms.
