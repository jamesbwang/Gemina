  Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins of non-immune origin which have at least one non-catalytic domain that bind reversibly to specific mono or oligosaccharides. Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM) involves a broad range of medicinal practices sharing common concepts which have been developed in China and are based on a tradition of more than thousands of years. Plant materials which are commonly used in TCM as a complementary or alternative for Western medical treatments contain a considerable number of important lectins. These lectins have been reported to have various applications and uses such as cancer treatment , glycoconjugate research , biomarker development , and others. Here , we summarize the available literature related to lectins from TCM and recent trends in their potential biomedical applications.
