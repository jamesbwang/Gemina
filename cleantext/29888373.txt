  In this work , we describe a simple and general procedure for the purification of carbon dots. Following a hydrothermal heating procedure , the reaction mixture usually contains unreacted starting material and by-products alongside the carbon dots , which often appear among otherwise intense photoluminescence. The proposed purification method is based on a solid phase extraction technique , where the reaction mixture is absorbed on porous alumina and the carbon dots are isolated from the by-products and unreacted organics using proper solvents , and are finally recovered from the alumina using a simple extraction.
