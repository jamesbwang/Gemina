  With the capability of presenting endogenous tissue contrast or exogenous contrast agents in deep biological samples at high spatial resolution , photoacoustic ( PA) imaging has shown significant potential for many preclinical and clinical applications. However , due to strong background signals from various intrinsic chromophores in biological tissue , such as hemoglobin , achieving highly sensitive PA imaging of targeting probes labeled by contrast agents has remained a challenge. In this study , we introduce a novel technique called transient triplet differential ( TTD) imaging which allows for substantial reduction of tissue background signals. TTD imaging detects directly the triplet state absorption , which is a special characteristic of phosphorescence capable dyes not normally present among intrinsic chromophores of biological tissue. Thus , these triplet state absorption PA images can facilitate `` true '' background free molecular imaging. We prepared a known phosphorescent dye probe , methylene blue conjugated polyacrylamide nanoparticles , with peak absorption at 660 nm and peak lowest triplet state absorption at 840 nm. We find , through studies on phantoms and on an in vivo tumor model , that TTD imaging can generate a superior contrast-to-noise ratio , compared to other image enhancement techniques , through the removal of noise generated by strongly absorbing intrinsic chromophores , regardless of their identity.
