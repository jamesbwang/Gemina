  To verify the effects of 12 , 24 , 36 hippotherapy sessions over time on postural balance<symptom> while sitting in children with cerebral palsy as well the effects of treatment after one interruption period of 45 days. Hippotherapy program with a twice-weekly treatment with a total of 13 children aged 5-10 years old. Measurements of postural balance<symptom> during sitting were performed using the AMTI AccuSway Plus platform. There was a statistically significant reduction in mediolateral and anteroposterior sway after the first 12 hippotherapy sessions , and further significant sway reduction occurred as the treatment progressed. Changes in the center of pressure displacement velocity variable began to occur after 24 sessions. Seated postural balance<symptom> improved in children with cerebral palsy , as evidenced by lower COP displacement , particularly after a greater number of sessions. After the last evaluations , when completing 36 sessions of hippotherapy , it was verified that the improvements to the postural balance<symptom> continued to occur. Therefore , further studies with a longer treatment period may help to clarify if , at some point , there is stabilization in the improvement of postural balance<symptom>. Furthermore , it is important to analyze the impact of hippotherapy on functional activities over time.
