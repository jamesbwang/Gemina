  Precision cancer medicine promises to tailor clinical decisions to patients using genomic information. Indeed , successes of drugs targeting genetic alterations in tumors , such as imatinib that targets BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> , have demonstrated the power of this approach. However , biological systems are complex , and patients may differ not only by the specific genetic alterations in their tumor , but also by more subtle interactions among such alterations. Systems biology and more specifically , network analysis , provides a framework for advancing precision medicine beyond clinical actionability of individual mutations. Here we discuss applications of network analysis to study tumor biology , early methods for N-of-1 tumor genome analysis , and the path for such tools to the clinic.
