  Zinc has proved its efficacy in many models of ischemia reperfusion ( I/R) injury. In this study , we used zinc acexamate ( ZAC) as an exogenous source of zinc against renal I/R injury and we investigated whether its protective effects are mediated by the decrease of oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and mitochondria induced-apoptosis. Rats were orally pretreated with vehicle or ZAC ( 10 or 100 mg/kg) 24 h and 30 min prior to 1 h of bilateral renal warm ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion. Our data showed that 10 mg/kg of ZAC , but not 100 mg/kg , improved renal architecture and function. Also , the low dose of ZAC up-regulated antioxidant enzymes activities and glutathione level and decreased lipids and proteins oxidation. Interestingly , the use of ZAC resulted in a significant reduce of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1ÃŸ , IL-6 and MCP-1) , enhanced mitochondria integrity and decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-9. We conclude that renal I/R induced oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis and that the use of ZAC at 10 mg/kg , but not 100 mg/kg , protects rat kidneys from I/R injury by down-regulating these processes.
