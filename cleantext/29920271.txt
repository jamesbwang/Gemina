  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) is strongly implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. EMT is thought to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level through the repressive activity of EMT transcription factors. However , these classical mechanisms have been parsed out almost exclusively in vitro , leaving questions about the programs driving EMT in physiological contexts. Here , using a lineage-labeled mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to study EMT in vivo , we found that most tumors lose their epithelial phenotype through an alternative program involving protein internalization rather than transcriptional repression , resulting in a `` partial EMT '' phenotype. Carcinoma cells utilizing this program migrate as clusters , contrasting with the single-cell migration pattern associated with traditionally defined EMT mechanisms. Moreover , many breast and colorectal cancer cell lines utilize this alternative program to undergo EMT. Collectively , these results suggest that carcinoma cells have different ways of losing their epithelial program , resulting in distinct modes of invasion and dissemination.
