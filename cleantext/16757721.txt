  To evaluate the clinical outcomes and relationship between tumor size , lymph node status , and prognosis in a large cohort of patients with triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) .849 Patients were categorized by tumor size and nodal status. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association of nodal status and tumor size with survival outcomes. A Sidak adjustment was used for pairwise group comparisons. We conducted six pairwise comparisons between different node status. In univariate and multivariate analyses , it was indicated that N0 patients had similar prognoses as N1 patients ( P = 0.072) , and the OS of both of these groups was significantly better than that of N2/N3 patients ( N0 vs N2 , P < 0.001; N0 vs N3 , P < 0.001; N1 vs N2 , P = 0.014; N1 vs N3 , P = 0.005). In summary , we report that in Chinese patients with triple-negative breast cancer , a greater difference in survival was observed between N1 and N2 than between N0 and N1 , warranting the possible need of more intensive chemotherapy for N2-3 patients. We also found that tumor size made an impact on survival when lymph nodes were extensively involved , a finding that needs longer follow-up and further validation.
