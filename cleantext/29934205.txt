  Hospital-acquired infections ( HAIs) are a significant contributor to adverse patient outcomes and excess cost of inpatient care. Adjunct ultraviolet-C ( UV-C) disinfection may be a viable strategy for reducing HAIs. This study aimed to measure the clinical , operational , and financial impact of a UV-C terminal disinfection intervention in a community hospital setting. Using a pre-post study design , we compared the HAI rates of 5 multidrug-resistant bacteria ( Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus<pathogen> , and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> from 6 culture sites before and after a 12-month facility-wide UV-C intervention. To measure impact of UV-C disinfection on hospital operations , mean inpatient emergency room wait time was calculated. Finally , we conducted a cost saving analysis to evaluate the financial benefits of the intervention. Overall , 245 HAIs among 13,177 inpatients were observed during a 12-month intervention period , with an incidence rate of 3.94 per 1,000 patient days. This observed HAIs incidence was 19.2 % lower than the preintervention period ( 4.87 vs 3.94 per 1,000 patient days; P = .006). The intervention did not adversely impact emergency department admissions ( 297.9 vs 296.2 minutes; P = .18) and generated a direct cost savings of $ 1,219,878 over a 12-month period. The UV-C disinfection intervention was associated with a statistically significant facility-wide reduction of multidrug-resistant HAIs and generated substantial direct cost savings without adversely impacting hospital operations.
