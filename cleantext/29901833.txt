  Fused , elongated mitochondria are more efficient in generating ATP than fragmented mitochondria. In diverse C. elegans<pathogen> longevity pathways , increased levels of fused mitochondria are associated with lifespan extension. Blocking mitochondrial fusion in these animals abolishes their extended longevity. The long-lived C. elegans<pathogen> vhl-1 mutant is an exception that does not have increased fused mitochondria , and is not dependent on fusion for longevity. Loss of mammalian VHL upregulates alternate energy generating pathways. This suggests that mitochondrial fusion facilitates longevity in C. elegans<pathogen> by increasing energy metabolism. In diverse animals , ATP levels broadly decreases with age. Substantial evidence supports the theory that increasing or maintaining energy metabolism promotes the survival of older animals. Increased ATP levels in older animals allow energy-intensive repair and homeostatic mechanisms such as proteostasis that act to prevent cellular aging. These observations support the emerging paradigm that maintaining energy metabolism promotes the survival of older animals.
