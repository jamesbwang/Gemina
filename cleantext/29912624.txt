  Governments have proposed text warning labels to decrease consumption of sugary drinks-a contributor to chronic<disease> diseases<disease> such as diabetes. However , they may be less effective than more evocative , graphic warning labels. We field-tested the effectiveness of graphic warning labels ( vs. text warning labels , calorie labels , and no labels) , provided insight into psychological mechanisms driving effectiveness , and assessed consumer sentiment. Study 1 indicated that graphic warning labels reduced the share of sugary drinks purchased in a cafeteria from 21.4 % at baseline to 18.2 %- an effect driven by substitution of water for sugary drinks. Study 2 showed that graphic warning labels heighten negative affect and prompt consideration of health consequences. Study 3 indicated that public support for graphic warning labels can be increased by conveying effectiveness information. These findings could spur more effective labeling policies that facilitate healthier choices , do not decrease overall beverage purchases , and are publicly accepted.
