  We studied the association between leisure time physical activity ( LTPA) and glycemic control , body mass index ( BMI) , and hypoglycemic incidents in type 1 ( T1DM) and type 2 diabetes patients ( T2DM). This is a cross-sectional study of 198 diabetic patients ( 60 with type 1 diabetes , 138 with type 2 diabetes). LTPA was assessed by a validated 12-month questionnaire. Patients were grouped as sedentary and moderately to vigorously active. Outcome measures were Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) , BMI , and hypoglycemic episodes. LTPA effect on the HbA1c reduction was present in diabetes type 1 patients. Patients who were involved in the moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity had a greater decrease in the HbA1c ( p = 0.048) than patients with low physical activity ( p = 0.085). Level of LTPA was neither associated with increased number of hypoglycemic episodes , nor BMI. After an average of 4 years of diabetes , the number of patients requiring more than one antidiabetic agent increased , although the observed difference did not correlate with LTPA level. LTPA has an influence on the regulation of diabetes type 1 , and intensification of medical treatment is compensating for the lack of lifestyle change-especially in type 2 diabetics.
