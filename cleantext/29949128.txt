  To identify the effect of duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation on bone mineral density ( BMD) and body composition among adolescents with anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN). We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of all patients 9-20 years old with a DSM-5 diagnosis of AN evaluated by the Stanford Eating Disorders Program ( 1997-2011) who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 188 adolescents with AN were included ( 178 females and 10 males). Using multivariate linear regression , duration of weight-bearing exercise ( B = 0.15 , p = 0.005) and participation in team sports ( B = 0.53 , p = 0.001) were associated with higher BMD at the hip and team sports ( B = 0.39 , p = 0.006) were associated with higher whole body BMC , controlling for covariates. Participation in team sports ( B =- 1.06 , p = 0.007) was associated with greater deficits in FMI Z-score. LBMI Z-score was positively associated with duration of weight-bearing exercise ( B = 0.10 , p = 0.018) and may explain the relationship between exercise and bone outcomes. Duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation may be protective of BMD at the hip and whole body BMC , while participation in team sports was associated with greater FMI deficits among adolescents with AN.
