  Self-gelling DNA hydrogels with cytosine-phosphate-guanine ( CpG) motifs have been shown to exhibit high potency as vaccine adjuvants. However , their oral use is limited because of their thermodynamic and chemical instability in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study , we aimed to develop DNA hydrogel microspheres ( Dgel-MS) coated with chitosan to improve their stability. Chitosan-coated Dgel-MS ( Cs-Dgel-MS) was prepared by emulsifying Dgel to obtain the D-gel core , followed by mixing with microemulsions of chitosan for electrostatic coating. Fluorescence imaging of Cs-Dgel-MS labeled with fluorescent dyes showed that Dgel-MS ( approximately 30 μm) was coated with chitosan. The recovery efficiency of Alexa Fluor 488-DNA was 87.4 ± 7.5 %. To load a phosphorothioate CpG oligodeoxynucleotide into Dgel , a modified Dgel ( mDgel) was designed and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC)- dextran was loaded into Cs-mDgel-MS as a model compound. The recovery efficiency of Alexa Fluor 488-CpG1668 and FITC-dextran was 83.3 ± 3.8 % and 67.8 ± 4.6 % , respectively. The release of Alexa Fluor 488-CpG1668 from Cs-mDgel-MS was slower than that from mDgel under acidic or DNase conditions. Intra-duodenal administration of FITC-dextran/Cs-mDgel-MS showed prolonged intestinal transition of the encapsulated FITC-dextran. These results indicate that Cs-Dgel-MS can be useful for oral delivery of CpG DNA and other bioactive compounds.
