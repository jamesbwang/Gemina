  Although more than 50 years have passed since the monumental discovery of Huxley and Hanson that muscle contraction results from relative sliding between actin and myosin filaments , coupled with ATP hydrolysis , the mechanism underlying the filament sliding still remains to be a mystery. It is generally believed that the myofilament sliding is caused by cyclic attachment-detachment between myosin heads in myosin filaments and myosin-binding sites in actin filaments. Attempts to prove the myosin head<symptom> movement<symptom> using techniques of X-ray diffraction and chemical probes attached to myosin heads have failed to obtain clear results because of the asynchronous nature of myosin head<symptom> movement<symptom>. Using the gas environmental chamber ( EC) attached to an electron microscope , we succeeded in recording myosin head<symptom> movement<symptom> in hydrated myosin filaments , coupled with ATP hydrolysis with the following results: ( 1) In the absence of actin filaments , myosin heads fluctuate around a definite neutral position , so that their time-averaged position remains unchanged; ( 2) On ATP application , myosin heads bind with ATP to be in the charged-up state , M-ADP-Pi , and perform a recovery stroke in the direction away from the myosin filament central bare zone and stay in the post-recovery stroke position; ( 3) In the actin-myosin filament mixture , myosin heads form rigor linkages with actin , and bind with applied ATP to be in the charged-up state , M-ADP-Pi , and perform a power stroke in the direction towards the myosin filament bare zone , while releasing ADP and Pi to stay in the post-power stroke position; ( 4) In both recovery and power strokes , myosin heads in the non charged-up state return to the neutral position. These results indicate that the charged-up myosin heads decide their direction of movement without being guided by actin filaments.
