  A series of unprecedented tetrazole-linked imidazo ( 1,5- a) pyridines are synthesized from simple and readily available building blocks. The reaction sequence involves an azido-Ugi-deprotection reaction followed by an acetic anhydride-mediated N-acylation-cyclization process to afford the target heterocycle. Furthermore , the scope of the methodology was extended to diverse R
