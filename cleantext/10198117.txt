  Basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH) transcription factors play essential roles in regulating eukaryotic developmental and physiological processes such as neuron generation , myocyte formation , intestinal tissue development , and response to environmental stress. In this study , the diamondback moth , Plutella xylostella ( L.) ( Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) , genome was found to encode 52 bHLH genes. All 52 P. xylostella bHLH ( PxbHLH) genes were classified into correspondent bHLH families according to their orthology with bHLHs from fruit fly and other insect species. Among these 52 PxbHLH genes , 19 have been annotated consistently with our classification in GenBank database. The remaining 33 PxbHLH genes are either annotated as general bHLH genes or as hypothetical genes. Therefore , our data provide useful information for updating annotations to PxbHLH genes. P. xylostella has four stem cell leukemia<disease> ( SCL) genes ( one of them has three copies) , two Dys genes , two copies of MyoR , Mitf , and Sima genes , and three copies of Sage genes. Further studies may be conducted to elucidate functions of these specific bHLH genes in regulating P. xylostella growth and development.
