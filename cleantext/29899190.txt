  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) is secreted from hypothalamic neurons ( GnRH neurons) and stimulates anterior pituitary gonadotrophs to synthesize and secrete gonadotropins. In addition to gonadotrophs , GnRH neurons also express GnRH receptors , and the autocrine action of GnRH is reportedly involved in the regulation of functions of GnRH neurons. There is accumulating evidence that extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) , one of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs) , is activated by GnRH and involved in various effects of GnRH in GnRH neurons. In the present study , we performed microarray analysis to examine the types of genes whose expression was regulated by GnRH in immortalized mouse GnRH neurons ( GT1-7 cells). We found that 257 genes among 55,681 genes examined were up-regulated after 30-min treatment of GT1-7 cells with GnRH. These up-regulated genes included four dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases ( DUSPs) , DUSP1 , DUSP2 , DUSP5 , and DUSP6. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the mRNA levels of DUSP5 and DUSP6 were robustly increased within 30 min. U0126 , an inhibitor of ERK activation , completely inhibited the increases in the mRNA levels of DUSP5 and DUSP6. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that ERK activation peaked at 5 min and declined steeply at 60 min , whereas DUSP5 and DUSP6 proteins were increased from 60 min. It was notable that down-regulation of DUSP6 augmented GnRH-induced ERK activation approximately 1.7-fold at 60 min. These results suggested that the up-regulation of DUSP6 regulates the duration of ERK activation at least in part.
