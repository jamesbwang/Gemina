  Thyroid hormone has a broad range of biological effects , both during development and in the adult Nuclear thyroid hormone action is mediated by thyroid hormone receptor ( TR) α and β. Thyroid hormone also has nongenomic actions at the membrane , which are less well characterized. Both TRα and TRβ undergo posttranslational modification , including phosphorylation , acetylation , and recently identified sumoylation. These posttranslational modifications have been shown to influence thyroid hormone signaling by altering TR DNA binding , TR interaction with cofactors , and TR-mediated transcription. The best characterized modification , with respect to gene regulation , is sumoylation , which plays an important role in nutrient regulators-mediated gene expression. We present an approach to study posttranslational modification of TR by small ubiquitin-like modifier ( SUMO) , a process referred to as sumoylation.
