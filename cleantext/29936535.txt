  Teff , an iron-rich staple grain in Ethiopia , is consumed mainly in the form of teff injera ( TI). Studies on the association of TI consumption with anemia<symptom> are limited. We aimed to determine the association of frequencies of TI consumption with anemia<symptom> , in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study involving 592 pregnant women: 187 anemic cases , and 405 non-anemic controls. TI consumption was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ). Multiple logistic regression , adjusted for dietary and non-dietary covariates , was performed to determine the relation of TI consumption to anemia<symptom> status<symptom>. We found that a decrease in frequency of TI consumption was significantly associated with an increase in the likelihood of anemia<symptom> ( p-trend = 0.009). Compared with everyday TI consumption , the adjusted odds ratios ( AORs) of anemia<symptom> associated with the other frequencies of teff consumption were 1.50 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.71 , 3.23; p = 0.285) for every other day , 2.13 ( 95 % CI 1.03 , 4.41; p = 0.04) for 1-2 times a week , and 3.17 ( 95 % CI 1.62 , 6.22; p < 0.001) for once in 2 weeks. Teff consumption was associated with reduced odds of anemia<symptom> in pregnant women. Further studies are warranted , including determining the feasibility and effectiveness of TI use for anemia<symptom> prevention. The study was registered as https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03251664.
