  Thanks to their ability to regrow any missing body part after injury , planarians have become a well-established invertebrate model system in regenerative studies. However , planarians are also unique in their embryonic development , displaying ectolecithality , or the accumulation of embryonic nutrients into accessory cells accompanying the zygotes. Gaining a better understanding of their peculiar embryogenesis can offer answers to some fundamental questions regarding the appearance and evolution of planarian regenerative capacities , and in a broader context , the diversification of embryonic and postembryonic development in animals. In this chapter , I give an overview of the present knowledge of planarian embryogenesis and the methodologies applied to its study. I describe and comment on protocols to fix and dissect planarian egg capsules , and perform whole-mount in situ hybridization and whole-mount immunohistochemistry on planarian embryos.
