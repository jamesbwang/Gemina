  Current consensus guidelines suggest that gallbladder cancer ( GBC) patients with resected T1a disease can be observed while patients with T1b or greater lesions<symptom> should undergo lymphadenectomy ( LNE). The primary aim of this study was to critically explore the impact of LNE in early-stage GBC on overall survival ( OS) on a population-based level. The 2004-2014 National Cancer Database was reviewed to identify non-metastatic GBC patients with T1a , T1b , or T2 disease and grouped whether a dedicated LNE was performed. OS and relative survival were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses before and after propensity score adjustments. 4015 patients were included , 246 ( 6 %) had T1a , 654 ( 16 %) T1b , and 3115 ( 78 %) T2 GBC. The rate of positive lymph nodes was 13 % , 12 % , and 40 % for T1a , T1b , and T2 tumors , respectively. Even after propensity score adjustment , no OS benefit was found if LNE was performed for T1a disease ( HR: 0.63 , 95 % CI: 0.35-1.13) while OS was improved for T1b ( HR: 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.49-0.87) and T2 tumors ( HR: 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.57-0.73). Despite a higher rate of nodal positivity among patients with T1a disease compared to previous reports , there was no impact on survival and current treatment guidelines appear appropriate for the management of T1a disease.
