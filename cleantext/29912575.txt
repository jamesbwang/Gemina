  Racial/ethnic identity is contingent and arbitrary , yet it is commonly used to evaluate disease risk and treatment response. Drawing on open-ended interviews with patients and clinicians in two US clinics , we explore how racialized risk is conceptualized and how it impacts patient care and experience. We found that racial/ethnic risk was a common but poorly defined construct for both patients and clinicians , who intermingled concepts of genetics , biology , behavior , and culture , while disregarding historical or structural context. We argue that racializing risk embodies social power in marked and unmarked bodies , reinforcing inequality along racial lines and undermining equitable health care.
