  The dynamics of haematopoietic stem cell differentiation and the hierarchy of oligopotent stem cells in the bone<disease> marrow remain controversial. Here we dissect haematopoietic progenitor populations at single cell resolution , deriving an unbiased reference model of transcriptional states in normal and perturbed murine bone<disease> marrow. We define the signature of the naive haematopoietic stem cell and find a continuum of core progenitor states. Core cell populations mix transcription of pre-myeloid and pre-lymphoid programs , but do not mix erythroid or megakaryocyte programs with other fates. CRISP-seq perturbation analysis confirms our models and reveals that Cebpa regulates entry into all myeloid fates , while Irf8 and PU .1 deficiency block later differentiation towards monocyte or granulocyte fates. Our transcriptional map defines a reference network model for blood progenitors and their differentiation trajectories during normal and perturbed haematopoiesis.
