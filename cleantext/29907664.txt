  The care of infants with recurrent wheezing relies largely on clinical assessment. The lung clearance index ( LCI) , a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity , is a sensitive marker of early airway disease in children with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> , but its utility has not been explored in infants with recurrent wheezing. To assess ventilation inhomogeneity using LCI among infants with a history of recurrent wheezing compared with healthy controls. This is a case-control study , including 37 infants with recurrent wheezing recruited from outpatient clinics , and 113 healthy infants from a longitudinal birth cohort , the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study. All infants , at a time of clinical stability , underwent functional assessment including multiple breath washout , forced expiratory flows and body plethysmography. LCI z-score values among infants with recurrent wheeze were 0.84 units ( 95 % CI 0.41 to 1.26) higher than healthy infants ( mean ( 95 % CI): 0.26 ( -0.11 to 0.63) vs -0.58 ( -0.79 to 0.36) , p < 0.001)). Nineteen percent of recurrently wheezing infants had LCI values that were above the upper limit of normal ( > 1.64 z-scores). Elevated exhaled nitric oxide , but not symptoms , was associated with abnormal LCI values in infants with recurrent wheeze ( p = 0.05). Ventilation inhomogeneity is present in clinically stable infants with recurrent wheezing.
