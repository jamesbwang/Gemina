  The introduction of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing ( CAD/CAM) technology to the field of removable prosthodontics has recently made it possible to fabricate complete dentures of prepolymerized polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA) blocks , which are claimed to be of better mechanical properties; however , no published reports that have evaluated mechanical properties of CAD/CAM PMMA. The purpose of this study was to compare flexural strength , impact strength , and flexural modulus of two brands of CAD/CAM PMMA and a conventional heat-cured PMMA. 45 rectangular specimens ( 65 mm × 10 mm × 3 mm) were fabricated ( 15 CAD/CAM AvaDent PMMA specimens from AvaDent , 15 CAD/CAM Tizian PMMA specimens from Shütz Dental , 15 conventional Meliodent PMMA specimens from Heraeus Kulzer) and stored in distilled water at ( 37 ± 1 °C) for 7 days. Specimens ( N = 15) in each group were subjected to the three-point bending test and impact strength test , employing the Charpy configuration on unnotched specimens. The morphology of the fractured specimens was studied under a scanning electron microscope ( SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey pairwise multiple comparisons with 95 % confidence interval. The Schütz Dental specimens showed the highest mean flexural strength ( 130.67 MPa) and impact strength ( 29.56 kg/m As CAD/CAM PMMA specimens exhibited improved flexural strength , flexural modulus , and impact strength in comparison to the conventional heat-cured groups , CAD/CAM dentures are expected to be more durable. Different brands of CAD/CAM PMMA may have inherent variations in mechanical properties.
