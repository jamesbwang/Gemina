  Mental well-being and excessive alcohol consumption each represent a significant public health concern , and evidence suggests an association between them. Furthermore , drinking motivations associated with harmful drinking have been studied , but not systematically in the UK population. A representative sample of 6174 UK adults aged 18 ‚Åª 75 were surveyed online. Low risk drinkers were found to have higher mental well-being than hazardous , harmful , and , probable , dependence drinkers. Using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis , it was found that just over 5 % of the variance in well-being scores was accounted for by the level of harmful drinking and drinking motivation; the most significant contribution was drinking to cope. Among people drinking to cope , those drinking in more harmful ways were statistically significantly more likely to have low well-being compared to less harmful drinkers. In the UK adult population there is a clear association between poor mental well-being and harmful drinking. Furthermore , coping was a significant motivation to drink for many with low mental well-being. While mental well-being was found to be directly linked with levels of harmful drinking , the motivation for drinking was a stronger predictor of mental well-being.
