  Brain metastases are common in metastatic melanoma and radiosurgery is often utilized for local control. Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( CPIs) play a central role in contemporary melanoma management; however , there is limited data exploring outcomes and potential toxicities for patients treated with CPIs and radiosurgery. We retrospectively identified all consecutive cases of newly diagnosed melanoma brain metastases ( MBM) treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery at a single institution between 2012 and 2017 , and included only patients that initiated CPIs within 8 weeks before or after radiosurgery. Thirty-eight patients were included with a median follow-up of 31.6 months. Two-year local control was 92 %. Median time to out-of-field CNS and extra-CNS progression were 8.4 and 7.9 months , respectively. Median progression-free survival ( PFS) was 3.4 months and median overall survival ( OS) was not reached ( NR). Twenty-five patients ( 66 %) received anti-CTLA4 and 13 patients ( 34 %) received anti-PD-1 +/- anti-CTLA4. Compared with anti-CTLA4 , patients that received anti-PD-1 +/- anti-CTLA4 had significant improvements in time to out-of-field CNS progression ( p = 0.049) , extra-CNS progression ( p = 0.015) , and PFS ( p = 0.043) , with median time to out-of-field CNS progression of NR vs. 3.1 months , median time to extra-CNS progression of NR vs. 4.4 months , and median PFS of 20.3 vs. 2.4 months. Six patients ( 16 %) developed grade â‰¥ 2 CNS toxicities ( grade 2: 3 , grade 3: 3 , grade 4/5: 0). Excellent outcomes were observed in patients that initiated CPIs within 8 weeks of undergoing radiosurgery for newly diagnosed MBM. There appears to be an advantage to anti-PD-1 or combination therapy compared to anti-CTLA4.
