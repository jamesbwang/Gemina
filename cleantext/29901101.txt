  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) make up a significant portion of transcripts that are not translated into proteins and lncRNAs were previously thought to be transcriptional noise. Recently , there has been increased interest in lncRNAs due to their diverse functions in human cancers. At present , lncRNAs are considered to be the main component of the competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) network due to their regulatory role in protein-coding gene expression by acting as microRNA ( miRNA) sponges. However , the function of the lncRNA-mediated ceRNA network in renal cell carcinoma remains unknown. To examine the specific mechanism , we compared the expression profiles of mRNAs , lncRNAs , and miRNAs between renal cell carcinoma tissues and non-tumor normal tissues using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. As a result , 5 lncRNAs were identified as aberrantly expressed and significantly correlated with the tumorigenesis and/or progression of renal cell carcinoma with the threshold value of absolute log2 fold change > 1 and corrected P < 0.05. Among the 5 dysregulated lncRNAs , 2 of them were prognostic biomarkers according to the overall survival analysis for patients with renal cell carcinoma. We successfully constructed a dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network , which included 4 renal cell carcinomaâ€‘specific lncRNAs , 17 mRNAs and 2 miRNAs. In summary , the present study identified new lncRNA biomarkers and potential targets for renal cell carcinoma therapy. In particular , the novel ceRNA network identified in our study will be vital for understanding the regulatory mechanisms mediated by lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma.
