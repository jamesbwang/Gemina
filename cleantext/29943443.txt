  To determine whether a food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ) and a short dietary assessment tool can be used to accurately estimate the Eatwell Guide proportions ( a plate-based food model) of diets of adults living in Scotland. The cross-sectional study was conducted as a follow up of the 2010 Scottish Health Survey ( participants aged 18-65 years old). Proportions of the Eatwell Guide food groups ( starchy carbohydrates , fruits and vegetables ( F&V) , dairy and alternatives , protein foods and oils and spreads) were calculated from the Scottish Health Survey Eating Habits Module ( SHeS EHM) , Scottish Collaborative Group FFQ ( SCG FFQ) and a seven-day estimated food diary ( reference method) , and compared using the Aitchison method and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Bland-Altman analyses assessed mean difference and 95 % limits of agreement between the methods for each food group. Ninety-six adults were included ( mean ( SD) age = 51.4 ( 11.1) years; body mass index = 27.1 ( 4.9) kg/m The SCG FFQ could be used to estimate Eatwell Guide proportions and monitor compliance to the Eatwell Guide recommendations and could be improved with small changes. The SHeS EHM is less suitable , but additional questions on dairy foods , and oils and spreads would improve its ability to estimate the Eatwell Guide proportions.
