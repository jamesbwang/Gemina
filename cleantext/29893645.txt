  Purpose To investigate the time-course changes and predictive utility of brain metabolite concentrations in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE). Materials and Methods Sixty-eight neonates ( age , 35-41 gestational weeks) with HIE were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit between September 2009 and March 2016 and examined by using proton MR spectroscopy at 18-96 hours ( n = 25) and 7-14 days ( n = 64) after birth ( 35-43 postmenstrual weeks) to estimate metabolite concentrations in the deep gray matter. Adverse outcome was defined as death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-22 months of age. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to evaluate the prognostic values of metabolites. Results At 18-96 hours , N-acetylaspartate and creatine concentrations were lower , whereas lactate , and glutamate and glutamine ( Glx) concentrations were higher in neonates with adverse outcomes than in those with favorable outcomes. Metabolite concentrations at 18-96 hours decreased during days 7-14 in neonates with adverse outcomes but did not change in those with favorable outcomes. For N-acetylaspartate , creatine , lactate , and Glx concentrations measured at 18-96 hours to predict adverse outcomes , areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.98 , 0.89 , 0.96 , and 0.88 , respectively , whereas at 7-14 days , the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.97 , 0.97 , 0.59 , and 0.36 , respectively. Conclusion Time-dependent reductions in N-acetylaspartate and creatine concentrations at both 18-96 hours and 7-14 days accurately predicted adverse outcomes. However , higher lactate and glutamate and glutamine concentrations were often transient.
