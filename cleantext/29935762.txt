  Identifying targets for chimeric antigen receptor-modulated T lymphocyte<symptom> ( CAR-T) therapy against solid tumors is an urgent problem to solve. In this study , we showed for the first time that the receptor tyrosine kinase , AXL , is overexpressed in various tumor cell lines and patient tumor tissues including triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) cell lines and patient samples , making AXL a potent novel target for cancer therapy , specifically for TNBC treatment. We also engineered T cells with a CAR consisting of a novel single-chain variable fragment against AXL and revealed its antigen-specific cytotoxicity and ability to release cytokines in a TNBC cell line and other AXL-positive tumors in vitro. Furthermore , AXL-CAR-T cells displayed a significant anti-tumor effect and in vivo persistence in a TNBC xenograft model. Taken together , our findings indicate that AXL-CAR-T cells can represent a promising therapeutic strategy against TNBC.
