  Until recently , ground-state nuclear moments of the heaviest nuclei could only be inferred from nuclear spectroscopy , where model assumptions are required. Laser spectroscopy in combination with modern atomic structure calculations is now able to probe these moments directly , in a comprehensive and nuclear-model-independent way. Here we report on unique access to the differential mean-square charge radii of ^ ( 252,253,254) No , and therefore to changes in nuclear size and shape. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional calculations describe well the changes in nuclear charge radii in the region of the heavy actinides , indicating an appreciable central depression<symptom> in the deformed proton density distribution in ^ ( 252,254) No isotopes. Finally , the hyperfine splitting of ^ ( 253) No was evaluated , enabling a complementary measure of its ( quadrupole) deformation , as well as an insight into the neutron single-particle wave function via the nuclear spin and magnetic moment.
