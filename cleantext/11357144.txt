  The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive examination of potential genotoxic effects of low doses of tritium delivered chronically to mice and to compare these effects to the ones resulting from equivalent doses of gamma-irradiation. Mice were chronically exposed for one or eight months to either tritiated water ( HTO) or organically bound tritium ( OBT) in drinking water at concentrations of 10 kBq/L , 1 MBq/L or 20 MBq/L. Dose rates of internal Î²-particle resulting from such tritium treatments were calculated and matching external gamma-exposures were carried out. We measured cytogenetic damage in bone<disease> marrow and in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs) and the cumulative tritium doses ( 0.009- 181 mGy) were used to evaluate the dose-response of OBT in PBLs , as well as its relative biological effectiveness ( RBE). Neither tritium , nor gamma exposures produced genotoxic effects in bone<disease> marrow. However , significant increases in chromosome damage rates in PBLs were found as a result of chronic OBT exposures at 1 and 20 M Bq/L , but not at 10 kBq/L. When compared to an external acute gamma-exposure
