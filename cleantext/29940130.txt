  Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) has only about 30 % -40 % five years survival rate due to the leukemia<disease> stem-like cells ( LSCs) with self-renewal and differentiation ability. To address the novel therapeutic targets in LSCs , we investigated the roles of miRNA-126 and TRAF7 in AML. We used qRT-PCR and western blot to investigate the expression level of miRNA-126 and TRAF7 in AML cell lines. Then , we uncover the effect of miRNA-126 on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis by MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis , separately. Furthermore , dual-luciferase assay and western blot were used to determine the target of miRNA-126 in AML and potential mechanism of cell apoptosis suppression of miRNA-126. We found that miRNA-126 was highly expressed in all AML cell lines and inhibition of miRNA-126 significantly induced cell death through apoptosis. The suppression of AML apoptosis with high-expression of miRNA-126 was caused by down-regulating TRAF7 , which blocked the c-FLIP pathway. The role of miRNA-126 in AML makes it a potential therapeutic target for successful clinical outcome.
