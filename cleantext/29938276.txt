  In situ monitoring of the photothermal ( PT) effect at the cellular level is of great importance in the photothermal ( PT) treatment of cancer. Herein , we report a class of DNA-templated gold nanoparticle ( GNP)- quantum dot ( QD) complexes ( GQC) for PT sensing in solution and in cancer cells in vitro. Specifically , the QD photoluminescence ( PL) could be activated at elevated temperature with a wide thermo-responsive range between 45 °C and 70 °C , which fits the temperature threshold for effective cancer cell ablation. The general applicability of GQC for intracellular PT sensing is explored using three types of PT agents ( gold nanorods ( GNRs) , gold nanostars ( GNSs) , and Prussian blue nanoparticles ( PBNPs)) with various PT performances. We show that the intracellular QD PL is gradually activated with increasing near-infrared ( NIR) irradiation time , providing a good correlation with the surrounding medium temperature for PT sensing. Moreover , we demonstrate that the GQC sensor could be used for specific photothermal labeling and imaging of cancer cells. The QD PL signal is retained in the cells post-treatment , thereby potentially enabling persistent photothermal labeling of cancer cells for post-treatment cell tracking and imaging-guided therapy evaluation.
