  MALDI mass spectrometry imaging ( MALDI-MSI) is a powerful tool to study endogenous metabolites. The process of matrix deposition is crucial for a high-quality imaging result. Commercial instruments for matrix deposition are expensive. Low-cost methods like airbrushing will generate matrix crystals that are too large for high-spatial-resolution imaging. Sublimation may cause some compounds to go undetected because of the lack of solvent. Herein , we utilized a mini-humidifier , costing less than 5 dollars , to deposit matrix for MALDI-MSI. Compared with Imageprep , a commercialized instrument , our device based on the humidifier<disease> provided higher sensitivity and much smaller matrix crystals with diameters of less than 10 μm. High-quality ion images with 10 μm spatial resolution were obtained using our method. The enhancement of sensitivity by the humidifier<disease> could provide a sufficient amount of ions to perform tandem mass imaging. We also performed MALDI-MS/MS imaging to separate two lipids in mouse brain.
