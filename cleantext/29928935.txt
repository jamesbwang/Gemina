  Benchmark dose ( BMD) analysis is generally recognized superior to generate a point of departure ( PoD) to conduct risk assessment on environmental toxicants , comparing with the traditionally employed no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) or lowest observed adverse effect level ( LOAEL) methods. However , only a few studies compared the two on producing PoD of thyroid toxicity caused by environmental chemicals. Here , we presented BMD analyses on several thyroid toxicity endpoints caused by a model chemical- propylthiouracil ( PTU). Adult female rats underwent ovariectomy were randomly assigned into groups receiving different doses of PTU ( 0 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 5.0 mg/kg bw) through gavage for 8 days. Results show that PTU induces significant dose-dependent changes of serum total thyroxine ( tT
