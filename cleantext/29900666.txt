  Dose-escalation trials commonly assume a homogeneous trial population to identify a single recommended dose of the experimental treatment for use in future trials. Wrongly assuming a homogeneous population can lead to a diluted treatment effect. Equally , exclusion of a subgroup that could in fact benefit from the treatment can cause a beneficial treatment effect to be missed. Accounting for a potential subgroup effect ( ie , difference in reaction to the treatment between subgroups) in dose-escalation can increase the chance of finding the treatment to be efficacious in a larger patient population. A standard Bayesian model-based method of dose-escalation is extended to account for a subgroup effect by including covariates for subgroup membership in the dose-toxicity model. A stratified design performs well but uses available data inefficiently and makes no inferences concerning presence of a subgroup effect. A hypothesis test could potentially rectify this problem but the small sample sizes result in a low-powered test. As an alternative , the use of spike and slab priors for variable selection is proposed. This method continually assesses the presence of a subgroup effect , enabling efficient use of the available trial data throughout escalation and in identifying the recommended dose ( s). A simulation study , based on real trial data , was conducted and this design was found to be both promising and feasible.
