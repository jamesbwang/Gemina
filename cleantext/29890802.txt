  To study the clinical effect of squeezing and clapping bone setting manipulation in treating the postpartum pubis symphysis separation. From June 2015 to March 2017 , 80 patients with postpartum pubic symphysis separation were randomly divided into treatment group and control group , 40 patients in each group. In treatment group , the patients ' reproductive age ranged from 26 to 40 years old with an average of ( 30.61 ± 5.94) years old and the neonatal weight ranged from 3.2 to 4.52 kg with an average of ( 3.59 ± 0.13) kg. In control group , patients ' reproductive age ranged from 22 to 37 years old with an average age of ( 27.51 ± 4.57) years old and the neonatal weight ranged from 3 to 5.8 kg with an average of ( 3.81 ± 0.63) kg. The patients in the treatment group were treated with the squeezing and clapping manipulation , once a week for 3 weeks. The patients in the control group were treated with pelvic bandage immobilization , and the immobilization of the pelvis was not less than 8 hours per day , 3 weeks for 1 course. The VAS pain score , Oswestry dysfunction index ( ODI) and separation distance of pubis were clinical observed and evaluated on the first day of treatment , 1 , 2 , 3 weeks and 1 months after treatment. The pubic symphysis VAS score was compared with that before treatment , in the treatment group , the difference was statistically significant at 1 week ( The `` squeezing and clapping '' manipulation can quickly restore the distance between pubic symphysis separation , relieve local pain and improve lumbosacral function , and is better than pelvic bandage fixation treatment.
