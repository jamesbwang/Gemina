  To describe the incidence of intralabyrinthine schwannoma ( ILS) utilizing the Rochester Epidemiology Project ( REP) , a unique medical consortium in the United States that covers a complete population of all ages in a well-defined geographic area over the past half-century. All patients with ILS diagnosed between January 1 , 1966 and December 31 , 2016 in Olmsted County , Minnesota , identified using the REP medical records-linkage system. Incidence of ILS. Fourteen incident cases of ILS were identified in Olmsted County since 1966-a period spanning 5.9 million person-years. Over the past decade , the incidence rate of ILS was 0.81 per 100,000 person-years and 1.1 over the last 5 years. Since 1966 , the cumulative incidence rate of ILS over the past 50 years was 0.26 per 100,000 person-years. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years ( interquartile ranges , 39-70). Incidence increased with age: over the last 5 years , those aged 60 to 69 exhibited an incidence rate of 2.7 per 100,000 person-years and those 70 + displayed a rate of 4.1. All patients had varying levels of asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss with 64 % of patients presenting with class D hearing. Four ( 29 %) patients had a history of sudden sensorineural hearing loss , five ( 36 %) reported imbalance and/or vertigo<symptom> , and four ( 29 %) reported aural fullness. Three of the 14 ( 21 %) patients had neurofibromatosis type 2. The incidence of ILS exceeds 1 per 100,000 person-years with modern diagnostic imaging. The rising incidence of ILS in recent years most likely reflects improved capacity for disease detection rather than a true increase in tumor development. Given the reputability of the REP consortium , these data suggest that ILS comprises a more common entity than previously considered.
