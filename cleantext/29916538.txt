  Oxidative stress is known to be a primary risk factor for neuronal diseases. Glutaredoxin ( GLRX) 1 , a redox‑regulator of the thioredoxin superfamily , is known to exhibit an important role in cell survival via various cellular functions. However , the precise roles of GLRX1 in brain ischemia are still not fully understood. The present study investigated whether transduced PEP‑1‑GLRX1 protein has protective effects against oxidative stress in cells and in an animal model. Transduced PEP‑1‑GLRX1 protein increased HT‑22 cell viability under oxidative stress and this fusion protein significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species and levels of DNA damage. In addition , PEP‑1‑GLRX1 protein regulated RAC‑a serine/threonine protein kinase and mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling , in addition to apoptotic signaling including B cell lymphoma ( Bcl) 2 , Bcl‑2 associated X , apoptosis regulator , pro‑caspase‑9 and p53 expression levels. In an ischemic animal model , it was verified that PEP‑1‑GLRX1 transduced into the Cornu Ammonis 1 region of the animal brain , where it markedly protected against ischemic injury. These results indicate that PEP‑1‑GLRX1 attenuates neuronal cell death resulting from oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Therefore , PEP‑1‑GLRX1 may exhibit a beneficial role in the treatment of neuronal disorders , including ischemic injury.
