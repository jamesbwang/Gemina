  GABA ( A) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels consisting of five subunits from eight subfamilies , each assembled in four hydrophobic transmembrane domains. This pentameric structure not only allows different receptor binding sites , but also various types of ligands , such as orthosteric agonists and antagonists , positive and negative allosteric modulators , as well as second-order modulators and non-competitive channel blockers. A fact , that is also displayed by the variety of chemical structures found for both , synthetic as well as nature-derived GABA ( A)- receptor modulators. This review covers the literature for natural GABA ( A)- receptor modulators until the end of 2017 and discusses their structure-activity relationship.
