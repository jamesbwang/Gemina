  Many new psychoactive substances ( NPS) introduced as recreational drugs have been associated with severe intoxication and death. Blood and/or urine samples were collected from intoxicated patients treated at Swedish hospitals that participated in the STRIDA project , a nationawide effort to address the growing problem of NPS. In patients undergoing evaluation for drug overdose , α-PBP was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical data were collected during Poisons Information Centre consultations and retrieved from medical records. From April 2013 to November 2015 , 43 patients tested positive for α-PBP. However , α-PBP was never specifically mentioned during consultation but only confirmed analytically. The α-PBP concentrations ranged 2.0-13,200 ng/mL in urine and 2.0-440 ng/mL in serum. The patients were aged 19-57 ( mean 34) years , 81 % were men , and 73 % were known drug addicts. All cases except 1 also involved other NPS and/or classical drugs. MDPV , α-PVP , and other pyrovalerone analogues were the most common other NPS ( 31 cases; 72 %). CNS depressants were detected in 28 cases ( 65 %) , with benzodiazepines ( 16 cases) being most frequent. Main clinical characteristics were agitation/anxiety ( 59 %) , tachycardia<symptom> ( 54 %) , and hypertension ( 37 %) , and 14 patients ( 33 %) required monitoring in the intensive care unit of which 8 were graded as severe intoxications. No fatalities were reported. Patients with intoxication from α-PBP resembled those by NPS cathinones MDPV and α-PVP. As patients never specifically declared α-PBP intake and poly-drug intoxication was common , they may have been unaware of the actual substance taken.
