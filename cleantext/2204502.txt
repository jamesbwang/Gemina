  Deficits in disorders of humoral immunity associated with a deficit of antibodies are the most common primary immunodeficiency. Total IgG and IgG subclasses measurements are used to diagnose , differentiate and control in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. The purpose of the study was to analyze the structure patients group according to difference between total IgG and sum of the IgG subclasses and to determine factors affecting the level of this difference. This study was based on data collected from 670 children referred to the Department of Clinical Immunology and Pediatrics in order to diagnose the immune disorders. For all children the level of the total of immunoglobulins IgG and of the IgG subclasses ( IgG1 , IgG2 , IgG3 , IgG4) were determined. The group of children was divided into subgroups according to gender , age ( under 6 years of age , 6.5-12 years , and 12-18 years) , and IgG abnormality ( below the normal range , normal and above the normal range). In the patients group , the total IgG values were on average higher than sum of the IgG subclasses. Statistical analysis shown the all parameters under study ( age , gender and IgG abnormality) influence statistically significant on the discrepancy between the sum of the IgG subclasses and total IgG. Assessment of IgG and IgG subclasses levels is based on different methods what causes the discrepancy between the sum of the IgG subclasses and total IgG. Standardization in that regard is crucial. In addition , we have shown the reliability of the results obtained. Despite the determination in two different laboratories and on different analyzers , as well as the freezing process does not affect the test results.
