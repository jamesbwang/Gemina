  The double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) which is scaffold of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACEs) in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. However , the relationship between the dsDNA and the occurrence of MACEs in patients with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction ( STEMI) remains unclear. In this study , 142 consecutive STEMI patients were admitted to medical institutions. Blood from the infarct-related coronary artery ( ICA) and peripheral artery ( PA) were obtained during percutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical follow-up was performed to analyze the occurrence of MACEs. Patients were divided into low ds-DNA group and high dsDNA group according to the cut-off value of ICA dsDNA. Mean follow-up time was 24.52 months in low dsDNA group and 25.71 months in high dsDNA group. dsDNA in the ICA was significantly higher than in the PA ( p = 0.038) and Spearman 's correlation analysis showed that they were positively correlated ( r = 0.758; p < 0.01). ICA dsDNA correlated negatively with ST-segment resolution ( r = -0.227; p = 0.007). The long-term MACEs rate was higher in high dsDNA group than low dsDNA group ( 23.7 vs. 6.7 % , p = 0.015). The ICA dsDNA ( OR 7.43 95 % CI 1.25 to 4.07 , p = 0.027) , Killip class ( OR 5.01 95 % CI 1.11 to 4.37 , p = 0.025) , BMI ( OR 1.36 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.7 , p = 0.016) and white blood cell count ( OR 1.27 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.57 , p = 0.024) were independent predictors of the occurrence of MACEs.
