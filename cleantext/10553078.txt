  Coxsackie B Virus<pathogen> ( CBV) infection has been linked to the aetiology of type 1 diabetes ( T1D) and vaccination has been proposed as prophylaxis for disease prevention. Serum neutralising antibodies and the presence of viral protein and RNA in tissues have been common tools to examine this potential disease relationship , whilst the role of anti-CBV cytotoxic T cell responses and their targets have not been studied. To address this knowledge gap , we augmented conventional HLA-binding predictive algorithm-based epitope discovery by cross-referencing epitopes with sites of positive natural selection within the CBV3 viral genome , identified using mixed effects models of evolution. Eight epitopes for the common MHC class I allele HLA-A * 0201 occur at sites that appear to be positively selected. Furthermore , such epitopes span the viral genome , indicating that effective anti-viral responses may not be restricted to the capsid region. To assess the spectrum of IFNy responses in non-diabetic subjects and recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes ( T1D) patients , we stimulated PBMC ex vivo with pools of synthetic peptides based on component-restricted sequences identified in silico. We found responders were more likely to recognize multiple rather than a single CBV peptide pool , indicating that the natural course of infection results in multiple targets for effector memory responses , rather than immunodominant epitopes or viral components. The finding that anti-CBV CD8 T cell immunity is broadly targeted has implications for vaccination strategies and studies on the pathogenesis of CBV-linked diseases.
