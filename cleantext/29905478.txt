  Efficient and selective aerobic oxidation of nitro-substituted alkylarenes to functional compounds is a fundamental process that remains a challenge. Here , we report a metal-free , efficient , and practical approach for the direct and selective aerobic oxidation of nitro-substituted alkylarenes to carboxylic acids or benzyl alcohols. This sustainable system uses O
