  A water-dissolvable electrolyte is developed by combining an ionic liquid ( IL) with poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PVA) , which decays over time by contact with water. An IL generally consists of two species of ions ( anion and cation) , and forms an electrical double layer ( EDL) of a large electrostatic capacitance due to the ions accumulated in the vicinity of a conductive electrode when voltage is applied. In a similar manner , the ionic gel developed in this work forms an EDL due to the ions suspended in the conjugated polymer network while maintaining the gel form. Test measurements show a large capacitance of 13 ÂµF cm
