  The development of inexpensive , earth abundant , and bioinspired oxygen evolution electrocatalysts that are easily accessible and scalable is a principal requirement with regard to the feasibility of water splitting for large-scale chemical energy storage. A unique , versatile , and scalable approach has been developed to fabricate manganese oxide films from single layers to multilayers with a controlled thickness and high reproducibility. The produced MnO
