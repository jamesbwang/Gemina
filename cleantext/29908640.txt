  Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells derived from human term placentas ( PMSCs) are novel therapeutic agents and more topical than ever. Here we evaluated the effects of three types of PMSCs on wound<disease> healing in an in vivo mouse model: Amnion-derived MSCs ( AMSCs) , blood vessel-derived MSCs ( BV-MSCs) from the chorionic plate and Wharton 's jelly-derived MSCs ( WJ-MSCs) from the umbilical cord. We topically applied PMSCs onto skin wounds<disease> in mice using the dermal substitute Matriderm AMSCs , BV-MSCs and WJ-MSCs significantly induced a faster healing and a higher number of blood vessels in the wound<disease> when compared to controls ( Matriderm Results indicate that all three PMSC types exert similar beneficial effects on wound<disease> closure and neovascularization in our mouse model. Using Matriderm These promising effects warrant further investigation in clinical trials.
