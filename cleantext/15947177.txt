  Leiomyoma affects up to 50 % of fertile women , leading to morbidity such as bleeding or pain. The effect of symptomatic leiomyoma on the productivity of employed women is understudied. The present study investigates productivity loss in a Swedish setting in women with symptomatic leiomyoma compared to healthy women. Women seeking care for leiomyoma and heavy menstrual bleeding ( HMB) were recruited at nine Swedish sites. Healthy controls with self-perceived mild to normal menstruation were recruited at routine visits. Cases and controls were employed without option to work from home. After recruitment , all women reported the work productivity and activity impairment ( WPAI) questionnaire , the pictorial blood assessment chart ( PBAC) and pain on the visual analog scale ( VAS). Women with symptomatic leiomyoma ( n = 88) missed more working time during menses compared to asymptomatic controls ( n = 34): 7.6 vs 0.2 % p = 0.003. The proportion of impairment while working was also significantly higher in women with symptomatic leiomyoma ( 43.8 vs 12.1 % p < 0.001). Moreover , cases reported greater activity impairment outside office hours ( 43.9 vs 12.1 % , p < 0.001). Among healthy controls , 69.5 % reported symptoms of HMB ( PBAC > 100). Symptomatic leiomyoma leads to loss of working hours as well as loss of productivity during working hours , and affects women in other daily activities. Increased awareness of the impact of leiomyomas on women 's lives is needed , and timely and appropriate management of the symptomatic leiomyomas could improve work productivity and quality of life.
