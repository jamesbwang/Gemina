  The presence of bile is not an uncommon finding in acidic oesophageal and extra-oesophageal refluxate , possibly affecting the hypopharyngeal mucosa and leading to neoplastic events. We recently demonstrated that acidic bile ( pH ≤ 4.0) can induce NF-κB activation and oncogenic mRNA phenotype in normal hypopharyngeal cells and generate premalignant changes in treated hypopharyngeal mucosa. We hypothesize that curcumin , a dietary inhibitor of NF-κB , may effectively inhibit the acidic bile-induced cancer-related mRNA phenotype , in treated human hypopharyngeal primary cells ( HHPC) , supporting its potential preventive use in vivo. Luciferase assay , immunofluorescence , Western blot , qPCR and PCR microarray analysis were used to explore the effect of curcumin in HHPC exposed to bile ( 400 μmol/L) at acidic and neutral pH. Curcumin successfully inhibited the acidic bile-induced NF-κB signalling pathway ( 25 % of analysed genes) , and overexpression of NF-κB transcriptional factors , c-REL , RELA ( p65) , anti-apoptotic bcl-2 , oncogenic TNF-α , EGFR , STAT3 , WNT5A , ΔNp63 and cancer-related IL-6. Curcumin effectively reduced bile-induced bcl-2 overexpression at both acidic and neutral pH. Our novel findings suggest that , similar to pharmacologic NF-κB inhibitor , BAY 11-7082 , curcumin can suppress acidic bile-induced oncogenic mRNA phenotype in hypopharyngeal cells , encouraging its future in vivo pre-clinical and clinical explorations in prevention of bile reflux-related pre-neoplastic events mediated by NF-κB.
