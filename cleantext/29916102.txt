  Glucagon has been recognized as a pivotal factor implicated in the pathophysiology ofdiabetes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic secretion levels of serum glucagon ( GLA) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) with different courses of disease , and to analyze its correlation with blood glucose fluctuation. This observational study included 55 T1DM patients and divided into 3 groups according to the courses of disease. Group 1 ( the disease duration < 1 year) , Group 2 ( 1 ≤ the disease durations ≤ 5) , 3 ( the disease durations > 5 years). All patients underwent a 100g standard steamed buns meal test , measuring the levels of serum glucose , glucagon , insulin , C-peptide in different points of time , and 48 of the total patients used continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS) to monitor blood glucose. The fasting glucagon level in Group 1 was significantly higher than it in Group 2. Furthermore , the GLA1h , the GLA3h and the AUCGLA0-3h in Group 1 were greatly larger than those in Group 3. Referring to glycemic variability , the LBGI , AUC of hypoglycemia , the percentage of hypoglycemia time andthe times of nocturnal hypoglycemia in Group 1 were significantly lower than those in Group 3. Moreover , the fasting glucagon level was the independent factors to SD and MAGE. The AUCGLA0-3h were negatively correlated with MODD , LBGI , GRADE-hypo and AUC of nocturnal hypoglycemia. It is concluded that glucagon secretory function impairs with duration of type 1 diabetes extended and correlates to glycemic fluctuation , especially hypoglycemia.
