  Pancoast or superior pulmonary sulcus tumour is a subset of lung carcinoma that invades the structures of the thoracic inlet- first ribs , distal roots of the brachial plexus , stellate ganglion , vertebrae , and subclavian vessels. The first symptom is usually shoulder pain; consequently , most patients are initially treated for osteoarthritis. Late diagnosis is common. Success of therapy depends on an accurate staging: standard imaging with CT scan of the chest , PET-CT scan , brain MRI are needed to rule out distant metastases , endobronchial ultrasound-guided needle biopsy ( EBUS-TBNA) or mediastinoscopy are mandatory for reliable nodal staging. An MRI of the thoracic inlet allows to clearly define the boundaries of local invasion. Modern management of Pancoast tumour includes induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection. As compared with historical series treated by preoperative radiation , a trimodally approach did enhance complete resection rates and perhaps long-term survival- from about 30 % 5-year survival rate to 60 % in R0-resected patients. In patients who have unresectable but non-metastatic Pancoast tumours and appropriate performance status , definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy are recommended options.
