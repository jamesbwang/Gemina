  Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults and leads to severe<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , substantial physical functional impairment , and restricted social participation. In this study , we aimed to determine whether cognitive behavioural therapy optionally combined with graded exercise compared with standard care alone improved the health status of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. We did a multicentre , single-blind , randomised trial , at four neuromuscular referral centres with experience in treating patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 located in Paris ( France) , Munich ( Germany) , Nijmegen ( Netherlands) , and Newcastle ( UK). Eligible participants were patients aged 18 years and older with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 , who were severely fatigued ( ie , a score of ≥ 35 on the checklist-individual strength , subscale fatigue<symptom>). We randomly assigned participants ( 1:1) to either cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care and optional graded exercise or standard care alone. Randomisation was done via a central web-based system , stratified by study site. Cognitive behavioural therapy focused on addressing reduced patient initiative , increasing physical activity , optimising social interaction , regulating sleep-wake patterns , coping with pain , and addressing beliefs about fatigue<symptom> and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Cognitive behavioural therapy was delivered over a 10-month period in 10-14 sessions. A graded exercise module could be added to cognitive behavioural therapy in Nijmegen and Newcastle. The primary outcome was the 10-month change from baseline in scores on the DM1-Activ-c scale , a measure of capacity for activity and social participation ( score range 0-100). Statistical analysis of the primary outcome included all participants for whom data were available , using mixed-effects linear regression models with baseline scores as a covariate. Safety data were presented as descriptives. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02118779. Between April 2 , 2014 , and May 29 , 2015 , we randomly assigned 255 patients to treatment: 128 to cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care and 127 to standard care alone. 33 ( 26 %) of 128 assigned to cognitive behavioural therapy also received the graded exercise module. Follow-up continued until Oct 17 , 2016. The DM1-Activ-c score increased from a mean ( SD) of 61 · 22 ( 17 · 35) points at baseline to 63 · 92 ( 17 · 41) at month 10 in the cognitive behavioural therapy group ( adjusted mean difference 1 · 53 , 95 % CI -0 · 14 to 3 · 20) , and decreased from 63 · 00 ( 17 · 35) to 60 · 79 ( 18 · 49) in the standard care group ( -2 · 02 , -4 · 02 to -0 · 01) , with a mean difference between groups of 3 · 27 points ( 95 % CI 0 · 93 to 5 · 62 , p = 0 · 007). 244 adverse events occurred in 65 ( 51 %) patients in the cognitive behavioural therapy group and 155 in 63 ( 50 %) patients in the standard care alone group , the most common of which were falls ( 155 events in 40 ( 31 %) patients in the cognitive behavioural therapy group and 71 in 33 ( 26 %) patients in the standard care alone group). 24 serious adverse events were recorded in 19 ( 15 %) patients in the cognitive behavioural therapy group and 23 in 15 ( 12 %) patients in the standard care alone group , the most common of which were gastrointestinal and cardiac. Cognitive behavioural therapy increased the capacity for activity and social participation in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 at 10 months. With no curative treatment and few symptomatic treatments , cognitive behavioural therapy could be considered for use in severely fatigued patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1.
