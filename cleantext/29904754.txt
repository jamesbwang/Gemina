  To evaluate the influence of different surface treatments of lithium disilicate glass ceramics on the bonding efficacy of three luting composites. A total of 450 blocks of e.max CAD ( Ivoclar Vivadent) ground with 600-grit silicon carbide paper were prepared and divided into three groups ( n = 150) according to the composite cements used: Variolink Esthetic DC ( VE) , Multilink Automix ( MA) , and SpeedCEM ( SC). Each group was further divided into five subgroups ( n = 10) according to the surface treatment performed: no treatment ( control) , Monobond Plus ( MP) , 37 % phosphoric acid and Monobond Plus ( PA) , < 5 % hydrofluoric acid and Monobond Plus ( HF) , and Monobond Etch & Prime ( ME). All treated ceramic specimens were bonded with three composite cements and light cured. After 24-h water storage and 5000 or 10,000 thermocycles , tensile bond strength ( TBS) was measured. The specimens underwent failure mode analysis. The results were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and t-tests with Bonferroni correction. The TBSs were significantly influenced by surface treatments ( p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in HF and ME among most of the groups. Furthermore , ME showed the highest bond strength with MA after 10,000 thermocycling. Most specimens of the ME groups exhibited cohesive failures , whereas a combination of adhesive failures and mixed failures were observed in control , MP , PA , and HF groups. In the surface treatment of lithium disilicate glass ceramics , Monobond Etch & Prime was found to be a possible substitution for the combination of hydrofluoric acid and Monobond Plus.
