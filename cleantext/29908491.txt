  With the vast majority of the microbial world still considered unculturable or undiscovered , microbiologists not only require more fundamental insights concerning microbial growth requirements but also need to implement miniaturized , versatile and high-throughput technologies to upscale current microbial isolation strategies. In this respect , single-cell-based approaches are increasingly finding their way to the microbiology lab. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that analysis and separation of free microbial cells by flow-based sorting as well as physical stochastic confinement of individual cells in microenvironment compartments can facilitate the isolation of previously uncultured species and the discovery of novel microbial taxa. Still , while most of these methods give immediate access to downstream whole genome sequencing , upscaling to higher cell densities as required for metabolic readouts and preservation purposes can remain challenging. Provided that these and other technological challenges are addressed in future innovation rounds , integration of single-cell tools in commercially available benchtop instruments and service platforms is expected to trigger more targeted explorations in the microbial dark matter at a depth comparable to metagenomics.
