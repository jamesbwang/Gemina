  In this study we evaluated if zebrafish larvae can be colonized by human gut microorganisms. We tested two strategies: ( 1) through transplantation of a human fecal microbiota and ( 2) by successively transplanting aerotolerant anaerobic microorganisms , similar to the colonization in the human intestine during early life. We used conventionally raised zebrafish larvae harboring their own aerobic microbiota to improve the colonization of anaerobic microorganisms. The results showed with the fecal transplant , that some members of the human gut microbiota were transferred to larvae.
