  Imaging characteristics and hearing outcomes in children with cochleovestibular or cochleovestibular nerve ( CVN) abnormalities. Retrospective , critical review. Tertiary referral academic center. Twenty-seven children with CVN abnormalities with magnetic resonance ( MRI) and/or computed tomography ( CT). Study Intervention ( s): None. Determine the likely presence or absence of a CNV and auditory stimulation responses. Two of 27 cases had unilateral hearing loss , and all others had bilateral loss. Eleven ( 46 %) were identified with a disability or additional condition. Twenty-two ( 42 %) ears<disease> received a cochlear implant ( CI) and 9 ears<disease> ( 17 %) experienced no apparent benefit from the device. MRI acquisition protocols were suboptimal for identification of the nerve in 22 ( 42 %) ears<disease>. A likely CVN absence was associated with a narrow cochlear aperture and internal auditory canal and cochlear malformation. Thirteen ( 48 %) children with an abnormal nerve exhibited normal cochleae on the same side. Hearing data were available for 30 ears<disease> , and 25 ears<disease> ( 83 %) exhibited hearing with or without an assistive device. One child achieved closed set speech recognition with a hearing aid , another with a CI. One child achieved open set speech recognition with a CI. Current imaging can not accurately characterize the functional status of the CVN or predict an assistive device benefit. Children who would have otherwise been denied a CI exhibited auditory responses after implantation. A CI should be considered in children with abnormal CVN. Furthermore , imaging acquisition protocols need standardization for clear temporal bone imaging.
