  To explore the effect of three kinds of drinking water and its possible mechanism on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of hypertensive mice. The water quality parameters were measured for three kinds of drinking water , and the parameters includedtotal dissolved solids ( TDS) , oxygen consumed ( OC) , p H , oxidation reduction potential ( ORP) , electric conductivity ( EC) , dissolved hydrogen , calcium and magnesium. Establishment of mouse model of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> by using N '- nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride ( L-NAME) for 30 days. Then the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control group , model control group , group of tap water and group of filtered water. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in mice was detected every month. After 3 months , nitric oxide ( NO) , nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) , total superoxide dismutase ( T-SOD) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px) , endothelin ( ET) , angiotensin ( Ang) , aldosterone ( ALD) , catecholamine ( CA) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( c-GMP) in serum of the mice were determined. Simultaneously morphological changes of heart , kidney and thoracic aorta paraffin section were observed. The p H , TDS , OC , EC , calcium and magnesium in filtered water were higher than that of pure and tap water. The negative ORP and great quantities of dissolved hydrogen were found in filtered water; The systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and mean blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( ( 106. 24 ± 5. 31) and ( 90. 73 ± 4. 99) mm Hg) of filtered water were lower than those of the pure water ( 119. 58 ± 6. 08 and 96. 44 ± 6. 48 mm Hg) ( P < 0. 05). The NO ( ( 87. 05 ± 39. 82) μmol/L) in the mice with filtered water were higher than those of with pure and tap water ( ( 45. 01 ± 9. 62) and ( 46. 56 ± 30. 54) μmol/L) ( P < 0. 05). Compared with those of the mice with pure water , significant decrease in IL-6 ( ( 201. 42 ± 36. 41) and ( 173. 99 ± 114. 96) vs. ( 363. 14 ± 149. 00) pg/m L) and Ang ( ( 1319. 20 ± 111. 90) and ( 1349. 38 ± 180. 15) vs. ( 1736. 17 ± 242. 86) ng/L) were observed in mice treated with tap and filtered water ( P < 0. 05). The T-SOD and GSH-Px ( ( 268. 37 ± 12. 25) and ( 712. 45 ± 30. 59) U/m L) in the mice with filtered water were significant higher than those of pure water ( ( 250. 46 ± 15. 60) and ( 678. 36 ± 35. 80) U/m L) ( P < 0. 05). Compared with pure and tap water , filtered water can reduce the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of the hypertensive mice by antioxidation and anti-inflammatory.
