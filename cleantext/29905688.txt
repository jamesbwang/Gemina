  We proposed and experimentally demonstrated 3-dimensional dark traps for low refractive index bio-cells using a single optical fiber Bessel beam. The Bessel beam was produced by concatenating single-mode fiber and a step index multimode fiber , which was then focused by a high refractive index glass microsphere integrated on the fiber end facet. The focused Bessel beam provided two dark fields along the axial direction , where stable trapping of low refractive index bio-cells was realized in a high refractive index liquid bath. The all-fiber and seamlessly integrated structure of the proposed scheme can find ample potential as a micro-optical probe in in situ characterization and manipulation of multiple bio-cells with refractive indices lower than that of the liquid bath.
