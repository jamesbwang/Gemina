  Oxidative stress has been implicated in mental disorders , including depression<symptom> Chlorogenic acid ( CGA) , one of the abundant phenolic compounds in herbs and fruits , has the properties of a natural antioxidant and free-radical scavenger. Therfore , we investigated the antidepressant-like effects and active mechanisms of CGA from the extract of Crataegus pinnatifida ( CP) fruit. Depression-like phenotypes were induced in mice by daily injection of stress hormone for 1-2 weeks. The brains of these animals exhibited reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and increased astrocytic hypertrophy , which are typical markers of depression<symptom> in animal models. Stress hormone injection 1) upregulated monoamine oxidase B ( MAOB) expression and 2) reduced spine numbers along neuronal dendrites , which indicates synaptic depression<symptom> The oral administration of CGA ( 30 mg kg Our study indicates that CGA and CP extracts prevented depressive behavior and thereby have potential as natural antidepressants.
