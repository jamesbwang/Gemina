  We developed EASI-tag ( easily abstractable sulfoxide-based isobaric-tag) , a new type of amine-derivatizing and sulfoxide-containing isobaric labeling reagents for highly accurate quantitative proteomics analysis using mass spectrometry. We observed that EASI-tag labels dissociate at low collision energy and generate peptide-coupled , interference-free reporter ions with high yield. Efficient isolation of
