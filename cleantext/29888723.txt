  The study aimed to describe the pattern of injuries among patients presenting at a tertiary care hospital in Enugu southeast Nigeria. A retrospective review of records of all injured patients seen in our hospital over a 12-month period was done. A total of 789 patients had complete medical records and were included in the study. Road traffic accident ( RTA) was the most common cause of injury. Lacerations/abrasions , fractures , and traumatic brain injury ( TBI) were the most frequently seen injuries. The injury severity score ( ISS) of the patients ranged from 1 to 50 with a mean score of 8.9 Â± 3.5. RTAs were responsible for 90.8 % of patients with ISS > 15. Patients with ISS > 15 contributed to 64.1 % of all deaths. The mortality rate was 4.5 %. Most deaths resulted from RTA and were associated with TBI ( P = 0.001). Lacerations and fractures were the most common injuries. RTA was the leading cause of injury. TBI was the most common cause of injury-related death.
