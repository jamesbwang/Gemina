  The proton motive force ( PMF) across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane that is generated by electron transport during photosynthesis is the driving force for ATP synthesis in plants. The PMF mainly arises from the oxidation of water in photosystem II and from electron transfer within the cytochrome b
