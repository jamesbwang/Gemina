  We consider condensation in a capillary groove of width L and depth D , formed by walls that are completely wet ( contact angle θ = 0) , which is in a contact with a gas reservoir of the chemical potential μ. On a mesoscopic level , the condensation process can be described in terms of the midpoint height ℓ of a meniscus formed at the liquid-gas interface. For macroscopically deep grooves ( D → ∞) , and in the presence of long-range ( dispersion) forces , the condensation corresponds to a second-order phase transition , such that ℓ ∼ ( μ _ ( cc)- μ) ^ ( -1/ 4) as μ → μ _ ( cc) ^ (-) where μ _ ( cc) is the chemical potential pertinent to capillary condensation in a slit pore of width L. For finite values of D , the transition becomes rounded and the groove becomes filled with liquid at a chemical potential higher than μ _ ( cc) with a difference of the order of D ^ ( -3). For sufficiently deep grooves , the meniscus growth initially follows the power law ℓ ∼ ( μ _ ( cc)- μ) ^ ( -1/ 4) , but this behavior eventually crosses over to ℓ ∼ D- ( μ-μ _ ( cc)) ^ ( -1/ 3) above μ _ ( cc) , with a gap between the two regimes shown to be δ ( over ¯) μ ∼ D ^ ( -3). Right at μ = μ _ ( cc) , when the groove is only partially filled with liquid , the height of the meniscus scales as ℓ ^ ( *) ∼ ( D ^ ( 3) L) ^ ( 1/4). Moreover , the chemical potential ( or pressure) at which the groove is half-filled with liquid exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on D with a maximum at D ≈ 3L/2 and coincides with μ _ ( cc) when L ≈ D. Finally , we show that condensation in finite grooves can be mapped on the condensation in capillary slits formed by two asymmetric ( competing) walls a distance D apart with potential strengths depending on L. All these predictions , based on mesoscopic arguments , are confirmed by fully microscopic Rosenfeld 's density functional theory with a reasonable agreement down to surprisingly small values of both L and D.
