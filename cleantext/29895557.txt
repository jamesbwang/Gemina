  Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT-2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce liver fat in rodent models. Data regarding the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on human liver fat are scarce. This study examined the effect of empagliflozin ( an SGLT-2 inhibitor) on liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) by using MRI-derived proton density fat fraction ( MRI-PDFF). Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were randomly assigned to either the empagliflozin group ( standard treatment for type 2 diabetes plus empagliflozin 10 mg daily) or the control group ( standard treatment without empagliflozin) for 20 weeks. Change in liver fat was measured by MRI-PDFF. Secondary outcome measures were change in alanine transaminase ( ALT) , aspartate transaminase ( AST) , and Î³-glutamyl transferase ( GGT) levels. When included in the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes , empagliflozin was significantly better at reducing liver fat ( mean MRI-PDFF difference between the empagliflozin and control groups -4.0 %; When included in the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes , empagliflozin reduces liver fat and improves ALT levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.
