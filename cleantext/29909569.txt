  Stroke is a leading cause for disability and morbidity associated with increased economic burden due to treatment and post-stroke care ( PSC). The aim of our study is to provide information on resource consumption for PSC , to identify relevant cost drivers , and to discuss potential information gaps. A systematic literature review on economic studies reporting PSC-associated data was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE , Scopus/Elsevier and Cochrane databases , Google Scholar and gray literature ranging from January 2000 to August 2016. Results for post-stroke interventions ( treatment and care) were systematically extracted and summarized in evidence tables reporting study characteristics and economic outcomes. Economic results were converted to 2015 US Dollars , and the total cost of PSC per patient month ( PM) was calculated. We included 42 studies. Overall PSC costs ( inpatient/outpatient) were highest in the USA ( $ 4850/PM) and lowest in Australia ( $ 752/PM). Studies assessing only outpatient care reported the highest cost in the United Kingdom ( $ 883/PM) , and the lowest in Malaysia ( $ 192/PM). Fifteen different segments of specific services utilization were described , in which rehabilitation and nursing care were identified as the major contributors. The highest PSC costs were observed in the USA , with rehabilitation services being the main cost driver. Due to diversity in reporting , it was not possible to conduct a detailed cost analysis addressing different segments of services. Further approaches should benefit from the advantages of administrative and claims data , focusing on inpatient/outpatient PSC cost and its predictors , assuring appropriate resource allocation.
