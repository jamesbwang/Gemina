  In recent decades , rice disease co-epidemics have caused tremendous damage to crop production in both China and Southeast Asia. A variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to map diseases distribution using coarse- to moderate-resolution imagery. However , the detection and discrimination of various disease species infecting rice were seldom assessed using high spatial resolution data. The aims of this study were ( 1) to develop a set of normalized two-stage vegetation indices ( VIs) for characterizing the progressive development of different diseases with rice; ( 2) to explore the performance of combined normalized two-stage VIs in partial least square discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA); and ( 3) to map and evaluate the damage caused by rice diseases at fine spatial scales , for the first time using bi-temporal , high spatial resolution imagery from PlanetScope datasets at a 3 m spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that the primary biophysical parameters caused by different disease ( e.g. , changes in leaf area , pigment contents , or canopy morphology) can be captured using combined normalized two-stage VIs. PLS-DA was able to classify rice diseases at a sub-field scale , with an overall accuracy of 75.62 % and a Kappa value of 0.47. The approach was successfully applied during a typical co-epidemic outbreak of rice dwarf ( Rice dwarf virus , RDV) , rice blast (
