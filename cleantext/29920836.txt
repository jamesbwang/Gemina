  Smokers can regulate their nicotine intake by altering the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( CPD) and their smoking intensity. The current study aimed to compare the utility of self-reported CPD , total nicotine equivalents ( TNE) and urinary cotinine to estimate nicotine intake during pregnancy. Longitudinal smoking behavior and biomarker data were collected at early pregnancy , late pregnancy and at postpartum as part of a smoking cessation trial to examine voucher-based incentives for decreasing smoking. Obstetric practices in Burlington , Vermont , United States. A subset of participants ( n = 47) from the parent trial , recruited between December 2006 and June 2012 , who provided a urine sample at each assessment during early pregnancy , late pregnancy and postpartum. Smoking was assessed using self-reported CPD , TNE , TNE/CPD and urinary cotinine. Pregnant smokers reported smoking 10.4 CPD at early pregnancy , 7.2 CPD at late pregnancy ( a 31 % reduction at late pregnancy , P = 0.001) and 8.6 CPD at postpartum ( a 19 % increase from late pregnancy , P = 0.08). TNE exposure was 41 % ( P = 0.07) and 48 % ( P = 0.03) lower at early and late pregnancy , respectively , compared to postpartum. TNE/CPD was on average 167 % higher at late pregnancy compared to early pregnancy ( P = 0.01) and remained high at postpartum , where it was 111 % higher compared to early pregnancy ( P = 0.007). Uriniary cotinine underestimated nicotine intake by 55 % during early pregnancy and by 65 % during late pregnancy compared to postpartum ( P Neither cigarettes smoked per day ( CPD) nor cotinine provides an accurate estimate of nicotine exposure during pregnancy. CPD underestimates nicotine intake substantially due to under-reporting and/or higher intensity of smoking , while cotinine underestimates nicotine intake markedly due to accelerated nicotine ( and cotinine) metabolism during pregnancy.
