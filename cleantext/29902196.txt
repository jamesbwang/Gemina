  Various natural and manmade disasters during last decades have highlighted the need of further improving on governmental preparedness to emergency events , and a relief supplies distribution problem named Inventory Slack Routing Problem ( ISRP) has received increasing attentions. In an ISRP , inventory slack is defined as the duration between reliefs arriving time and estimated inventory stock-out time. Hence , a larger inventory slack could grant more responsive time in facing of various factors ( e.g. , traffic congestion<symptom>) that may lead to delivery lateness. In this study , the relief distribution problem is formulated as an optimization model that maximize the minimum slack among all dispensing sites. To efficiently solve this problem , we propose a two-stage approach to tackle the vehicle routing and relief allocation sub-problems. By analyzing the inter-relations between these two sub-problems , a new objective function considering both delivery durations and dispensing rates of demand sites is applied in the first stage to design the vehicle routes. A hierarchical routing approach and a sweep approach are also proposed in this stage. Given the vehicle routing plan , the relief allocation could be easily solved in the second stage. Numerical experiment with a comparison of multi-vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem ( TSP) has demonstrated the need of ISRP and the capability of the proposed solution approaches.
