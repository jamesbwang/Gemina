  Venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is the third leading cause of vascular disease and accounts for $ 10 billion in annual US healthcare costs. The nationwide burden of 30-day readmissions after such events has not been comprehensively assessed. We analyzed adults â‰¥ 18 years of age with hospitalizations associated with acute VTE between January 1 , 2010 , and December 31 , 2014 , in the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Nearly 1 in 5 patients with acute VTE were readmitted within 30 days. Predictors and causes of readmission were primarily related to patient characteristics and complications from comorbid conditions , whereas healthcare quality had a moderate impact on readmission risk.
