  Mucin 1 ( MUC1) is a heterodimeric protein that is aberrantly overexpressed on the surface of diverse human carcinomas and is an attractive target for the development of mAb-based therapeutics. However , attempts at targeting the shed MUC1 N-terminal subunit have been unsuccessful. We report here the generation of mAb 3D1 against the nonshed oncogenic MUC1 C-terminal ( MUC1-C) subunit. We show that mAb 3D1 binds with low nM affinity to the MUC1-C extracellular domain at the restricted Î±3 helix. mAb 3D1 reactivity is selective for MUC1-C-expressing human cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. Internalization of mAb 3D1 into cancer cells further supported the conjugation of mAb 3D1 to monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE). The mAb 3D1-MMAE antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC) ( a) kills MUC1-C-positive cells in vitro , ( b) is nontoxic in MUC1-transgenic ( MUC1.Tg) mice , and ( c) is active against human HCC827 lung tumor xenografts. Humanized mAb ( humAb) 3D1 conjugated to MMAE also exhibited antitumor activity in ( a) MUC1.Tg mice harboring syngeneic MC-38/ MUC1 tumors , ( b) nude mice bearing human ZR-75-1 breast tumors , and ( c) NCG mice engrafted with a patient-derived triple-negative breast cancer. These findings and the absence of associated toxicities support clinical development of humAb 3D1-MMAE ADCs as a therapeutic for the many cancers with MUC1-C overexpression.
