  c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase shown inappropriate expression and actively involved in progression and metastasis in most types of human cancer. Development of c-Met-targeted imaging and therapeutic agents would be extremely useful. Previous studies reported that c-Met-binding peptide ( Met-pep1 , YLFSVHWPPLKA) specifically targets c-Met receptor. Here , we evaluated 18F-labeled Met-pep1 for PET imaging of c-Met positive tumor in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) xenografted mice. c-Met-binding peptide , Met-pep1 , was synthesized and labeled with 4-nitrophenyl ( 18F) -2-fluoropropionate ( ( 18F)- NPFP) ( ( 18F) FP-Met-pep1). The cell uptake , internalization and efflux of ( 18F) FP-Met-pep1 were assessed in UM-SCC-22B cells. In vivo pharmacokinetics , blocking and biodistribution of the radiotracers were investigated in tumor-bearing nude mice by microPET imaging. The radiolabeling yield for ( 18F) FP-Met-pep1 was over 55 % with 97 % purity. ( 18F) FP-Met-pep1 showed high tumor uptake in UM-SCC-22B tumor-bearing mice with clear visualization. The specificity of the imaging tracer was confirmed by significantly decreased tumor uptake after co-administration of unlabeled Met-pep1 peptides. Prominent uptake and rapid excretion of ( 18F) FP-Met-pep1 was also observed in the kidney , suggesting this tracer is mainly excreted through the renal-urinary routes. Ex vivo biodistribution showed similar results that were consistent with microPET imaging data. These results suggest that 18F-labeled c-Met peptide may potentially be used for imaging c-Met positive HNSCC cancer in vivo and for c-Met-targeted cancer therapy.
