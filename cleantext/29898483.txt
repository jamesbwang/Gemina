  Outbreaks of scabies are common in community facilities , but rare in hospitals. We report the outbreak of scabies infestations in health care workers in a tertiary care hospital. Five staff members developed a scabies infestation , confirmed by a dermatologist. The scabies was acquired obviously while treating a severe ill ICU patient , no other source of the infection could be detected. All staff members were treated with Permethrine and Ivermectine. The immunocompromised index patient had undergone antiscabious treatment several months before she was admitted to the ICU , but due to the close physical contact with the staff in the ICU transmissions of mite occurred obviously.This case underlines that scabies may remain contagious over a long period even after an appropriate treatment of a well-known patient. Especially in the conditions of an ICU environment , appropriate personal protective measures are required for a long period of time.
