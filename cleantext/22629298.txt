  Olive flounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus) is one of the most economically important aquaculture fish. However , its production is often affected by various diseases , especially viral hemorrhagic septicemia<disease> virus ( VHSV) that cause serious economic losses. In this study , we sequenced the whole transcriptome of the P. olivaceus using Illumina RNA-sEq. De novo assembly of control and virus-infected cDNA libraries of head kidney at 13 and 20 °C was accomplished with 2,007,532,438 raw reads , resulting in 244,578 unigenes with an average length of 533 bp and found 65,535 candidate coding unigenes with homology to other species by BLAST analysis. DEG analysis among control and virus-infected head kidney samples of 13 and 20 °C revealed that 1290 up-regulated and 162 down-regulated genes ( p ≤ 0.01) , linked to metabolism , virulence factors , adhesion and immune-response. We constructed an expressed gene catalog for the P. olivaceus to serve as a resource for marine environmental genomic and immuno-genetic/genomic studies focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of P. olivaceus to VHSV under different temperature.
