  Active warming of patients is recommended by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE) to prevent inadvertent perioperative hypothermia<symptom> ( IPH). This paper examines the cost effectiveness of one consequence of IPH , an increase in blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and the resulting transfusion risk. We quantified the risk and modelled two patient pathways , one with and one without warming , across two different surgery types. We were able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of active warming based on one consequence even allowing for uncertainties in the model.
