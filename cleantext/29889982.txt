  Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome<disease> ( OSAS) is believed to be associated with craniofacial and neuromuscular changes , although the interplay among these variables still is poorly recognised. The objective of this study was to identify hyoid , muscular and swallowing changes associated with OSAS , and to correlate these alterations with OSAS severity. Cross-sectional study , in a tertiary referral centre. Seventy-two adult individuals participated in this study: 12 controls ( without apnoea) and 60 patients with apnoea ( mild , moderate and severe OSAS-20 individuals in each group). All participants were initially evaluated by otorhinolaryngologist and neurologist and underwent polysomnography for OSAS stratification. Cephalometric data , clinical myofunctional status and swallow videofluoroscopy exam were assessed. A hybrid effect model was used to analyse swallowing parameters; dependent variables were age , body mass index ( BMI) and cephalometric measures. Individuals with OSAS presented lower hyoid position and narrower posterior airway distance when compared to controls. These parameters correlated to OSAS severity. Additionally , OSAS patients exhibited significantly lower myofunctional scores. Both velum and hyoid contraction times were significantly lower in the OSAS group at videofluoroscopy , regardless of its severity. Premature leakage into pharynx was more common in OSAS groups. Laryngeal penetration phenomenon occurred only in two patients ( both from OSAS group). Our results suggest that hyoid bone position is associated with OSAS severity. Muscular pattern and swallowing are impaired in OSAS patients , irrespective of OSAS severity and facial profile. These findings indicate a higher predisposition of OSAS patients to present an inferior hyoid positioning , accompanied by myofunctional and swallowing disorders.
