  The moir√© of a monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride on Ir ( 111) is found to be a template for Ir , C , and Au cluster superlattices. Using scanning tunneling microscopy , the cluster structure and epitaxial relation to the substrate , the cluster binding site , the role of defects , as well as the thermal stability of the cluster lattice are investigated. The Ir and C cluster superlattices display a high thermal stability , before they decay by intercalation and Smoluchowski ripening. Ab initio calculations explain the extraordinarily strong Ir cluster binding through selective sp
