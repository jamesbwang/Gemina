  Air pollution can be detected through rainwater composition. In this study , long-term measurements ( 2000-2014) of wet deposition were made to evaluate the physicochemical interaction and the potential sources of pollution due to changes of land use. The rainwater samples were obtained from an urban site in Kuala Lumpur and a highland-rural site in the middle of Peninsular Malaysia. The compositions of rainwater were obtained from the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The results showed that the urban site experienced more acidity in rainwater ( avg = 277 mm , range of 13.8 to 841 mm; pH = 4.37) than the rural background site ( avg = 245 mm , range of 2.90 to 598 mm; pH = 4.97) due to higher anthropogenic input of acid precursors. The enrichment factor ( EF) analysis showed that at both sites , SO
