  Overt hepatic encephalopathy ( OHE) is a serious complication of liver dysfunction , which is associated with severe morbidity/mortality and healthcare resource utilization. OHE can be medically refractory due to spontaneous portosystemic shunts ( SPSSs) and therefore a new treatment option for these SPSSs is critical. This is a retrospective study of 43 patients with medically refractory OHE , who underwent CARTO ( Coil-Assisted Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration) procedures between June 2012 and October 2016. The patient demographic characteristics , technical and clinical outcomes with an emphasis on HE improvement , and complications are reviewed and analyzed. The overall clinical success rate was 91 % with a significant HE improvement. Eighty-one percent of patients had clinically significant improvement from OHE and 67 % of patients had complete resolution of their HE symptoms during our follow-up period of 893 Â± 585 days ( range 36-1881 days , median 755.0 days). The median WH score improved from 3 ( range 2-4) pre-CARTO to 1 ( range 0-4) post-CARTO ( p < 0.001). The median ammonia<pathogen> level significantly decreased from 134.5 pre-CARTO to 70.0 post-CARTO ( p < 0.001) in 3 days. The overall mean survival was 1465.5 days ( 95 % CI of 1243.0 and 1688.0 days). Only three patients had recurrent HE symptoms. There were 39.6 % minor complication rate including new or worsened ascites and esophageal varices , and only 2.3 % major complication rate requiring additional treatment ( one patient with bleeding esophageal varices requiring treatment). No procedure-related death is noted. CARTO appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for refractory overt hepatic encephalopathy ( OHE) due to spontaneous portosystemic shunts. CARTO could be an excellent addition to currently available treatment options for these patients.
