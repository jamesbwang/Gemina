  It is widely accepted that while controlled processes ( e.g. , working memory and executive functions) decline with age , implicit ( automatic) processes are not affected by age. In this paper we challenge this view by arguing that high-level automatic processes ( e.g. , recruiting motivation) decline with age , and that this decline plays an unappreciated role in cognitive aging. Specifically , we hypothesized that due to their decline , automatic motivational processes are less likely to be spontaneously activated in old age; thus , implicit external activation of them should have stronger effects on older ( vs. younger) adults. In two experiments we used different methods of implicitly activating motivation , and measured executive functions of younger and older adults using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In both experiments , implicit modulation of motivation resulted in improved executive functioning for older adults. The framework we propose is general and offers a new look at various aspects of cognitive aging.
