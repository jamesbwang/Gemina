  It is recognized that biocomputing can provide intelligent solutions to complex biosensing projects. However , it remains challenging to transform biomolecular logic gates into convenient , portable , resettable and quantitative sensing systems for point-of-care ( POC) diagnostics in a low-resource setting. To overcome these limitations , the first design of biocomputing on personal glucose meters ( PGMs) is reported , which utilizes glucose and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as signal outputs , DNAzymes and protein enzymes as building blocks , and demonstrates a general platform for installing logic-gate responses ( YES , NOT , INHIBIT , NOR , NAND , and OR) to a variety of biological species , such as cations ( Na
