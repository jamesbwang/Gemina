  Visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) is related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). However , the role of mesenteric adipose tissue ( MAT) , part of the VAT , in NAFLD is unclear. In the present study , we monitored the liver and four depots of the VAT in high fat diet ( HFD) feeding mice at multiple time points ( 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks). The MAT had become inflamed by the 8th week of HFD feeding , earlier than other depots of VAT. Furthermore , MAT removal after 8 weeks of HFD resulted in more severe steatosis and more foci of inflammation<symptom> infiltration , as well as higher NAFLD activity scores. Consistent with these findings , the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipid anabolism genes was increased in the livers of inflamed MAT removal mice. MAT removal also injured the intestinal barrier and promoted intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. The bacterial load translocated to the liver and circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide were also evaluated in inflamed MAT removal mice. In a co-culture experiment involving adipocytes and intestinal epithelial cells , mRNA expression of zonula occludens-1 ( ZO-1) and occludin in CT-26 cells was up-regulated , and permeability of monolayer Caco-2 cells was elevated under stimulation from adipocytes or inflamed adipocytes. Taken together , these results demonstrated that MAT removal damaged the intestinal barrier and aggravated NAFLD , and that MAT inflammation<symptom> may be a compensatory response to protect the liver by maintaining the intestinal barrier.
