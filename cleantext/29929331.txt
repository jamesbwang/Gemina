  The evidence of negative impacts of agricultural pesticides on non-target organisms is constantly growing. One of the most widely used group of pesticides are neonicotinoids , used in treatments of various plants , e.g. oilseed crops , corn and apples , to prevent crop damage by agricultural insect pests. Treatment effects have been found to spill over to non-target insects , such as bees , and more recently also to other animal groups , among them passerine birds. Very little is known , however , on the presence of neonicotinoids in other wild species at higher trophic levels. We present results on the presence of neonicotinoid residues in blood samples of a long-distant migratory food-specialist raptor , the European honey buzzard. Further , we investigate the spatial relationship between neonicotinoid residue prevalence in honey buzzards with that of crop fields where neonicotinoids are typically used. A majority of all blood samples contained neonicotinoids , thiacloprid accounting for most of the prevalence. While neonicotinoid residues were detected in both adults and nestlings , the methodological limit of quantification was exceeded only in nestlings. Neonicotinoids were present in all sampled nests. Neonicotinoid presence in honey buzzard nestlings ' blood matched spatially with the presence of oilseed plant fields. These are the first observations of neonicotinoids in a diurnal raptor. For better understanding the potential negative sub-lethal of neonicotinoids in wild vertebrates , new ( experimental) studies are needed.
