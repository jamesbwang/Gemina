  There was a varied spatial distribution of reported syphilis<disease> cases across cities in South China. This study aims to identify and describe spatiotemporal clusters of primary and secondary syphilis<disease> ( P/S) cases in this region. Reported syphilis<disease> cases in Guangdong Province , China , from January 2014 to June 2015 were collected from the national centralized reporting system. Spatiotemporal clusters of P/S were identified and cross-validated by calculating local Moran 's I , performing hotspot analysis ( Getis-Ord Gi *) , and constructing a discrete Poisson model in SaTScan. Reported cases within and outside the clusters were compared by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression. Out of 17,691 reported P/S cases , 11 % were in the identified spatiotemporal clusters. The monthly P/S notification rate ( per 100,000 persons) ranged between 0.6 and 1. The identified clusters were located in 14 , out of 126 , counties in eight , out of 21 , cities. Cases of older age , living in rural area and taking self-initiated syphilis<disease> test were more likely to be in the clusters. Some areas bore a greater burden of P/S in Guangdong Province. Routine spatiotemporal analysis of P/S cases may be useful for enhancing syphilis<disease> control programs by strategic location-based service planning.
