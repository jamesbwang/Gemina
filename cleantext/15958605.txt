  Preclinical optimization of compounds toward viable drug candidates requires an integrated understanding of properties that impact predictions of the clinically efficacious dose. The importance of optimizing half-life , unbound clearance , and potency and how they impact dose predictions are discussed in this letter. Modest half-life improvements for short half-life compounds can dramatically lower the efficacious dose. The relationship between dose and half-life is nonlinear when unbound clearance is kept constant , whereas the relationship between dose and unbound clearance is linear when half-life is kept constant. Due to this difference , we show that dose is more sensitive to changes in half-life than changes in unbound clearance when half-lives are shorter than 2 h. Through matched molecular pair analyses , we also show that the strategic introduction of halogens is likely to increase half-life and lower projected human dose even though increased lipophilicity does not guarantee extended half-life.
