  We examined associations between emotional exhaustion<symptom> and selected sociodemographic and psychological factors among nurses in inpatient and outpatient nursing units at a university hospital in South Korea. The participants were 386 nurses who completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory , a measure of emotional exhaustion<symptom>. Psychological characteristics were evaluated , including hardiness , self-esteem , experience of trauma , resilience , perceived stress , and social support. Correlation analyses examined the relationships between emotional exhaustion<symptom> with sociodemographic , occupational , and psychological characteristics. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between emotional exhaustion<symptom> and the assessed characteristics. Higher emotional exhaustion<symptom> scores were associated with greater depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , traumatic experience , and perceived stress. Exhaustion<symptom> was inversely associated with hardiness , self-esteem , resilience , and quality of life. The regression analysis indicated that gender , marriage , resilience , depression<symptom> , perceived stress , and secondary traumatic stress were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion<symptom>. This study showed that psychological characteristics , such as resilience , depression<symptom> , and secondary traumatic experiences , may cause emotional exhaustion<symptom>. Understanding the needs of people with distinct demographic and psychological characteristics offers valuable direction for the development of intervention programs to prevent burnout among nurses.
