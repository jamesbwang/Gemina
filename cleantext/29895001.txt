  Although social anxiety<symptom> disorder ( SAD) has an early onset and is frequently found in adolescence , evidence for psychotherapeutic treatments of SAD in adolescents is rather scarce. Within the Social Phobia Psychotherapy Research Network ( SOPHO-NET) , we examined the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral ( CBT) and psychodynamic therapy ( PDT) compared to a waiting list ( WL) in these patients. In a multicenter randomized controlled superiority trial , 107 patients , aged 14-20 years , were randomized to CBT ( n = 34) , PDT ( n = 34) , or WL ( n = 39). Assessments were made at baseline , at the end of treatment , and 6 and 12 months after termination. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents ( LSAS-CA) applied by raters masked to the treatment condition was used as the primary outcome. As secondary outcomes , rates of response and remission and the Social Phobia Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( SPAI) were used. Both treatments were superior to WL in the LSAS-CA ( CBT: p = 0.0112 , d = 0.61 , 95 % CI 0.14-1.08; PDT: p = 0.0261 , d = 0.53 , 95 % CI 0.06-1.00). At the end of treatment , response rates were 66 , 54 , and 20 % for CBT , PDT , and WL. The corresponding remission rates were 47 , 34 , and 6 % , respectively. CBT and PDT were significantly superior to WL regarding remission ( CBT: p = 0.0009 , h = 1.0; PDT: p = 0.0135 , h = 0.74) , response ( CBT: p = 0.0004 , h = 0.97; PDT: p = 0.0056 , h = 0.72) , and the SPAI ( CBT: p = 0.0021 , d = 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.27-1.22; PDT: p = 0.0060 , d = 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.19-1.13). Treatment effects were stable at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. These results are comparable to the large SOPHO-NET trial in adults ( n = 495). Early treatments for social anxiety<symptom> are needed in order to prevent chronic manifestation of SAD.
