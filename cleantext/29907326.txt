  Diabetic macroangiopathy is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Endothelial cell injury is a pathological precondition for diabetic macroangiopathy. Fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21) is a key metabolic regulator which has recently been suggested to protect cardiac myocytes and vascular cells against oxidative stress-induced injury in vitro and vivo. In this study , we aimed to investigate the protective capacity of FGF21 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) against high glucose ( HG)- induced apoptosis via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ protein kinase B ( PI3K/Akt)/ FoxO3a pathway. The cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay , Intracellular ROS levels were measured by the detection of the fluorescent product formed by the oxidation of DCFH-DA , Apoptosis was analyzed using Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining and Flow Cytometry Analysis ( FCA) , the expression of protein were detected by Western blot. Results show that pretreating HUVECs with FGF21 before exposure to HG increases cell viability , while decreasing apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis shows that HG reduces the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a , and induces nuclear localization of FoxO3a. The effects were significantly reversed by FGF21 pre-treatment. Furthermore , the protective effects of FGF21 were prevented by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Our data demonstrates that FGF21 protects HUVECs from HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis via the activation of PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway.
