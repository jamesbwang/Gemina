  Routine laboratory studies are often obtained following total hip arthroplasty ( THA). Moreover , laboratory studies are often continued daily until the patient is discharged regardless of medical management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of routine complete blood count ( CBC) tests following THA. Secondarily , the purpose was to identify patient factors associated with abnormal postoperative lab values. This retrospective review identified 352 patients who underwent primary THA at a single institution from 2012 to 2014. Preoperative and postoperative CBC values were collected along with demographic data , use of tranexamic acid ( TXA) , and transfusion rates. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with an abnormal postoperative lab and risk of transfusion. Of the 352 patients , 54 patients were transfused ( 15.3 %). Patients who underwent transfusion had a significantly lower preoperative hemoglobin ( Hb; 12.0 g/dL) compared to patients who did not undergo transfusion ( 13.5 g/dL; P < .001). Patients who did not receive TXA were 3.7 times more likely to receive a transfusion. No patients received medical intervention based on the outcome of postoperative platelet or white blood counts. A Hb value below 11.94 g/dL for patients who are anemic preoperative or did not receive TXA predicted transfusion after postoperative day 1. Under value-based care models , cost containment while maintaining high-quality patient care is critical. Routine postoperative CBC tests in patients with a normal preoperative Hb who receive TXA do not contribute to actionable information. Patients who are anemic before THA or do not receive TXA should at minimum obtain a CBC on postoperative day 1.
