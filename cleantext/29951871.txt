  In the present study , we used the human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of taraxasterol on vascular inflammation<symptom>. HUVECs were pre-treated with taraxasterol 1 h before lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) treatment. The concentrations of TNF-α , IL-8 , PGE2 , and NO were measured. The expression of VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , iNOS , COX-2 , NF-κB , and LXRα was detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that taraxasterol not only reduced the production of TNF-α , IL-8 , PGE2 , and NO induced by LPS , but also reduced the expression of iNOS and COX-2. Taraxasterol also suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore , taraxasterol concentration-dependently increased the expression of LXRα. The inhibition of taraxasterol on TNF-α , IL-8 , PGE2 , and NO production can be reversed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate ( GGPP , the LXRα inhibitor). Here , we found that taraxasterol inhibited vascular inflammation<symptom> through activating LXRα.
