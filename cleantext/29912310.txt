  Creating clear , visually pleasing 2D depictions of RNA and DNA strands and their interactions is important to facilitate and communicate insights related to nucleic acid structure. Here we present RiboSketch , a secondary structure image production application that enables the visualization of multistranded structures via layout algorithms , comprehensive editing capabilities , and a multitude of simulation modes. These interactive features allow RiboSketch to create publication quality diagrams for structures with a wide range of composition , size , and complexity. The program may be run in any web browser without the need for installation , or as a standalone Java application. https://binkley2.ncifcrf.gov/users/bindewae/ribosketch_web.
