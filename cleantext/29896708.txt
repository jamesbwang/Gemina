  Traditional toxicological screens based on the zebrafish model use observable phenotypic endpoints during their development to determine the toxicity of teratogens. Yet toxicity does not always translate to obvious phenotypic changes and the criteria used to score the toxicity of a teratogen are frequently subjected to human perception. The advancement in omics-based technologies has allowed us to quantitatively and objectively determine the toxicity of a teratogen based on biomolecular changes. The field of proteomics has been gaining popularity as a valuable tool in toxicology. Hence , in this chapter , we described a protocol for both label-free and label-based proteomic methods to analyse proteomic changes in both embryos and adult livers of zebrafish exposed to the teratogen TCDD ( tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) as an example.
