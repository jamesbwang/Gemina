  Despite the short-term and long-term health implications of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) , opinions are divided on selective vis-à-vis universal screening. We validated the accuracy of screening tests for GDM. Pregnant women ( n = 491) were recruited to this prospective , blind comparison with a gold standard study. We did selective screening between 13 and 20 weeks using reagent-strip glycosuria , random capillary blood glucose ( RBG) and the presence of ≥ 1 risk factor ( s). Between 20 and 34 weeks , we did universal screening following the ` one-step ' approach using glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) , fasting venous plasma glucose ( FPG) , and the 1-hour and the ` gold standard ' 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT). Tests accuracy was estimated following the WHO and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE) diagnostic criteria. Overall test performance was determined from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC). GDM prevalence per 2-hour OGTT was 9.0 % for the WHO criteria and 14.3 % for the NICE criteria. Selective screening using glycosuria , RBG and risk factors missed 97.4 % , 87.2 % and 45.7 % of cases , respectively. FPG threshold ≥ 5.1 mmol/L had the highest clinically relevant sensitivity ( 68 %) and specificity ( 81 %) , but FPG threshold ≥ 5.6 mmol/L had higher positive predictive value. Although sensitivity of 1-hour OGTT was 39.5 % , it had the highest accuracy and diagnostic OR. Regarding test performance , 1-hour OGTT and FPG were very good ( AUC > 0.8) , RBG was poor ( AUC ≈ 0.60) , whereas HbA1c was invaluable ( AUC < 0.5). Selective screening using glycosuria and random blood glucose is unnecessary due to its low sensitivity. Fasting glucose ≥ 5.1 mmol/L could be applicable for screening at the population level. Where 2-hour OGTT is not available , FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L , complemented by the presence of risk factors , could be useful in making therapeutic decision.
