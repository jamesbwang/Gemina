  The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm ( SLN-A) on the staging in high-risk endometrial cancer ( EC) compared to SLN plus selective lymphadenectomy ( S-LND). We retrospectively analyzed the database from a multicenter collaboration that included women with high risk features who underwent primary surgical staging. One-hundred and seventy-one women were identified ( 171) , 66 in the SLN-A and 105 in the S-LND group , respectively. Pelvic LD was performed on 115 patients ( 67.2 %) and aortic dissection was performed in 54/105 of the women in the S-LND group ( 51 %). The 5-year comparison did not show a significant difference in the strategy adopted for nodal staging , regarding disease-free survival ( DFS) ( HR: 0.82; 95 % CI 0.53-1.28; p = 0.390). In this study focusing on women with EC in the HR groups , we did not find a difference in the 5-year DFS when comparing the SLN-A strategy with S-LND. The SLN strategy did not seem to compromise the prognosis of patients with a higher risk of recurrence.
