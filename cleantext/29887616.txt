  There are only a few Doctors of Philosophy ( PhDs) in Biomedical Sciences from Pakistan and there are a number of misconceptions in our country regarding them. This may be due to a lack of knowledge regarding the existence of available programmes or a lack of will or interest in acquiring such a degree. While several PhD programmes exist all over the world , such programmes are lacking in our region even though the Higher Education Commission ( HEC) is trying to promote PhD through multiple means and resources. This review discusses the concepts of academicians and clinicians about a PhD , especially in Biomedical Sciences; importance of such a programme; whether Pakistan should have this programme; state of current PhD holders and companies that employ them in well-developed countries e.g. the United States of America. At the same time it also emphasises the need for supervisors to be interested in and promoting availability of PhD programmes , and recognising that there are very few qualified supervisors who have a research experience at an international level.
