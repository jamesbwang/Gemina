  This work examines the hypothesis that older workers ' responses to negative events at work depend , in part , on daily fluctuations of subjective age bias ( SAB; how old people feel compared to their actual age) and age group identification ( age GI). We tested whether SAB and age GI fluctuate over time , whether they influence attributions of negative daily work events as age-related , and thereby predict older workers ' daily affect and cognitive engagement in their work. A diary study with 169 older workers ( aged 50-70 years) demonstrates that there are substantial daily variations in SAB and GI. Daily fluctuations of SAB and age GI respectively predicted attributions of negative personal ( e.g. , forgetfulness) and social ( e.g. , social exclusion) work events to age. Age attributions , in turn , negatively predicted affect and daily cognitive engagement over and above event occurrence. In other words , when confronted with negative daily work events , the short-term dissociation from one 's chronological age and age group ( i.e. , feeling younger and identifying less with other older adults) seems to benefit older workers ' well-being.
