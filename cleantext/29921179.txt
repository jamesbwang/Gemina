  Promising Future in General Internal Medicine for the Next Generation of Physicians Abstract. We are facing a lack of specialists in general internal medicine in general practitioners ' practices as well as in hospitals , while at the same time the population ages and usually displays several chronic<disease> diseases<disease> ( multimorbidity). Thanks to more university places , an improved job description for general internal medicine and new further education offers ( curricula) , interest in general internal medicine increased again , as surveys of students indicate. The young generation of family doctors and generalists in hospitals wishes flexible working conditions in order to reconcile work , family and spare time in the best possible way. Working atmosphere and colleagues have a high priority. These wishes must now be incorporated into attractive further training with flexible curricula and mentoring offers so that young talents can successfully be promoted.
