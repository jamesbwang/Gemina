  Environmental change can result in substantial shifts in community composition. The associated immigration and extinction events are likely constrained by the spatial distribution of species. Still , studies on environmental change typically quantify biotic responses at single spatial ( time series within a single plot) or temporal ( spatial beta diversity at single time points) scales , ignoring their potential interdependence. Here , we use data from a global network of grassland experiments to determine how turnover responses to two major forms of environmental change- fertilisation and herbivore loss- are affected by species pool size and spatial compositional heterogeneity. Fertilisation led to higher rates of local extinction , whereas turnover in herbivore exclusion plots was driven by species replacement. Overall , sites with more spatially heterogeneous composition showed significantly higher rates of annual turnover , independent of species pool size and treatment. Taking into account spatial biodiversity aspects will therefore improve our understanding of consequences of global and anthropogenic change on community dynamics.
