  Chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) results from hematopoietic stem cell transformation by the In this work , we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry ( SOCE) and thrombin induced calcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells ( 32d-p210). The 32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression that could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced calcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells ( NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE blockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation rate in both 32d cell lines. TKI treatment slightly reduced the thrombin-induced response , but imatinib restored SOCE to the wild type level. Bcr-Abl is also known to deregulate Protein Kinase C ( PKC) , which was described to modulate calcium entries. We showed that PKC enhances SOCE and thrombin induced calcium entries in control cells while this effect is lost in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. The tyrosine kinase activity seems to regulate calcium entries probably not directly but through a global cellular reorganization involving a PKC pathway. Altogether , calcium entries are deregulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and could represent an interesting therapeutic target in combination with TKI.
