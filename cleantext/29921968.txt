  Invariant natural killer T1 ( iNKT1) cells are characterized by the preferential expression of T-box transcription factor T-bet ( encoded by Tbx21) and the production of cytokine IFN-γ , but the relationship between the developmental process and iNKT1 lineage diversification in the thymus remains elusive. We report in the present study a crucial role of programmed cell death 5 ( PDCD5) in iNKT cell terminal maturation and iNKT1 fate determination. Mice with T cell-specific deletion of PDCD5 had decreased numbers of thymic and peripheral iNKT cells with a predominantly immature phenotype and defects in response to α-galactosylceramide. Loss of PDCD5 also selectively abolished the iNKT1 lineage by reducing T-bet expression in iNKT cells at an early thymic developmental stage ( before CD44 upregulation). We further demonstrated that TOX2 , one of the high mobility group proteins that was highly expressed in iNKT cells at stage 1 and could be stabilized by PDCD5 , promoted the permissive histone H3K4me3 modification in the promoter region of Tbx21. These data indicate a pivotal and unique role of PDCD5/TOX2 in iNKT1 lineage determination. They also suggest that the fate of iNKT1 may be programmed at the developmental stage of iNKT cells in the thymus.
