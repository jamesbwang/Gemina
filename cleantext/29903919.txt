  Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive brain tumor , with a subpopulation of stem-like cells thought to mediate its recurring behavior and therapeutic resistance. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) inducing factor Zeb1 was linked to tumor initiation , invasion , and resistance to therapy in glioblastoma , but how Zeb1 functions at molecular level and what genes it regulates remain poorly understood. Contrary to the common view that EMT factors act as transcriptional repressors , here we show that genome-wide binding of Zeb1 associates with both activation and repression of gene expression in glioblastoma stem-like cells. Transcriptional repression requires direct DNA binding of Zeb1 , while indirect recruitment to regulatory regions by the Wnt pathway effector Lef1 results in gene activation , independently of Wnt signaling. Amongst glioblastoma genes activated by Zeb1 are predicted mediators of tumor cell migration and invasion , including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prex1 , whose elevated expression is predictive of shorter glioblastoma patient survival. Prex1 promotes invasiveness of glioblastoma cells
