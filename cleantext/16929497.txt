  The adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CD97/ADGRE5 is present in adherens junctions of human normal intestinal cells and upregulated in colorectal carcinomas. Here , we examined whether CD97 directly interacts with junctional proteins in normal and malignant colorectal tissue. We identified an association of CD97 with β-catenin using a proximity ligation assay and confirmed the interaction between both endogenous proteins at the biochemical level by co-immunoprecipitation in human and mouse tissues and cell lines. Glutathione S-transferase-pulldown revealed that CD97 binds β-catenin through its seven-span transmembrane/intracellular domain ( s). To study tumor-associated changes in the interaction of CD97 and β-catenin
