  Regulating energy transfer pathways through materials is a central goal of nanotechnology , as a greater degree of control is crucial for developing sensing , spectroscopy , microscopy , and computing applications. Such control necessitates a toolbox of actuation methods that can direct energy transfer based on user input. Here we introduce a proposal for a molecular exciton gate , analogous to a traditional transistor , for regulating exciton flow in chromophoric systems. The gate may be activated with an input of light or an input flow of excitons. Our proposal relies on excitation migration via the second excited singlet ( S
