  Mitochondria are important organelles for the adaptation to energy demand that play a central role in bioenergetics metabolism. The mitochondrial architecture and mitochondrial machinery exhibits a high degree of adaptation in relation to nutrient availability. On the other hand , its disruption markedly affects energy homeostasis. The brain , more specifically the hypothalamus , is the main hub that controls energy homeostasis. Nevertheless , until now , almost all studies in relation to mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism have focused in peripheral tissues like brown adipose tissue , muscle , and pancreas. In this review , we highlight the relevance of the hypothalamus and the influence on mitochondrial machinery in its function as well as its consequences in terms of alterations in both energy and metabolic homeostasis.
