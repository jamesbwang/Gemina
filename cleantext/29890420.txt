  Carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) could be directly used as metal-free catalysts for the reduction of nitroaromatics by sulfide in water , but their catalytic ability need a further improvement. This study evaluated the feasibility of surface modification through thermal and radiation pretreatments to enhance catalytic activity of CNTs on nitrobenzene reduction by sulfide. The results show that thermal treatment could effectively improve the catalytic behaviors of CNTs for the reduction of nitrobenzene by sulfide , where the optimum annealing temperature was 400 Â°C. However , plasma radiation pretreatment did n't result in an obvious improvement of the CNTs catalytic activity. Moreover , the possible reasons have been explored and discussed in the study. Additionally , the impacts of various operational parameters on nitrobenzene reduction catalyzed by the CNTs after an optimized surface modification were also evaluated. It was found that the rate of nitrobenzene removal by sulfide was positively correlated with CNTs doses in a range of 0.3-300 mg L
