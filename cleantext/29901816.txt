  Ketogenic diets reduce seizures<symptom> in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Whether adults benefit from similar treatment has not been clarified. We therefore examined the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We performed a randomized clinical trial ( RCT) with patients > 16 years who had at least 3 seizures<symptom> per month despite having tried at least 3 antiepileptic drugs. They were randomized to either 12 weeks on the modified Atkins diet ( diet group) or habitual diet ( control group). Primary endpoint was a change in seizure<symptom> frequency from baseline to the intervention period , comparing those on diet with controls. We assigned 37 patients to the diet group and 38 to the control group. Nine of the patients in the diet group and 4 controls were excluded. Of those who completed the dietary intervention ( n = 24) , median seizure<symptom> change was -1.0 ( interquartile range ( IQR) -13.7-8.8) , while in the control group ( n = 32) the median change was 4.5 ( IQR -4.8-33.5). The median difference between the groups was -7.0 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) -37.0-3.0; P = .21). In the intention-to-treat analysis , the relative risk ( RR) for achieving > 50 % seizure<symptom> reduction was 1.8 ( 95 % CI 0.3-10.2; P = .65) , while for achieving > 25 % seizure<symptom> reduction RR was 2.43 ( 95 % CI 0.94-6.28; P = .06). We observed no serious adverse events. In this RCT investigating the effect of an adjunctive modified Atkins diet on seizure<symptom> frequency in adults with difficult-to-treat focal epilepsy , we found a significant reduction in seizure<symptom> frequency in the diet group compared to the controls , but only for moderate benefit ( > 25 % seizure<symptom> reduction) among those who completed the intervention. However , seizure<symptom> response varied considerably between individuals , perhaps negatively influenced by a drop in serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs.
