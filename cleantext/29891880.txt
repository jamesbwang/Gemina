  This systematic literature review investigates factors impacting on clinicians ' decisions to offer genetic tests in their practice , and maps them to a theoretical behaviour change framework. Better understanding of these factors will inform the design of effective interventions to integrate genomics tests into clinical care. We conducted a narrative synthesis of empirical research of medical specialists ' perspectives on and experiences of offering genetic tests to their patients. This review was based upon the PRISMA statement and guidelines for reviewing qualitative research. Four electronic data sources were searched-MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PubMed. Studies were independently assessed by two authors. Content analysis was applied to map the findings of included studies to a framework validated for behaviour and implementation research , the Theoretical Domains Framework ( TDF). The TDF describes 14 factors known to influence behaviour and has been applied in diverse clinical settings to understand and/or modify health professional behaviour. Thirty-four studies published in 39 articles met inclusion and quality criteria. Most studies were published after 2011 ( 54 %) , Northern American ( 82 %) , quantitative in design ( 68 %) and addressed familial cancer genetic tests ( 53 %). Of the 14 TDF factors , 13 were identified. The three most common factors were: Environmental Context and Resources ( n = 33) , Beliefs about Consequences ( n = 26) , and Knowledge ( n = 23). To support the adoption of genomic tests beyond specialist services , nuanced interventions targeting considerations beyond clinician education are needed. For instance , interventions addressing organisational constraints which may restrict clinicians ' ability to offer genomic tests are required alongside those targeting factors intrinsic to the clinician.
