  Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates ( PCs) has been identified as the most prevalent transfusion-associated infectious risk. To prevent PC-related septic transfusion reactions , the Intercept Â® pathogen inactivation procedure was introduced for all PCs in Switzerland in 2011. Based on numbers of transfused units and mandatorily reported adverse events with high imputability , we compare the risks associated with transfusion of conventional PCs ( cPCs) and pathogen-inactivated PCs ( PI-PCs). From 2005 to 2011 , a total of 158,502 cPCs have been issued in Switzerland , and 16 transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections ( including 3 fatalities) were reported. This corresponds to a morbidity and mortality rate of ca. 1:9,900 and 1:52,800 , respectively. From 2011 to 2016 , a total of 205,574 PI-PCs have been issued , and no transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection was reported. Despite continuously increasing transfusion reaction rates per 1,000 RBC and plasma issued between 2008 and 2016 , we observed reductions of 66 % for life-threatening and fatal reactions and of 26 % for all high-imputability transfusion reactions related to PI-PCs as compared to cPCs. No increased rates of bleeding or clinical observations of ineffectiveness of PI-PCs have been reported. After implementation of PI-PCs , the annual increase in platelet usage per 1,000 inhabitants decelerated. Swiss hemovigilance data confirm a favorable safety profile of the nationwide introduced Intercept pathogen inactivation procedure and its reliable prevention of septic transfusion reactions and fatalities due to bacterially contaminated PCs.
