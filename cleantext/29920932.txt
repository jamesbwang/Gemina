  New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation ( NODAT) is a complication following solid organ transplantation ( SOT) and may be related to immune or inflammatory responses. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) within 158 immune- or inflammation-related genes contribute to NODAT in SOT recipients. The association between 263 SNPs and NODAT was investigated in a discovery sample of SOT recipients from the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study ( STCS , n
