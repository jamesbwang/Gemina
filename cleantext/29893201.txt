  Environmental enteric dysfunction ( EED) causes gut inflammation<symptom> and increased intestinal permeability leading to deficiencies in micronutrients such as zinc and iron. Fecal markers such as myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , neopterin ( NEO) , and alpha-1-anti-trypsin ( AAT) can predict EED. The aim of this study was to examine the association between fecal markers of EED with zinc and iron status among children at first 2 years of life. Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Study Bangladeshi birth cohort data were used to conduct this analysis. Multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations were performed to test the association between individual fecal markers with zinc or iron status of the children. A total of 265 children were enrolled in the study ( male: female = 1:1). Of the 627 stool<symptom> samples collected (
