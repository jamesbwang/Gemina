  The yellow leafy head of Brassica rapa is known to be tasty and nutritional. Therefore , the heading stage of leaf development is critical to realize high yield and economic benefits. A widely planted commercial cultivar of B. rapa ( ` Qiubao ' , deep yellow leafy head) was used to conduct transcriptome analysis. The results showed that the yellowing of the inner leaf was likely induced by the predominant Î²-carotene biosynthesis pathway due to the upregulated gene geranylgeranyl diphosphate and phytoene synthase , and the downregulated gene CrtL-e , NCED4 and DWARF-27. Some genes related to chlorophyll synthesis were also found to be downregulated , such as nitrate reductase , nitrite reductase , glutamine synthetase , glutamate synthase and protochlorophyllide reductase A. Transcript profiling also revealed strong changes in expression levels of hormonal genes related to auxin , cytokinin , ethylene , abscisic acid , gibberellin and brassinosteroids , suggesting the crucial role that hormones play in heading stage. Examination of carbohydrate and sucrose metabolism pathways revealed that sucrose biosynthesis is probably regulated by 6-phosphofructokinase and sucrose synthase 1 ( SUS1/SuSy1) branch , instead of the sucrose-phosphate synthase branch. Several cold-response genes were induced in the late-heading stage , but the results suggest that the common C-repeat binding factor responsive pathway may not be involved in cold adaption. We also identified a series of upregulated transcription factors-AP2/ ERF , MYB , bHLH , NAC and WRKY were found to be predominant. The transcripts analysis provides a preliminary genetic resource to unravel key genes and molecular mechanisms responsible for leafy head development in B. rapa , therefore , improving leafy head quality and yield through genetic means in future.
