  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease in which innate and adaptive immune cells act together to cause eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> , goblet cell metaplasia ( GCM) and bronchial hyperreactivity ( BHR). In clinical trials employing biologicals against interleukin ( IL) -4 Rα or IL-5 , only a subset of moderate-to-severe asthmatics responded favorably , suggesting that distinct pathophysiological mechanisms are at play in subgroups of patients , called endotypes. However , the effect of multiple cytokine blockade using bispecific antibodies ( Ab) has not been tested. To target simultaneously IL-4 , IL-13 and IL-5 signaling pathways with a novel IL-4Rα/ IL-5 bispecific Ab in a murine house dust mite ( HDM) model of asthma. Two monoclonal Abs neutralizing IL-4Rα and IL-5 were generated using a llama-based Ab platform. Their heavy ( HC) and light chains ( LC) where then co-transfected in mammalian cells , resulting in a heterogeneous Ab mixture from which the bispecific Ab was isolated using a dual anti-idiotypic purification process. C57BL/6J mice were finally sensitized and challenged to HDM extracts and treated during challenge with the Abs. We successfully generated and characterized the monospecific and bispecific Abs targeting IL-4Rα and IL-5. The monospecific Abs could suppress eosinophilia and/or IgE synthesis whereas only the IL-4Rα/ IL-5 bispecific Ab and the combination of monospecific Abs additionally inhibited GCM and BHR. Type 2 cytokines act synergistically to cause GCM and BHR in HDM-exposed mice.
