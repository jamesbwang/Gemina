  Overweight and obesity are important risk factors for diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , and premature death in modern society. Recently , numerous natural and synthetic compounds have been tested in diet-induced obese animal models , to counteract obesity. Melatonin is a circadian hormone , produced by pineal gland and extra-pineal sources , involved in processes which have in common a rhythmic expression. In teleost , it can control energy balance<symptom> by activating or inhibiting appetite-related peptides. The study aims at testing effects of melatonin administration to control-fed and overfed zebrafish , in terms of expression levels of orexigenic ( Ghrelin , orexin , NPY) and anorexigenic ( leptin , POMC) genes expression and morphometry of visceral and subcutaneous fat depots. Adult male zebrafish ( n = 56) were divided into four dietary groups: control , overfed , control + melatonin , overfed + melatonin. The treatment lasted 5 weeks and BMI levels of every fish were measured each week. After this period fishes were sacrificed; morphological and morphometric studies have been carried out on histological sections of adipose tissue and adipocytes. Moreover , whole zebrafish brain and intestine were used for qRT-PCR. Our results demonstrate that melatonin supplementation may have an effect in mobilizing fat stores , in increasing basal metabolism and thus in preventing further excess fat accumulation. Melatonin stimulates the anorexigenic and inhibit the orexigenic signals. It seems that adequate melatonin treatment exerts anti-obesity protective effects , also in a diet-induced obesity zebrafish model , that might be the result of the restoration of many factors: the final endpoint reached is weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and stabilization of weight gain.
