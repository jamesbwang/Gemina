  Additives play an important role in modifying the morphology and phase separation of donor and acceptor molecules in bulk heterojunction ( BHJ) solar cells. Here , we report triptycene ( TPC) as a small-molecule additive for supramolecular control of phase separation and concomitant improvement of the power conversion efficiency ( PCE) of PTB7 donor and fullerene acceptor-based BHJ polymer solar cells. An overall 60 % improvement in PCE is observed for both PTB7: PC
