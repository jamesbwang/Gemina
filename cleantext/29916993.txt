  The combination of AT1 blocker/neutroendopeptidase neprilysin inhibition ( ARNi) represents an interesting approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in hypertension. We assessed the efficacy of ARNi , compared with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade alone , on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and on protection from target organ damage development in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHRSP). In high-salt fed SHRSP , we assessed plasma and tissue natriuretic peptides , urinary volume , BP and body<symptom> weight over a short-term treatment ( 6 weeks) with either ARNi ( sacubitril/valsartan 68 mg/kg per day) or valsartan ( 30 mg/kg per day) , protection from stroke and renal damage ( as documented by proteinuria<symptom>) over 4 months of treatment with either sacubitril/valsartan or valsartan; the ability of either treatment to reduce progression of cerebrovascular and renal damage after 2 weeks of high-salt diet. Higher levels of plasma and tissue atrial natriuretic peptide , of urinary cyclic guanosine 3 ' 5 ` monophosphate and urine volumes , along with lower BP levels , were found upon sacubitril/valsartan as compared with valsartan over the short-term treatment. Sacubitril/valsartan caused a significant reduction of both BP and proteinuria<symptom> levels and complete prevention of stroke over the long-term treatment. Once organ damage was established , a significant delay of its progression was observed with sacubitril/valsartan. The dual angiotensin II type 1 receptor/neutroendopeptidase inhibition significantly increased atrial natriuretic peptide level and reduced BP. Complete prevention of stroke was achieved in this model. The ability of sacubitril/valsartan to reduce organ damage progression was superior to that of valsartan alone. ARNi may represent a highly effective therapeutic agent to protect from target organ damage development in hypertension.
