  Genotype 1 of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) is the most prevalent worldwide. Pegylated-interferon and ribavirin therapy is still used in the developing world but has less efficiency in this genotype. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) rs12979860 and rs8099917 ( IL28B) and rs1800896 , rs1800871 , and rs1800872 ( IL10) are related to treatment outcome , but previous studies clustered nonresponse and relapse patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the frequency of those SNPs in HCV<pathogen> genotype 1 for response , nonresponse , or relapse. Patients were classified according to treatment outcome. Genomic DNA was extracted by blood samples and SNPs were defined by PCR and sequencing. Data analysis was performed with R project. The frequency of rs12979860 CC was similar among responders ( 0.48) and relapsers ( 0.46) and lower among nonresponders ( 0.18). The same trend was observed for rs8099917 TT. rs12979860 CC showed a protective effect for relapsers compared to nonresponders ( OR = 0.25) as it occurs with responders ( OR = 0.17). Haplotypes 12979860/C rs8099917/T were associated with protection against the nonresponder phenotype compared to responders ( OR = 0.27) or relapsers ( OR = 0.37). Frequency of rs12979860 and rs8099917 is different between relapsers and nonresponders , but similar between relapsers and responders.
