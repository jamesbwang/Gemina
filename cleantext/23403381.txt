  A first step to offer community-dwelling older persons proactive care is to identify those at risk of functional decline within a year. This study investigates the predictive value of registered information , questionnaire and GP-opinion on functional decline. In this cohort study , embedded within the ISCOPE-trial , participants ( â‰¥ 75 years) completed the ISCOPE-screening questionnaire on four health domains. GPs gave their opinion on vulnerability of participants. Functional status was measured at baseline and 12 months ( Groningen Activities Restriction Scale ( GARS)). The outcome was functional decline ( death , nursing home admission , 10 % with greatest functional decline). The predictive value of pre-selected variables ( age , sex , polypharmacy , multimorbidity , living situation; GPs ' opinion on vulnerability , number of domains with problems ( ISCOPE-score)) was compared with the area under the curves ( AUC) for logistic regression models. 2018 of the 2211 participants ( median age 82.1 years ( IQR 78.8-86.5) , 68.0 % female , median GARS 31 ( IQR 24-41)) were visited at 12 months ( median GARS 34 ( IQR 26-44)). 394 participants ( 17.8 %) had functional decline ( 148 died , 45 nursing home admissions , 201 with greatest functional decline). The AUC for age and sex was 0.602 , increasing to 0.620 ( p = 0.029) with polypharmacy , multimorbidity and living situation. The GPs ' opinion added more ( AUC 0.672 , p < 0.001) than the ISCOPE-score ( AUC 0.649 , p = 0.007). AUC with all variables was 0.686 ( p = 0.016) , and 0.643 for GPs ' opinion alone. The GPs ' opinion and ISCOPE-score improve this prediction model for functional decline based on readily available variables. GPs could identify older patients for further assessment with their clinical judgement. Netherlands trial register , NTR1946. Registered 10 August 2009.
