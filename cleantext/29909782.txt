  Microscopic myringoplasty is the most frequently performed procedure for repairing tympanic membrane perforations. The endoscopic transcanal approach bypasses the narrow ear canal segment and provides a wider view. An open-label randomised clinical trial was conducted on 56 patients with small anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Perforations were repaired with an endoscopic push-through technique ( n = 28) or a microscopic underlay technique ( n = 28). Follow up was conducted using endoscopic examination and pure tone audiometry three months ' post-operatively. Graft success rate was 92.9 per cent in the endoscopic group versus 85.7 per cent in the microscopic group. The corresponding pre-operative mean air-bone gaps were 17.4 dB and 18.5 dB , improving to 6.1 dB and 9.3 dB post-operatively ( p > 0.05). Mean air-bone gap closure was 11.4 dB in the endoscopic group and 9.2 dB in the microscopic group ( p > 0.05). Mean operative time and estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> were 37.0 minutes and 29 ml in the endoscopic group , versus 107 minutes and 153 ml in the microscopic group ( both p < 0.05). The endoscopic push-through technique for anterior tympanic membrane perforations is as effective as microscopic underlay myringoplasty; furthermore , it is less invasive and takes less operative time.
