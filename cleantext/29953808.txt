  Cancer cells rely on the chaperone heat shock<symptom> protein 70 ( Hsp70) for survival and proliferation. Recently , benzothiazole rhodacyanines have been shown to bind an allosteric site on Hsp70 , interrupting its binding to nucleotide-exchange factors ( NEFs) and promoting cell death in breast cancer cell lines. However , proof-of-concept molecules , such as JG-98 , have relatively modest potency ( EC
