  Marine cone snails are a large family of gastropods that have evolved highly potent venoms for predation and defense. The cone snail venom has exceptional molecular diversity in neuropharmacologically active compounds , targeting a range of receptors , ion channels , and transporters. These conotoxins have helped to dissect the structure and function of many of these therapeutically significant targets in the central and peripheral nervous systems , as well as unravelling the complex cellular mechanisms modulated by these receptors and ion channels. This review provides an overview of & alpha;- conotoxins targeting neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The structure and activity of both classical and non-classical & alpha;- conotoxins are discussed , along with their contributions towards understanding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR) structure and function.
