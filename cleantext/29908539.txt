  Antioxidant , antimicrobial , anti-hyperglycaemic , anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects of Allium cepa ( A. cepa) have been previously shown. In this study , the effects of A. cepa aqueous-alcoholic extract on tracheal responsiveness , lung inflammatory cells and phospholipase A2 ( PLA2) level in bronchoalveolar fluid ( BALF) of asthmatic rats were examined. Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group ( C) , asthmatic group ( A) , asthmatic group ( A) treated with A. cepa extract ( AC , 0.175 , 0.35 , and 0.7 mg/mL) and dexamethasone ( D , 1.25 μg/mL). The extract of A. cepa and dexamethasone were added to animal 's drinking water during sensitization period. Tracheal responsiveness to methacholine and ovalbumin , lung inflammatory cells and PLA2 level in BALF were assessed. Tracheal responsiveness to methacholine and ovalbumin , PLA2 level , total and most differential WBC count were increased but lymphocytes was decreased in asthmatic animals compared to group C ( p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Treatment of sensitized rats with dexamethasone and all concentrations of A. cepa lead to a significant decrease in total WBC and PLA2 level compared to asthmatic group ( p < 0.001). The two higher concentrations of A. cepa also significantly decreased tracheal responsiveness , neutrophil and eosinophil counts but led to a significant increase in lymphocytes count compared to asthmatic group ( p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Treatment of sensitized group with the highest concentration of A. cepa also significantly reduced monocyte count compared to asthmatic group ( p < 0.001). Anti-inﬂammatory and preventive effects of A. cepa on tracheal responsiveness and lung inflammation<symptom> in asthmatic animals may suggest its potential therapeutic effect on airway diseases such as asthma.
