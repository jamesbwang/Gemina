  Across the international dairy industry , the vast majority of dairy herds have dehorned cows. Farmers choose to dehorn calves for different reasons such as easier handling of non-horned cattle and reduced risk of injuries in animals and staff. This review focuses on disbudding by use of hot-iron cautery as is practiced by dairy farmers in calves < 3 months of age. We examine welfare effects of the use of NSAIDs in combination with a local anesthetic including indicators relevant for the three major welfare concerns-affective states , basic health , and functioning as well as the possibility to behave naturally. Across indicators of animal welfare , the majority of available evidence suggest that the use of NSAIDs in combination with a local anesthetic is advantageous in terms of animal welfare , and no studies suggest that NSAIDs are a disadvantage to animal welfare. However , irrespective of the welfare concern , use of NSAIDs combined with a local anesthetic does not fully eliminate the welfare challenges from disbudding. Further research is needed in order to fully understand the effects of this medication protocol on calf welfare , including knowledge about the duration of healing and the presence of long-term pain. At present , this lack of knowledge challenges the precise formulation of adequate pain management-in terms of medication protocol , duration , dosage , and type of administration.
