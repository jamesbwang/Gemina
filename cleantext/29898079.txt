  Normal pressure hydrocephalus<symptom> ( NPH) , described by Hakim and Adams in 1965 , is characterized by gait apraxia , urinary incontinence , and dementia. It is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) pressure and ventricular dilation that can not be attributed to cerebral atrophy. To evaluate gait characteristics in patients with idiopathic NPH and investigate the effect of the CSF tap test ( CSF-TT) on gait. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with probable idiopathic NPH were submitted to the CSF-TT. The procedure aimed to achieve changes in gait parameters. Fifteen gait parameters were assessed before and after the CSF-TT. Five showed a statistically significant improvement ( p < 0.05): walking speed ( p < 0.001) , cadence ( p < 0.001) , step length ( p < 0.001) , en bloc turning ( p = 0.001) , and step height ( p = 0.004). This study demonstrated that gait speed was the most responsive parameter to the CSF-TT , followed by cadence , step length , en bloc turning , and step height.
