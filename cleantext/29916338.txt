  In the actual context of terrorism targeting children and families , it seems essential to describe different experiences of pediatric psychological emergency devices after such unexpected mass trauma. Here we testify our experience of the psychological emergency care setup dedicated to children and families during the first 48 hours after the terrorist attack of Nice , France , on July 14 , 2016. Activated within the hour following the attack , the device included two child psychiatry teams turning over each day , receiving at least 163 individuals ( 99 children and 64 adults) within the first 2 days.
