  While thyroid is considered to be a dormant organ , when required , it can regenerate through increased cell proliferation. However , the mechanism for regeneration remains unknown. Nkx2-1 ( fl/fl); TPO-cre mouse thyroids exhibit a very disorganized appearance because their thyroids continuously degenerate and regenerate. In mouse thyroids , a cluster of cells are found near the tracheal cartilage and muscle , which are positive for expression of NKX2-1 , the master transcription factor governing thyroid development and function. In the present study , we propose that this cluster of NKX2-1-positive cells may be the precursor cells that mature to become thyroid follicular cells , forming thyroid follicles. We also found that phosphorylation of AKT is induced by NKX2-1 in the proposed thyroid progenitor-like side-population cell-derived thyroid cell line ( SPTL) cells , suggesting the possibility that NKX2-1 plays a role in differentiation through the modulation of AKT signaling. This study revealed that Nkx2-1 ( fl/fl); TPO-cre mice provide a suitable model to study in vivo regeneration and folliculogenesis of the thyroid.
