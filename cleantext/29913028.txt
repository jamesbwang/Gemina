  Neonatal compartment syndrome<disease> is rare. There are multiple proposed etiologies , including infection , vascular insult , and mechanical compression. Much like compartment syndrome<disease> in adults , delayed surgical intervention for neonatal compartment syndrome<disease> can have catastrophic results. The authors present a unique case of a neonate who presented with left forearm and hand swelling and skin ulceration after vaginal delivery. Findings from the evaluation for vascular injury , infection , and hypercoagulability were normal. The neonate was diagnosed with compartment syndrome<disease> and underwent decompressive fasciotomy of the forearm flexor and extensor compartments as well as hand intrinsic and thenar compartments within the first 24 hours of life. At 5 years old , the patient had progressive radial clubbing and a 41-mm limb length discrepancy due to growth arrest at the distal radial physis. A radial distraction osteogenesis was then performed. Postoperatively , the patient continues to improve her range of motion and strength through rehabilitation. ( Orthopedics. 201x; xx ( x): xx-xx.).
