  Clinical guidance is needed to initiate , continue , and discontinue drug treatments near the end of life. To identify drugs and drug classes most often adequate , questionable , or inadequate for older people at the end of life. Delphi consensus survey. Forty European experts in geriatrics , clinical pharmacology , and palliative medicine from 10 different countries. Panelists were asked to characterize drug classes as `` often adequate , '' `` questionable , '' or `` often inadequate '' for use in older adults aged 75 years or older with an estimated life expectancy of ≤ 3 months. We distinguished the continuation of a drug class that was previously prescribed from the initiation of a new drug. Consensus was considered achieved for a given drug or drug class if the level of agreement was ≥ 75 %. The expert panel reached consensus on a set of 14 drug classes deemed as `` often adequate , '' 28 drug classes deemed `` questionable , '' and 10 drug classes deemed `` often inadequate '' for continuation during the last 3 months of life. Regarding the initiation of new drug treatments , the panel reached consensus on a set of 10 drug classes deemed `` often adequate , '' 23 drug classes deemed `` questionable , '' and 23 drug classes deemed `` often inadequate ''. Consensus remained unachieved for some very commonly prescribed drug treatments ( e.g. , proton-pump inhibitors , furosemide , haloperidol , olanzapine , zopiclone , and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). In the absence of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials , these consensus-based criteria provide guidance to rationalize drug prescribing for older adults near the end of life.
