  A possible approach to enhance the performance of microbial electrochemical system such as microbial fuel cells is to increase the conductivity of catalytic biofilms and thereby the direct extracellular electron transfer within the biofilms and from the electrode. In the present study , we evaluated the impact of static low-intensity magnetic field on the anodic biofilms in microbial fuel cells ( MFCs). Results demonstrated that the application of a low-intensity magnetic field ( 105 and 150 mT) can significantly shorten the startup time and enhance the overall performance of single-chamber MFCs in terms of current density ( 300 %) and power density ( 150 %). In situ conductance evaluation indicated that short-term application of magnetic field can increase biofilm conductivity , although the long-term enhancements were likely results of increased conductivity of the anodic biofilms associated with enriched population of Geobacteraceae. The peak-manner response of conductivity over gate potentials and the positive response of mature biofilm conductance to low intensity of magnetic field support the redox conduction model of the conductive exoelectrogenic biofilms.
