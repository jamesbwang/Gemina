  This paper explores the behaviours and meanings associated with intimacy and sexuality among older adults with diverse partners living in subsidised senior housing. It utilises survey and qualitative data from a mixed methods of ageing/HIV exposure to illustrate gendered views on sexual and intimate behaviours , and attitudes towards transactional/commercial sex. Data suggest that women were cautious about engaging in intimate relationships , while men sought them and the companionship they provided to address loneliness. Reasons for non-intimacy were age and health problems. Generally speaking , both men and women had positive attitudes towards sex. Men took risks by having multiple partners and using condoms irregularly; women believed they could avoid risks by taking time to get to know their partners , but never used condoms. Forty per cent of men who saw sex workers were not regular condom users. They traded risk of gossip , violence and infection for companionship with women seeking money and physical safety. Findings have implications for policies , counselling and interventions for older sexually active adults in institutional and residential settings.
