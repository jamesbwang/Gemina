  Polyamines have been implicated in numerous biological processes , including inflammation<symptom> and carcinogenesis. Homeostatic regulation leads to interconversion of the polyamines putrescine and the downstream metabolites spermidine and spermine. The enzyme spermine oxidase ( SMOX) , which back-converts spermine to spermidine , contributes to regulation of polyamine levels , but can also have other effects. We have implicated SMOX in gastric inflammation<symptom> and carcinogenesis due to infection by the pathogen
