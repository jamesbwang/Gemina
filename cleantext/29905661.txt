  The aim of this work was to investigate the association between traumatic experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) with the academic performance of university students. This is a one-phase study that included 2213 students , enrolled at one of seven college institutions in their first or final semesters in all programs , who filled out the self-response questionnaires. From this student population , 14 % presented with PTSD , with 13.3 % in their first semester and 14.9 % in their final semester. The students who presented lower academic results ( low scoring) had a higher prevalence of PTSD in both the first and final semesters. Nonsexual violence was related with low scoring in the first-semester students. Thus , we conclude that students in the PTSD group present worse academic performance. These results indicate a need to pay attention to students who have been through traumatic experiences and gone on to develop PTSD , to ensure their undergraduate success and enable their future performance as professionals.
