  This study aims to develop a straightforward , sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method to quantify 15 eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid in human plasma. Tert-Butyl methyl ether was used on the liquid-liquid extraction method and significantly reduced the expense and time. The method showed excellent linearity for all analytes , with regression coefficients higher than 0.99 over a wide range of concentrations from 0.01 ng mL
