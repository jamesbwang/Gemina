  In muscle , but not in single-molecule mechanics studies , actin , myosin and accessory proteins are incorporated into a highly ordered myofilament lattice. In view of this difference we compare results from single-molecule studies and muscle mechanics and analyze to what degree data from the two types of studies agree with each other. There is reasonable correspondence in estimates of the cross-bridge power-stroke distance ( 7 ⁻ 13 nm) , cross-bridge stiffness ( ~ 2 pN/nm) and average isometric force per cross-bridge ( 6 ⁻ 9 pN). Furthermore , models defined on the basis of single-molecule mechanics and solution biochemistry give good fits to experimental data from muscle. This suggests that the ordered myofilament lattice , accessory proteins and emergent effects of the sarcomere organization have only minor modulatory roles. However , such factors may be of greater importance under e.g. , disease conditions. We also identify areas where single-molecule and muscle data are conflicting: ( 1) whether force generation is an Eyring or Kramers process with just one major power-stroke or several sub-strokes; ( 2) whether the myofilaments and the cross-bridges have Hookean or non-linear elasticity; ( 3) if individual myosin heads slip between actin sites under certain conditions , e.g. , in lengthening; or ( 4) if the two heads of myosin cooperate.
