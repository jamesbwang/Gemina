  Exopolysaccharide ( EPS) of two benthic diatoms , Amphora sp. and Stauroneis sp. , with different biofilm formation abilities were investigated. The ratio of suspension-cells/biofilm-cells was employed to indicate the diatom biofilm formation abilities. The soluble EPS from the supernatant of whole culture , tightly bound EPS from floating cells , loosely and tightly bound EPS from biofilm cells were fractionated as SL-EPS , F-TB-EPS , BF-LB-EPS and BF-TB-EPS , respectively. The analysis for productions and monosaccharide compositions indicated that EPS from two diatoms were different in terms of the productions , distributions , and monomer compositions. Amphora sp. produced more ( 1.5-fold) total exopolysaccharides , but less ( < 0.4-fold) BF-TB-EPS than Stauroneis sp.. The monosaccharides of the EPS from Amphora sp. were more diverse than those of Stauroneis sp. , with 13 and 10 monomers , respectively. Neutral sugars , Glc , Xyl and Man , were abundant in Stauroneis sp. , while Gal , Glc and Xyl were rich in Amphora sp.. Uronic acid and hexosamine were present in all fractions of two diatoms , especially Glc-A being the most abundant monomer in SL-EPS of Amphora sp.. It was proposed that the high content of uronic acid ( especially Glc-A) might be crucial for the strong biofilm formation abilities of Amphora sp..
