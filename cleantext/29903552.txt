  First-line nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin was associated with a significantly improved overall response rate ( primary endpoint) versus paclitaxel/carboplatin in a phase III trial of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). We report the results of an analysis evaluating the correlation of response and the time to response with survival and quality-adjusted outcomes. Using a landmark approach , progression-free survival ( PFS) , overall survival ( OS) , and quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity ( Q-TWiST) were compared between patients with a confirmed partial or complete response at or before 6 weeks ( ≤ 6-week responders) and those without ( ≤ 6-week nonresponders). The outcomes were also analyzed in two 12-week landmark analyses: ≤ 12-week responders versus ≤ 12-week nonresponders and early responders ( ≤ 6 weeks) versus late responders ( 6-12 weeks) versus ≤ 12-week nonresponders. The median OS and PFS for the ≤ 6-week responders versus ≤ 6-week nonresponders were 14.5 versus 10.3 months ( P < .001) and 5.5 versus 4.5 months ( P = .002) , respectively. The ≤ 6-week responders gained 2.1 months of mean Q-TWiST. The median OS and PFS for the ≤ 12-week responders versus ≤ 12-week nonresponders were 16.3 versus 8.4 months and 5.3 versus 2.8 months ( both P < .001) , respectively , and the ≤ 12-week responders gained 3.2 months of mean Q-TWiST. The median OS was 13.1 , 16.6 , and 8.4 months ( P < .001) , the median PFS was 4.1 , 6.7 , and 2.8 months ( P < .001) , and the mean Q-TWiST was 10.2 , 11.7 , and 7.8 months for the early responders , late responders , and ≤ 12-week nonresponders , respectively. Both early and late responders had significantly longer Q-TWiST compared with the ≤ 12-week nonresponders ( difference , +2.4 and +3.9 months , respectively; P < .05). These results underscore response as an important surrogate for assessment of long-term treatment outcomes in advanced NSCLC.
