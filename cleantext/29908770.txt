  To measure in vitro fertilization ( IVF) outcomes following 24-chromosome single nucleotide-polymorphism ( SNP)- based preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy ( PGT-A) and euploid embryo transfer. Retrospective. Fertility clinics and laboratory. Women 20-46 years of age undergoing IVF treatment. Twenty-four-chromosome SNP-based PGT-A of day 5/6 embryo biopsies. Maternal age-stratified implantation , clinical pregnancy , and live birth rates per embryo transfer; miscarriage rates; and number of embryo transfers per patient needed to achieve a live birth. An implantation rate of 69.9 % , clinical pregnancy rate per transfer of 70.6 % , and live birth rate per transfer of 64.5 % were observed in 1,621 nondonor frozen cycles with the use of SNP-based PGT-A. In addition , SNP-based PGT-A outcomes , when measured per cycle with transfer , remained relatively constant across all maternal ages; when measured per cycle initiated , they decreased as maternal age increased. Miscarriage rates were ∼ 5 % in women ≤ 40 years old. No statistically significant differences in pregnancy outcomes were found for single-embryo transfers ( SET) versus double-embryo transfers with SNP-based PGT-A. On average , 1.38 embryo transfers per patient were needed to achieve a live birth in nondonor cycles. Our findings that SNP-based PGT-A can mitigate the negative effects of maternal age on IVF outcomes in cycles with transfer , and that pregnancy outcomes from SET cycles are not significantly different from those of double-embryo transfer cycles , support the use of SET when transfers are combined with SNP-based PGT-A.
