  Our objective is to compare the clinical to the pathologic stage in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Review of a prospective database from one surgeon. Patients had NSCLC , chest tomography ( CT) and most had positron emissions tomography ( PET). Those with suggested N1 , N2 , central tumors and/or tumors > 5 cm underwent mediastinoscopy and/or endobronchial ultrasound and , if N2 negative , underwent resection with complete thoracic lymphadenectomy. Between January 2006 and December 2016 , there were 1,444 consecutive patients. The sensitivity and specificity for CT was: 76 % and 79 % for pathologic stage I , 48 % and 89 % for stage II and 58 % and 88 % for stage III. The sensitivity and specificity for PET was: 77 % and 70 % for pathologic stage I , 43 % and 88 % for stage II and 46 % and 93 % for stage III. Pathologic N1 disease was proven in 7 % of patients and missed in 4 % by CT , 5 % by PET , and 3 % by both. Pathologic N2 disease was proven in 20 % of patients and missed in 9 % by CT , 10 % by PET , and 8 % by both. Ten percent of clinically stage I patients and 21 % of clinically stage II patients had occult N2 disease. Independent predictors of occult N1 disease included high SUV Despite advancements in CT , PET and minimally invasive nodal biopsy , there remains significant NSCLC mis-staging , especially for N2 disease. Improved , targeted N2 lymph node biopsy may improve pre-resection staging.
