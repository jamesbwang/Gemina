  Owing to the lack of databases of blood flow distributions in the external carotid branches , surgeons currently rely on per-operative imaging and on their experience to choose the recipient vessels for microsurgical facial reconstructions. But , thanks to three-dimensional phase contrast angiography ( PCA) and kinematic CINE phase contrast ( PC) sequences , MRI technologies have the potential to provide quantitative anatomical and hemodynamic information without injection of contrast agent. Having developed and optimized PC-MRI sequences for the small facial vessels , our objective was to investigate the haemodynamic and blood flow distribution in the external carotid branches. We included 31 healthy volunteers in an MRI prospective study. Two-dimensional CINE PC-MRI sequences ( average duration time of 2 min 40 s ± 24 s) were performed in the external carotid collaterals ( n = 290). A statistical analysis of the flow measurements showed that , despite large interpersonal variabilities , a general flow distribution pattern was obtained by dividing the vessel flow rates by the external carotid artery one ( providing local percentages of the incoming flow). The vessels could then be classified in three haemodynamic groups ( p < 0.05 Student 's test): `` low flow '' group ( lingual artery-12.5 ± 5 % of incoming flow) , `` intermediate flow '' group ( superior thyroid artery-16.5 ± 10 % , internal maxillary artery-20.5 ± 11 % , superficial temporal artery-18.4 ± 6 %) , `` high flow '' group ( facial artery -26.6 ± 10 %). Thanks to this general flow distribution mapping , it is now possible to estimate the flow rates in the distal branches of any individual from a single blood flow measurement in the external carotid artery.
