  Despite limited indications , preoperative stress testing is often used prior to non-cardiac surgery. Patient-level analyses of stress testing and outcomes are limited by case mix and selection bias. Therefore , we sought to describe facility-level rates of preoperative stress testing for non-cardiac surgery , and to determine the association between facility-level preoperative stress testing and postoperative major adverse cardiac events ( MACE). We identified patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery within 2 years of percutaneous coronary intervention in the Veterans Affairs ( VA) Health Care System , from 2004 to 2011 , facility-level rates of preoperative stress testing and postoperative MACE ( death , myocardial infarction ( MI) or revascularisation within 30 days). We determined risk-standardised facility-level rates of stress testing and postoperative MACE , and the relationship between facility-level preoperative stress testing and postoperative MACE. Among 29937 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery at 131 VA facilities , the median facility rate of preoperative stress testing was 13.2 % ( IQR 9.7 % -15.9 %; range 6.0 % -21.5 %) , and 30-day postoperative MACE was 4.0 % ( IQR 2.4 % -5.4 %). After risk standardisation , the median facility-level rate of stress testing was 12.7 % ( IQR 8.4 % -17.4 %) and postoperative MACE was 3.8 % ( IQR 2.3 % -5.6 %). There was no correlation between risk-standardised stress testing and composite MACE at the facility level ( r = 0.022 , p = 0.81) , or with individual outcomes of death , MI or revascularisation. In a national cohort of veterans undergoing non-cardiac surgery , we observed substantial variation in facility-level rates of preoperative stress testing. Facilities with higher rates of preoperative stress testing were not associated with better postoperative outcomes. These findings suggest an opportunity to reduce variation in preoperative stress testing without sacrificing patient outcomes.
