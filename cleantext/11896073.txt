  We aimed to identify predictive clinicoradiologic characteristics of thymidylate synthase ( TS) expression status in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. We reviewed clinicoradiologic features of 169 patients stratified into TS-negative ( n = 84) and TS-positive ( n = 85) groups , including quantitative CT radiomic features of both primary lung and metastatic lesions<symptom> from initial CT and PET. Clinical factors including age and smoking history were significantly associated with TS as well as radiomic features. The predictive performance for dichotomizing TS expression status was slightly higher when imaging features of primary lung lesions<symptom> were added compared to the model based solely on the clinical features , but without statistical significance ( 10-fold cross-validated AUC = 0.619 and 0.581 , respectively; P = 0.425). The predictive performance of clinicoradiologic parameters slightly increased with primary lung lesions<symptom> only compared to the inclusion of metastatic lesions<symptom> , but without statistical significance ( 10-fold cross-validated AUC = 0.619 and 0.554 , respectively; P = 0.203). Overall survival was prolonged in the TS-negative group compared to the TS-positive group ( P = 0.001). TS-negativity is a potential prognostic biomarker , and our study presents that although CT radiomic features have potential for predicting TS expression status , clinical significance is uncertain. The addition of radiomic features to clinical factors did not show significant improvement in predicting TS-negativity.
