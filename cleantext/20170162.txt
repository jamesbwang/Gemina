  In the present work , the potential for rapid , targeted analysis of hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls ( OH-PCBs) in diluted human blood plasma using liquid chromatography coupled with trapped ion mobility spectrometry and TOF high resolution mass spectrometry ( LC-TIMS-TOF MS) was evaluated. Experimental OH-PCB collisional cross section ( CCS
