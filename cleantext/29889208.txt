  Single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( smFISH) is a powerful technique to study gene expression in single cells due to its ability to detect and count individual RNA molecules. Complementary to deep sequencing-based methods , smFISH provides information about the cell-to-cell variation in transcript abundance and the subcellular localization of a given RNA. Recently , we have used smFISH to study the expression of the gene NDC80 during meiosis in budding yeast , in which two transcript isoforms exist and the short transcript isoform has its entire sequence shared with the long isoform. To confidently identify each transcript isoform , we optimized known smFISH protocols and obtained high consistency and quality of smFISH data for the samples acquired during budding yeast meiosis. Here , we describe this optimized protocol , the criteria that we use to determine whether high quality of smFISH data is obtained , and some tips for implementing this protocol in other yeast strains and growth conditions.
