  We present a fully continuous chip microreactor-based multistage platform for the synthesis of quantum dots with heterostructures. The use of custom-designed chip reactors enables precise control of heating profiles and flow distribution across the microfluidic channels while conducting multistep reactions. The platform can be easily reconfigured by reconnecting the differently designed chip reactors allowing for screening of various reaction parameters during the synthesis of nanocrystals. III-V core/shell quantum dots are chosen as model reaction systems , including InP/ZnS , InP/ZnSe , InP/CdS and InAs/InP , which are prepared in flow using a maximum of six chip reactors in series.
