  The study purpose was to describe dietary intake and the factors influencing micronutrient supplements ( MS) use in Celiac Disease ( CD) ± Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D). Three-day food records collected from parents of youth ( 3-18 years) with CD ( n = 14) ± T1D ( n = 10) were assessed for macro and micronutrient intake , diet quality ( DQ) , glycemic index ( GI) , glycemic load ( GL) , and food group intake. Focus group methodology and thematic concept analysis were conducted to determine factors influencing adolescent MS use. Mean ± SD age was 11 ± 4.4 ( CD) and 13 ± 3.7 ( CD + T1D) ( P = 0.32). Body mass index was within healthy reference ranges ( 17.9 ± 2.5 ( CD); 19.3 ± 3.8 ( CD + T1D) kg/m
