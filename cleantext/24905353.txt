  Some plant growth-promoting bacteria encode for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate ( ACC) deaminase , which facilitates plant growth and development by lowering the level of stress ethylene under waterlogged conditions. The substrate ACC is the immediate precursor for ethylene synthesis in plants; while bacterial ACC deaminase hydrolyzes this compound into Î±-ketobutyrate and ammonia<pathogen> to mitigate the adverse effects of the stress caused by ethylene exposure. Here , the structure and function of ACC deaminase , ethylene biosynthesis and waterlogging response , waterlogging and its consequences , role of bacterial ACC deaminase under waterlogged conditions , and effect of this enzyme on terrestrial and riparian plants are discussed.
