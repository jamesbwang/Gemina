  We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the `` Timed Up and Go '' ( TUG) and the Chair test as screening tools in the Emergency Department ( ED) , stratified by sex. This prospective cohort study was conducted at a Level 1 Trauma center. After consent , subjects performed the TUG and the Chair test. Subjects were contacted for phone follow-up and asked to self-report interim falling. Data from 192 subjects were analyzed. At baseline , 71.4 % ( n = 137) screened positive for increased falls risk based on the TUG evaluation , and 77.1 % ( n = 148) scored below average on the Chair test. There were no differences by patient sex. By the six-month evaluation 51 ( 26.6 %) study participants reported at least one fall. Females reported a non-significant higher prevalence of falls compared to males ( 29.7 % versus 22.2 % , p = 0.24). TUG test had a sensitivity of 70.6 % ( 95 % CI: 56.2 % -82.5 %) , a specificity of 28.4 % ( 95 % CI: 21.1 % -36.6 %) , a positive predictive ( PP) value 26.3 % ( 95 % CI: 19.1 % -34.5 %) and a negative predictive ( NP) value of 72.7 % ( 95 % CI: 59.0 % -83.9 %). Similar results were observed with the Chair test. It had a sensitivity of 78.4 % ( 95 % CI: 64.7 % -88.7 %) , a specificity of 23.4 % ( 95 % CI: 16.7 % -31.3 %) , a PP value 27.0 % ( 95 % CI: 20.1 % -34.9 %) and a NP value of 75.0 % ( 95 % CI: 59.7 % -86.8 %). No significant differences were observed between sexes. There were no sex specific significant differences in TUG or Chair test screening performance. Neither test performed well as a screening tool for future falls in the elderly in the ED setting.
