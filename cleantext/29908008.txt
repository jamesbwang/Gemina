  Cadmium ( Cd) is a non-essential , toxic heavy metal that poses serious threats to both ecosystems and human health. Plants employ various cellular and molecular mechanisms to minimise the impact of Cd toxicity and cell walls function as a defensive barrier during Cd exposure. In this study , we adopted a quantitative gel-based proteomic approach ( two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) to investigate changes in the abundance of cell wall and soluble proteins in stems of Medicago sativa L. upon long-term exposure to Cd ( 10 mg · Cd · kg
