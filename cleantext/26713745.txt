  The relationship between anti-tumoral immunity and cancer progression is complex. Recently , immune editing has emerged as a model to explain the interplay between the immune system and the selection of genetic alterations in cancer. In this model , the immune system selects cancer cells that grow as these are fit to escape immune surveillance during tumor development. Gliomas and glioblastoma , the most aggressive and most common of all primary malignant brain tumors are genetically heterogeneous , are relatively less antigenic , and are less responsive to immunotherapy than other cancers. In this review , we provide an overview of the relationship between glioma 's immune suppressive features , anti-tumoral immunity and cancer genomics. In this context , we provide a critical discussion of evidence suggestive of immune editing in this disease and discuss possible alternative explanations for these findings.
