  Generalized linear mixed models have played an important role in the analysis of longitudinal data; however , traditional approaches have limited flexibility in accommodating skewness and complex correlation structures. In addition , the existing estimation approaches generally rely heavily on the specifications of random effects distributions; therefore , the corresponding inferences are sometimes sensitive to the choice of random effect distributions under certain circumstance. In this paper , we incorporate serially dependent distribution-free random effects into Tweedie generalized linear models to accommodate a wide range of skewness and covariance structures for discrete and continuous longitudinal data. An optimal estimation of our model has been developed using the orthodox best linear unbiased predictors of random effects. Our approach unifies population-averaged and subject-specific inferences. Our method is illustrated through the analyses of patient-controlled analgesia data and Framingham cholesterol data.
