  Electric stimulation therapy ( EST) and magnetic sphincter augmentation ( MSA) represent novel methods for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD). The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of EST and magnetic sphincter augmentation device ( MSAD) comapred to laparoscopic fundoplication ( LF) and proton pump inhibitor therapy ( in case of EST). We performed a systematic literature search without restrictions on publication dates in five electronic databases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane library , PubMed , and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) , complemented by hand search , search in trial registries , and documentation provided by the manufacturers. No study passed inclusion criteria for analyzing EST effectiveness. Concerning safety , lead erosion through the esophagus and trocar perforation of the small bowel occurred in 2.4 % of patients ( in one study). Only the registry study fulfilled inclusion criteria for effectiveness analysis of MSAD. The crucial outcome of GERD-health-related quality of life ( HRQL) score improved from 20 to 3 points in MSAD patients , and from 23 to 3.5 points in LF patients. However , the LF patients were in a more severe stage of the disease. The results yield indefinite conclusions about the use of both MSAD and EST.. Clinical effectiveness and safety of both MSAD and EST are not sufficiently proven and are yet to be supported by high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials.
