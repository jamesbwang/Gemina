  Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is highly resistant to chemotherapies. The lack of efficacious treatment for metastatic RCC has led to a poor 5-year survival rate. Here , we found that Apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53-2 ( ASPP2) was frequently decreased in primary RCC tissues in comparison with non-tumoural kidney controls. Decreased ASPP2 was correlated with high grades and poor outcomes of RCC. Further studies revealed that ASPP2 downregulation promoted EMT and increased resistance to 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU)- induced apoptosis. To this end , the regulatory mechanisms of ASPP2 were further explored. Our data revealed that ASPP2 was inhibited by histone deacetylatlase 1 ( HDAC1) , which acted by preventing the binding between transcription factor ( E2F1) and the ASPP2 promoter. Of particular importance , HDAC1 inhibitor vorinostat restored ASPP2 transcription and produced a synergistic effect with 5-FU in elevating ASPP2 , promoting apoptosis and inhibiting EMT in both in vitro and in vivo RCC models. In summary , our data not only highlight an important role of ASPP2 in RCC progression and drug resistance , but also reveal new regulatory mechanisms of ASPP2 , which provides important insights into novel treatment strategies by targeting ASPP2 dysregulation in RCC.
