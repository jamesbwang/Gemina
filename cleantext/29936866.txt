  While health care costs can be considerable in individuals with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) , the degree to which health care expenditures vary following first-line treatment for non-relapsed versus relapsed DLBCL is unknown. Using 100 % Medicare claims , we identified beneficiaries with DLBCL treated with first-line therapy between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2014. We then compared health care expenditures of patients who received a second-line immunochemotherapy ( relapse cohort) to those who did not begin a second-line therapy during follow-up ( non-relapse cohort). After propensity score matching , the relapsed cohort incurred significantly higher health care costs ( $ 6998 vs $ 3314 per month; p < .001) , driven by inpatient ( $ 2548 vs $ 1943 per month; p < .001) and outpatient office visit costs ( $ 3581 vs $ 753 per month; p < .001). Our analysis confirms older adults with relapsed DLBCL incur higher medical costs and suggests improved first-line treatment would not only reduce the likelihood of relapse , but also contain health care costs.
