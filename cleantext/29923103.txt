  The applicability of ultra-low-dose computed tomography ( CT) for attenuation correction ( AC) of single-photon-emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging ( SPECT-MPI) remains elusive. One-hundred patients underwent one-day Attenuation maps for MPI obtained from ultra-low radiation dose CT scans are interchangeable with attenuation maps from standard-dose CT while offering a substantial reduction in radiation dose exposure.
