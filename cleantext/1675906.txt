  The blood-brain barrier ( BBB) regulates the transport of ions , nutrients , and metabolites to help maintain proper brain function. This restrictive interface formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells excludes the majority of small and large molecule drugs from entering the brain , and blood-brain barrier dysfunction is a signature of many neurological diseases. Thus ,
