  The evaluation of intensive cognitive training is usually based on neuropsychological tests and questionnaires. A study of the subjective experience of cognitive training would provide another type of valuable information concerning the effects of rehabilitation. We used grounded theory methods to explore the experience and management of attention dysfunction in daily life two-four years after brain injury. Data were collected by in-depth interviews of 14 adults with moderate-to-mild attention dysfunction after stroke or traumatic brain injury , and working part time or full time at the time of the interviews. The group received 20 hours of attention process training within the context of multidisciplinary rehabilitation early after brain injury. Data were analysed by open coding with constant comparison. The management of attention dysfunction was described by the informants as a dynamic process where strategies are continuously refined and flexibly adjusted as awareness and metacognitive knowledge increases. This process is regulated by situation-dependent factors. Attention process training might provide a suitable starting point for the identification of problem areas , improved specific goalsetting and stimulated self-training. The model describes the dynamic nature of the process , the ongoing struggle , self-training and search for feedback.
