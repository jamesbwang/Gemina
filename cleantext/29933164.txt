  Pyrite ash is a residue from the roasting of pyrite ores to obtain sulphuric acid used in the fertiliser industry and its production is widely extended worldwide. The mismanagement of this waste may result in environmental and health damages due to its physico-chemical characteristics. The main objective of this study was to examine the physico-chemical and mineralogical composition of roasted pyrite ash from an abandoned fertiliser company , and to evaluate the environmental risk caused by the wind and water dispersion of metals posed by this waste. In order to achieve these objectives , a sequential extraction procedure and a physical fractionation into six size fractions: > 100 , 100-50 , 50-20 , 20-10 , 10-2.5 and < 2.5 Î¼m were applied. Results showed that pyrite ash is composed mainly of iron-oxides such as hematite ( 46 %) and secondary minerals as anglesite and shows high concentrations of Pb ( 7464 mg kg
