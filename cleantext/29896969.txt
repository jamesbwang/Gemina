  Young African American and Latina women aged 15 to 24 are more likely to adopt short-acting forms of contraception over long-acting reversible contraception. Mobile applications and other forms of digital media may be useful for providing adolescents with information about sexual and reproductive health both inside and outside of the health care setting. The miPlan app was designed in accordance with principles of user experience design , and its content was informed by the theory of planned behavior and the transtheoretical model of behavior change. A university-based design team engaged young African American and Latina women to inform app development and provide input on app design , conducting multiple rounds of usability testing. Researchers then evaluated the acceptability of the miPlan app in family planning clinics among African American and Latina women aged 15 to 24. Participants rated the app highly acceptable , finding it both easy to use and highly informative. We demonstrate that mobile applications designed in conjunction with user populations may be effective at providing health information due to users ' ability to identify with them and their accessibility.
