  Cytosolic NADP +- isocitrate dehydrogenase ( ICDH) is one of the major enzymes involved in the production of 2-oxoglutarate for amino acid biosynthesis in plants. In most plants studied , ICDH is encoded by either one gene or a small gene family , and the protein sequence has been highly conserved during evolution , suggesting it plays different and essential roles in metabolism and differentiation. To elucidate the role of ICDH in hybrid poplar ( Populus tremula x P. alba) , transgenic plants overexpressing the Pinus pinaster gene were generated. Overexpression of ICDH resulted in hybrid poplar ( Populus tremula Ã— P. alba) trees with higher expression levels of the endogenous ICDH gene and higher enzyme content than control untransformed plants. Transgenic poplars also showed an increased expression of glutamine synthetase ( GS1 .3) , glutamate decarboxylase ( GAD) and other genes associated with vascular differentiation. Furthermore , these plants exhibited increased growth in height , longer internodes and enhanced vascular development in young leaves and the apical region of stem. Modifications in amino acid and organic acid content were observed in young leaves of the transgenic lines , suggesting an increased biosynthesis of amino acids for building new structures and also for transport to other sink organs , as expanding leaves or young stems. Taken together , these results support an important role of ICDH in plant growth and vascular development.
