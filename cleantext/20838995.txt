  Node stage ( N stage) is of paramount importance for gastric cancer staging. Radiologically node status implies detection and characterization of suspect malignant lymph nodes. Clinically it might determine survival and alter therapeutic plans. A number of modalities , including computerized tomography , MRI , PET and endoscopic ultrasound are currently available. Using a multimodality strategy , accuracy ranges between 50-90 % across various studies. Specificity and sensitivity varies with respect to method , number of positive lymph nodes , their location and other characteristics. Restaging after neoadjuvant therapy and staging of recurrence presents its own , particular challenges. Each method has its advantages and limitations and none of them alone is adequate enough for staging. While most of them are clinically well established , they are also active research topics. To overcome the aforementioned limitations a multidisciplinary , multimodality approach with emphasis on clinical staging and treatment plans is proposed.
