  Adenosine receptor activation has been investigated as a potential therapeutic approach to heal bone. Bone has enhanced regenerative potential when influenced by either direct or indirect adenosine receptor agonism. As investigators continue to elucidate how adenosine influences bone cell homeostasis at the cellular and molecular levels , a small but growing body of literature has reported successful in vivo applications of adenosine delivery. This review summarizes the role adenosine receptor ligation plays in osteoblast and osteoclast biology and remodeling/regeneration. It also reports on all the modalities described in the literature at this point for delivery of adenosine through in vivo models for bone healing and regeneration.
