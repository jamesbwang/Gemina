  KDN is an abbreviated name of 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid , and belongs to sialic acid members like N-acetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac) , and N-glycolylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Gc). The aminoacyl group at C5 position of Neu5Ac is replaced by a hydroxyl group in KDN. Like Neu5Ac , KDN exists in various glycoconjugates including glycosphingolipids in vertebrates and gram-negative bacteria. Because of its unique properties , some methods are specifically applicable to KDN residue , although most detection methods for Neu5Ac are also applicable. In this chapter , methods for identification of KDN residues in glycosphingolipids are described , focusing on two methods that are often used , i.e. , the fluorescent HPLC analysis and the TLC immunostaining with the antibodies specific to α2 ,3- and α2,8-KDN residues.
