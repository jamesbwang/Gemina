  Pallidal deep brain stimulation ( DBS) improves the symptoms of dystonia. The improvement processes of dystonic movements ( phasic symptoms) and tonic symptoms differ. Phasic symptoms improve rapidly after starting DBS treatment , but tonic symptoms improve gradually. This difference implies distinct neuronal mechanisms for phasic and tonic symptoms in the underlying cortico-basal ganglia neuronal network. Phasic symptoms are related to the pallido-thalamo-cortical pathway. The pathway related to tonic symptoms has been assumed to be different from that for phasic symptoms. In the present study , local field potentials of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi) and globus pallidus externus ( GPe) and electroencephalograms from the motor cortex ( MCx) were recorded in 19 dystonia patients to analyze the differences between the two types of symptoms. The 19 patients were divided into two groups , 10 with predominant phasic symptoms ( phasic patients) and 9 with predominant tonic symptoms ( tonic patients). To investigate the distinct features of oscillations and functional couplings across the GPi , GPe , and MCx by clinical phenotype , power and coherence were calculated over the delta ( 2-4 Hz) , theta ( 5-7 Hz) , alpha ( 8-13 Hz) , and beta ( 14-35 Hz) frequencies. In phasic patients , the alpha spectral peaks emerged in the GPi oscillatory activities , and alpha GPi coherence with the GPe and MCx was higher than in tonic patients. On the other hand , delta GPi oscillatory activities were prominent , and delta GPi-GPe coherence was significantly higher in tonic than in phasic patients. However , there was no significant delta coherence between the GPi/GPe and MCx in tonic patients. These results suggest that different pathophysiological cortico-pallidal oscillations are related to tonic and phasic symptoms.
