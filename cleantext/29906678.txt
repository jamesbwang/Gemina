  The folate cycle is an essential metabolic pathway in the cell , involved in nucleotide synthesis , maintenance of the redox balance<symptom> in the cell , methionine metabolism and re-methylation reactions. Standardised methods for the measurement of folate cycle intermediates in different biological matrices are in great demand. Here we describe a rapid , sensitive , precise and accurate liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric ( LC-MS/MS) method with a wide calibration curve range and a short run time for the simultaneous determination of folate cycle metabolites , including tetrahydrofolic acid ( THF) , 5‑methyl THF , 5‑formyl THF , 5,10‑methenyl THF , 5,10‑methylene THF , dihydrofolic acid ( DHF) and folic acid in different biological matrices. Extraction of folate derivatives from soft and hard tissue samples as well as from adherent cells was achieved using homogenisation in buffer , while extraction from the whole blood and plasma relied on the anion exchange solid-phase extraction ( SPE) method. Chromatographic separation was completed using a Waters Atlantis dC
