  Ovarian cancer ( OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. Accumulated studies have revealed that targeting protein for Xklp2 ( TPX2) was tightly associated with the development and progression of OC. The present study further determined a novel mechanism of TPX2 in OC via the AKT signaling pathway. The differentially expressed genes were screened in GEO database for gene expression microarray of OC. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the key differentially expressed genes in OC. We prepared CD133/1 + OC stem cells. Then cells were treated with TPX2-1 siRNA and perifcsine to explore the correlation of TPX2 and the AKT signaling pathway. We determined the expression of TPX2 , AKT , Pl3 K , PTEN , caspase-3 , Bax and Bcl-2 in OC cells. Cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and apoptosis rate were respectively measured using MTT and EdU assays , Transwell assay , Scratch test , and flow cytometry. Xenograft tumor in nude mice was used to determine the effect of TPX2 in OC cells in vitro. Initially , TPX2 overexpression was observed in OC , and TPX2 mediated the effect of the AKT signaling pathway in OC. TPX2 knockdown decreased expression of AKT , Pl3 K , and Bcl-2 , and the extent of AKT phosphorylation , but increased expression of PTEN , Caspase-3 , and Bax. Furthermore , TPX2 knockdown suppressed OC cell proliferation , migration and invasion , but promoted OC cell apoptosis. Taken together , TPX2 silencing negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway by which OC cell proliferation was inhibited yet cell apoptosis was accelerated , suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to OC.
