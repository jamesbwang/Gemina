  Thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs) were cloned based on their homology with the retroviral oncogene v-ERBA. In Vertebrates two genes , THRA and THRB , encode respectively many isotypes and isoforms of receptors TRα and TRβ , resulting from alternative splicing and/or internal transcription start sites. We present here a wide overview of this diversity and of their mechanisms of action as transcription regulators , as well as alternative actions through cytoplasmic signaling.
