  Inhibition of Janus-kinase 1/2 ( JAK1/2) is a mainstay to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN). Sporadic observations reported the co-incidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas during treatment of MPN with JAK1/2 inhibitors. We assessed 626 MPN patients including 69 with myelofibrosis receiving JAK1/2 inhibitors for lymphoma development. B-cell lymphomas evolved in 4/69 patients ( 5.8 %) upon JAK1/2 inhibition compared to 2/557 ( 0.36 %) with conventional treatment ( 16-fold increased risk). A similar 15-fold increase was observed in an independent cohort of 929 MPN patients. Considering primary myelofibrosis only ( N = 216) , 3 lymphomas were observed in 31 inhibitor-treated patients ( 9.7 %) versus 1/185 controls ( 0.54 %). Lymphomas were of aggressive B-cell type , extra-nodal or leukemic with high MYC expression in the absence of
