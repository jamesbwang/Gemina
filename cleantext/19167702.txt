  Fear memory is a highly stable and durable form of memory , even over vast ( remote) time frames. Nevertheless , some elements of fear memory can be forgotten , resulting in generalization. The purpose of this study is to determine how cued fear memory generalizes over time and measure underlying patterns of cortico-amygdala synaptic plasticity. We established generalization gradients at recent ( 1-d) and remote ( 30-d) retention intervals following auditory cued fear conditioning in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Results revealed a flattening of the generalization gradient ( increased generalization) that was dissociated from contextual fear generalization , indicating a specific influence of time on cued fear memory performance. This effect reversed after a brief exposure to the novel stimulus soon after learning. Measurements from cortico-amygdala imaging of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal
