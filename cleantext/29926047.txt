  Transcytosis of nanoparticles ( NPs) is emerging as an attractive alternative to the paracellular route in cancer drug delivery with studies suggesting targeting caveolae-mediated endocytosis to maximize NP transcytosis. However , there are limited studies on transcytosis of NPs , especially for corona-coated NPs. Most studies focused on cellular uptake as an indirect measure of the NP 's transcellular permeability ( Pd). Here , we probed the effect of protein corona on the uptake and transcytosis of 20 , 40 , 100 , and 200 nm polystyrene nanoparticles ( pNP-PC) across HUVECs in a microfluidic channel that modelled the microvasculature. We observed increased cell uptake with size of pNP-PC although it was the smallest 20 nm pNP-PC that exhibited the highest transcellular Pd. In the absence of corona however , cell uptake decreased with size , and the largest 200 nm pNP-PEG exhibited the lowest transcellular Pd. By inhibiting caveolae-mediated endocytosis in HUVECs , smaller pNPs had a larger drop in cell uptake than larger pNPs , regardless of surface coating. However , only the smallest ( 20 nm) and largest ( 200 nm) pNP-PC had a decrease in Pd following inhibition with MÎ²CD. Our findings showed that the protein corona affected the transcytosis of NPs , and their uptake by caveolae-mediated endocytosis did not necessarily lead to transcytosis.
