  Researchers have discovered how the gut microbiome affects tumor development in the mouse liver. By treating mice with antibiotics , they showed that depleting gut commensal bacteria enhances certain primary bile acids in the liver. This causes natural killer T cells to accumulate there , where they protect against tumors. A trial to determine whether this mechanism also operates in humans is being planned.
