  Central venous catheter bloodstream infections are an important cause of hospital-acquired infection with increased morbidity , mortality and cost. The incidence varies between countries and even hospitals. Needleless connector hubs are used on virtually all intravascular devices and colonization of these is considered the cause of much of the postinsertion catheter-related<disease> infections<disease> through breaks in aseptic technique and failure to disinfect properly. This systematic review evaluated 165 search hits on hub disinfection practices with particular emphasis on the time of scrubbing the connector for 15 sec but also the impact of measures of education and compliance. We found no randomized controlled trials ( RCT) that addressed the question of scrubbing time but four in vitro studies and two clinical studies ( one Swedish and one American) supported the instruction to scrub<disease> the hub for 15 sec. Where studied , compliance with disinfection protocols was found to be surprisingly low. Though the optimal technique or disinfection time has not formally been identified through RCTs , nevertheless scrubbing with chlorhexidine-alcohol for 15 sec is seen as a reasonable recommendation and consistent with conclusions of three big reviews during the past three years ( two from the UK , and one from Australia/USA).
