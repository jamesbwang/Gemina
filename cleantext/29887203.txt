  This study evaluated the performances of twenty-nine algorithms that use satellite-based spectral imager data to derive estimates of chlorophyll-a concentrations that , in turn , can be used as an indicator of the general status of algal cell densities and the potential for a harmful algal bloom ( HAB). The performance assessment was based on making relative comparisons between two temperate inland lakes: Harsha Lake ( 7.99 km
