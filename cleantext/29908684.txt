  Predictive equations remain the clinical tool of choice to estimate the energy expenditure , however , poor accuracy has been found when applied in patients with severe obesity. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of the total energy expenditure ( TEE) those obtained by predictive equations of resting energy expenditure ( REE) times individual estimates of metabolic equivalents ( MET) , taking as reference the TEE measured by doubly labeled water ( DLW) , before , six and twelve months after bariatric surgery. Twenty class III obese women ( age: 29.4 ± 5.1 years; BMI: 44.9 ± 2.5 kg/m The patients showed 65 % of excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. The body fat mass decreased 17 % after 1 year of surgery. TEE ( 2930 ± 525 kcal.day None of the prediction equations tested was accurate for estimating TEE for the 3 periods evaluated; however , while there are no reports of specific equations for class III obese women , the Harris and Benedict x MET and DRI equations , can describe the TEE with acceptable accuracy. After surgery , the best equation to be used will depend if the patient has been treated for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and in which post-treatment period it is used.
