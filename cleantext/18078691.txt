  The animal-pathogenic oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica causes serious losses in aquaculture by infecting and killing freshwater fish. Like plant-pathogenic oomycetes , S. parasitica employs similar infection structures and secretes effector proteins that translocate into host cells to manipulate the host. Here , we show that the host-targeting protein SpHtp3 enters fish cells in a pathogen-independent manner. This uptake process is guided by a gp96-like receptor and can be inhibited by supramolecular tweezers. The C-terminus of SpHtp3 ( containing the amino acid sequence YKARK) , and not the N-terminal RxLR motif , is responsible for the uptake into host cells. Following translocation , SpHtp3 is released from vesicles into the cytoplasm by another host-targeting protein where it degrades nucleic acids. The effector translocation mechanism described here , is potentially also relevant for other pathogen-host interactions as gp96 is found in both animals and plants.
