  Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis , which is associated with high relapse risks. However , mechanisms underlying JAK/STAT signaling-mediated breast tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here , we showed that GRAMD1B expression is upregulated on IL-6 but downregulated upon treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably , Gramd1b knockdown caused morphological changes of the cells , characterized by the formation of membrane ruffling and protrusions , implicating its role in cell migration. Consistently , GRAMD1B inhibition significantly enhanced cell migration , with an increase in the levels of the Rho family of GTPases. We also found that Gramd1b knockdown-mediated pro-migratory phenotype is associated with JAK2/STAT3 and Akt activation , and that JAK2 or Akt inhibition efficiently suppresses the phenotype. Interestingly , AG490 dose-dependently increased p-Akt levels , and our epistasis analysis suggested that the effect of JAK/STAT inhibition on p-Akt is via the regulation of GRAMD1B expression. Taken together , our results suggest that GRAMD1B is a key signaling molecule that functions to inhibit cell migration in breast cancer by negating both JAK/STAT and Akt signaling , providing the foundation for its development as a novel biomarker in breast cancer.
