  Hemodynamically significant PDA ( hsPDA) is one of the most common problems in preterm infants. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of combined pharmacological ( paracetamol + ibuprofen) therapy on monotherapy-resistant hsPDA in infants. The study included infants with persistent hsPDA , unresponsive to monotherapy. Combined treatment ( paracetamol + ibuprofen) was started as paracetamol at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 5 days , and ibuprofen at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg at 24 and 48 hours. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed at 2 days after the end of treatment. If hsPDA persisted after the combined treatment , a surgical PDA ligation was considered. A total of 12 infants were enrolled and 9 infants ( 75 %) with monotherapy-resistant PDA were successfully treated with combined therapy. In three patients , no response was obtained to the combined treatment so surgical ligation was applied. Combined therapy may be a useful treatment option for monotherapy-resistant hsPDA in preterm infants. Before surgical ligations , this combined therapy option should be considered.
