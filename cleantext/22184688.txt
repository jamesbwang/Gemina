  As electronic health records have become a more integral part of a physician 's daily life , new electronic health record tools will continue to be rolled out to trainees. Patient access to provider notes is becoming a more widespread practice because this has been shown to increase patient empowerment. In this analysis , we compared differences between resident and attending physicians ' perceptions prior to implementation of patient access to provider notes to facilitate optimal use of electronic health record features and as a potential for patient empowerment. This was a single-site study within an academic internal medicine program. Prior to implementation of patient access to provider notes , we surveyed resident and attending physicians to assess differences in perceptions of this new electronic health record tool using an open access survey provided by OpenNotes. We surveyed 37 % ( 20/54 total) of resident physicians and obtained a 100 % response rate and 72 % ( 31/44 total) of attending physicians. Similarities between the groups included concerns about documenting sensitive topics and anticipation of improved patient engagement. Compared with attending physicians , resident physicians were more concerned about litigation , discussing weight , offending patients , and communicated less overall with patients through electronic health record. Patient access to provider notes has the potential to empower patients but concerns of the resident physicians need to be validated and addressed prior to its utilization.
