  The termite gut microbiome is a model system to investigate microbial interactions and their associations with host. For decades , extensive research with molecular tools and conventional cultivation method has been carried out to define the microbial diversity in termite gut. Yet , many bacterial groups of the termite gut microbiome have not been successfully cultivated in laboratory. In this study , we adapted the recently developed microfluidic streak plate ( MSP) technique for cultivation of termite gut microbial communities at both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We found that 99 operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) were cultivable by MSP approach and 18 OTUs were documented first time for termite gut microbiota. Further analysis of the bacterial diversities derived by culture-dependent MSP approach and culture-independent 16S rRNA gene typing revealed that both methods have bias in recovery of gut microbiota. In total 396 strains were isolated with MSP technique , and potential new taxa at species and/or genus levels were obtained that were phylogenetically related to Burkholderia , Micrococcus<pathogen> , and Dysgonomonas<pathogen>. Results from this study indicate that MSP technique is applicable for cultivating previously unknown and new microbial groups of termite gut microbiota.
