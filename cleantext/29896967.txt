  We aimed to assess to what extent CpG island<disease> methylator phenotype ( CIMP) contributes to cancer subtypes obtained by multilevel omic data analysis. 16 The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets encompassing three data layers in 4688 tumor samples were analyzed. We identified cancer integrative subtypes ( ISs) by the use of similarity network fusion and consensus clustering. CIMP high ( CIMP-H) associated ISs were profiled by gene sets and transcriptional regulators enrichment analysis. In nine out of 16 cancer datasets CIMP-H clusters significantly overlaped with unique ISs. The contribution of CIMP-H on integrative molecular profiling is variable; therefore , only in a subset of cancer types does CIMP-H contribute to homogenous integrative subtype. CIMP-H associated ISs are heterogenous groups with regard to deregulated pathways and transcriptional regulators.
