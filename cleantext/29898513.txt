  Combined pollution of agrichemicals and heavy metals in urban lawn soils were commonly observed throughout the world , and the co-existed two chemicals could interact with each other both in environment behavior and toxic effect. However , little has been reported on the ecological risk of their combined pollution , especially in field due to lack of systematic methodology. In this study , four soils ( C , N1 , N2 , N3) from two public parks in Beijing , China , with similar properties but contrasting heavy metal contaminated level were chosen to assess the ecological risks of co-existed herbicide siduron and heavy metals. Environmental behaviors of siduron in studied soils were investigated with batch experiments in lab , based on which the environmental exposure level of siduron was simulated with HYDRUS-1D. Results suggested that soil organic matter ( SOM) rather than the co-existed heavy metals was the dominant factor affecting the fate and the accumulation of siduron in soils. Soil N2 with the highest SOM , showed the strongest tendency to retain siduron among the studied soils. Significant joint effect of siduron and heavy metals on cucumber root elongation was observed through lab experiments. Thus , the joint toxicity of siduron and heavy metals were calculated based on single toxicology data of them using independent action ( IA) and concentration addition ( CA) model. Then , the predicted no effect concentration ( PNEC
