  Peritoneal adhesions develop after abdominal surgery , trauma or intraperitoneal infections , and have important consequences. The deposition of peritoneal fibrin is a common pathophysiological pathway for the formation of adhesions. Here , we aimed to examine the effects of fibrin-induced cytokine production on peritoneal mesothelial cells ( PMCs) , and to block the effects of fibrin using an integrin-linked kinase ( ILK) inhibitor , QLT-0267. PMCs were cultured from the enzymatic disaggregation of rat omentum. After the PMCs were covered with fibrin , the expression of IL-1β , IL-6 , TNFα and VEGF-A increased. This increase in cytokine production was attenuated by QLT-0267 , which acted via the inhibition of both the ILK and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK) pathways , and subsequently via the GSK-3β pathway. We found that QLT-0267 decreased both the severity of peritoneal adhesion and the serum levels of IL-6 in our post-surgical adhesion mouse model. In conclusion , our study provides novel evidence that fibrin-induced cytokine production may involve in the mechanism of peritoneal adhesion formation. Furthermore , the use of the small molecule inhibitor QLT-0267 is a new strategy in preventing peritoneal adhesion in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
