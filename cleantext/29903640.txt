  Recent advances in materials development and tissue engineering has resulted in a substantial number of bioinspired materials that recapitulate cardinal features of bone extracellular matrix ( ECM) such as dynamic inorganic and organic environment ( s) , hierarchical organization , and topographical features. Bone mimicking materials , as defined by its self-explanatory term , are developed based on the current understandings of the natural bone ECM during development , remodeling , and fracture repair. Compared to conventional plastic cultures , biomaterials that resemble some aspects of the native environment could elicit a more natural molecular and cellular response relevant to the bone tissue. Although current bioinspired materials are mainly developed to assist tissue repair or engineer bone tissues , such materials could nevertheless be applied to model various skeletal diseases in vitro. This review summarizes the use of bioinspired materials for bone tissue engineering , and their potential to model diseases of bone development and remodeling ex vivo. We largely focus on biomaterials , designed to re-create different aspects of the chemical and physical cues of native bone ECM. Employing these bone-inspired materials and tissue engineered bone surrogates to study bone diseases has tremendous potential and will provide a closer portrayal of disease progression and maintenance , both at the cellular and tissue level. We also briefly touch upon the application of patient-derived stem cells and introduce emerging technologies such as organ-on-chip in disease modeling. Faithful recapitulation of disease pathologies will not only offer novel insights into diseases , but also lead to enabling technologies for drug discovery and new approaches for cell-based therapies.
