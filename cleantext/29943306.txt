  Clinical application of stem cells ( SCs) progresses significantly in the treatment of a large number of diseases , e.g. leukemia<disease> , respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> , kidney disease , cerebral palsy , autism , or autoimmune diseases. Of those , the population , biological phenotypes , and functions of individual SCs are mainly concerned , due to the lack of cell separation and purification processes. The single-cell technology , including microfluidic technology and single-cell genome amplification technology , is widely used to study SCs and gains some recognitions. The present review will address the importance of single-cell technologies in the recognition and heterogeneity of SCs and highlight the significance of current single-cell approaches in the understanding of SC phenotypes. We also discuss the values of single-cell studies to overcome the bottleneck in explore of biological mechanisms and reveal the therapeutic potentials of SCs in diseases , especially tumor-related diseases , as new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
