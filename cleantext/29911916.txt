  To compare recordings of bone conduction ( BC) stimulated auditory brainstem response ( ABR) obtained using the newer BC transducer Radioear B81 and the conventional BC transducer Radioear B71. Balanced electromagnetic separation transducer ( BEST) design found in the B81 may influence the ABR magnitudes and latencies , as well as electrical artefacts. ABRs to tone burst stimuli of 500 Hz , 2000 Hz , 4000 Hz , click stimulation , and broad-band chirp stimulation at 20 and 50 dB nHL were recorded. For each device , stimulus and intensity level , the ABR Jewett wave V amplitude and latency were obtained. The device-related electrical stimulus artefacts on the ABR recordings were also analysed by calculating the Hilbert envelope of the peri-stimulus recording segments. Twenty-three healthy adults with normal hearing were included in the study. The ABRs obtained by the B81 were similar to that of the B71 in terms of ABR wave V amplitude and latency. However , the B81 produced smaller electrical artefacts than B71 and this difference was statistically significant. The BC transducer Radioear B81 provides ABRs comparable to Radioear B71 while causing smaller artefacts.
