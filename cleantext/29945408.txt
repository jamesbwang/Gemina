  The factors influencing the grade of knee osteoarthritis were screened by ordered Logistic regression analysis. The classification model of knee osteoarthritis was established , which provided tool for the evaluation of clinical classification of knee osteoarthritis. A total of 753 cases of knee osteoarthritis from Wangjing Hospital , China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences were treated with single factor and multivariate Logistic regression analysis from September 18 , 2014 to April 26 , 2016. The model formula was constructed and evaluated. In this study , it was found that 13 factors associated with knee osteoarthritis grading. Old age , obesity , long course of disease , recurrence , lower limb deformity , quadriceps muscle atrophy , WOMAC index , TCM syndrome<disease> score , VAS score and grading degree were positively correlated. One knee pain , limited pain range , knee activity and grading degree were negatively correlated. The knee osteoarthritis grading model was constructed and the evaluation test was effective ( Training set AUC = 0.860 , test set AUC = 0.879). In this study , a classification model of knee osteoarthritis was established which has a good ability to predict the classification of knee osteoarthritis under preliminary evaluation.
