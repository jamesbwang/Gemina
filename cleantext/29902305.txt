  The US Food and Drug Administration is considering limiting cigarettes to very low nicotine levels. Cigarette consumption of nondaily intermittent smokers ( ITS) , who compose one-third of US adult smokers , could feasibly increase or could be unaffected if their smoking is not motivated by nicotine seeking. To compare cigarette consumption in ITS receiving very low-nicotine-content cigarettes ( VLNCCs) or identical normal-nicotine-content cigarettes ( NNCCs). This randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted from June 2015 to July 2017 at a single US site. Volunteer ITS not planning to quit were recruited via media. Overall , 297 individuals enrolled , and 238 were randomized. Analyses were intent-to-treat. After a 2-week baseline of smoking their own brand of cigarettes provided gratis , ITS were randomized to VLNCCs or NNCCs for 10 weeks. The number of cigarettes per day ( CPD) was assessed by real-time reporting , timeline follow-back reports , and cigarette butt counts. The primary outcome was change in CPD from baseline to weeks 9 to 10 of intervention , adjusting for baseline CPD. The mean ( SD) age of the 238 randomized participants was 37.9 ( 13.8) years. Of 238 participants , 108 ( 45 %) were men. At baseline , the mean ( SD) CPD was 3.1 ( 2.9). In intent-to-treat analyses using multiple imputation to address missing data , the VLNCC group had a mean decrease of 1.6 CPD ( 95 % CI , 1.1-2.0; 51 % of baseline) vs 0.05 decrease with NNCCs ( 95 % CI , -0.5 to 0.4; 2 % of baseline). Treatment group differences were not materially moderated by sex , race/ethnicity , or history of daily smoking. Cheating with conventional cigarettes , inferred from cotinine assays , was more common in the VLNCC group ( OR , 2.95; 95 % CI , 1.54-5.66) , but sensitivity analyses showed significant VLNCC effects among the compliant participants as well. In longitudinal analysis of CPD over time with random intercept and slope , the VLNCC and NNCC groups differed significantly in both linear ( -0.15; 95 % CI , -0.22 to -0.08; P < .001) and quadratic ( 0.0026; 95 % CI , 0.0010-0.0042; P = .002) trends: CPD dropped by 43.8 % in the VLNCC group over 4 weeks , then leveled off thereafter. Abstinence ( intent-to-treat , biochemically verified) in weeks 9 to 10 postrandomization did not differ significantly by treatment group ( VLNCC , 10.2 % vs NNNC , 5.0 %; P = .28). Switching to VLNCCs caused substantial smoking reduction among ITS but did not significantly increase abstinence. Response to a VLNCC intervention suggests that nicotine-seeking motivates ITS ' smoking. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02228824.
