  The objective of this study was to determine whether ammonium accumulates in IVF media during fertility process and whether the brief co-incubation of gametes ( bIVF) benefited the outcomes of newborns. Ammonium levels in IVF media during gamete co-incubation were measured and the effects of bIVF on neonatal outcomes were evaluated retrospectively in this study. A total of 609 live newborns cycles were included in this study. The results showed that ammonium levels in the conventional IVF ( cIVF) media<pathogen> was significantly increased than that in bIVF and control media ( 27.32 ± 5.60 vs 20.71 ± 3.89 , P = 0.03; 27.32 ± 5.60 vs 19.46 ± 1.31 , P = 0.01 , respectively). In the cIVF group , the mean gestational age was significantly lower ( 37.36 ± 2.29 vs. 37.74 ± 1.94 weeks , P = 0.031) and the incidence of preterm birth ( < 37 weeks) was higher than that in the bIVF group ( 25.80 vs. 17.63 % , P = 0.015). Singleton cycles and twin cycles were then analyzed respectively. The gestational age and birth weight of the singleton cycles were similar between the two groups. However , of the twin cycles , the gestational age was significantly decreased and the rate of preterm birth was increased significantly in the cIVF group ( 35.76 ± 2.31 vs. 36.48 ± 1.73 , P = 0.013; 53.33 vs. 31.52 % , P = 0.002 , respectively). There is an ammonium accumulation in IVF media during co-incubation of gametes. And bIVF reduces the risk of preterm birth ( < 37 weeks) , especially with regard to preterm birth of the twin cycles , and seems to be a safe alternative method for improving the neonatal outcomes compared with cIVF.
