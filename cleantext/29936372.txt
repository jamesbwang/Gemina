  Biomedical research in areas such as metabolic disorders , neuromodulatory , and immunomodulatory conditions involves lipid metabolism and demands a reliable and inexpensive method for quantification of short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs). We report a GC-MS method for analysis of all straight-chain and branched-chain SCFAs using pentafluorobenzyl bromide ( PFBBr) as derivatization reagent. We optimized the derivatization and GC-MS conditions using a mixture containing all eight SCFA standards , i.e. , five straight-chain and three branched-chain SCFAs. The optimal derivatization conditions were derivatization time 90 min , temperature 60 Â°C , pH 7 , and ( CH
