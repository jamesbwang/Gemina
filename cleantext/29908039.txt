  Cerebral hypoxia has been associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. We studied whether reducing cerebral hypoxia in extremely preterm infants during the first 72 hours of life affected neurological outcomes at two years of corrected age. In 2012-2013 , the phase II randomised Safeguarding the Brains of our smallest Children trial compared visible cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) monitoring in an intervention group and blinded NIRS monitoring in a control group. Cerebral hypoxia was significantly reduced in the intervention group. We followed up 115 survivors from eight European centres at two years of corrected age , by conducting a medical examination and assessing their neurodevelopment with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development , Second or Third Edition , and the parental Ages and Stages Questionnaire ( ASQ). There were no differences between the intervention ( n = 65) and control ( n = 50) groups with regard to the mean mental developmental index ( 89.6 ± 19.5 versus 88.4 ± 14.7 , p = 0.77) , ASQ score ( 215 ± 58 versus 213 ± 58 , p = 0.88) and the number of children with moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment ( 10 versus six , p = 0.58). Cerebral NIRS monitoring was not associated with long-term benefits or harm with regard to neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of corrected age.
