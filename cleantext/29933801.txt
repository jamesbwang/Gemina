  Alignment of the lumbar spine has an important impact on the segmental motion , degenerative pathology , and health-related quality of life. The relationship between lumbar lordosis and pelvic incidence is predictive in the pathogenesis of spinal disorders , including disk degeneration , spondylolisthesis , and adjacent segment degeneration. This article reviews the relationship between lumbar and pelvic alignment with pathology of the lumbar spine , provides goals for appropriate alignment in reconstructive surgery , and discusses strategies for effective realignment of the spine.
