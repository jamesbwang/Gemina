  The aim of this study was to assess the potential health risk of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) at home and kindergarten for pre-school children. The urine samples were taken from 200 pre-school children aged 5-7 years and analyzed for 1-OHP as a biomarker of PAHs. Mixed effect models were applied to investigate the association between effective environmental parameters ( mode of transport , distance to major roads , traffic density , greenness , tobacco exposure , home ventilation , and grill foods) and urinary 1-OHP levels. A Monte-Carlo simulation technique was applied to calculate the risk of exposure to PAHs and to check the uncertainty of input variables and the sensitivity of the estimated risk. The median and inter quartile range ( IQR) of 1-OHP was 257 ( 188.5) ng L
