  The aim of the present study was to investigate whether tumor-derived supernatants down-regulate the immune function of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs) in oral cancer and the potential molecular mechanisms of this effect. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and flow cytometry were used to detect tumor-infiltrating and peripheral blood pDCs. MTS and flow cytometry were employed to evaluate the immune response of CD4 The proportion of pDCs ( 0.121 % ± 0.043 %) was significantly higher in Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) samples than in normal tissue ( 0.023 % ± 0.016 %) ( P = 0.021). TLR9 mRNA was significantly lower in tumor-infiltrating pDCs and positively correlated to low IFN-α production ( r = 0.956; P < 0.01). The supernatant of oral cancer cells negatively regulated TLR9 mRNA expression and the subsequent IFN-α production of pDCs , which inhibited the immune response of CD4 Tumor-derived supernatants may impair the function of tumor-infiltrating pDCs , which subsequently decreases the immune response of CD4
