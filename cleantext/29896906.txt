  Varicocele has a common association with male infertility<symptom> , but its exact role is still debated. Apoptosis has been suggested as one of the mechanisms of varicocele-associated infertility<symptom>. Granulysin is a molecule that plays a role in apoptosis with no previous study about its role in male infertility<symptom>. This case-controlled study aimed to assess seminal plasma granulysin level in infertile patients with varicocele. This study involved 90 men that were allocated into fertile normozoospermic men ( n = 20) , infertile men without varicocele ( n = 30) and infertile men with varicocele ( n = 40). These men were subjected to history taking , clinical examination , semen analysis and estimation of seminal granulysin. In general , seminal granulysin level was significantly elevated in infertile men compared with fertile men. Infertile men with varicocele showed significantly higher seminal granulysin compared with infertile men without varicocele , in bilateral varicocele cases and in grade III varicocele. Seminal granulysin level was negatively correlated with sperm concentration , sperm motility , sperm normal forms percentage and testicular volumes. It is concluded that increased seminal granulysin has a negative impact on spermatogenesis in infertile men in general and in infertile men associated with varicocele in particular.
