  The effect of humidity on flame-made metal oxide agglomerate morphology and size distribution is investigated , for the first time to our knowledge , and compared to that on soot , which has been widely studied. Understanding the impact of humidity on such characteristics is essential for storage , handling , processing , and eventual performance of nanomaterials. More specifically , broadly used agglomerates of flame-made silica nanoparticles are humidified at various saturation ratios , S = 0.2-1.5 , and dried before characterization with a differential mobility analyzer ( DMA) , an aerosol particle mass ( APM) analyzer , and transmission electron microscopy. At high humidity , the constituent single and/or aggregated ( chemically bonded) primary particles ( PPs) rearrange to balance the capillary forces induced by condensation-evaporation of liquid bridges between PPs. Larger agglomerates restructure more than smaller ones , narrowing their mobility size distribution. After humidification at S = 1.5 and drying , agglomerates collapse into compact structures that follow a fractal scaling law with mass-mobility exponent D
