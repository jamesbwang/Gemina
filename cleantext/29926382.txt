  The main objective was to evaluate , whether the subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH)- associated early inflammatory response has focal or global character , i.e. , whether areas distant to hematoma may be affected by an early inflammatory response. The second objective was to evaluate the association of anesthesia recovery time for basic reflexes/neurological functions with severity of SAH. SAH was induced in rats using an endovascular perforation model. Anesthesia recovery time was evaluated for pain reaction recovery time ( spinal level) , spontaneous ventilation recovery time ( brain stem level) , and consciousness<symptom> recovery time ( neocortical level). mRNA expressions of TNFα , IL-1β , IL-6 , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 in areas adjacent and distant to hematoma were evaluated between 2 and 8 h after SAH. Serum levels of TNFα , IL-1β , and IL-6 were assessed at 4 and 8 h after SAH. Anesthesia recovery time of all selected parameters was associated with severity of SAH. The consciousness<symptom> recovery time test had the best predictive value , while the spontaneous ventilation recovery time test was able to bring information in the shortest time. The mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in severe SAH groups in both adjacent and distant areas. The inflammatory response in mild/moderate SAH groups was less strong , peaking at 4 h after SAH. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were ambiguous. Anesthesia recovery time may be useful for bleeding severity prediction in the SAH model; however , further validation is needed. Severe subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> is associated with the strong early inflammatory response , which has a global character , while mild subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> is accompanied by a weaker
