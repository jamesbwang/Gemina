  To evaluate the effectiveness of a population-based , public education campaign designed to increase awareness of the Canadian Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines ( LRDG). A province-wide mass media campaign was introduced. To measure campaign effectiveness , we completed a cross-sectional study using pre- and postcampaign surveys. Measurements included awareness of the LRDG , specific knowledge of the LRDG , and beliefs toward drinking and behavior change. Postsurvey respondents were more likely to be aware of the LRDG ( 19.2 % vs. 25.8 %). However , increased awareness was largely driven by females being significantly more aware of the guidelines after the campaign ( odds ratio = 1.74; 95 % confidence interval = ( 1.38 , 2.19)). Men were not found to be more aware postcampaign. The results did not show a significant increase in specific knowledge of the LRDG or change in beliefs toward drinking and behavior change after the campaign. Independent of the survey cycle , males and those aged 19 to 25 years were less likely to be aware of the LRDG , select the correct drink limit or less , and believe that consuming alcohol in excess has short- and long-term health consequences when compared to females and those aged 56 to 70 years. A provincial public health education campaign was effective at increasing awareness of the LRDG , though uptake was lowest among those at highest risk for heavy drinking.
