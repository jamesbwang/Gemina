  We investigated the frequency and pattern of detection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ( t-mAbs) daratumumab and elotuzumab by routine serum protein electrophoresis ( SPE) and immunofixation ( IF) in treated patients with myeloma. Detection of t-mAb was assessed in 22 patients by retrospective review of SPE/IF ordered prior to , during , and after 26 individual courses of therapy. t-mAb was distinguishable from M-protein in 16 of 26 courses , with daratumumab detected in nine of nine and elotuzumab in six of seven patients. t-mAb was detected on first follow-up SPE/IF in 12 patients , with earliest detection 7 days after therapy initiation and latest detection 70 days after therapy. t-mAb persisted throughout induction therapy in most patients , with loss of detection during maintenance daratumumab. When distinguishable from M-protein , t-mAbs are detectable in 93 % of treated patients as soon as 7 days after the initial dose and are consistently observed throughout induction therapy , warranting increased monitoring and careful interpretation of SPE/IF.
