  Researchers hypothesized that telomere shortening facilitates carcinogenesis. Previous studies found inconsistent associations between blood leukocyte telomere length ( LTL) and cancer. Epigenetic reprogramming of telomere maintenance mechanisms may help explain this inconsistency. We examined associations between DNA methylation in telomere-related genes ( TRG) and cancer. We analyzed 475 participants providing 889 samples 1 to 3 times ( median follow-up , 10.1 years) from 1999 to 2013 in the Normative Aging Study. All participants were cancer-free at each visit and blood leukocytes profiled using the Illumina 450K array. Of 121 participants who developed cancer , 34 had prostate cancer , 10 melanoma , 34 unknown skin malignancies , and 43 another cancer. We examined 2,651 CpGs from 80 TRGs and applied a combination of Cox and mixed models to identify CpGs prospectively associated with cancer ( at FDR < 0.05). We also explored trajectories of DNA methylation , logistic regression stratified by time to diagnosis/censoring , and cross-sectional models of LTL at first blood draw. We identified 30 CpGs on 23 TRGs whose methylation was positively associated with cancer incidence ( Î² = 1.0-6.93) and one protective CpG in
