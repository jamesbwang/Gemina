  We report herein the development of a stereodivergent route towards polyhydroxylated bicyclic azetidine scaffolds , namely 6-azabicyclo ( 3.2.0) heptane derivatives. The strategy hinges on a common bicyclic Î²-lactam precursor , which is forged by way of a rare example of a cationic Dieckmann-type reaction , followed by IBX-mediated desaturation. Substrate-controlled diastereoselective oxidations then allow the divergent preparation of novel iminosugar mimics.
