  Rifamycin-derived drugs , including rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine , and rifaximin , have long been used as first-line therapies for the treatment of tuberculosis<disease> and other deadly infections. However , the late steps leading to the biosynthesis of the industrially important rifamycin SV and B remain largely unknown. Here , we characterize a network of reactions underlying the biosynthesis of rifamycin SV , S , L , O , and B. The two-subunit transketolase Rif15 and the cytochrome P450 enzyme Rif16 are found to mediate , respectively , a unique C-O bond formation in rifamycin L and an atypical P450 ester-to-ether transformation from rifamycin L to B. Both reactions showcase interesting chemistries for these two widespread and well-studied enzyme families.
