  Although aqueous dye lasers are much sought after , they have been of no practical use , as laser dyes show a strong tendency for aggregation in water , thus diminishing their optical output. Contributing towards this shortcoming , we studied the noncovalent interactions of two prominent laser dyes , namely , rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B , with a water soluble macrocyclic host , sulfobutylether-Î²-cyclodextrin ( SBE
