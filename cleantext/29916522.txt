  Peer-run wellness centers provide safe places in the community for individuals with psychiatric disorders to develop personal and community supports , feel needed , and be accepted and grow. Until now , these centers have existed only in the community , not in the state hospital setting. The current article chronicles the development of what the authors believe is the first peer-run wellness center on the grounds of a state psychiatric hospital. After 8 years of operation , the center has served hundreds of visitors. In that time , centers have opened in the state 's other state hospitals and contributed to peer presence in the hospitals ' units and treatment malls. The benefits of peer-run wellness centers are important in the hospital setting as well as the community. Despite institutional barriers , the center was able to address the needs of hospitalized individuals while informing a more recovery-oriented inpatient culture.
