  A porous , sintered , and reaction-bonded Si ₃ N ₄ ( SRBSN) planar membrane was prepared by phase-inversion tape-casting , nitridation ( at 1350 & deg; C) , and sintering ( at 1650 & deg; C) of silicon slurry. The membrane was comprised of uniform rod-like & beta;- Si ₃ N ₄ crystals with a large length/diameter ratio and had high porosity and bending strength. The prepared membrane features a typical asymmetric structure with a skin layer , a sponge layer , and finger-like voids and an average pore size of 0.61 & mu; m. A high permeation flux of 367 L m
