  Conspecific populations of plants in their native range are expected to show considerable variation due to long-term ecological and evolutionary factors. We investigated the levels of secondary metabolites in Heracleum including H. persicum a valuable medicinal plant to depict the magnitude of cryptic variation and the potential significance of novel chemical traits. The essential oil volatiles from fruits of 34 populations from different species of Heracleum in Iranian distribution range and a native and invasive population of H. sphondylium and H. persicum from Norway were analyzed with GC-MS. Out of 48 compounds identified , a contrasting pattern in the level of two major compounds , octyl acetate and hexyl butyrate was found among all studied species. Interestingly , a significant geographic pattern was observed; the hexyl butyrate/octyl acetate ratio was high ( range 1.8-3.2) in the northwestern Iranian populations of H. persicum compared to that in northern and central populations ( range 0.3-0.9). Four populations from Zagros mount chain also exhibited a unique composition. Anethole was found in two populations of H. persicum from central Zagros , not previously reported for essential oil of fruits of Heracleum so far. The results suggest high efficiency of large scale sampling from distribution range of species in identifying novel compounds. The unique pattern of geographic structuring also provides novel information to unravel cryptic variation in Heracleum. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
