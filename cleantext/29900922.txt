  Community water fluoridation is widely used worldwide and its role in preventive dental health care is well established. However , there is sufficient evidence of the ill effects of excessive fluoride content in water , causing skeletal and dental fluorosis. Alongside , there was also extraskeletal and dental manifestations of excessive fluorides reported. They include the effect on thyroid function , but the literature regarding this is sparse. The present systematic review aims to analyze the data from controlled studies about the effect of fluoride on thyroid function. A systematic literature search was performed using PUBMED , MEDLINE , EMBASE , COCHRANE Library , EBSCO search , and the internet search , with language restriction to English. The search included published studies which dealt with the association of fluorine with hypothyroidism , from January 1981 to November 2015. Literature search was done using keywords: fluoride and hypothyroidism , dental fluorosis and thyroid disorders , systemic fluorosis and thyroid disease , excessive water fluoridation and hypothyroidism , thyroid and fluoride , fluorosis and its adverse effects. Out of 166 publications , related to search strategy , 37 full articles which were related with the association of fluoride and hypothyroidism were acquired for further inspection. Out of the 37 articles , 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. The data were extracted and placed in an excel sheet and were analyzed. The analysis suggested a positive correlation of excess fluoride and hypothyroidism. The present systematic review suggests a positive correlation between excess fluoride and hypothyroidism. This calls the need for further well-controlled studies in this otherwise emerging alarming issue. It also calls for considerable community network through health informatics for problem sensitization.
