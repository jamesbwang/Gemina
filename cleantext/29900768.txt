  Two jaguars were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine , ketamine , and isoflurane. Arterial blood samples analyzed shortly after darting revealed no abnormalities. Samples analyzed 2 and 1.5 hr after darting revealed moderate hyperkalemia in both animals ( 6.8 and 6.2 mEq/L , respectively). Shortly after hyperkalemia was recognized , one jaguar developed electrocardiographic abnormalities ( sinoventricular rhythm and widened QRS complexes) , and a few minutes later , suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation with chest compressions , intermittent positive-pressure ventilation , and epinephrine was successful , and autonomous breathing and circulation resumed within a few minutes. Anesthesia-related hyperkalemia has been reported in a variety of large felids but has not been reported previously in jaguars. In all reports , Î±-2 adrenergic agonists were used as part of the immobilization protocol. Due to the presumptively high incidence and mortality caused by this complication , frequent monitoring of electrolyte concentrations and prompt treatment of hyperkalemia is recommended when anesthetizing large felids , including jaguars.
