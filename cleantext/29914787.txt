  A novel ternary system consisting of deep eutectic solvent-alcohol ( DES-OL) mixture was developed for the effective delignification of lignocellulosic biomass. Optimization studies included selecting suitable co-solvent ( among n-BuOH , n-PrOH & EtOAc) for treating biomass ( rice husk , rice straw and wheat straw) , altering the DES-to-alcohol ratio ( 2:1 , 1:1 and 1:2) as well as the reaction temperature ( 50 , 80 and 120 °C). The highest delignification ( ∼ 50 %) was observed using n-butanol assisted DES ( ChCl: OA) at a ratio of 2:1 , with high solid loading of 15 % ( w/v) at 120 °C ( ∼ 1.2 bar) in a 60 min reaction. Post pretreatment , high purity lignin was recovered after distilling off butanol for recycling. Microscopy and CPMAS/NMR studies confirmed the effectiveness of DES-OL pretreatment on biomass delignification.
