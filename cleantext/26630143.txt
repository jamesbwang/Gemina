  We review the cardiovascular and renal outcomes and safety of newer anti-diabetic medications in high-risk patients. We examine the outcomes of the IRIS , EMPA-REG OUTCOME , CANVAS , LEADER , SAVOR-TIMI 53 , and EXAMINE trials demonstrating the cardiovascular and renal benefits of thiazolidinediones , SGLT2 inhibitors , GLP-1 agonists , and DPP-4 inhibitors. Diabetes mellitus is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease with rising prevalence and disease burden. The microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes are well-recognized and include increased risk of cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , and stroke. Newer diabetes medications have demonstrated significant cerebrovascular , cardiovascular , renal , and mortality benefits in high risk patients with diabetes. In addition to their glucose-lowering effects , the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone , SGLT2 inhibitors , GLP-1 agonist , and DPP-4 inhibitors have demonstrated significant cerebrovascular , cardiovascular , renal , and mortality effects. The outcomes and safety data of newer diabetes medications from recent trials demonstrate cardiovascular and mortality effects with significant implications for clinical practice.
