  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) are emerging as novel diagnostic markers of prostate cancer ( PCa) and new determinants of castration-resistant PCa ( CRPC) , an aggressive and metastatic form of PCa. In addition to androgen receptor ( AR) signaling , neuroendocrine differentiation ( NED) is associated with CRPC. Recent reports demonstrate that the downregulation of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor ( REST) protein is a key step in NED of PCa cells. Here , we report HOTAIR as a novel REST-repressed lncRNA that is upregulated in NED PCa cells and in CRPC. HOTAIR overexpression is sufficient to induce , whereas knockdown of HOTAIR suppressed NED of PCa cells. Gene ontology ( GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes under HOTAIR overexpression and in CRPC versus benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) suggests that HOTAIR may participate in PCa progression. Taken together , our results provide the first evidence of lncRNA HOTAIR as a driver for NED of PCa cells.
