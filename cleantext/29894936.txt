  Polyacrylamides of different molecular weight , charges and dosages allow to control the retention and distribution of nanoparticles ( NPs) in composites , and optimise composite properties and functionality. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of high molecular weight ( 13 MDa) cationic polyacrylamide ( CPAM) charge and dosage on SiO
