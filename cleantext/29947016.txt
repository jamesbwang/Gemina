  In the current scenario of endovascular intervention , surgeons have to manually navigate the catheter within the complex vasculature of the human body under the guidance of X-ray. This manual intervention upsurges the possibilities of vessel damage due to frequent contact between the catheter and vasculature wall. In this context , a shape memory alloy-based miniaturized actuator was proposed in this study with a specific aim to reduce vessel wall related damage by improving the bending motions of the guidewire tip in a semi-automatic fashion. The miniaturized actuator was integrated with a FDA-approved guidewire and tested within a patient-specific vascular network model to realize its feasibility in the real surgical environment. The results illustrate that the miniaturized actuator gives a bending angle over 23 ° and lateral displacement over 900 µm to the guide wire tip by which the guidewire can be navigated with precision and possible vessel damage during the catheter intervention can certainly be minimized. In addition to it , the dynamic responses of the presented actuator were further investigated through numerical simulation in conjunction with the analytic analysis.
