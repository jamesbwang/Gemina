  Aberrant hypermethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9) is a key barrier to the development of cloned embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT). The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chaetocin , an inhibitor of H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39 H , in regulating the H3K9 methylation in ovine SCNT embryos. Treatment of sheep fetal fibroblast cells with chaetocin specifically decreased the levels of H3K9 di-and trimethylation , and down-regulated the expression of H3K9 methyltransferases , SUV39H1/2 and G9A. Cloned embryos from chaetocin-treated cells could develop to the blastocyst stage at a similar rate to those derived from non-treated cells. However , direct treatment of SCNT or in vitro fertilized embryos with chaetocin impaired the embryonic development. These results suggest that although chaetocin is a potential agent for modulating H3K9 methylation in cells , it may have an adverse effect on the development of embryos.
