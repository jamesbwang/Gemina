  Thoracoscopic left atrial appendectomy is a minimally invasive procedure for left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , particularly those at a great risk for both stroke and bleeding despite appropriate oral anticoagulant therapy. It serves as an alternative strategy for stroke risk reduction. Moreover , the oral anticoagulant therapy can be discontinued after the operation. However , we encountered a 74-year old male patient who developed cardiogenic stroke after thoracoscopic left atrial appendectomy. We report this case to introduce how we evaluate the risk of postoperative cardiogenic stroke by means of contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomography ( CT) , and how we formulate the postoperative patient management strategy including short-term oral anticoagulation therapy by using results of cardiac CT..
