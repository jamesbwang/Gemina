  Paraquat ( PQ) is a widely used herbicide which is inexpensive and easily accessible for people in rural areas. A small amount of PQ ingestion could be lethal , yet currently , the optimal treatment is still controversial. Extracorporeal therapies ( ECTR) have been practised in PQ poisoning<disease> management , though limited evidence could be obtained to suggest its superiority over conservative therapy. Haemodialysis ( HD) and haemoperfusion ( HP) are most commonly used , while some institutions also choose HP-HD concurrent therapy. The object of the present trial is to investigate whether haemopurification therapy can reduce mortality compared with conservative therapy. This is a planned single-centre , non-blinded , randomised controlled trial. Acute PQ poisoned adults who have orally ingested PQ within 24 hours would be recruited. A total of 360 patients would be recruited and randomly assigned to four groups , that is , HP , HD , concurrent HP-HD and control , at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects would be also stratified by their urine dithionite test results. Primary outcome is 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include survival time , all-cause mortality at the 3rd , 7th and 60th day , rate of major complications , Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation score and Poisoning<disease> Severity Score , etc.. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol and informed consent documents have been approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in September 2017 ( approval number: 2017-KY-10). The result of this trial would be submitted to peer-reviewed journal. NCT03314909; Pre-results.
