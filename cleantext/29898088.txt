  To evaluate the levels of knowledge about asthma of parents of school children. A cross-sectional study was carried out with parents of children with medical diagnosis of asthma ( mild , moderate and severe) , followed up at an outpatient referral center for childhood asthma in the Southern region of Brazil ( Asthma Group). Parents of children with asthma in remission and healthy children were also selected ( Control Group). The Newcastle Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire ( NAKQ) questionnaire was applied in both groups. A total of 154 parents of children participated in the study; in that , 62 ( 40.26 %) in the Asthma Group , and 92 ( 59.74 %) in the Control Group , with a mean age of 35.60 ± 10.03 years. Of these , 132 ( 85.7 %) were female , and 72 ( 46.8 %) parents studied up to high school. The average score of level of knowledge was 18.06 ± 4.11 points. Only 30.5 % parents had acceptable levels of knowledge about asthma , which were more prevalent in the Asthma Group than in the Control Group ( 41.9 % versus 22.8 % , p = 0.01). The mean score in Newcastle Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire ( NAKQ) was higher in the Asthma Group ( 19.32 ± 3.92 versus 17.21 ± 4.03 , p = 0.001) , respectively. The parents with mild and moderate asthmatic children scored more than those of severe asthma ( 19.5 and 19.9 versus 18.2 points , p = 0.02). Most parents had an unsatisfactory level of knowledge about asthma , which reinforces the need for changes in public asthma management programs.
