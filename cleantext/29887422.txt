  The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the fast-track approach in patients undergoing complex liver procedures and to analyse factors that influence morbidity and functional recovery. Hepatic resections ( 2014-2016) were stratified according to difficulty score , obtaining a group of 215 complex resections ( 102 laparoscopic , 163 open). The laparoscopic group was matched by propensity score with open patients to obtain the minimally invasive liver surgery group ( n = 102) and the open group ( n = 102). Groups were similar in terms of patient and disease characteristics. The postoperative morbidity was 31.4 % in the minimally invasive liver surgery and 38.2 % in the open group ( P = .05) , and functional recovery was shorter in the minimally invasive liver surgery ( respectively 4 versus 6 days , P = .041). The adherence to fast-track was high in both groups , with several items with higher penetrance in the minimally invasive liver surgery group. Among factors associated with morbidity and functional recovery , a laparoscopic approach and strict adherence to a fast-track protocol resulted in protective factors. The combination of minimally invasive approaches and fast-track protocols allows a reduced rate of postoperative morbidity and satisfactory functional recovery even in the setting of complex liver resections. When the laparoscopic approach is not feasible , strict adherence to a fast-track program is associated with the achievement of adequate results and should be implemented.
