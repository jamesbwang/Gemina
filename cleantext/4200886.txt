  Previous research has shown that leadership is signaled through nonverbal assertiveness. However , those studies have been mostly conducted in individualistic cultural contexts , such as in the U.S. Here , we suggest that one important strategy for goal attainment in collectivistic cultures is for leaders to self-regulate their behaviors. Thus , contrary to the previous evidence from individualistic cultural contexts , in collectivistic cultural contexts , leaders might suppress nonverbal assertiveness. To test this possibility , we assessed nonverbal behaviors ( NVB) of Japanese leaders and members , and how they were evaluated by observers. We recruited Japanese leaders and members of university clubs and video-recorded them while introducing their club. Then , we coded their nonverbal rank signaling behavior. Finally , we asked a new set of naïve observers to watch these video-clips and to judge targets ' suitability for being possible club leaders. Results of a multilevel analysis ( level 1: individual participants , level 2: clubs) suggested that the more the club culture focused on tasks ( rather than relationships) , the more likely were leaders ( but not members) of those clubs to suppress their nonverbal assertiveness. Naïve observers judged individuals who restrained from emitting nonverbal assertiveness as being more suitable and worthy club leaders. Thus , our findings demonstrate the cultural fit between contextual effects at the collective level ( i.e. , cultural orientation of a group) and the signaling and perceiving of social ranks at the individual level ( i.e. , suppression of nonverbal assertiveness). We discuss the importance of studying the cultural fit between the collective reality that people inhabit and people 's psychology for future research in cultural psychology.
