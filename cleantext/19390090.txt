  Increasing evidences have shown that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. However , the contributions of lncRNAs to colorectal cancer remain largely unknown. Here , we identify a lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 that facilitates colorectal cancer , where it is upregulated. AFAP1-AS1 expression was associated with colorectal cancer patient survival. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation , cell cycle , and tumorigenesis in an subcutaneous mouse xenograft model system. Further data demonstrated that AFAP1-AS1 was associated with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( EZH2) and that this association was required for the repression of EZH2 target genes. Our findings indicate that AFAP1-AS1 is an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression and may be a novel prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Targeting AFAP1-AS1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.
