  Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant , which has been detected at significant concentrations in soils at sites used for fire-fighting training operations. Recent ecotoxicological research has mainly focused on earthworms to assess the toxicity of PFOS in soil. However , the inclusion of other soil taxonomic groups allow for a more holistic estimate of contaminant risk , including the derivation of more comprehensive soil quality guidelines. The present study assessed the toxicity of PFOS using the collembolan , Folsomia candida<pathogen> , and the oribatid mite , Oppia nitens , in two types of soil: a coarse-textured sandy loam ( VSL) and fine-textured clay loam ( NRS). As a standard O. nitens reproduction test is being formalized , the results of the study were also used to compare sensitivity across test species. Effects were soil dependent , with test species being 2-4 times more susceptible to PFOS in VSL , relative to NRS , likely due to differences in organic matter and clay content. Oppia nitens was significantly more sensitive to PFOS , regardless of soil type , in comparison to F. candida<pathogen>. The IC50s for reproduction for O. nitens were 23 mg kg
