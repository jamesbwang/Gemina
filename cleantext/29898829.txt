  To develop a machine learning-based model for the binary classification of chest radiography abnormalities , to serve as a retrospective tool in guiding clinician reporting prioritisation. The open-source machine learning library , Tensorflow , was used to retrain a final layer of the deep convolutional neural network , Inception , to perform binary normality classification on two , anonymised , public image datasets. Re-training was performed on 47,644 images using commodity hardware , with validation testing on 5,505 previously unseen radiographs. Confusion<symptom> matrix analysis was performed to derive diagnostic utility metrics. A final model accuracy of 94.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 94.3-94.7 %) based on an unseen testing subset ( n = 5,505) was obtained , yielding a sensitivity of 94.6 % ( 95 % CI: 94.4-94.7 %) and a specificity of 93.4 % ( 95 % CI: 87.2-96.9 %) with a positive predictive value ( PPV) of 99.8 % ( 95 % CI: 99.7-99.9 %) and area under the curve ( AUC) of 0.98 ( 95 % CI: 0.97-0.99). This study demonstrates the application of a machine learning-based approach to classify chest radiographs as normal or abnormal. Its application to real-world datasets may be warranted in optimising clinician workload.
