  Naturally occurring stress-induced transcriptional readthrough is a recently discovered phenomenon , in which stress conditions lead to dramatic induction of long transcripts as a result of transcription termination failure. In 2015 , we reported the induction of such downstream of gene ( DoG) containing transcripts upon osmotic stress in human cells , while others observed similar transcripts in virus-infected and cancer cells. Using the rigorous methodology Cap-Seq , we demonstrated that DoGs result from transcriptional readthrough , not de novo initiation. More recently , we presented a genome-wide comparison of NIH3T3 mouse cells subjected to osmotic , heat , and oxidative stress and concluded that massive induction of transcriptional readthrough is a hallmark of the mammalian stress response. In their recent letter , Huang and Liu in contrast claim that DoG transcripts result from novel transcription initiation near the ends of genes. Their conclusions rest on analyses of a publicly available transcription start site ( TSS-Seq) dataset from unstressed NIH3T3 cells. Here , we present evidence that this dataset identifies not only true transcription start sites , TSSs , but also 5 '- ends of numerous snoRNAs , which are generally processed from introns in mammalian cells. We show that failure to recognize these erroneous assignments in the TSS-Seq dataset , as well as ignoring published Cap-Seq data on TSS mapping during osmotic stress , have led to misinterpretation by Huang and Liu. We conclude that , contrary to the claims made by Huang and Liu , TSS-Seq reads near gene ends can not explain the existence of DoGs , nor their stress-mediated induction. Rather it is , as we originally demonstrated , transcriptional readthrough that leads to the formation of DoGs.
