  BackgroundFatigue in myasthenia gravis ( MG) is common and difficult to manage. Unlike myasthenic weakness<symptom> it is not amenable to drug therapies.ObjectiveOur primary aim was to investigate whether a combination of physical and psychological therapy would help address symptoms of fatigue<symptom> in MG patients , who have stable disease but residual problematic fatigue<symptom>. Our secondary aim was to quantitate fatigue<symptom> by applying different scores and to ascertain which would be most relevant to apply in MG.MethodsWe recruited 10 MG patients with stable disease and who suffer from fatigue<symptom>. Nine of these 10 patients participated in a 10-week program that involved physical and psychological intervention. We quantified their fatigue<symptom> using the modified fatigue<symptom> impact scale ( MFIS) , the visual analogue fatigue<symptom> scale ( VAFS) and the fatigue<symptom> severity scale ( FSS) at the start of the study , at various intervals during the program and 3 months later.ResultsDuring the program , there was a small improvement in the physical and psychosocial subscale of the MFIS. There was a significant improvement ( p < 0.01) in the VAFS at the end of the program. No clear improvement was noted in FSS. Three months later , all fatigue<symptom> scores declined to baseline but 50 % of patients had made some life-style changes.ConclusionsThis is a small pilot study , which utilized a combined approach with physical and psychological therapy , and showed some benefit in improving fatigue<symptom> in patients with MG. The improvement was small and unsustained. Because of the small patient cohort , one can not derive any firm conclusions and a larger study is required to investigate this further.
