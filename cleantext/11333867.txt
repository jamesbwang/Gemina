  The standard method for personal identification and verification of urine samples in doping control is short tandem repeat ( STR) analysis using nuclear DNA ( nDNA). The DNA concentration of urine is very low and decreases under most conditions used for sample storage; therefore , the amount of DNA from cryopreserved urine samples may be insufficient for STR analysis. We aimed to establish a multiplexed assay for urine mitochondrial DNA typing containing only trace amounts of DNA , particularly for Japanese populations. A multiplexed suspension-array assay using oligo-tagged microspheres ( Luminex MagPlex-TAG) was developed to measure C-stretch length in hypervariable region 1 ( HV1) and 2 ( HV2) , five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) , and one polymorphic indel. Based on these SNPs and the indel , the Japanese population can be classified into five major haplogroups ( D4 , B , M7a , A , D5). The assay was applied to DNA samples from urine cryopreserved for 1- 1.5 years ( n = 63) and fresh blood ( n = 150). The assay with blood DNA enabled Japanese subjects to be categorized into 62 types , exhibiting a discriminatory power of 0.960. The detection limit for cryopreserved urine was 0.005 ng of nDNA. Profiling of blood and urine pairs revealed that 5 of 63 pairs showed different C-stretch patterns in HV1 or HV2. The assay described here yields valuable information in terms of the verification of urine sample sources employing only trace amounts of recovered DNA. However , blood can not be used as a reference sample.
