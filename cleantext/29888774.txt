  In this presented work , a series of designs and experiments have been constructed to study how a DNA structure affected the fluorescence of silver nanoclusters ( AgNCs). A `` bulb ''- like DNA structure was firstly used as the synthesizing template , and bright green-emitting AgNCs were obtained with a quantum yield of 17.2 %. The `` DNA bulb '' structure was assembled using three single-stranded oligonucleotides ( ssDNAs) , with a flexible ssDNA<pathogen> part serving as the `` filament ''. The results seemed intriguing as luminous AgNCs could be obtained only when the complete spatial structure was formed. To further investigate the role of the `` bulb '' structure , thirteen cytosine-rich sequences were employed as the `` filament '' , respectively. Interestingly , the fluorescence intensities of AgNCs were all enhanced after the `` filament '' ssDNA<pathogen> was integrated into the `` bulb '' structure. The enhancement was as much as 175.2-fold , and the minimum enhancement was 1.3-fold. Spectral analyses were then conducted to give an understanding of the role of cytosine. When the sequences in the `` bulb shell '' were changed , the `` DNA bulb '' structure still showed an enhancing effect. Finally , the green-emitting AgNCs were utilized toward the selective detection of Hg2 + to demonstrate potential applications.
