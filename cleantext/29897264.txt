  To examine the relationship between extended high-frequency pure tone hearing thresholds ( frequencies 10 to 14 kHz) and working memory capacity ( WMC) , inhibitory control , and cognitive flexibility. Experimental study measuring correlations between different high-frequency hearing threshold measures and cognitive measures. Pure tone audiometry was assessed in the extended high-frequency ( frequencies 10 , 12.5 and 14 kHz). Subjects were also tested regarding WMC , inhibitory control ( response inhibition) , and cognitive flexibility ( information updating and shifting ability). Forty-three subjects between 20 and 29 years old with normal hearing ( â‰¤ 20 dB HL) in the frequency range between 0.125 to 8 kHz. No significant correlations were seen between high-frequency hearing thresholds defined as average best and worst ear high-frequency hearing thresholds and the cognitive measures. Differences between the best and the worst ear showed significant negative correlations with inhibitory control and global executive function ( combination score for WMC , inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility). The present study suggests that global executive functions , more specifically response inhibition , and hearing threshold asymmetry in the extended high-frequency range are interrelated.
