  To protect the aquatic living resources of Chesapeake Bay , the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership has developed guidance for state water quality standards , which include ambient water quality criteria to protect designated uses ( DUs) , and associated assessment procedures for dissolved oxygen ( DO) , water clarity/underwater bay grasses , and chlorophyll-a. For measuring progress toward meeting the respective states ' water quality standards , a multimetric attainment indicator approach was developed to estimate combined standards attainment. We applied this approach to three decades of monitoring data of DO , water clarity/underwater bay grasses , and chlorophyll-a data on annually updated moving 3-year periods to track the progress in all 92 management segments of tidal waters in Chesapeake Bay. In 2014-2016 , 40 % of tidal water segment-DU-criterion combinations in the Bay ( n = 291) are estimated to meet thresholds for attainment of their water quality criteria. This index score marks the best 3-year status in the entire record. Since 1985-1987 , the indicator has followed a nonlinear trajectory , consistent with impacts from extreme weather events and subsequent recoveries. Over the period of record ( 1985-2016) , the indicator exhibited a positive and statistically significant trend ( p < 0.05) , indicating that the Bay has been recovering since 1985. Patterns of attainment of individual DUs are variable , but improvements in open water DO , deep channel DO , and water clarity/submerged aquatic vegetation have combined to drive the improvement in the Baywide indicator in 2014-2016 relative to its long-term median. Finally , the improvement in estimated Baywide attainment was statistically linked to the decline of total nitrogen , indicating responsiveness of attainment status to the reduction of nutrient load through various management actions since at least the 1980s.
