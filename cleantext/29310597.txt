  Following the publication of this article ( 1) , the authors noticed found that they incorrectly reported the BUSCO completeness for the PhyloFish brown trout and European whitefish transcriptomes. This was due to an error in their TransDecoder pipeline and restricted to those two datasets and their interpretation. They apologise for this misreported result and thank the authors of the PhyloFish database for bringing it to their attention.
