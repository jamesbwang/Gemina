  REACH is a regulation of the European Union adopted to improve the safe use of chemicals with regard to human health and the environment. The safe use of chemicals can be achieved only if the hazard and the exposure of the substances are well characterized. Testing on animals has been traditionally the main tool for hazard assessment. For ethical and economic reasons , alternative ways of testing that do not use laboratory animals have been developed by different parties ( regulatory agencies , researchers , industry) over the recent decades , and their proper use in hazard assessment is encouraged under REACH. In this chapter , we describe how ( Q) SAR models and predictions are included into REACH and their adequate use promoted by the European Chemicals Agency ( ECHA).
