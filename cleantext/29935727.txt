  Better characterisation and understanding of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) development and progression lead to better diagnosis and clinical outcomes. In this study , expression of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) subunits: p65 ( RelA) , p105/p50 , p100/p52 , and cRel in RCC tissue were compared with corresponding normal kidney , along with tumour characteristics and survival outcome. Ninety-six cases of RCC with paired normal kidney were analysed. Clinicopathological data , demographics and survival data were available. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) for NF-κB subtypes was analysed using the Aperio digital pathology system for overall cellular expression and localisation. The prognostic cancer-specific survival value of the subunits in RCC patients was analysed. Approximately 50 % of patients had clinical stage T1 , with 22 patients having metastases at presentation. RCC subtypes were: clear cell ( n = 76); papillary ( n = 11); chromophobe ( n = 5); clear cell tubulopapillary ( n = 3); and one multilocular cystic RCC. Median follow up was 54.5 months ( 0.2-135) , with 28 deaths at time of analysis. NF-κB p65 had higher overall and nuclear expressions , with lower overall and nuclear expressions of p50 , p52 and cRel in RCC compared with normal kidney. Higher expressions of p65 ( nuclear) , p52 ( overall and nuclear) and p50 ( overall) correlated significantly with worse cancer-specific survival. This is the first large series of analysis of expression of NF-κB subunits in RCC. Especially with regards to the less studied subunits ( p52 , p50 , cRel) , our results allow a better understanding the role of NF-κB in RCC development and progression , and may pave the way for future targeted NF-κB subunit specific therapies.
