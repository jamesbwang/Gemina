  Quantitative analysis of shape and form is critical in many biological disciplines , as context-dependent morphotypes reflect changes in gene expression and physiology , e.g. , in comparisons of environment-dependent phenotypes , forward/reverse genetic assays or shape development during ontogenesis. 3D-shape rendering methods produce models with arbitrarily numbered , and therefore non-comparable , mesh points. However , this prevents direct comparisons. We introduce a workflow that allows the generation of comparable 3D models based on several specimens. Translocations between points of modelled morphotypes are plotted as heat maps and statistically tested. With this workflow , we are able to detect , model and investigate the significance of shape and form alterations in all spatial dimensions , demonstrated with different morphotypes of the pond-dwelling microcrustacean
