  Oxygen reduction reaction underpins the development of the whole fuel-cell field , where there is a strong impetus to develop efficient and stable catalysts that can replace the precious metal Pt/C. Herein , a series of excellent catalysts for ORR derived from Ce/La dual lanthanide metal-organic framework with functional Lewis-basic sites were synthesized for the first time. The synergistic effect of high concentration of oxygen vacancies from La-embedded CeO
