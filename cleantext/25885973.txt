  Sugammadex is a novel drug capable of reversing paralysis induced by the common steroidal nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs , rocuronium and vecuronium. Reversal is complete at any depth of blockade dependent on the dose of sugammadex administered. This allows rocuronium to be used as a rescue agent in scenarios where succinylcholine is contraindicated. Sugammadex is considered a safe drug with minimal side effects compared with traditional reversal with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. This article features a case report where succinylcholine was undesirable and rapid reversal of paralysis with sugammadex was used during general anesthesia for dentistry.
