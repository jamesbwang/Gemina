  Probiotics have tremendous potential to develop healthy diets , treatment , and prevention. Investigation of in vitro cultural properties of health-promoting microorganisms like lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) and bifidobacteria is crucial to select probiotic strains for treatments based on gut microbiota modulation to justify individualized and personalized approach for nutrition and prevention of variety of diseases. The We studied six LAB strains ( The studied strains of LAB and bifidobacteria did not form spores , were positively stained by Gram , grow on medium in a wide range of pH ( 1.0-9.0 , optimum pH 5.5-6.5) , were sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics; and showed different resistance to gastric juice , bile , and pancreatic enzymes. The most resistant to antibiotics were We recognized strain-dependent properties of studied LAB and bifidobacteria probiotic strains ( adhesive ability , resistance to antibiotics , and gut biological fluids) and discussed potential for most effective individualized treatment for gut and distant sites microbiome modulation.
