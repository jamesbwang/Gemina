  Despite extensive testing , the efficacy of low-frequency ( 1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) of temporo-parietal targets for the treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations ( AVH) in patients with schizophrenia is still controversial , but promising results have been reported with both high-frequency and neuronavigated rTMS. Here , we report a double-blind sham-controlled study to assess the efficacy of high-frequency ( 20 Hz) rTMS applied over a precise anatomical site in the left temporal region using neuronavigation. Fifty-nine of 74 randomized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders ( DSM-IV R) were treated with rTMS or sham treatment and fully evaluated over 4 weeks. The rTMS target was determined by morphological MRI at the crossing between the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus ( STS). The primary outcome was response to treatment , defined as a 30 % decrease of the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale ( AHRS) frequency item , observed at 2 successive evaluations. While there was no difference in primary outcome between the treatment groups , the percentages of patients showing a decrease of more than 30 % of AHRS score ( secondary outcome) did differ between the active ( 34.6 %) and sham groups ( 9.1 %) ( P = .016) at day 14. This controlled study reports negative results on the primary outcome but demonstrates a transient effect of 20 Hz rTMS guided by neuronavigation and targeted on an accurate anatomical site for the treatment of AVHs in schizophrenia patients.
