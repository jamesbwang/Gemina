  Little is known about the molecular mechanism of the rare coexistence of Leber 's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy ( LHON) and multiple sclerosis ( MS) , also known as the Harding 's syndrome<disease>. In this study , we provide novel evidence that the m. 11778A > G variant causes a defective metabolic interplay between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. We used dermal fibroblasts derived from a female proband exhibiting clinical symptoms compatible with LHON-MS due to the presence of the pathogenic m. 11778A > G variant at near homoplasmic levels. Our mitochondrial morphometric analysis reveals abnormal cristae architecture. Live-cell respiratory studies show stunted metabolic potential and spare respiratory capacity , vital for cell survival upon a sudden energy demand. The m. 11778 A > G variant also alters glycolytic activities with a diminished compensatory glycolysis , thereby preventing an efficient metabolic reprogramming during a mitochondrial ATP crisis. Our collective results provide evidence of limited bioenergetic flexibility in the presence of the m. 11778 A > G variant. Our study sheds light on the potential pathophysiologic mechanism of the m. 11778 A > G variant leading to energy crisis in this patient with the LHON-MS disease.
