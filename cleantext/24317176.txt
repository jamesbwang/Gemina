  Endocrine therapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Renal metastasis of breast cancer is rare in clinical practice. We present here a 54-year-old woman with breast cancer after first line chemotherapy and second line endocrinotherapy ( i.e. , toremifene & exemestane) failure. The patient was rarely diagnosed breast cancer metastasis to the kidney and a positive hormone status ( ER and PR) but was negative for human epidermal factor receptor 2 ( HER2). The patient was treated with a high dose of fulvestrant ( SERD; 500 mg) by intramuscular injection once per month. The patient 's condition significantly improved as measured by a decrease in the renal and pulmonary masses; symptoms including dry<symptom> cough<symptom> and blood phlegm<symptom> also improved. Endocrinotherapy with high-dose fulvestrant may provide benefits for patients with HR +/ HER2- advanced breast cancer with renal metastasis after SERMs failure.
