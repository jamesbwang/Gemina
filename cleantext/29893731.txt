  Municipal solid waste ( MSW) landfills now represent one of the most important issues related to the waste management cycle. Knowledge of biogas production is a key aspect for the proper exploitation of this energy source , even in the post-closure period. In the present study , a simple mathematical model was proposed for the simulation of biogas production. The model is based on first-order biodegradation kinetics and also takes into account the temperature variation in time and depth as well as landfill settlement. The model was applied to an operating landfill located in Sicily , in Italy , and the first results obtained are promising. Indeed , the results showed a good fit between measured and simulated data. Based on these promising results , the model can also be considered a useful tool for landfill operators for a reliable estimate of the duration of the post-closure period.
