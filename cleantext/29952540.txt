  Zinc-oxide ( ZnO) is widely used as an n-type electron transporting layer ( ETL) for quantum dot ( QD) light-emitting diode ( QLED) because various metal doping can be possible and ZnO nanoparticle can be processed at low temperatures. We report here a Li- and Mg-doped ZnO , MLZO , which is used for ETL of highly efficient and long lifetime QLEDs. Co-doping , Mg and Li , in ZnO increases its band gap and electrical resistivity and thus can enhance charge balance<symptom> in emission layer ( EML). It is found also that the O-H concentration at the oxide surface decreases and exciton decay time of QDs on the metal oxide increases by co-doping in ZnO. The inverted green QLEDs with MLZO ETL exhibits the maximum current efficiency ( CE
