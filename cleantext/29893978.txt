  Results from radon measurements by active sampling of indoor air in the buildings within the Nuclear Scientific Experimental and Educational Centre ( NSEEC) protected site at the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy ( INRNE) are presented. The inspected buildings included in this report are the IRT research reactor structure and several auxiliary formations wherein the laundry facilities and the gamma irradiator GOU-1 ( 60Co source) are installed as well as the Central Alarm Station ( CAS) premises. Besides the reactor hall and the primary cooling loop area , special attention was given to the premises of the First Class Radiochemical Laboratory in the IRT reactor basement. Determination of radon concentration distribution in the premises of the constructions within the site is an important part of radiation surveillance during the operation and maintenance of the NSEEC facilities as well as for their involvement in the educational activities at INRNE.
