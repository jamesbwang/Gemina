  Fear-potentiated startle ( FPS) paradigms provide insight into fear learning mechanisms that contribute to impairment among individuals with posttraumatic stress symptoms ( PTSS). Electrophysiology also has provided insight into these mechanisms through the examination of event-related potentials ( ERPs) such as the P100 and LPP. It remains unclear , however , whether the P100 and LPP may be related to fear learning processes within the FPS paradigm. To this end , we tested differences in ERP amplitudes for conditioned stimuli associated ( CS +) and not associated ( CS-) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US) during fear acquisition. Participants included 54 female undergraduate students ( mean age = 20.26). The FPS response was measured via electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle. EEG data were collected during the FPS paradigm. While the difference between CS + and CS- P100 amplitude was not significant , LPP amplitudes were significantly enhanced following the CS + relative to CS-. Furthermore , the LPP difference wave ( CS + minus CS-) was associated with FPS scores for the CS- during the later portion of fear acquisition. These findings suggest that conditioned stimuli may have altered emotional encoding ( LPP) during the FPS paradigm. Thus , the LPP may be a promising neurophysiological marker that is related to fear learning processes.
