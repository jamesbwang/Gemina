  Objectives This study aimed to examine the prevalence of weight misperception and to explore the association of weight perception with physical activity and dietary intake. Methods A population-based , nationally representative cross-sectional survey was conducted of 920 Thai adolescents aged 13 to 24 years. Respondents were selected using stratified multistage sampling. Respondents who agreed to participate were asked to complete the Youth Risk Behavior Questionnaire. Results Females were more likely than males to misperceive themselves as overweight ( 21.8 % vs. 11.7 %) , whereas males were more likely than females to misperceive themselves as underweight ( 12.3 % vs. 3.4 %). Males were more likely than females to report a high intake of vegetables ( 45.7 % vs. 38.0 %) , milk ( 39.1 % vs. 38.0 %) , 100 % fruit juice ( 20.9 % vs. 17.7 %) and soda or pop ( 38.5 % vs. 20.6 %). Males were also more likely than females to report vigorous physical activity of more than 60 minutes per day ( 38.1 % vs. 21.3 %) and vigorous exercise to strengthen or tone<symptom> muscles ( 37.3 % vs. 13.2 %). Conclusions Gender differences in dietary intake and physical activity were identified. However , there were no significant differences in dietary intake and physical activity between adolescents who correctly perceived themselves as overweight and those who misperceived themselves as overweight.
