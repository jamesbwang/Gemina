  Sodium nitroprusside lowers blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> by vasodilatation but is reported to reduce cerebral blood flow. In healthy young men sodium nitroprusside reduced blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , total peripheral resistance , and arterial CO Cerebral autoregulation maintains cerebral blood flow ( CBF) despite marked changes in mean arterial pressure ( MAP). Sodium nitroprusside ( SNP) reduces blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> by vasodilatation but is reported to lower CBF , probably by a reduction in its perfusion pressure. We evaluated the influence of SNP on CBF and aimed for a 20 % and then 40 % reduction in MAP , while keeping MAP ≥ 50 mmHg , to challenge cerebral autoregulation. In 19 healthy men ( age 24 ± 4 years; mean ± SD) duplex ultrasound determined right internal carotid ( ICA) and vertebral artery ( VA) blood flow. The SNP reduced MAP ( from 83 ± 8 to 69 ± 8 and 58 ± 4 mmHg; both P < 0.0001) , total peripheral resistance , and arterial CO
