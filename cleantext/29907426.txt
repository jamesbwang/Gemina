  The incidence of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( TAPVC) in the Caucasian population is 2.5/ 100,000 live births ( LB) , and the incidence in the Hispanic population is 19.8/ 100,000 LB. Without knowing the exact etiology for the development of congenital heart disease , our objective was to determine the maternal factors associated with the development of TAPVC. 55 mother-child binomials with isolated TAPVC ( group I) and 152 healthy mother-child binomials ( group II) were included. Both groups had no maternal history of addiction , pre-eclampsia , or type 1 , 2 or gestational diabetes mellitus. Complete clinical histories were obtained for the women in both groups and perinatal and birth data were recorded. In addition , genealogies across three generations were constructed to determine affected first- or second-degree relatives with complex congenital heart disease. Among the maternal characteristics analyzed , women in group I had a higher number of pregnancies before gestation of the index case ( p = < 0.05) , and the Body Mass Index ( BMI) before pregnancy was higher compared to Group II ( p < 0.05) , with an adjusted risk of OR = 3.6 ( p = 0.011). The family history showed a higher prevalence in the group of patients with TAPVC compared to healthy children ( p < 0.05). Maternal obesity before pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of CATVP in children in the Mexican population.
