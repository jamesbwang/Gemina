  Protein aggregation causes α-synuclein to switch from its physiological role to a pathological toxic gain of function. Under physiological conditions , monomeric α-synuclein improves ATP synthase efficiency. Here , we report that aggregation of monomers generates beta sheet-rich oligomers that localise to the mitochondria in close proximity to several mitochondrial proteins including ATP synthase. Oligomeric α-synuclein impairs complex I-dependent respiration<symptom>. Oligomers induce selective oxidation of the ATP synthase beta subunit and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation. These oxidation events increase the probability of permeability transition pore ( PTP) opening , triggering mitochondrial swelling , and ultimately cell death. Notably , inhibition of oligomer-induced oxidation prevents the pathological induction of PTP. Inducible pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC)- derived neurons bearing SNCA triplication , generate α-synuclein aggregates that interact with the ATP synthase and induce PTP opening , leading to neuronal death. This study shows how the transition of α-synuclein from its monomeric to oligomeric structure alters its functional consequences in Parkinson 's disease.
