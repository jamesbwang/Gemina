  Simple photonic fiber-based workbenches have been able to emulate well-known nonlinear wave dynamics occurring in deep or shallow water conditions. Here , by investigating the nonlinear reshaping of a flat-top pulse upon propagation in an anomalous dispersive optical fiber , we observe that typical signatures of focusing dam break flows and Peregrine-like breather events can locally coexist in spontaneous pattern formations. The experimental measurements are in good agreement with our numerical predictions.
