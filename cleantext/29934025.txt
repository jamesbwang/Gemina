  To evaluate the impact of parental weight<symptom> status<symptom> and offspring cardiorespiratory fitness on the risk of obesity among Chinese children. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Wuhan , China from May to June 2010. Children 's height , weight , and waist circumference were measured for assessing their total and central obesity. Their cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by the 20-m shuttle-run test. We calculated parental body mass index according to self-reported height and weight , and divided it into normal weight or overweight/obesity. Multivariable logistic regression model was applied to estimate the combined relationships of cardiorespiratory fitness and parental weight<symptom> status<symptom> with the risk of obesity of children. A total of 587 Chinese children ( 343 boys and 244 girls) aged 9.6 ( 0.7) years participated in this study. Compared with those who had low cardiorespiratory fitness and at least 1 parent with overweight/obesity , children who had high cardiorespiratory fitness and at least 1 parent with overweight/obesity reported lower risks of total obesity ( OR 0.12 , 95 % CI .05-0.30) and central obesity ( OR .09 , 95 % CI .04-0.20) , and children who had high cardiorespiratory fitness and no parent with overweight/obesity were 89 % ( OR 0.11 , 95 % CI .05-0.24) less likely to have total obesity and 92 % ( OR .08 , 95 % CI .04-0.16) less likely to have central obesity ( all P < .001). High level of cardiorespiratory fitness among children could attenuate the influence of parental obesity on their offspring 's
