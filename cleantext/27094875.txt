  Different dimensions of carbon materials with various features have captured numerous interests due to their applications on the tremendous fields. Restricted by the raw materials and devices , the controlling of their morphology is a major challenge. Utilizing the catalytic features of the intermediates from the low-cost salts and polymerization of 0D carbon quantum dots ( CQDs) , 0D CQDs are expected to self-assemble into 1/2/3D carbon structures with the assistance of temperature-induced intermediates ( e.g. , ZnO , Ni , and Cu) from the salts ( ZnCl
