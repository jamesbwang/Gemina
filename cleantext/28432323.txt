  We present a multimodal approach for measuring the three-dimensional ( 3D) refractive index ( RI) and fluorescence distributions of live cells by combining optical diffraction tomography ( ODT) and 3D structured illumination microscopy ( SIM). A digital micromirror device is utilized to generate structured illumination patterns for both ODT and SIM , which enables fast and stable measurements. To verify its feasibility and applicability , the proposed method is used to measure the 3D RI distribution and 3D fluorescence image of various samples , including a cluster of fluorescent beads , and the time-lapse 3D RI dynamics of fluorescent beads inside a HeLa cell , from which the trajectory of the beads in the HeLa cell is analyzed using spatiotemporal correlations.
