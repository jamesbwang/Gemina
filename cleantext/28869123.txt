  The main role of pretreatment is to reduce the natural biomass recalcitrance and thus enhance saccharification yield. A further prerequisite for efficient utilization of all biomass components is their efficient fractionation into well-defined process streams. Currently available pretreatment methods only partially fulfill these criteria. Steam explosion , for example , excels as a pretreatment method but has limited potential for fractionation , whereas organosolv is excellent for delignification but offers poor biomass deconstruction. In this article , a hybrid method combining the cooking and fractionation of conventional organosolv pretreatment with the implementation of an explosive discharge of the cooking mixture at the end of pretreatment was developed. The effects of various pretreatment parameters ( ethanol content , duration , and addition of sulfuric acid) were evaluated. Pretreatment of birch at 200 Â°C with 60 % v/v ethanol and 1 % w/w The novel hybrid method developed in this study allowed for the efficient fractionation of birch biomass and production of pretreated solids with high cellulose and low lignin contents. Moreover , the explosive discharge at the end of pretreatment had a positive effect on enzymatic saccharification , resulting in high hydrolyzability of the pretreated solids and elevated ethanol titers in the following high-gravity SSF. To the best of our knowledge , the ethanol concentration obtained with this method is the highest so far for birch biomass.
