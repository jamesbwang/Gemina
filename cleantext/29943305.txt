  Single cell sequencing is important to detect the gene heterogeneity between cells , as the part of single-cell systems biology which combines computational science , mathematical modelling and high-throughput technologies with biological function and organization in the cell. We initially arise the question how to integrate the outcomes of single-cell systems biology with clinical phenotype , interpret alterations of single-cell gene sequencing and function in patient response to therapies , and understand the significance of single-cell systems biology in the discovery and development of new molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. The present review furthermore focuses the significance of singe cell systems biology in respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> and calls the special attention from scientists who are working on single cell systems biology to improve the diagnosis and therapy for patients with lung diseases.
