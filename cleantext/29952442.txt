  The aim was to review paediatric patients who had a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture or bacterial PCR test , yet had a normal CSF white cell count for age. Patients were included if they had a CSF sample sent for culture ( between 2005 and 2015) or bacterial PCR ( 2010-2015) , however neurosurgical and neurology patients were excluded. Of the 2,482 patients reviewed , there were 101 patients with laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis<disease> included , of which 27 were positive by culture and PCR , 26 by culture alone and 48 were positive by PCR only. Eighteen ( 18 %) of these patients had CSF white cell counts within normal range. Only one case with a normal CSF white cell count , where the lumbar puncture was done after six days of antibiotics , was deemed to be clinically significant. Bacterial PCR should not be routinely requested in patients with a normal CSF white cell count , unless their blood culture is positive or unless clinically indicated based on the assessment of a senior paediatrician.
