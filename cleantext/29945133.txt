  Based on the assumptions that depersonalization symptoms are relevant for test anxiety<symptom> maintenance , we examined their frequency , psychological predictors , association with anxiety<symptom> symptoms , and association with test performance. In Study 1 , 203 students rated their test anxiety<symptom> severity and depersonalization in their last oral examination. In Study 2 , we assessed test anxiety<symptom> 1 week before an oral examination , depersonalization , safety behaviors , self-focused attention , and negative appraisals of depersonalization directly after the examination , and post-event processing 1 week later among 67 students. In Study 1 , 47.3 % reported at least one moderate depersonalization symptom. In Study 2 , test anxiety<symptom> and negative appraisals of depersonalization significantly predicted depersonalization. Depersonalization was linked to a higher intensity of safety behaviors and post-event processing but not to self-focused attention. It was not related to performance. Results are limited by the non-random sampling and the small sample size of Study 2. However , by showing that depersonalization contributes to the processes the maintenance of test anxiety<symptom> , the findings confirm that depersonalization- normally understood as an adaptive mechanism to cope with stressful events- can become maladaptive.
