  The aim of this nationwide descriptive survey was to assess the use of regional anesthesia in obstetrics in Greek public hospitals. The survey was conducted between March and August , 2016. A structured questionnaire was sent to 50 Anesthesia Departments in Greek Public Hospitals with obstetric units. The response rate was 94 %. Data corresponded to 9475 cesarean and 8155 vaginal deliveries. Regional anesthesia was used in 69.2 % of cesarean , with single shot spinal being the most popular technique ( 44.3 % of all cesarean). Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was used in 18.1 % of all cesarean ( 35.1 % in Athens versus 7.9 % in periphery , p < 0.001). Post-cesarean analgesia was mainly based on simple analgesics and systematic opioids ( 78.6 %). Long acting spinal opioids were rarely used ( in 4.4 % of spinals and spinal/epidurals). Labor epidural analgesia was applied in 19.1 % of all vaginal deliveries ( 30.3 % in Athens versus 13.1 % in periphery , p < 0.001). Paracetamol and pethidine represented the standard labor analgesia in 48.9 % and 55.3 % of hospitals , respectively. Intravenous remifentanil was used in 10.6 % of hospitals ( 50 % of Athens ' versus 2.5 % of peripheral hospitals , p = 0.002). In 48.9 % of hospitals , mainly in periphery , the anesthesiologists did not get involved in labor analgesia. Regional anesthesia represents the most common practice for cesarean in Greek public hospitals , but still the percentage of general anesthesia remains high. Also , the use of labor epidural analgesia is quite limited , especially in periphery.
