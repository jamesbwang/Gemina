  MiR-338-5p expression is reportedly upregulated in colorectal cancer ( CRC) tissues. Clinicopathologic features show that miR-338-5p overexpression correlates with the metastatic status of CRC patients. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of serum miR-338-5p for CRC. We obtained peripheral blood samples from 210 individuals , including 80 CRC patients , 50 colorectal polyp ( CRP) patients and 80 healthy controls ( HCs). Serum miR-338-5p was quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). Area under the curve ( AUC) values of the receiver operating curve were used to estimate the diagnostic values of miR-338-5p , CEA and their combination. The serum miR-338-5p levels in CRC , CRP and HC patients were 4.94 ± 1.13 , 4.12 ± 0.75 and 3.07 ± 0.75 , respectively. These values were significantly different from each other. The AUC values of miR-338-5p in CRC patients were 0.923 ( 95 % CI: 0.882- 0.964) and 0.845 ( 95 % CI: 0.792- 0.898) when compared with those of HCs and non-CRC subjects , respectively. The AUC value of the combination of miR-338-5p and CEA was 0.932 ( 95 % CI: 0.882- 0.964) , with a sensitivity of 85 % , specificity of 88.8 % , and cut-off value of 8.16. Circulating miR-338-5p may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for CRC detection. The combination of miR-338-5p and CEA exhibited the greatest diagnostic value in our study.
