  Sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots ( S-GQDs) were synthesized by two facile hydrothermal technologies. The photoluminescence ( PL) properties of the GQDs and S-GQDs samples were mainly investigated. Through regulating the content of S powders in S-GQDs synthesizing process , the optimal S-GQDs have a high S/C atomic ratio of 19.53 %. The S doping introduce more functional groups on the C sp
