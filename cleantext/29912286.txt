  Reported classifications of germinal vesicle ( GV) chromatin configurations in pig oocytes were not done by uniform standards and they were not well correlated with oocyte competence. In this study , GV-chromatin of pig oocytes was classified into non-surrounded nucleolus ( NSN) , surrounded nucleolus ( SN) , partly NSN ( pNSN) and SN ( pSN) , prematurely-condensed NSN ( cNSN) , pNSN ( cpNSN) and pSN ( cpSN) , and early diakinesis ( ED) patterns. During in vitro maturation in 199-medium , NSN oocytes from 1-2 mm follicles went consecutively through pNSN , pSN , cpSN and ED before undergoing GV breakdown , and chromatin in some SN oocytes from 3-6 mm follicles re-decondensed into a RDC configuration. Under unfavorable conditions such as follicle atresia , ovary handling or maturation in simple MEM-medium , however , premature chromatin condensation occurred , forming cNSN , cpNSN and cpSN patterns. While all NSN and pNSN and some pSN and RDC oocytes actively transcribed , no cNSN , cpNSN or cpSN oocytes showed transcription. Maturation and embryo culture suggested that SN and pSN oocytes were more competent than NSN and pNSN oocytes; cpSN oocytes were more competent than cNSN/cpNSN oocytes; and only RDC oocytes could develop into blastocysts. It is concluded that the newly classified chromatin configurations are more closely correlated with oocyte competence than those reported previously.
