  There are limited treatment options for patients with a chronic refractory greater trochanteric pain syndrome<disease>. Orthobiologic interventions may stimulate tendon healing and improve pain and function in patients who fail the standard conservative treatment. Since the US FDA 's new position statement regarding the centrifugation of bone<disease> marrow aspirate products as a potentially ` more than minimally manipulated ' product , there is a growing concern about the most common bone<disease> marrow aspirate concentrate technique. In this case , a 57 year old female with a debilitating chronic greater trochanteric pain syndrome<disease> was treated with a pure autologous bone<disease> marrow aspirate injection using a novel aspiration technique. The patient showed significant improvements in pain and function without recurrence at 1-year follow-up. This is the first case report to illustrate this novel technique for aspirating pure bone<disease> marrow that should comply with the new FDA regulations.
