  This study was performed in order to evaluate efficiency of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy ( NIRS) for the determination of fatty acid composition ratio of sunflower seeds and to compare performance of calibration methods. Calibration equations were developed using modified partial least squares ( MPLS) and partial least squares ( PLS) regression methods. Ninety-three sunflower seed varieties were from test field of East Mediterranean Agricultural Research Institute. In order to determine the reference fatty acid values needed to construct calibration in NIRS analysis , sunflower seed samples were analyzed by gas chromatography method. Coefficients of determination ( R
