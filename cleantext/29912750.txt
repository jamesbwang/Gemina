  Upon diagnosis , distant metastases are encountered in 21-50 % of neuroendocrine tumours ( NETs). However , few systemic treatment options are available for the well-differentiated NETs in the metastatic stage. Lu-DOTATATE is one of the most effective treatments in this limited patient group. We retrospectively investigated its efficacy and effect on the survival in patients with both well-differentiated and grade III NETs who had high uptake in pretherapeutic Ga-DOTATATE PET/computed tomography scans. Patients with metastatic NETs treated with Lu-DOTATATE between January 2010 and November 2015 in our department were included in this retrospective cohort. Toxicity and adverse effects were evaluated according to SWOG criteria. Progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) rates were calculated considering the first date of treatment. Response was evaluated according to RECIST criteria. Potential predictors of survival and response were analysed. Patients ( n = 186) with metastatic NETs originating from various primary sites ( bronchial , pancreatic , nonpancreatic gastroenteropancreatic-NETs , pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma and unknown primary) were treated with 1107 courses of Lu-DOTATATE treatment ( median: 6; range: 3-12). Among 160 patients whose responses to treatment could be evaluated according to the RECIST criteria , 28.1 % ( n = 45) had a progressive disease , 21.9 % ( n = 35) had a stable disease , 46.9 % ( n = 75) had a partial response and 3.1 % ( n = 5) had a complete response. Median follow-up was 30.6 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS was 36.4 months , mean PFS was 38 months and the mean OS was 55 months. The disease control rates in patients with WHO grades I , II and III were 74 , 73 and 60 % , respectively , and the OS rates were 61.9 , 52.2 and 38.4 months , respectively. We observed no major renal toxicity except a minor increase ( 11.1 %) in average serum creatinine levels. In 33.9 % ( n = 56) of the patients , grade I toxicity; in 9.1 % ( n = 15) , grade II; and in 1.2 % ( n = 2) , grade III toxicity were observed. Lu-DOTATATE therapy is an important treatment option in somatostatin receptor type-2-positive pancreatic , nonpancreatic gastroenteropancreatic-NETs , and lung NETs including metastatic NETs with an unknown primary site and significantly contributed to patients ' OS. Additionally , peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may have a role in a selected subgroup of patients with grade III NET with high somatostatin receptor type-2 expression.
