  Helminthosporol , a natural growth regulator isolated from a fungus , stimulates hypocotyl growth and seed germination , similar to gibberellin ( GA). We recently reported that helminthosporic acid ( H-acid) , a synthetic analog of helminthosporol , acts as an agonist of GA receptor. In this study , we showed that a H-acid analog , in which the hydroxymethyl group at the C-8 position of H-acid was converted to a keto group , acts as a selective GA receptor agonist. 1) This analog shows higher hypocotyl elongation activity in Arabidopsis than H-acid does , and induces the degradation of DELLA protein and 2) leads to the formation of the GID1-DELLA complex and 3) regulates the expression of GA-related genes. In addition , 4) its hypocotyl elongation activity was not observed in a atgid1a single mutant , and 5) this analog could promote only the interaction between specific GA receptors and DELLA proteins in vitro. Taken together , our results strongly suggest that the selectivity of the reported H-acid analog depends on the specificity of its GA receptor binding activity.
