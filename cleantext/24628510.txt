  Odontoid fractures in young children are rare. Most authors advocate for closed reduction and external stabilization as first line treatment. Unlike adults , young children are much less amenable to an awake reduction for real-time assessment of neurological function. We used spinal cord monitoring , as used in spine surgery , to assess the function of the spinal cord during the closed reduction in our 31-month-old patient. A 31-month-old male presented with a displaced odontoid fracture and ASIA C spinal cord injury. Given his age , closed reduction and halo application were completed under general anesthesia guided by neuromonitoring. A less-than-ideal reduction initially was accepted due to a decline in motor-evoked potentials. Subsequently , there was no change in neurological status. The reduction was repeated under anesthesia , with monitoring , a number of times until good correction was achieved. Ultimately , a surgical fusion was required due to ligamentous instability. The child achieved a very good neurological outcome and a stable spine. Neuromonitoring is an important adjunct to closed reductions when complete and reliable neurological assessment is not possible.
