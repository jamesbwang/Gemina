  Diabetic keratopathy is a common ocular complication of patients with a long-term history of diabetes and it will have a negative effect on the visual quality and function. A study reported that the incidence of diabetic keratopathy in diabetic patients ranged from 47 % to 64 % , but the precise underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. There is evidence that advanced glycation end products contribute substantially to the onset and progress of various diabetic complications and it is a key factor for the mechanism of the hyperglycemic memory. This review focuses primarily on the present research state and prospect of advanced glycation end products and their role in the pathological changes of the cornea.
