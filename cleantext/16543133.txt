  Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 ( PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PSD-95/ discs-large/ZO -1 ( PDZ)- domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine ( DA) transporter ( DAT) , the primary target for cocaine 's reinforcing actions. Here , we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knock-out ( KO) mice , the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover , in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine , we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the âˆ¼ 30 % reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly , we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice , consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knock-down ( KD) of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression , supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary , in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine , our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.
