  This paper reports a robust and stretchable nanolaser platform that can preserve its high mode quality by exploiting hybrid quadrupole plasmons as an optical feedback mechanism. Increasing the size of metal nanoparticles in an array can introduce ultrasharp lattice plasmon resonances with out-of-plane charge oscillations that are tolerant to lateral strain. By patterning these nanoparticles onto an elastomeric slab surrounded by liquid gain , we realized reversible , tunable nanolasing with high strain sensitivity and no hysteresis. Our semiquantum modeling demonstrates that lasing build-up occurs at the hybrid quadrupole electromagnetic hot spots , which provides a route toward mechanical modulation of light-matter interactions on the nanoscale.
