  While two-component systems ( TCSs) , composed of a sensor histidine kinase ( HK) and a response regulator , are the main signaling pathways in bacteria , global TCS activity remains poorly described. Here , we report the kinetic parameters of the HK autophosphorylation reaction using previously uncharacterized γ-phosphate-modified ATP analogues to further elucidate their utility as activity-based probes for global TCS analysis. Given the increased stability of thiophosphorylated histidine in comparison to that of the native phosphoryl modification , which is attributed to the decreased electrophilicity of this moiety , we anticipated that ATPγS may be turned over much more slowly by the HKs. Surprisingly , we found this not to be the case , with the turnover numbers decreasing < 1 order of magnitude. Instead , we found that alkylation of the thiophosphate had a much more dramatic effect on turnover and , in one case , the binding affinity of this substrate analogue ( BODIPY-FL-ATPγS).
