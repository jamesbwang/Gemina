  The aim of the present study was to clarify the predictors of the response of patients with resectable lung cancer and untreated airflow obstruction to tiotropium , an antimuscarinic bronchodilator. Tiotropium was administered to 29 preoperative patients with untreated airflow obstruction. The forced vital capacity ( FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV The introduction of tiotropium resulted in a 15 % gain in the FEV We developed an equation for predicting the response to tiotropium using parameters obtained from spirometry and quantitative computed tomography. A large-scale study to validate the usefulness of this equation is warranted.
