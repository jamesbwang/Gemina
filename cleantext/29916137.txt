  Patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) have increased fracture risk. Osteopontin ( OPN) is a protein involved in bone remodeling and inflammation<symptom>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of OPN with fracture prevalence and with metabolic parameters in post-menopausal women with T2DM. Sixty-four post-menopausal women with T2DM ( age 67.0 ± 7.8 years , diabetes duration 8.9 ± 6.7 years) , enrolled in a previous study , were followed up ( 3.6 ± 0.9 years). Previous fragility fractures were recorded. The FRAX score ( without BMD) was calculated and biochemical parameters ( plasma glucose , HbA1c , lipid profile and renal function) were assessed. Serum 25OH-vitamin D , calcium , PTH and OPN were evaluated at baseline. The association between OPN and fracture prevalence at baseline was evaluated by a logistic model. OPN levels were higher in patients with previous fractures ( n. 25) than in patients without previous fractures at baseline ( n. 39) ( p = 0.006). The odds of having fractures at baseline increased by 6.7 ( 1.9-31.4 , 95 % CI , p = 0.007) for each increase of 1 ng/ml in OPN levels , after adjustment for vitamin D and HbA1c levels. Fracture incidence was 4.7 %. Higher OPN associated with a decrease in HDL-cholesterol ( p = 0.048) , after adjustment for age , basal HDL-cholesterol , basal and follow-up HbA1c and follow-up duration. 25OH-vitamin D associated with an increase in FRAX-estimated probability of hip fracture at follow-up ( p = 0.029) , after adjustment for age , 25OH-vitamin D and time. In post-menopausal women with T2DM , OPN might be a useful marker of fracture and worse lipid profile.
