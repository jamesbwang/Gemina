  Background and purpose- Cutibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> , formerly known as Propionibacterium<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> , is often isolated from deep tissues of the shoulder. It is recognized as an important causative agent of foreign-material associated infections. However , the incidence and significance of its detection in tissues from patients without clinical evidence for infection is unclear. We assessed the incidence of C acnes colonization of osteosynthesis material in asymptomatic patients , and evaluated the short-term outcome in relation to the microbiological findings. Patients and methods- We microbiologically analyzed osteosynthesis material of 34 asymptomatic patients after surgery on the clavicle. Material obtained from 19 asymptomatic patients after osteosynthesis of the fibula served as a control group. Patients were clinically followed up for 3-24 months after removal of the osteosynthesis material. Results- Bacteria were recovered from devices in 29 of 34 patients from the clavicle group. 27 of 29 positive samples grew C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen>. Isolation of C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> was more common in male than in female patients. No bacterial growth was observed on foreign material from patients in the fibula group. All patients remained asymptomatic at follow-up. Interpretation- Growth of C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> is common on osteosynthesis material of the shoulder , especially in males. Samples were positive irrespective of clinical signs of infection. Therefore , detection of C.<pathogen> acnes<pathogen> in this clinical setting is of questionable clinical significance. The high positivity rate in asymptomatic patients discourages routine sampling of material in cases without clinical evidence for infection.
