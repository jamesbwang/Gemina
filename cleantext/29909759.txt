  Early detection of psychosis: evidence and perspectives Abstract. Early detection of psychosis , in the sense of preventing psychosis , has become increasingly important in recent years. Especially psychopathological approaches are promising and are reflected in the attenuated and transient positive symptoms ( `` ultra high risk '' criteria) and the basic symptom criterion `` cognitive disturbances ''. According to the recommendation of the European Psychiatric Association ( EPA) , both risk-criteria sets are currently the most well-tested diagnostic criteria for a psychosis risk syndrome<disease>. Moreover , comorbid mental disorders and psychosocial problems are frequently the reasons for treatment.
