  Young adult patients with cancer have to deal with their disease in an eventful phase of life. A common side effect of cancer and its treatment is cancer-related fatigue<symptom> ( CRF) , a phenomenon which can thwart successful coping with developmental tasks. The aims of this study were to assess the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ-FA12 , a new instrument for assessing physical , emotional and cognitive fatigue<symptom> , in young adults with cancer , and to propose a cut-off value that indicates a need for further more specific diagnostics. In a sample of young adults who were first diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 39 years old , we assess the composite and item reliabilities as well as discriminant validity of the subscales for the EORTC QLQ-FA12. We also discuss two possible ways to calculate a summarizing score when conducting a receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis to find the cut-off value. The EORTC QLQ-FA12 fit the sample ( CFI = 0.96 , SRMR = 0.04) , had discriminant validity regarding its subscales and every subscale showed convergent validity ( composite reliabilities were 0.92 for physical , 0.89 for emotional and 0.74 for cognitive fatigue<symptom>). The sum of the first ten items with a range of 0 to 30 revealed a cut-off value of twelve or more with 91 % sensitivity and 77 % specificity. The new instrument EORTC QLQ-FA12 is able to distinguish between physical , emotional , and cognitive fatigue<symptom> in young adult patients. It enables us to study different concepts of general fatigue<symptom> without the need for additional items , and can be used as a screening instrument for young adults. Future research should investigate the multidimensional character of CRF.
