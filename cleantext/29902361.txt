  Immune tolerance induction ( ITI) was the primary therapeutic approach to eradicate inhibitors in haemophilia patients. Several large ITI registries had been reported , but successful predictors of ITI outcome are still debated. No reports are available on large ITI studies in non-caucasian countries. We designed a retrospective cohort study of ITI in Japanese haemophilia patients with inhibitor. Retrospective data were collected from 155 haemophilia ( H) A ( 140 severe-type) and 7 HB ( 7 severe-type) patients treated at 45 institutions. ITI outcome was centrally reviewed. We defined `` success '' as undetectable inhibitor after 2 consecutive measurements. The ITI success rate was 71.2 % for HA and 83.3 % for HB. Cumulated success rates for HA achieving 50 % and 75 % were 0.7 and 2 years after treatment , respectively. Significant successful predictors in HA were low-responding inhibitors compared to high-responding inhibitors , shorter time to the start of ITI , and lower historical and treatment peak titres of inhibitor. Dose regimen ( high dose; ≥ 90 IU/kg every day , low dose; ≤ 75 IU/kg , 3 d/wk) and the type of therapeutic product did not affect outcomes. The success rate of salvage ITI using von Willebrand factor-containing factor VIII was 50 % ( n = 6/12) , and patient age at the start of salvage ITI was a significant predictor. The inhibitor recurred in 6 HA cases ( 3.9 %). The results provided potentially important information for improving future success rates for ITI in inhibitor patients.
