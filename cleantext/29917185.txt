  To investigate the role of microRNA-212 in prostate cancer ( PCa) and its underlying mechanism. MicroRNA-212 expressions in 72 PCa tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected by qRT-PCR ( quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The relationship between microRNA-212 expression and clinical characteristics of PCa patients was analyzed. Target genes of microRNA-212 were predicted by TargetScan and verified by luciferase reporter gene assay. Proliferation , cell cycle , and apoptosis of PCa cells were detected after transfection with corresponding plasmids of microRNA-212 in PCa cells , respectively. The effect of microRNA-212 on BMI1 and NF-κB pathway was detected by Western blot. MicroRNA-212 was downregulated in PCa patients. The survival rate of PCa patients with lower expression of microRNA-212 was remarkably lower than those with a higher level. After overexpression of microRNA-212 , we observed inhibited proliferation and arrested cell cycle of PCa cells. Increased apoptosis was found after PCa cells were transfected with microRNA-212 mimic. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that microRNA-212 was bound to BMI1 , which further promoted PCa development via NF-κB pathway. MicroRNA-212 was downregulated in PCa tissues , which could promote the PCa development by targeting BMI1 via NF-κB pathway.
