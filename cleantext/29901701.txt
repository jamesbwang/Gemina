  Few investigations have explored temperature and birth outcomes. In a retrospective cohort study , we examined apparent temperature , a combination of temperature and relative humidity , and term low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) among 43,629 full-term LBW infants and 2,032,601 normal weight infants in California from 1999 to 2013. The California Department of Public Health provided birth certificate data , while meteorologic data came from the California Irrigation Management Information System , US Environmental Protection Agency , and National Centers for Environmental Information. After considering several temperature metrics , we observed the best model fit for term LBW over the full gestation ( 13.0 % change , 95 % confidence interval: 4.1 , 22.7 per 10 degrees Fahrenheit ( °F) increase in apparent temperature) above 55 °F and the greatest association for third trimester exposure above 60 °F ( 15.8 % , 95 % confidence interval: 5.0 , 27.6). Apparent temperature during the first month of pregnancy exhibited no significant risk , while the first trimester had a significantly negative association , and second trimester , last month and last two weeks had slightly increased risks. Mothers who were Black , older , delivered male infants , or gave birth during the warm season conferred the highest risks. This study provides further evidence for adverse birth outcomes from heat exposure for vulnerable subgroups of pregnant women.
