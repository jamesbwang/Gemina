  In this article , we discuss the challenges faced in recruiting `` hard-to-reach '' groups for interview studies , specifically those who do not access preventative healthcare services. We do this by reflecting on the varying success of different recruitment methods we have used in two recent studies; one investigating ethnic disparities in human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> vaccination uptake and another exploring difference in cervical screening non-participation. Engaging new community groups to help with recruitment proved particularly difficult , as did recruiting online. Our most successful recruitment methods included recruiting through community groups with whom we had previously established relationships , recruiting through schools and re-contacting participants who previously completed a related survey. We conclude that successful recruitment is dependent on study awareness and engagement. We urge others to be transparent in reporting recruitment methods in order to benefit the qualitative research community and suggest that details are published as supplementary material alongside qualitative articles in future.
