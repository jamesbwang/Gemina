  Sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA) secondary to ventricular fibrillation ( VF) may be due to different cardiac conditions. We investigated whether copeptin , hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP in addition to clinical assessment may help to identify the etiology of SCA and yield prognostic information. EDTA-blood was collected prior to or at hospital admission from patients with SCA of assumed cardiac origin. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records. VF was the primary heart<symptom> rhythm<symptom> in 77 patients who initially were divided into 2 groups based on whether they had an ischemic or non-ischemic mechanism as the most likely cause of SCA. They were further divided into 4 groups according to whether or not they had a history of previous heart disease. The patients were categorized by baseline clinical information , ECG , echocardiography and coronary angiography; Group 1 ( n = 43): SCA with first AMI , Group 2 ( n = 10): SCA with AMI and previous MI , Group 3 ( n = 3): SCA without AMI and without former heart disease , Group 4 ( n = 18): SCA without AMI and with known heart disease. Copeptin and hs-cTNT did not differ between patient groups , whereas NT-proBNP was significantly higher in patients with established heart disease without AMI and differed between non-AMI and AMI. Furthermore , NT-proBNP was significantly elevated in non-survivors as compared to survivors. NT-proBNP provided both diagnostic and prognostic information in blood samples collected close to out-of-hospital resuscitation of VF patients , whereas copeptin and hs-cTnT failed to do so.
