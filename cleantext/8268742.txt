  Corneal epithelial defect ( CED) is a common medical emergency condition involving loss of surface epithelial layer of the cornea. The aim of the study is to explore the practice patterns of ophthalmologists in management of traumatic CED in Saudi Arabia and to assess the variance in clinical practice from the established clinical practice guidelines. A Survey based study at King Abdulaziz University Hospital between March 2015 and January 2016. A survey of 16 relevant closed ended questions was distributed to 300 practicing ophthalmologists including Saudi Ophthalmology Society ( SOS) members and non-members. The survey questionnaire focused on the known aspects of traumatic CED management. 188 practicing ophthalmologists responded to the distributed questionnaire. That represents a 63 % response rate for the present survey study. The age group most commonly affected by traumatic CED is 6-18 years old ( 61.2 %). Fingernail trauma ( n = 129 , 68.6 %) was the major cause of CED reported by respondents. In large CED ( > 5 mm) most common modality of treatment is pressure patching with topical antibiotics with or without cycloplegics ( 40.4 %) whereas in small CED ( < 2 mm) topical antibiotics and cycloplegics is the preferred way ( 40.4 %). The most commonly used prophylactic antibiotic was second-generation fluroquinolons ( 58.5 %). Present study demonstrates that practicing ophthalmologists are reporting that traumatic CED mostly affects young people and fingernail trauma is the major cause. There is lack of clear institutional guidelines and consensus on the management of traumatic corneal abrasions.
