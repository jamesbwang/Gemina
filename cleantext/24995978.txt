  The dynamic posttranslational modification O-linked Î²- N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation ( O-GlcNAcylation) is present on thousands of intracellular proteins in the brain. Like phosphorylation , O-GlcNAcylation is inducible and plays important functional roles in both physiology and disease. Recent advances in mass spectrometry ( MS) and bioconjugation methods are now enabling the mapping of O-GlcNAcylation events to individual sites in proteins. However , our understanding of which glycosylation events are necessary for regulating protein function and controlling specific processes , phenotypes , or diseases remains in its infancy. Given the sheer number of O-GlcNAc sites , methods for identifying promising sites and prioritizing them for time- and resource-intensive functional studies are greatly needed. Revealing sites that are dynamically altered by different stimuli or disease states will likely go a long way in this regard. Here , we describe advanced methods for identifying O-GlcNAc sites on individual proteins and across the proteome and for determining their stoichiometry in vivo. We also highlight emerging technologies for quantitative , site-specific MS-based O-GlcNAc proteomics ( O-GlcNAcomics) , which allow proteome-wide tracking of O-GlcNAcylation dynamics at individual sites. These cutting-edge technologies are beginning to bridge the gap between the high-throughput cataloguing of O-GlcNAcylated proteins and the relatively low-throughput study of individual proteins. By uncovering the O-GlcNAcylation events that change in specific physiological and disease contexts , these new approaches are providing key insights into the regulatory functions of O-GlcNAc in the brain , including their roles in neuroprotection , neuronal signaling , learning and memory , and neurodegenerative diseases.
