  The significant and progressive reduction in the number of permanent teachers in medical schools ( professor , associate professor and assistant professor) is a reason for concern for the National Conference of Deans. This reduction will intensify in the coming decade ( 2017-2026). Forty-three percent of the permanent faculty will retire , as will 55 % of the faculty linked to clinical areas , 34 % of the faculty not linked to clinical areas and 32 % of the faculty of basic areas. This deficit is significant now , and , in a few years , the situation will be unsustainable , especially in the clinical areas. This report reveals the pressing need to adopt urgent measures to alleviate the present situation and prevent a greater problem. The training of future physicians , immediately responsible for the health of our society , depends largely on the theoretical and practical training taught in medical schools , with the essential collaboration of healthcare institutions. Paradoxically , while the number of teachers decreases substantially , there is an exponential increase in the number of medical schools and students who are admitted every year without academic or healthcare justification.
