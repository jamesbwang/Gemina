  Herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus 1 ( HSV-1) is a prevalent human pathogen that infects the cornea causing potentially blinding herpetic disease. A clinical herpes<disease> vaccine is still lacking. In the present study , a novel prime/pull vaccine was tested in Human Leukocyte Antigen- ( HLA-) transgenic rabbit model of ocular herpes<disease> ( HLA Tg rabbit). Three asymptomatic ( ASYMP) peptide epitopes were selected from the HSV-1 membrane glycoprotein C ( UL44
