  Self-management of hypertension can reduce and control blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) compared with clinic monitoring. However , self-management relies on patients following an algorithm , which may be variably adhered to. This study reports fidelity of high-risk patients to the self-management algorithm set by the TASMIN-SR trial. Patients with hypertension , above target clinic BP and one or more of stroke , diabetes , coronary heart disease or chronic kidney disease , were invited to self-monitor following an individualized self-titration algorithm. Home BP readings and medication change details were submitted monthly for 12 months. Readings downloaded from patients ' electronic monitors were compared with written submissions , and protocol fidelity was assessed. Two hundred and seventy-six patients were randomized to self-management and 225 ( 82 %) completed the required training sessions. Of these , 166 ( 74 %) completed self-management. A total of 11385 ( 89.6 %) submitted readings were accurate compared with corresponding downloaded monitor readings. Mean error rate was 5.2 % per patient , which increased with age but not comorbidities. Patients made 475 of 683 ( 69.5 %) algorithm-recommended medication changes , equating to nearly three medication changes per patient. Mean SBP for patients who completed training and made all recommended changes dropped from 141 mmHg ( 95 % CI 138.26-144.46) to 121 mmHg ( 95 % CI 118.30-124.17 mmHg) compared with 129 mmHg ( 95 % CI 125.27-136.73 mmHg) for patients who made none. Most patients randomized to self-management completed training; however , 36 % of these had dropped out by 12 months. Self-monitoring was largely undertaken properly and accurately recorded. Fidelity with self-management was associated with lower achieved SBP. Successful implementation of self-management into daily practice requires careful training and should be accompanied by monitoring of fidelity.
