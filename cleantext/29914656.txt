  Bacteriophages are more abundant than any other organism on our planet. The interaction of bacteriophages and bacteria and their coevolution is well known. In this chapter , we describe various aspects of modeling such systems and their dynamics. We explore their interaction in: ( i) liquid media , which leads to well-mixed populations and ( ii) solid media , where their interaction is spatially restricted. Such modeling , when used in conjunction with experiments would not only shed deep insight into the underlying dynamics but also provide useful clues toward potential therapeutic applications.
