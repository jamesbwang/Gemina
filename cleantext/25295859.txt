  Reducing crop losses due to abiotic stresses is a major target of agricultural biotechnology that will increase with climate change and global population growth. Concerns , however , have been raised about potential ecological impacts if transgenes become established in wild populations and cause increased competitiveness of weedy or invasive species. Potential risks will be a function of transgene movement , population sizes , and fitness effects on the recipient population. While key components influencing gene flow have been extensively investigated , there have been few studies on factors subsequent to transgene movement that can influence persistence and competitiveness. Here , we performed multiyear , multigenerational , assessment to examine fitness effects and persistence of three mechanistically different abiotic stress tolerance genes:
