  Black-blood ( BB) imaging is used to complement contrast-enhanced 3D gradient-echo ( CE 3D-GRE) imaging for detecting brain metastases , requiring additional scan time. In this study , we proposed deep-learned 3D BB imaging with an auto-labelling technique and 3D convolutional neural networks for brain metastases detection without additional BB scan. Patients were randomly selected for training ( 29 sets) and testing ( 36 sets). Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated deep-learned and original BB images , assessing the degree of blood vessel suppression and lesion<symptom> conspicuity. Vessel signals were effectively suppressed in all patients. The figure of merits , which indicate the diagnostic performance of radiologists , were 0.9708 with deep-learned BB and 0.9437 with original BB imaging , suggesting that the deep-learned BB imaging is highly comparable to the original BB imaging ( difference was not significant; p = 0.2142). In per patient analysis , sensitivities were 100 % for both deep-learned and original BB imaging; however , the original BB imaging indicated false positive results for two patients. In per lesion<symptom> analysis , sensitivities were 90.3 % for deep-learned and 100 % for original BB images. There were eight false positive lesions<symptom> on the original BB imaging but only one on the deep-learned BB imaging. Deep-learned 3D BB imaging can be effective for brain metastases detection.
