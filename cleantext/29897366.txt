  Research on the energy transfer mechanism of rare-earth-doped upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs) has been an important area due to the increasing demand for tuning multicolor emission and enhancing the upconversion efficiency; however , because of large energy mismatch , many lanthanide activators , such as Eu3 + , can not realize highly efficient near infrared-to-visible upconversion by simple codoping of Yb3 +. Therefore , introduction of other ions to assist the energy transfer process is required. Herein , we prepared core-shell nanoparticles with different doping locations to investigate the upconversion energy transfer mechanism. The upconversion luminescence ( UCL) of core-shell nanoparticles was investigated by steady-state luminescence and time-resolved luminescence spectra. The UCL behaviors in these different multi-activator core-shell nanoparticles were observed. The results revealed different energy transfer channels influenced by the doping location of activators. This study may open up new avenues of structure design for fine-tuning of multicolor UCL for specific applications.
