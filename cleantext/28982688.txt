  We propose an unsupervised multi-omics integration pipeline , using deep-learning autoencoder algorithm , to predict the survival subtypes in bladder cancer ( BC). We used TCGA dataset comprising mRNA , miRNA and methylation to infer two survival subtypes. We then constructed a supervised classification model to predict the survival subgroups of any new individual sample. Our training data gave two subgroups with significant survival differences ( p-value = 8e-4) , where high-risk survival subgroup was enriched with KRT6/14 overexpression and PI3K-Akt pathways. We tested the robustness of model by randomly splitting the main dataset into multiple training and test folds , which gave overall significant p-values. Then , we successfully inferred the subtypes for a subset of samples kept as test dataset ( p-value = 0.03). We further applied our pipeline to predict the survival subgroups from another validation dataset with miRNA data ( p-value = 0.02). Conclusively , present pipeline is an effective approach to infer the survival subtype of a new sample , exemplified by BC.
