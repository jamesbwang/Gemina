  This data article provides the summary data from tests comparing various Gaussian process software packages. Each spreadsheet represents a single function or type of function using a particular input sample size. In each spreadsheet , a row gives the results for a particular replication using a single package. Within each spreadsheet there are the results from eight Gaussian process model-fitting packages on five replicates of the surface. There is also one spreadsheet comparing the results from two packages performing stochastic kriging. These data enable comparisons between the packages to determine which package will give users the best results.
