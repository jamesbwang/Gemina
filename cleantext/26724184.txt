  To explore the therapeutic effect and the biomechanical mechanism of 3D printing individualized heel cup in treating of plantar heel pain. The clinical effect was evaluated by plantar pressure analysis and pain assessment in participants. Its biomechanical mechanism of protecting the plantar heel was explored using finite element simulation. The individualized heel cup could support and protect the osseous structure and soft tissue of plantar heel while walking and jogging , as well as significantly reduce the self-reported pain after being worn for 4 weeks. The nylon heel cup could alter the load concentration of the heel as well as decrease the load affected on plantar fascia and calcaneus bone. It also provided an obvious support for heel pad. To summarize , the 3D printed individualized heel cup can be used as an effective method for the treatment of plantar heel pain.
