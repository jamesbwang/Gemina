  MicroRNAs ( miRs) serve promoting or suppressive roles in various human cancer types , including ovarian cancer; however , the role of miR-142-3p in ovarian cancer growth and chemoresistance has not previously been studied. In the present study , reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to examine miR and protein expression levels. An MTT assay was used to examine cell proliferation. A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to clarify the target gene of miR-142-3p. The present study reported that miR-142-3p expression levels were significantly lower in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines , when compared with those in adjacent tissues and the normal human ovarian epithelial cell line IOSE386 , respectively. The reduced expression of miR-142-3p was significantly associated with poor cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of miR-142-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and increased the sensitivity of SKOV3/DDP cells to cisplatin. Sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) was identified as a target gene of miR-142-3p; SIRT1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-142-3p in ovarian cancer cells. Further investigation demonstrated that SIRT1 reversed the suppressive effects of miR-142-3p on the proliferation and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. In addition , SIRT1 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer. A negative correlation between the expression of SIRT1 and miR-142-3p in ovarian cancer tissues was also observed. In summary , the present study indicated that miR-142-3p inhibits the proliferation and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells by targeting SIRT1. This suggests that miR-142-3p may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
