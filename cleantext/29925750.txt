  We examined whether early delayed scanning is useful for differentiation of liver lesion<symptom> and heterogenous physiological accumulation in positron emission tomography ( PET) examination. The subjects of the study were 33 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent PET examination and were added early delayed scanning to distinguish between liver lesions<symptom> and heterogenous physiological accumulation to conventional early images. We placed same regions of interest ( ROI) in the tumor and hepatic parenchyma for early delayed and conventional early images. Then , we measured SUVmax of the ROIs and calculated tumor to liver parenchyma uptake ratio ( TLR). In addition , change rates between early and early delayed images were calculated for the SUVmax and TLR. The receiver operating characterstic ( ROC) analysis result of SUVmax showed the highest SUVmax change rate , and the ROC analysis result of TLR showed the highest early delayed scanning. The SUVmax of the lesions<symptom> did not change between early scan and early delayed scanning ( p = 0.98) , but it decreased significantly in the normal group ( p < 0.001). TLR of the lesion<symptom> group was significantly increased ( p < 0.001) in early delayed images compared to early scan and TLR significantly decreased in the normal group ( p < 0.001). The AUC of the ROC curve showed the highest SUVmax change rate ( 0.99). Early delayed scanning could distinguish between liver lesions<symptom> and heterogenous physiological accumulation in colon cancer patients.
