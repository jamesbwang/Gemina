  Esophagectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy is the standard surgical approach for patients with tumors of the esophagus or pancreatic head. Postoperative mortality is strongly correlated with the occurrence of anastomotic leakage ( AL). Delay in diagnosis leads to delay in treatment , which ratifies the need for development of novel and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tests for detection of AL.. Urinary volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) reflect the metabolic status of an individual , which is associated with a systemic immunological response. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of urinary VOCs to detect AL after esophagectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy. In the present study , urinary VOCs of 63 patients after esophagectomy ( n = 31) or pancreaticoduodenectomy ( n = 32) were analyzed by means of field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry. AL was defined according to international study groups. AL was observed in 15 patients ( 24 %). Urinary VOCs of patients with AL after pancreaticoduodenectomy could be distinguished from uncomplicated controls , area under the curve 0.85 ( 95 % CI 0.76-0.93) , sensitivity 76 % , and specificity 77 %. However , this was not observed following esophagectomy , area under the curve 0.51 ( 95 % CI 0.37-0.65). In our study population AL following pancreaticoduodenectomy could be discriminated from uncomplicated controls by means of urinary VOC analysis , NTC03203434.
