  Replies to comments made by B. J. Jacobs ( see record 2018-27937-015) on the authors ' original editorial ( see record 2017-56601-001). While Fogarty and Mauksch agree with Dr. Jacobs that reviving the Doherty and Baird Levels of family involvement would be helpful , as would training clinicians to engage family members as partners in care , Fogarty and Mauksch want to reemphasize that helping trainees recognize systemic thinking and learn systemic problem solving is a necessary precursor to any form of family focused action. Clinicians should pursue shared decision-making partnerships with patients and their family members. ( PsycINFO Database Record
