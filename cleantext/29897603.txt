  Infectious bronchitis<symptom> ( IB) control has a strong impact on poultry farming , because of the necessary epidemiological knowledge for planning the best strategy , the optimal strain association , the priming and boosting interventions. Broiler farming is even more problematic given the short and intense productive cycle , which requires an early onset of protection against most of the infectious threats , possibly with limited respiratory post-vaccination reactions that would have a direct impact on the bird health and productivity. For this purpose , gel vaccination has been proposed as a new approach for infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus ( IBV) control and vaccine intake , kinetics and compatibility of combined strains administered by gel have been analyzed in this study. After gel vaccination with single and combined 1/96 and B-48 strains on 4 groups of commercial broilers , a 21-d-long experimental trial has been conducted to monitor the vaccine safety by clinical assessment and vaccine kinetics by strain-specific real-time RT-PCR on choanal cleft swabs. The vaccine strains administered by gel were safe and negligible respiratory signs were detected , even when combined. Vaccine titers were compared among groups and within the same group among a 10-bird pooled sample and 10 swabs from individually sampled birds. 1/96 strain early reached high titers in all animals , while B-48 presence was less constant even though it was detected in almost all birds before the trial end. The individual and pooled sample comparison revealed a partial overestimation of vaccine titers in the pooled samples and the loss of the prevalence data , although the trend portrayed by the pooled swabs closely followed the individual ones.
