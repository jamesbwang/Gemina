  Abscisic acid ( ABA) is an important phytohormone controlling responses to abiotic stresses and is sensed by proteins from the PYR/PYL/RCAR family. To explore the genetic contribution of PYLs toward ABA-dependent and ABA-independent processes , we generated and characterized high-order Arabidopsis mutants with mutations in the PYL family. We obtained a pyl quattuordecuple mutant and found that it was severely impaired in growth and failed to produce seeds. Thus , we carried out a detailed characterization of a pyl duodecuple mutant , pyr1pyl1/2/3/ 4/5/7/ 8/9/10/ 11/12. The duodecuple mutant was extremely insensitive to ABA effects on seed germination , seedling growth , stomatal closure , leaf senescence , and gene expression. The activation of SnRK2 protein kinases by ABA was blocked in the duodecuple mutant , but , unexpectedly , osmotic stress activation of SnRK2s was enhanced. Our results demonstrate an important role of basal ABA signaling in growth , senescence , and abscission and reveal that PYLs antagonize ABA-independent activation of SnRK2s by osmotic stress.
