  Land use changes are often considered to be the main factors influencing soil infiltration. But the difference of soil infiltration capacity for different land use type is less clear. In this paper , we conduct a meta-analysis of all 42 papers that could be found associated with the effects of land use changes on soil infiltration capacity. The results showed that soil initial and steady infiltration rates increased after land use changes from grassland to forest<disease> ( +41.35 % ,/) , shrubland to forest<disease> ( +42.73 % ,/) and cropland to agroforestry ( +70.28 % , +84.17 %). Soil infiltration rates declined after land use changes from grassland to cropland (/ , -45.23 %) , shrubland to cropland ( -64.24 % ,/) and forest<disease> to cropland ( -53.58 % , -42.15 %). It was evident that soil infiltration rates were negatively related to soil bulk density and initial moisture and positively related to soil total porosity and organic matter content. In sum , establishing agroforestry ecosystem was beneficial to improve soil infiltration capacity compare to cropland and plantation , which has important implications for developing sustainable agriculture and forest<disease> from the viewpoint of soil and water conservation.
