  NG2 glia are self-renewal cells widely populating the entire central nervous system ( CNS). The differentiation potential of NG2 glia in the brain has been systematically studied. However , the fate of NG2 glia in the spinal cord during development and after injury is still unclear. Here , we took advantage of faithful expression of Cre in NG2-CreERT2 knock-in mice to demonstrate that spinal NG2 glia remain committed to the oligodendrocyte ( OL) lineage and generate OLs , but not astrocytes or neurons , during development. However , we found significant age- and region dependent differences in differentiation into OLs. Embryonic or neonatal NG2 glia generated more than 90 % of the white matter OLs , but only 50 % ( embryonic) or 75 % ( neonatal) of gray matter OLs. Such differences disappeared after myelin completion coinciding with a decrease in the differentiation rate. While we never detected the generation of astrocytes from NG2 glia during spinal cord development , we found a small portion of NG2 glia could generate astrocytes in adult spinal cord upon acute traumatic injury.
