  Retinal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) and Sjögren syndrome<disease> ( SS) may be subclinical and thus underdiagnosed. We aimed at evaluating morphological and functional visual abnormalities in a cohort of SLE and SS patients in the absence of an overt clinical visual impairment. We also investigated potential associations between retinal disorders and disease activity , organ involvement , and treatment with steroid and/or hydroxychloroquine. The study comprised 42 SLE and 36 primary SS patients and 76 healthy controls ( HC). Ophthalmological examination , standard automated perimetry , spectral-domain optical coherence tomography , and fundus perimetry were performed. Retinal thickness of the posterior pole was not different between SLE and HC groups , but it was reduced in the SS group compared with both the HC and the SLE group. In SLE and SS patients , mean defect and pattern standard deviation by standard automated perimetry were higher than in HC. Visual field index values were lower in both SLE and SS patients than in HC. SLE patients with nephritis displayed increased mean defect and pattern standard deviation and reduced visual field index values compared to patients without nephritis. In SLE and SS patients , fundus perimetry differential sensitivity was reduced , and mean defect values were higher than in HC. Disturbances in fundus perimetry in the SLE group were more prevalent in steroid-naïve patients and in SS patients who received a cumulative hydroxychloroquine dose > 1,000 g. Functional eye impairment was demonstrated in SLE patients , possibly associated with kidney involvement. In SLE , corticosteroids might exert a protective role. Morphological alterations and functional impairment were detected in SS patients , which may be linked to hydroxychloroquine toxicity.
