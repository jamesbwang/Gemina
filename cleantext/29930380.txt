  Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 ( PHLPP2) is a tumor suppressor that catalyzes the de-phosphorylation of the AGC kinases , while p27 acts as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell cycle , apoptosis , and cell motility. Our previous studies have identified that PHLPP2 participates in inhibition of transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells following lung carcinogen B ( a) P/B ( a) PDE exposure. However , nothing was known about the association of p27 with regulation of PHLPP2 expression and the role of PHLPP2 in bladder cancer ( BC) invasion. In our current studies , we demonstrated that PHLPP2 inhibited BC invasion through promoting MMP2 degradation via p62-mediated autophagy; and p27 expression was able to stabilize PHLPP2 protein by inhibiting protein degradation of Hsp90 , which could directly bind to PHLPP2 and protect it from degradation. More in-depth studies discovered that stabilization of Hsp90 by p27 was mediated by calpain1 proteolysis system , whereas p27 inhibited calpain1 gene transcription by attenuating Jak1/Stat1 cascade in human invasive BC cells. Collectively , we for the first time revealed PHLPP2 downregulation in BCs and its participating in promotion of BC invasion , as well as novel role of p27 and mechanisms underlying its regulation of PHLPP2 protein degradation through Hsp90-dependent manner. Our findings improve our understanding of p27 and PHLPP2 roles and their crosstalk in regulation of BC invasion , which further contributes to improve the current strategy for invasive bladder cancer therapy.
