  Although recent progress in the use of human iPS cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic progenitors is remarkable , alternatives are essential in the strategies of treatment of basal-ganglia-related diseases. Attention has been focused on neural stem cells ( NSCs) as one of the possible candidates of donor material for neural transplantation , because of their multipotency and self-renewal characteristics. In the present study , miniature-swine ( mini-swine) mesencephalic neuroepithelial stem cells ( M-NESCs) of embryonic 17 and 18 days grafted in the parkinsonian rat striatum<pathogen> were assessed immunohistochemically , behaviorally and electrophysiologically to confirm their feasibility for the neural xenografting as a donor material. Grafted mini-swine M-NESCs survived in parkinsonian rat striatum<pathogen> at 8 weeks after transplantation and many of them differentiated into tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH)- positive cells. The parkinsonian model rats grafted with mini-swine M-NESCs exhibited a functional recovery from their parkinsonian behavioral defects. The majority of donor-derived TH-positive cells exhibited a matured morphology at 8 weeks. Whole-cell recordings from donor-derived neurons in the host rat brain slices incorporating the graft revealed the presence of multiple types of neurons including dopaminergic. Glutamatergic and GABAergic post-synaptic currents were evoked in the donor-derived cells by stimulation of the host site , suggesting they receive both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from host area. The present study shows that non-rodent mammalian M-NESCs can differentiate into functionally active neurons in the diseased xenogeneic environment and could improve the parkinsonian behavioral defects over the species. Neuroepithelial stem cells could be an attractive candidate as a source of donor material for neural transplantation.
