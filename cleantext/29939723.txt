  Highly fluorescent nanomaterials have shown great potential application in optics area. However , further improving their fluorescence properties especially for nanomaterials still remains a challenge. Specifically , luminescence of lanthanide ( Ln) ions doped two-dimensional ( 2D) nanosheets is seldom studied. Herein , MgWO
