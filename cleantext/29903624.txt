  Resident duty hour restrictions can limit the frequency of resident flap checks at smaller institutions with `` home '' call. Institutions are compensating with adjuvant nursing flap checks as well as incorporating technology; however , this management remains controversial. A prospective cohort of 122 free flaps for reconstruction of the head and neck by a single surgeon. Demographic information , operative details , postoperative care , and flap outcomes were recorded. Over 42 months , 122 free flaps were performed on 115 patients. The overall flap success rate was 96 %. The flap success rate at 72 h was 98 % and 96 % at the time of discharge with reexploration rates of 11.6 %. The intraoperative and postoperative salvage rates were 71 % and 64.3 % respectively. Limited resident flap checks combined hourly nurse flap checks and an implantable Doppler is an effective monitoring protocol for academic programs in the setting of residency duty hour restrictions.
