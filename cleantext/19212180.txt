  This study investigated the long-term risk factors for pneumonia<disease> after esophageal reconstruction using a gastric tube via the posterior mediastinal route following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The influence of columnar metaplasia in the remnant esophagus was specifically assessed. Among 225 patients who underwent esophagectomy between January 2004 and December 2010 , the subjects were 54 patients who could be followed up for more than 5 years. Routine oncologic follow-up consisted of CT scanning of the abdomen and chest every 4-6 months and annual endoscopy. Data on the occurrence of pneumonia<disease> were collected by retrospective review of chest CT scans. Risk factors for pneumonia<disease> investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses included the age , gender , diameter of the stapler , length of the intrathoracic remnant esophagus , anastomotic stricture , and presence of columnar metaplasia in the remnant esophagus. The median age was 62.4 years ( interquartile range: 55.8-68.0 years). Forty-three patients were men. Pneumonia<disease> was detected in 39 patients ( 72.2 %). The incidence of columnar metaplasia in the remnant esophagus increases with time. Anastomotic stricture was significantly related to the absence of columnar metaplasia on endoscopy in the first year after esophagectomy ( p = 0.013). Univariate analysis showed that the frequency of pneumonia<disease> was significantly related to the intrathoracic remnant esophagus length â‰¥ 4.4 cm ( p = 0.014) , age over 65 years ( p = 0.014) , and the presence of columnar metaplasia in the remnant esophagus in the fifth year after esophagectomy ( p = 0.005). Among them , age over 65 years and the presence of columnar metaplasia in the remnant esophagus in the fifth year after esophagectomy were found to be independent indicators of the postoperative pneumonia<disease> by multivariate analysis. Pneumonia<disease> occurred in 72.2 % ( 39/54) of patients after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The presence of columnar metaplasia after esophagectomy is an indicator for pneumonia<disease> over the long term.
