  Translation is dynamically regulated during cell development and stress response. In order to detect actively translated open reading frames ( ORFs) and dynamic cellular translation events , we have developed a computational method , RiboWave , to process ribosome profiling data. RiboWave utilizes wavelet transform to denoise the original signal by extracting 3-nt periodicity of ribosomes and precisely locate their footprint denoted as Periodic Footprint P-site ( PF P-site). Such high-resolution footprint is found to capture the full track of actively elongating ribosomes , from which translational landscape can be explicitly characterized. We compare RiboWave with several published methods , like RiboTaper , ORFscore and RibORF , and found that RiboWave outperforms them in both accuracy and usage when defining actively translated ORFs. Moreover , we show that PF P-site derived by RiboWave shows superior performance in characterizing the dynamics and complexity of cellular translatome by accurately estimating the abundance of protein levels , assessing differential translation and identifying dynamic translation frameshift.
