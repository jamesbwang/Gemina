  The Congolese liana Ancistrocladus likoko ( Ancistrocladaceae) produces naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids that are , chemotaxonomically remarkable , all based on the same coupling type , with the biaryl axis located between C-5 and C-8 '. About 20 alkaloids , belonging to the subclass of 5,8 '- linked naphthylisoquinolines , have so far been discovered in this plant species. Here , we report on the isolation and structure elucidation of six further such 5,8 '- coupled monomeric alkaloids , named ancistrolikokines I ( 9) , C
