  Youth ( including both childhood and adolescence) is a period when the brain undergoes dramatic remodeling and is also a time when neuropsychiatric conditions often emerge. Many of these illnesses have substantial sex differences in prevalence , suggesting that sex differences in brain development may underlie differential risk for psychiatric symptoms between males and females. Substantial evidence documents sex differences in brain structure and function in adults , and accumulating data suggests that these sex differences may be present or emerge during development. Here we review the evidence for sex differences in brain structure , white matter organization , and perfusion during development. We then use these normative differences as a framework to understand sex differences in brain development associated with psychopathology. In particular , we focus on sex differences in the brain as they relate to anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , psychosis , and attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms. Finally , we highlight existing limitations , gaps in knowledge , and fertile avenues for future research.
