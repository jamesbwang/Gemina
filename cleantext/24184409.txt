  The ability to avoid predators is crucial to wild prey animals ' survival. Potential danger is signalled , among others , by the presence of predator scents. These odors are used in research both to trigger and to study fear reactions in laboratory animals; they are also employed as repellents against pest rodent species. In our study , we assessed nine predator-derived odors for their effectiveness in eliciting avoidance responses in a free-living colony of Norway rats ( Rattus<pathogen> norvegicus<pathogen> The rats were studied in a field setting. Food was put in two compartments inside the experimental pen: in one of them , predator scent was introduced on experimental days. The rats did not avoid boxes with predator odor and did not display an increased latency of food-carrying behavior or any other fear-related behavior , such as freezing or increased grooming. The results confirm the hypothesis that the foraging of rodents in a well-known territory and in relative proximity to burrows and other shelters is not affected by indirect cues of predation risk , such as the presence of predator urine or feces. We have also concluded that in a well-established colony living in a familiar territory , predator scent holds little promise as rodent repellent.
