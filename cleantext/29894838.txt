  In the present study , we have synthesized nickel hydroxide nanosuspensions ( Ns) using microemulsion technique. This approach is eco-friendly and makes use of Tween 80 ( a non-ionic biocompatible surfactant) and newly synthesized metallosurfactants for the formation of uniform nanoparticles in the form of nanosuspensions ( Ns). The nickel hydroxide Ns 's were derived from three different metallosurfactants i.e. NiCTAC ( Bishexadecyltrimethylammonium nickel tetrachloride) , NiDDA ( Bisdodecylamine nickel dichloride) and NiHEXA ( bishexadecylamine nickel dichloride). Three different nickel-based metallosurfactants were synthesized and characterized using various methods such as CHN ,
