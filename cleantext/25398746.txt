  While there is a literature on the distribution of food stores across geographic and social space , much of this research uses cross-sectional data. Analyses attempting to understand whether the availability of stores across neighborhoods is associated with diet and/or health outcomes are limited by a lack of understanding of factors that shape the emergence of new stores and the closure of others. We used quarterly data on supermarket and convenience store locations spanning seven years ( 2006-2012) and tract-level census data in four US cities: Birmingham , Alabama; Chicago , Illinois; Minneapolis , Minnesota; San Francisco , California. A spatial discrete-time survival model was used to identify factors associated with an earlier and/or later closure time of a store. Sales volume was typically the strongest indicator of store survival. We identified heterogeneity in the association between tract-level poverty and racial composition with respect to store survival. Stores in high poverty , non-White tracts were often at a disadvantage in terms of survival length. The observed patterns of store survival varied by some of the same neighborhood sociodemographic factors associated with lifestyle and health outcomes , which could lead to confusion<symptom> in interpretation in studies of the estimated effects of introduction of food stores into neighborhoods on health.
