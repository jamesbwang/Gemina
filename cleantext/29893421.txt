  Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS) is commonly used by clinical microbiology laboratories to identify bacterial pathogens and yeasts , but not for the identification of moulds. Recent progress in extraction protocols and the composition of comparative libraries support potential application of MALDI-TOF MS for mould identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. We evaluated the performance of the Bruker Microflex ™ MALDI-TOF MS instrument ( Billerica , MA , USA) to identify clinical isolates and reference strains of moulds using 3 libraries , the Bruker mould library , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) library and the Mass Spectrometry Identification ( MSI) online library , and compared those results to conventional ( morphological) and molecular ( 18S/ITS; gold standard) identification methods. All 3 libraries demonstrated greater accuracy in genus identification ( ≥ 94.9 %) than conventional methods ( 86.4 %). MALDI-TOF MS identified 73.3 % of isolates to species level compared to only 31.7 % by conventional methods. The MSI library demonstrated the highest rate of species-level identification ( 72.0 %) compared to NIH ( 19.5 %) and Bruker ( 13.6 %) libraries. Greater than 20 % of moulds remained unidentified to species level by all 3 MALDI-TOF MS libraries primarily because of library limitations or imperfect spectra. The overall identification rate of each MALDI-TOF MS library depended on the number of species and the number of spectra representing each species in the library.
