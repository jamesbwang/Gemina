  The anaerobic metabolism of glucose by cancer cells , even under well oxygenated conditions , has been documented by Otto Warburg as early as 1927. Micro-environmental hypoxia and intracellular pathways activating the hypoxia-related gene response , shift cancer cell metabolism to anaerobic pathways. In the current review we focus on a major enzyme involved in anaerobic transformation of pyruvate to lactate , namely lactate dehydrogenase 5 ( LDH5). The value of LDH5 as a marker of prognosis of cancer patients , as a predictor of response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and , finally , as a major target for cancer treatment and radio-sensitization is reported and discussed. Clinical , translational and experimental data supporting the uniqueness of the LDHA gene and its product LDH5 isoenzyme are summarized and future directions for a metabolic treatment of cancer are highlighted.
