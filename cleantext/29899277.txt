  Green<symptom> sample preparation is one of the most challenging aspects in green analytical chemistry. In this framework , miniaturized microextraction techniques have been developed and are widely performed due to their numerous positive features such as simplicity , limited need for organic solvents , instrumentation of low cost and short time of extraction. Also , ionic liquids ( ILs) have unequivocally a & ldquo; green & rdquo; character , which they owe to their unique properties including the re-usage , the high reaction efficiency and selectivity in room temperature , the ability to dissolve both organic and inorganic compounds , and thermal stability. In the present review , the recent advances in the application of ionic liquids in miniaturized liquid and solid phase extraction techniques as extractants , intermediate solvents , mediators and desorption solvents are discussed , quoting the advantages and drawbacks of each individual technique. Some of the most important sample preparation techniques covered include solid-phase microextraction ( SPME) , dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction ( DLLME) , single-drop microextraction ( SDME) , stir bar sorptive extraction ( SBSE) , and stir cake sorptive extraction ( SCSE).
