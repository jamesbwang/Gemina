  Precipitation occurs easily during the hot forming of high-nitrogen austenitic stainless steels , which reduces their hot ductility significantly. The effect of grain size on the hot ductility of high-nitrogen austenitic stainless steel in the presence of precipitates was investigated. Different grain sizes of 18Mn18Cr0 .5 N steel specimens , with and without precipitates , were hot-tension tested. The precipitate morphology , fracture surface , and cracks were studied by scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , and electron backscatter diffraction analysis. For the 18Mn18Cr0 .5 N steel , damage-formation strains of all grain-size specimens were reduced by the precipitates during the hot-tension test. Crack-formation sites were located at grain boundaries and were independent of the Taylor factor. A larger grain size resulted in an increased sensitivity of the fracture strain to precipitates. When the grain size was smaller than 51 Î¼m , the fracture strain became insensitive to the precipitates. A method was suggested to mitigate surface cracking for metal materials with a high precipitation tendency.
