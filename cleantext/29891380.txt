  The evolution of resistant weed populations in response to intensive herbicide selection pressure is a global issue. Resistance to post-emergence herbicides is widespread , whereas soil-applied pre-emergence herbicides can often remain effective. For example , in Australia pyroxasulfone is a new pre-emergence soil-applied herbicide which provides control of Lolium rigidum populations resistant to multiple post-emergence herbicide modes of action. A fundamental knowledge of the genetic basis of metabolic resistance in weeds is important for understanding plant evolution pathways under herbicide selection and sustaining long-term weed resistance management. In this study we define the mechanistic basis of resistance to pyroxasulfone in a L. rigidum population. TLC provides evidence that pyroxasulfone resistance is metabolism-based with approximately 88 % of parental (
