  Distribution of blood flow in myocardium is a key determinant of the localization and severity of myocardial ischemia under impaired coronary perfusion conditions. Previous studies have extensively demonstrated the transmural difference of ischemic vulnerability. However , it remains incompletely understood how transmural myocardial flow is regulated under in vivo conditions. In the present study , a computational model of the coronary circulation was developed to quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of transmural flow distribution to various cardiovascular and hemodynamic factors. The model was further incorporated with the flow autoregulatory mechanism to simulate the regulation of myocardial flow in the presence of coronary artery stenosis. Numerical tests demonstrated that heart rate ( HR) , intramyocardial tissue pressure ( P
