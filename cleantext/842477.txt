  The pathogenesis of Dupuytren 's disease ( DD) remains unclear although there is increasing evidence supporting the role of stem cells in this and other fibrotic conditions. This review examines the role of DD tissue-associated embryonic stem cells ( ESCs) and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) , and circulating fibrocytes and circulating MSCs , in the biology of DD. It is exciting to infer that dysfunction of an upstream ESC-like population within the affected tissue leads to the downstream development and proliferation of aberrant myofibroblasts through a putative MSC intermediate. This ESC-like population may be a potential novel therapeutic target through modulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore , circulating CD34
