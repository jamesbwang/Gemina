  In the absence of any robust data supporting the TNM classification of T4 buccal mucosa cancers , we did this prospective study to compare the oncologic outcomes of T4a and T4b buccal mucosa cancer patients. This is a prospective study of 210 treatment na√Øve T4 buccal mucosa cancer patients. All patients underwent upfront radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy ( RT)/ chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT). This is the largest prospective series in the literature on T4 buccal cancers. T4a disease was seen in 135 ( 64.3 %) patients and T4b in 75 ( 35.7 %) patients. On comparison between all T4a and T4b cases , a significant difference was observed with regard to 3-year local control ( 49.6 % vs. 41.1 %: p-0.025) and disease-free survival ( DFS) ( 65.3 % vs. 42 %: p-0.035) with a slightly higher incidence of distant metastasis in T4b patients ( 17.3 % vs. 9.6 %). Inadequate cut margin ( < 5 mm) was seen only in 7.4 % patients with T4a disease and 12 % patients with T4b disease. When patients with adequate cut margins were considered for analysis , local recurrence rate was similar for T4a ( 26/135; 19.3 %) and T4b ( 15/66; 22.7 %) disease suggesting the importance of radical surgery in infra-notch T4b buccal cancers. While the 3-year survival for T4a patients who received adjuvant RT alone was 72.2 % , it was only 42.1 % for similar T4b patients suggesting a need to intensify adjuvant treatment for these patients. Surgery should be considered as the primary modality of treatment for T4b patients , where clear margins are achievable. The benefit of treatment intensification with adjuvant CCRT should be explored in T4b buccal cancers.
