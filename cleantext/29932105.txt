  Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) is a disease , which mainly affects the elderly population. Unfortunately , the prognosis of patients aged > 65 years is dismal , with 1-year overall survival approaching 10 % with conventional therapies. The hypothesis of harnessing the immune system against cancer , including leukemia<disease> , has been postulated for a long time , and several clinical attempts have been made in this field. In the last years , we increased our knowledge about the interplay between AML and immune cells , but no major improvement has been translated , up to now , from bench to bedside. However , the outstanding results coming from the modern immuno-oncology trials with new drugs have granted a new interest for immunotherapy in AML. Accordingly , the elderly population represents an ideal target , given the low percentage of patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant. With that in mind , in the era of immunotherapy , we consider immunosenescence as the optimal background to start investigating a biology-driven approach to AML therapy in the elderly. By taking into account the physiological age-related changes of immune response , more personalized and tailored use of the new drugs and strategies harnessing the immune system against AML , has the potential to increase their efficacy and impact on clinical outcomes.
