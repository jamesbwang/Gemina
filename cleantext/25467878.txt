  Optimal energy and protein provision through enteral nutrition is essential for critically ill patients. However , in clinical practice , the intake achieved is often far below the recommended targets. Because no polymeric formula with sufficient protein content is available , adequate protein intake can be achieved only by supplemental amino acids or semi-elemental formula administration. In the present study , we investigated whether protein intake can be increased with a new , very high intact-protein formula ( VHPF) for enteral feeding. In this randomized , controlled , double-blind , multicenter trial , 44 overweight ( body mass index â‰¥ 25 kg/m The primary outcome , protein intake at day 5 , was 1.49 g/kg body<symptom> weight ( 95 % CI 1.21-1.78) and 0.76 g/kg body<symptom> weight ( 95 % CI 0.49-1.03 , P < 0.001) for VHPF and SHPF , respectively. Daily protein intake was statistically significantly higher in the VHPF group compared with the SHPF group from day 2 to day 10. Protein intake in the VHPF group as a percentage of target ( 1.5 g/kg ideal body<symptom> weight) was 74.7 % ( IQR 53.2-87.6 %) and 111.6 % ( IQR 51.7-130.7 %) during days 1-3 and days 4-10 , respectively. Serum amino acid concentrations were higher at day 5 in the VHPF group than in the SHPF group ( P = 0.031). No differences were found in energy intake , measures of gastrointestinal tolerance , and safety. Enteral feeding with VHPF ( 8 g/100 kcal) resulted in higher protein intake and plasma amino acid concentrations than an isocaloric SHPF ( 5 g/100 kcal) , without an increase in energy intake. This VHPF facilitates feeding according to nutritional guidelines and is suitable as a first-line nutritional treatment for critically ill overweight patients. Netherlands Trial Register , NTR5643.
