  To evaluate the effects of red propolis on cheek pouch angiogenesis in a hamster new model sponge implant. Forty eight animals divided into eight groups. ( Groups I-IV) , the animals were treated for 15 days before and 10 days after sponge implantation. ( Groups V-VIII) , the animals were treated for 10 days after sponge implantation ( GI and GV: red propolis 100 mg/kg , GII and GVI: celecoxib 20 mg/kg , GIII and GVII: 1 % gum arabic 5 mL/kg , GIV and GVIII: distilled water 5 mL/kg). On the 11th day of implantation , the animals were anesthetized for stereoscopic microscopic imaging and morphometric quantification of angiogenesis ( SQAN) , followed by histopathological evaluation ( H&E). In the SQAN analysis , no significant difference was found between the groups. However , on histology , propolis was found reduce the population of mastocytes in the qualitative analyses ( p = 0,013) in the quantitative analyses to reduce the number of blood vessels ( p = 0,007) , and increase the macrophage count ( p = 0,001). Red propolis inhibited inflammatory angiogenesis when administered before andcontinuously after sponge implant , and was shown to have immunomodulating effects on inflammatory cells ( mastocytes and macrophages) in a new sponge implant hamster model.
