  Thrombosis is a complication of prosthetic valves on oral anticoagulants which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A re-operation carries a substantial risk , with mortality rate from 10 % to 15 % in selected series , which may be 2- or 3-folds higher in critically ill patients. This study conducted in a tertiary care cardiology unit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in stuck mitral bileaflet heart valves. As a prospective observational study , clinical symptoms and fluoroscopy were the mainstay in diagnosis of stuck mitral valve. Gradient across the valve by transthoracic echocardiography was used to monitor the therapy every 6 h. Fall of mean gradient more than 50 % was considered as successful thrombolysis. And final results were again checked by fluoroscopy with documentation of improved leaflet movement. Totally we studied 34 patients. Patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase achieved an overall 91.2 % freedom from a repeat operation or major complications , a large subcutaneous hematoma occurred in one ( 2.9 %) , reoperation required in two due to failure of treatment ( 5.9 %) , allergic reaction in one ( 2.9 %) , one patient developed transient neurologic dysfunction ( 2.9 %) and one patient died during therapy due to refractory cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( 2.9 %). All patients including those with delayed presentation ( > 14 days) and hemodynamically unstable patients had good results similar to those who presented within 14 days and hemodynamically stable. Mortality was higher in unstable patients and reoperation was higher with delayed presentation. Thrombolysis with streptokinase is highly successful and safe therapy in hemodynamically stable as well as unstable patients , or those with early or delayed presentation with stuck bileaflet mitral valves , especially in centers where round the clock cardiothoracic surgery backup is not available.
