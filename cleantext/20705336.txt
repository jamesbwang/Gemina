  Most tumor cells take up more glucose than normal cells. Splicing dysregulation is one of the molecular hallmarks of cancer. However , the role of splicing factor in glucose metabolism and tumor development remains poorly defined. Here , we show that upon glucose intake , the splicing factor SRSF5 is specifically induced through Tip60-mediated acetylation on K125 , which antagonizes Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation. SRSF5 promotes the alternative splicing of CCAR1 to produce CCAR1S proteins , which promote tumor growth by enhancing glucose consumption and acetyl-CoA production. Conversely , upon glucose starvation , SRSF5 is deacetylated by HDAC1 , and ubiquitylated by Smurf1 on the same lysine , resulting in proteasomal degradation of SRSF5. The CCAR1L proteins accumulate to promote apoptosis. Importantly , SRSF5 is hyperacetylated and upregulated in human lung cancers , which correlates with increased CCAR1S expression and tumor progression. Thus , SRSF5 responds to high glucose to promote cancer development , and SRSF5-CCAR1 axis may be valuable targets for cancer therapeutics.
