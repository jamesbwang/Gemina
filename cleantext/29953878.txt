  Obesity is a chronic and debilitating disease that has become a global epidemic. Especially severe in the Unites States , obesity currently affects almost 40 % of the population. Obesity has a strong causal relationship with numerous serious comorbidities that impair quality of life , shorten life expectancy , and carry a major economic burden. Obesity has particular relevance to cardiologists because it contributes directly to several major cardiovascular diseases and , consequently , increases overall cardiovascular mortality. Multiple treatment options are available , but metabolic and bariatric surgery offers the most effective and durable treatment for obesity. Moreover , metabolic and bariatric operations alleviate and often completely eliminate numerous comorbidities , particularly type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors , such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. With their low risk of complications and morbidity , metabolic and bariatric operations significantly improve quality of life and overall survival , particularly reducing death due to cardiovascular disease.
