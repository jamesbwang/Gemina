  The aim of this study was to evaluate a new nurse-guided patient education program in spinal cord injury rehabilitation with particular focus on the patients ' perspectives and experiences. Longitudinal qualitative study. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 10 rehabilitation patients and used the content analysis method to analyze the data. Patients emphasized the importance of the practical training of the education program. This impacted their well-being as well as their autonomy. They rated discussions with primary nurses and peers about physical or psychological concerns. However , after discharge , the learning process was ongoing , and patients experienced the transition to living at home as a major challenge. This research provides valuable information from the patients ' perspective for enhancing spinal cord injury patient education. Situational learning , based on the practical parts of patient education and working with peers , is highlighted.
