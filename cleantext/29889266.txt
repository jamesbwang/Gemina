  Marburg<disease> virus ( MARV) , family Filoviridae , causes Marburg<disease> hemorrhagic<disease> fever<disease> ( MHF) in humans and nonhuman primates with case fatality rates of up to 90 %. There is no approved therapeutic for MHF , yet several experimental approaches have been evaluated in preclinical studies including small interfering RNA and monoclonal antibody ( mAb) treatment. In this study we attempted to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the neutralizing mAb M4 by combining treatment with 1 or 2 of blocking but nonneutralizing mAbs 126-15 and 127-8. We found that single-dose treatment early after infection with the neutralizing mAb M4 or any of the mAb combinations resulted in similar protection in the MARV hamster model. However , a single-dose treatment with the cocktail of all 3 mAbs provided the best protection in delayed treatment , with 67 % -100 % of the animals surviving a lethal challenge depending on the time of treatment. This study identified a new promising mAb cocktail as a therapeutic option for MHF.
