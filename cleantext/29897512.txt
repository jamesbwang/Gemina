  Plant vacuoles display many versatile functions. Vacuoles in vegetative tissues are generally involved in protein degradation , and are called lytic vacuoles. However , vegetative vacuoles in specialized cells can accumulate large concentrations of proteins , such as those in idioblast myrosin cells along veins in the order Brassicales , which store large amounts of myrosinases ( thioglucoside glucohydrolase and thioglucoside glucohydrolase). Myrosinases cleave the bond between sulfur and glucose in sulfur-rich compounds ( glucosinolates) to produce toxic compounds ( isothiocyanates) when plants are damaged by pests. This defense strategy is called the myrosinase-glucosinolate system. Recent studies identified atypical myrosinases , PENETRATION 2 ( PEN2) and PYK10 , along with key components for development of myrosin cells. In this review , we discuss three topics in the myrosinase-glucosinolate system. First , we summarize the complexity and importance of the myrosinase-glucosinolate system , including classical myrosinases , atypical myrosinases and the system that counteracts the myrosinase-glucosinolate system. Secondly , we describe molecular machineries underlying myrosin cell development , including specific reporters , cell lineage , cell differentiation and cell fate determination. The master regulators for myrosin cell differentiation , FAMA and SCREAM , are key transcription factors involved in guard cell differentiation. This indicates that myrosin cells and guard cells share similar transcriptional networks. Finally , we hypothesize that the myrosinase-glucosinolate system may have originated in stomata of ancestral Brassicales plants and , after that , plants co-opted this defense strategy into idioblasts near veins at inner tissue layers.
