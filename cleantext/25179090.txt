  To examine trimester-specific associations among glycemic variability , fetal growth , and birthweight in pregnancies with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( Type 1 DM). In this retrospective cohort study of 41 pregnant women with Type 1 DM , we used continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) data to calculate glycemic variability ( coefficient of variation of glucose) over a 7-day interval in each trimester. Clinical data , including fetal biometry , birthweight , and perinatal complications , were extracted from medical records. Women maintained good glycemic control during pregnancy , with mean HbA1c in the first , second , and third trimester 6.5 % , 6.1 % , and 6.4 % , respectively. Sixty-three percent of infants were large for gestational age ( LGA). Estimated fetal weight percentile ( EFW % ile) and abdominal circumference percentile ( AC % ile) increased during pregnancy , consistent with accelerated prenatal growth. Correlations between trimester-specific glycemic variability and EFW , AC , and birthweight were not statistically significant. After maternal age adjustment , glycemic variability was not associated with birthweight for any trimester ( adj. β for first trimester: -38.46 , 95 % CI: -98.58 to 21.66; adj. β for second trimester: -12.20 , 95 % CI: -51.47 to 27.06; adj. β for third trimester: -26.26 , 95 % CI: -79.52 to 27.00). The occurrence of LGA remains very high in contemporary U.S. women with Type 1 DM , despite the use of CGM and overall good glycemic control. Neither HbA1c nor glycemic variability predicted fetal overgrowth or birthweight. Since LGA is a key driver of maternal and newborn complications in pregnancies with Type 1 DM , our data emphasize the importance of investigating both glucose-dependent and glucose-independent underlying mechanisms.
