  This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the Beneware model ABP-021 oscillometric blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitor in the general population according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol ( ESH-IP). The accuracy of the device was assessed in relation to various clinical variables , including age , sex , BMI , and arm circumference. Thirty-three individuals ( 18 men and 15 women) , with a mean age of 36 ± 14 years ( age range: 20-68 years) , were studied according to the recommendations of the ESH-IP. Sequential same-arm blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurements were performed , alternating between a mercury standard and the automatic device. The differences among the test-control measurements were assessed and divided into categorization zones of 5 , 10 , and 15 mmHg discrepancy. The device complied with the quality requirements of the ESH-IP. The device-observer disagreement was -1.2 ± 4.7 mmHg for systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and -1.7 ± 4.3 mmHg for diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP). The device produced 77 , 93 , and 98 measurements , respectively , within the 5 , 10 , and 15 mmHg discrepancy limits for SBP. For DBP , 80 , 97 , and 99 measurements were observed within the 5 , 10 , and 15 mmHg discrepancy limits. The number of participants with two or three of the device-observer differences within 5 mmHg was 26 for SBP and 29 for DBP , whereas there were only two participants with no device-observer differences within 5 mmHg for DBP. These data show that the Beneware model ABP-021 monitor meets the requirements of the ESH-IP , in static conditions , indicating its suitability for measuring blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in the general adult population.
