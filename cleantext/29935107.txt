  To assess the associations of dietary linoleic acid ( LA) and Î±-linolenic acid ( ALA) with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) risk in a population-based cohort and further explore the mechanism of action in a high-fat-diet induced obese ( DIO) mouse model. The occurrence of T2D among 15,100 healthy Chinese adults from China Health and Nutrition Survey ( CHNS , 1997-2011) were followed up for a median of 14 years. The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI , with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them , relative risks ( 95 % confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 ( 0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 ( 0.34-0.85) in women for ALA , while 0.71 ( 0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 ( 0.36-0.89) in women for LA. DIO mice were fed with LA or ALA enriched HFD ( 0.2 % wt/wt) for 15 weeks. Significant sex-dependent changes of gut microbiota were detected in LA or ALA fed DIO mice. Endotoxemia , systematic and adipose inflammation<symptom> were relieved in ALA fed male mice and LA fed female mice. Long-term intake of LA ( for women only) and ALA may have protective effect on T2D development for obese/overweight subjects through sex-specific gut microbiota modulation and gut-adipose axis.
