  High-throughput technology has generated large-scale protein interaction data , which is crucial in our understanding of biological organisms. Many complex identification algorithms have been developed to determine protein complexes. However , these methods are only suitable for dense protein interaction networks , because their capabilities decrease rapidly when applied to sparse protein ‚Åª protein interaction ( PPI) networks. In this study , based on penalized matrix decomposition (
