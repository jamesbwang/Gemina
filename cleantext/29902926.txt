  The Exeter V40 Orthinox stem is one of the most commonly used femoral components in total hip arthroplasty. Its design , material and finish has evolved significantly from the original design established by Ling and Lee over 3 decades ago. An early problem reported with the original Exeter stem was a high rate of stem fractures. It was thought that with the new Orthinox steel used in the V40 system , the rate of stem fractures would reduce. There are reports of the Exeter V40 stem failing in a variety of locations. This paper highlights the 3 locations where the Exeter stem may fail and estimates a rate of 0.262 % for stem fractures due to the constant use of the Exeter stem throughout the career of the senior surgeon.
