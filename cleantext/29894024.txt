  As federal initiatives aim to fundamentally alter or dismantle the Affordable Care Act ( ACA) , evidence regarding the use of insurance among clients obtaining contraceptive care at Title X-funded facilities under ACA guidelines is essential to understanding what is at stake. A nationally representative sample of 2,911 clients seeking contraceptive care at 43 Title X-funded sites in 2016 completed a survey assessing their characteristics and insurance coverage and use. Chi-square tests for independence with adjustments for the sampling design were conducted to determine differences in insurance coverage and use across demographic characteristics and facility types. Most clients ( 71 %) had some form of public or private health insurance , and most of these ( 83 %) planned to use it to pay for their services. Foreign-born clients were less likely than U.S.-born clients to have coverage ( 46 % vs. 75 %) and to use it ( 78 % vs. 85 %). Clients with private insurance were less likely than those with public insurance to plan to use their insurance ( 75 % vs. 91 %). More than one-quarter of clients not planning to use existing insurance for services indicated that the reason was that someone might find out. Coverage gaps persist among individuals seeking contraceptive care within the Title X network , despite evidence indicating increases in health insurance coverage among this population since implementation of the ACA. Future research should explore the impact of altering or eliminating the ACA both on the Title X provider network and on the individuals who rely on it.
