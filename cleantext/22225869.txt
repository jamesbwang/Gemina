  Radiotherapy is among the commonly applied treatment options for glioma , which is one of the most common types of primary brain tumor. To evaluate the effect of radiotherapy noninvasively , it is vital for oncologists to monitor the effects of X-ray irradiation on glioma cells. Preliminary research had showed that PKC-ι expression correlates with tumor cell apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation. It is also believed that the lactate-to-creatine ( Lac/Cr) ratio can be used as a biomarker to evaluate apoptosis in glioma cells after X-ray irradiation. In this study , we evaluated the relationships between the Lac/Cr ratio , apoptotic rate , and protein kinase C iota ( PKC-ι) expression in glioma cells. Cells of the glioma cell lines C6 and U251 were randomly divided into 4 groups , with every group exposed to X-ray irradiation at 0 , 1 , 5 , 10 and 15 Gy. Single cell gel electrophoresis ( SCGE) was conducted to evaluate the DNA damage. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the cell cycle blockage and apoptotic rates. Western blot analysis was used to detect the phosphorylated PKC-ι ( p-PKC-ι) level. The DNA damage increased in a radiation dose-dependent manner ( The Lac/Cr ratio decreases with an increase in X-ray irradiation and thus can be used as a biomarker to reflect the effects of X-ray irradiation in glioma cells.
