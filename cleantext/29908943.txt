  and Purpose: Recent improvements in lung cancer survival have spurred an interest in understanding and minimizing long term radiation-induced lung damage ( RILD). However , there is still no objective criteria to quantify RILD leading to variable reporting across centres and trials. We propose a set of objective imaging biomarkers to quantify common radiological findings observed 12-months after lung cancer radiotherapy ( RT). Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 27 patients from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation were included in this study. To detect and measure the severity of RILD , twelve quantitative imaging biomarkers were developed. These describe basic CT findings including parenchymal change , volume reduction and pleural change. The imaging biomarkers were implemented as semi-automated image analysis pipelines and assessed against visual assessment of the occurrence of each change. The majority of the biomarkers were measurable in each patient. Their continuous nature allows objective scoring of severity for each patient. For each imaging biomarker the cohort was split into two groups according to the presence or absence of the biomarker by visual assessment , testing the hypothesis that the imaging biomarkers were different in these two groups. All features were statistically significant except for rotation of the main bronchus and diaphragmatic curvature. The majority of the biomarkers were not strongly correlated with each other suggesting that each of the biomarkers is measuring a separate element of RILD pathology. We developed objective CT-based imaging biomarkers that quantify the severity of radiological lung damage after RT.. These biomarkers are representative of typical radiological findings of RILD.
