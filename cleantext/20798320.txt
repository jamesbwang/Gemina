  The problem of how concepts can refer to or be about the non-mental world is particularly puzzling for abstract concepts. There is growing evidence that many characteristics beyond the perceptual are involved in grounding different kinds of abstract concept. A resource that has been suggested , but little explored , is introspection. This paper develops that suggestion by focusing specifically on metacognition-on the thoughts and feelings that thinkers have about a concept. One example of metacognition about concepts is the judgement that we should defer to others in how a given concept is used. Another example is our internal assessment of which concepts are dependable and useful , and which less so. Metacognition of this kind may be especially important for grounding abstract concepts.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
