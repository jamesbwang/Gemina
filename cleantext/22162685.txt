  In this study , we investigated temporal changes in galanin receptor type 2 ( GalR2) expression in NF200- , galanin- , neuropeptide Y ( NPY)- , and neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS)- like immunoreactive ( LI) dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) neurons after median nerve chronic constriction injury ( CCI) , and the effects of GalR2 on c-Fos expression in the cuneate nucleus ( CN). Double immunofluorescence labeling methods were used to appraise changes in GalR2 expression in NF200-LI , galanin-LI , NPY-LI , and nNOS-LI DRG neurons after CCI. The von Frey assay was used to assess the efficiency of intraplantar administration of saline , M871 ( a GalR2 antagonist) , or AR-M1896 ( a GalR2 agonist) on neuropathic signs of rats with CCI. The effects of alterations in c-Fos expression were assessed in all treatments. The percentage of GalR2-LI neurons in lesioned DRGs increased and peaked at 1 week after CCI. We further detected that percentages of GalR2-LI neurons labeled for NF200 , galanin , NPY , and nNOS significantly increased following CCI. Furthermore , M871 remarkably attenuated tactile allodynia , but the sensation was slightly aggravated by AR-M1896 after CCI. Consequentially , after electrical stimulation of the CCI-treated median nerve , the number of c-Fos-LI neurons in the cuneate nucleus ( CN) was significantly reduced in the M871 group , whereas it increased in the AR-M1896 group. These results suggest that activation of GalR2 , probably through NPY or nitric oxide , induces c-Fos expression in the CN and transmits mechanical allodynia sensations to the thalamus.
