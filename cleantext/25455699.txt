  Dual-task ( DT) paradigms have been used in gait research to assess the automaticity of locomotion , particularly in people with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). In people with PD , reliance on cortical control during walking leads to greater interference between cognitive and locomotor tasks. Yet , recent studies have suggested that even healthy gait requires cognitive control , and that these cognitive contributions occur at specific phases of the gait cycle. Here , we examined whether changes in gait stability , elicited by simultaneous cognitive DTs , were specific to certain phases of the gait cycle in people with PD. Phase-dependent local dynamic stability ( LDS) was calculated for 95 subjects with PD and 50 healthy control subjects during both single task and DT gait at phases corresponding to ( 1) heel contact-weight transfer , ( 2) toe-off-early swing , and ( 3) single-support-mid swing. PD-related DT interference was evident only for the duration of late swing and LDS during the heel contact-weight transfer phase of gait. No PD-related DT costs were found in other traditional spatiotemporal gait parameters. These results suggest that PD-related DT interference occurs only during times where cortical activity is needed for planning and postural adjustments. These results challenge our understanding of DT costs while walking , particularly in people with PD , and encourage researchers to re-evaluate traditional concepts of DT interference.
