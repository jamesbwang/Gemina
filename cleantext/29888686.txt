  This study associated Human<pathogen> Papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infection and other clinical parameters with five-year survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi , Pakistan. A total of 140 patients diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma were enlisted. HPV<pathogen> status and subtypes were established through polymerase chain reaction performed in a previously published study. Clinical data including five-year survival were obtained through institutional medical records. Ninety-five patients ( 67.9 per cent) were positive for HPV<pathogen>. Of these , 85 patients were HPV<pathogen> 16 positive while 2 patients were HPV<pathogen> 18 positive. The mean survival time for HPV<pathogen> positive patients was 44.3 months , whereas survival time for HPV<pathogen> negative patients was 46.9 months. Univariate analysis showed that HPV<pathogen> status in oral squamous cell carcinoma was not a statistically significant factor in determining five-year survival rate ( p = 0.386). There is a high prevalence of HPV<pathogen> positive oral squamous cell carcinoma in Pakistan; however , there is no difference in the five-year survival rate when compared to HPV<pathogen> negative oral squamous cell carcinoma.
