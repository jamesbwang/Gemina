  Higher sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P) plasma levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density ( BMD) , and increased risk of prevalent vertebral fracture. So , we hypothesized that postmenopausal women with increased baseline plasma S1P levels have a greater risk for future incident fracture ( osteoporosis-related fractures ( ORFs)). This study was conducted in a prospective longitudinal cohort of 707 women recruited in 2004 and followed up annually for a mean period of 5.2 ± 1.3 years. They were postmenopausal ( aged ≥ 50 years). The primary outcome measure was the time to the first confirmed ORF<pathogen> event using radiographs and/or a surgical report. The plasma S1P levels ( µmol/L) were significantly higher in the women with incident fracture ( 7.23 ± 0.79) than in those without ORFs ( 5.02 ± 0.51; The associations between plasma S1P levels and fracture risk were independent of BMD and other confounders. These findings demonstrate that high plasma S1P level at baseline and at years 1 to 5 is a strong and independent risk factor for future ( ORFs) among postmenopausal women and could be a useful biomarker for fracture risk assessment in this population.
