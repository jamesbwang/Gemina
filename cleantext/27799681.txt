  This research was conducted to examine the simple visual and auditory reaction times of badminton players of the national teams and to examine the possible effects of reaction-time average values of badminton players under the age of 15 who participated in the fifth International Rumi Child Sport Games. In total , 48 players ( male = 24; female = 24) from six countries ( Turkey , Azerbaijan , Bulgaria , Macedonia , Serbia , Georgia) participated in the study. Stature , bodyweight , BMI , dominant and non-dominant hand visual and auditory reaction time values of the participants were detected. At the end of the study , it was determined that there were statistically significant differences between the countries in terms of male dominant and non-dominant hand visual reaction values , and male dominant hand auditory reaction values. It was also determined that there were statistically significant differences between the countries in terms of female bodyweight , BMI , dominant and non-dominant hand visual reaction values , and female non-dominant hand auditory reaction values. There was statistically significant difference between female and male players with regards to dominant and non-dominant hand visual , and non-dominant hand auditory reaction values. In conclusion , it was determined that the reaction times of the top ranking countries in the fifth International Rumi Child Sport Games under-15 were at a better level , and it can be concluded that this factor played an important role for success alongside with technique and tactic features.
