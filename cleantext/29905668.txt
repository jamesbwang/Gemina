  To report a case of central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with macular telangiectasia Type 2 using multimodal imaging. Observational case report. A 58-year-old woman who presented with acute painless unilateral vision loss<symptom> was diagnosed with central retinal artery occlusion in her right eye with macular telangiectasia Type 2 findings in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed retinal whitening with unusual cherry-red spot plus small crystalline deposits in the temporal macula. Surprisingly , spectral domain optical coherence tomography of the contralateral eye showed characteristically intraretinal hyporreflective spaces , whereas optical coherence tomography angiography exhibited microvascular abnormalities in the deep capillary plexus. At follow-up , a pseudolamellar macular hole was noticed in the affected eye with no recovery of best-corrected visual acuity. This case describes an onset of central artery occlusion in a patient with underlying macular telangiectasia Type 2 and suggests that it had a possible role in the acceleration of its natural course. The utility of multimodal imaging lies on better accuracy in diagnosis as well as prognosis , management , and monitoring of the disease.
