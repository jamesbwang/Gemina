  The manual evaluation , classification and counting of biological objects demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells ( RBCs) in microcapillary Poiseuille flow , we overcome this drawback by introducing a convolutional neural regression network for an automatic , outlier tolerant shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ` slipper ' and ` croissant ' shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates , slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method , we are able to find the transition point between both ` phases ' of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds , from our data , we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively , our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results. Moreover , the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.
