  Lung transplantation is the last option for the treatment of end stage chronic lung disorders. Because the shortage of donor lung organs represents the main hurdle , lung regeneration has been considered to overcome this hurdle. Recellularization of decellularized organ scaffold is a promising option for organ regeneration. Although detergents are ordinarily used for decellularization , other approaches are possible. Here we used high alkaline ( pH12) sodium hydroxide ( NaOH)- PBS solution without detergents for lung decellularization and compared the efficacy on DNA elimination and ECM preservation with detergent based decellularization solutions CHAPS and SDS. Immunohistochemical image analysis showed that cell components were removed by NaOH solution as well as other detergents. A Collagen and GAG assay showed that the collagen reduction of the NaOH group was comparable to that of the CHAPS and SDS groups. However , DNA reduction was more significant in the NaOH group than in other groups ( p < 0.0001). The recellularization of HUVEC revealed cell attachment was not inferior to that of the SDS group. Ex vivo functional analysis showed 100 % oxygen ventilation increased oxygen partial pressure as artificial hemoglobin vesicle-PBS solution passed through regenerated lungs in the SDS or NaOH group. It was concluded that the NaOH-PBS based decellularization solution was comparable to ordinal decellularizaton solutions and competitive in cost effectiveness and residues in the decellularized scaffold negligible , thus providing another potential option to detergent for future clinical usage.
