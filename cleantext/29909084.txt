  The treatment of mandibular condyle fractures has been the subject of considerable discussion , especially whether open or closed treatment should be used. There is a need for practical,evidence-based guidelines , and both objective and subjective parameters should be measured. To date , fewstudies have considered clinically relevant subjective parameters. This study was performed to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment of condylar fractures using the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire ( MFIQ) and the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders ( DC/TMD) and to compare the outcomes of open and the closed treatment. Patients with condylar fractures and at least 1 year of follow-up were examined. These patients completed the MFIQ and other questionnaires , and were examined according to the DC/TMD. Seventy-four of 171 eligible patients participated in this study. The mean MFIQ score was 10.70 ( standard error 2.9) in the open group and 4.96 ( standard error 1.3) in the closed group ( P = 0.023) , an outcome in favour of the closed treatment group. Examination according to the DC/TMD did not reveal a significant prevalence of TMD complaints. Closed treatment appears to be a safe and appropriate modality for most unilateral condylar fractures. Although the open group in general showed similar outcomes , this treatment should be reserved for limited indications.
