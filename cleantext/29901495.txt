  To investigate multispectral imaging ( MSI) as a novel diagnostic approach for diabetic retinopathy ( DR) in clinic. A total of 50 Type-2 diabetic patients ( 99 eyes) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All subjects underwent digital fundus photography ( DFP) , MSI , and fundus fluorescein angiography. A total exact agreement , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value of no DR/mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR) and severe NPDR/proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR) grading were calculated based on DFP and MSI and were compared with fundus fluorescein angiography. Compared with fundus fluorescein angiography , the exact agreement for MSI was 0.835; for DFP , it was 0.614; the sensitivity for no DR/mild NPDR in both MSI and DFP was 100 % , and for severe NPDR/PDR , it was 97.4 % and 88.3 %. The specificity for no DR/mild NPDR in MSI and DFP was 96.3 % and 95 % , and for severe NPDR/PDR , it was 100 % in both. The positive predictive value for no DR/mild NPDR in MSI and DFP was 86.4 % and 82.6 % , and for severe NPDR/PDR , it was 100 % in both; the negative predictive value for no DR/mild NPDR in MSI and DFP was 100 % , and for severe NPDR/PDR , it was 91.7 % and 71.0 % in both. Multispectral imaging displayed an excellent agreement with fundus fluorescein angiography in DR grading , which suggested that it might serve as a new diagnostic technique and an informative tool for evaluating DR.
