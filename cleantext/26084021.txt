  The identification of the cellular origin of cancer is important for our understanding of the mechanisms regulating carcinogenesis , thus the cellular origin of cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) is a current topic of interest. Although CCA has been considered to originate from biliary epithelial cells , recent studies have suggested that multiple cell types can develop into CCA. With regard to the hilar and extrahepatic bile ducts , peribiliary glands ( PBGs) , a potential stem cell niche of biliary epithelial cells , have attracted attention as the cellular origin of biliary tract cancer. Recent histopathological and experimental studies have suggested that some kinds of inflammation-induced CCA and intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct are more likely to originate from PBGs. During inflammation-mediated cholangiocarcinogenesis , the biliary epithelial injury-induced regenerative response by PBGs is considered a key process. Thus , in this review , we discuss recent advances in our understanding of cholangiocarcinogenesis from the viewpoint of inflammation<symptom> and the cellular origin of CCA , especially focusing on PBGs.
