  This study aimed to investigate whether exosomes secreted by mouse GATA-4-expressing bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) could induce BMSC differentiation into myocyte precursors , decrease cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and improve cardiac function following myocardial infarction ( MI). BMSCs were transduced with a lentivirus carrying a doxycycline ( DOX)- inducible GATA-4 or control lentivirus , and secreted exosomes from these BMSCs were collected and co-cultured with BMSCs or cardiomyocytes under hypoxic and serum free conditions. Furthermore , exosomes were injected into mice 48 h after MI. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography at 48 , 72 , and 96 h after exosome treatment. Quantitative PCR showed that co-culture of BMSCs with GATA-4-BMSC exosomes increased cardiomyocyte-related marker expression. Co-culture of GATA-4-BMSC exosomes with cardiomyocytes in anoxic conditions decreased apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry. Injection of GATA-4-BMSC exosomes in mice 48 h after MI increased cardiac function over the next 96 h; increased cardiac blood vessel density and number of c-kit-positive cells and decreased apoptotic cardiomyocyte cells were also observed. Differential expression of candidate differentiation- and apoptosis-related miRNAs and proteins that may mediate these effects was also identified. Exosomes isolated from GATA-4-expressing BMSCs induce differentiation of BMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells , decrease anoxia-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and improve myocardial function after infarction.
