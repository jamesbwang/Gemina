  To determine the test-retest correlation of an objective eye-tracking device among uninjured youth athletes. Repeated-measures study. Sports-medicine clinic. Healthy youth athletes ( mean age = 14.6 Â± 2.2 years; 39 % women) completed a brief , automated , and objective eye-tracking assessment. Participants completed the eye-tracking assessment at 2 different testing sessions. During the assessment , participants watched a 220-second video clip while it moved around a computer monitor in a clockwise direction as an eye tracker recorded eye movements<symptom>. We obtained 13 eye movement<symptom> outcome variables and assessed correlations between the assessments made at the 2 time points using Spearman 's Rho ( rs). Thirty-one participants completed the eye-tracking evaluation at 2 time points ( median = 7 ( interquartile range = 6-9) days between tests). No significant differences in outcomes were found between the 2 testing times. Several eye movement<symptom> variables demonstrated moderate to moderately high test-retest reliability. Combined eye conjugacy metric ( BOX score , rs = 0.529 , P = 0.008) , the variance of the ratio for both eye movements<symptom> in the horizontal ( rs = 0.497 , P = 0.013) and vertical ( rs = 0.446; P = 0.029) movement planes along the top/bottom of the computer screen , and the variance of the left and right eye movement<symptom> along the bottom segment of the computer screen ( rs = 0.565; P = 0.004) each demonstrated moderate between-test correlations. Automated and quantitative eye movement<symptom> and conjugacy metrics provide relatively stable measurements among a group of healthy youth athletes. Thus , their inclusion as a visual tracking metric may be complementary to other visual examination techniques when monitoring concussion recovery across time.
