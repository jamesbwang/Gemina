  Cerebrovascular diseases of ischemic origin still remain the leading cause of death and disability of the population. In acute cerebral discirculation conditions , anaerobic glycolysis is activated , ATP formation rate decreases , the ion pumps work is disrupted and superoxide radicals are formed. Eventually , ionic asymmetry leads to the cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema<symptom>. Therefore , it is extremely important to induce simultaneous ( complex) effect of medications on the key mechanisms of neuronal damage in process of survival of brain cells during acute ischemic stroke. On this evidence , in the experiments on rats ( n = 70) , the neuroprotective activity of magnesium sulfate , lamotrigine and acetylcysteine as a combination was studied , under normobaric hypoxia conditions ( after carotid ligation of the right carotid artery). Researches have shown the use of magnesium sulfate ( 1000 mg/kg , ip) , lamotrigine ( 20 mg/kg , per os) and acetylcysteine ( 200 mg/kg , per os) as a combination , is accompanied by increasing antioxidant and neuroprotective activity of drugs. The protective index in this group was 2.18 and the differences were statistically significant compared to control group ( p < 0.05). All factors- enhancement of the antioxidant systems of neurons by acetylcysteine , inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity by lamotrigine and correction of ion stress by magnesium ions , critically increase the time prior to apnea. Accordingly , the combination of magnesium sulfate , lamotrigine and acetylcysteine is able to protect brain cells from the damaging effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation and can be effectively used for pharmacological correction of hypoxic brain damage ( in acute ischemic stroke).
