  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE) is expressed in human skeletal muscle. The ACE I/D polymorphism has been associated with athletic performance in some studies. Studies suggested that the ACE I/D gene variant is associated with ACE enzyme content in the serum , and there is an interaction between ACE and Uncoupling Proteins 2 and 3 ( UCP2 , and UCP3). However , no studies have explored the effect of ACE I/D on ACE , UCP2 and UCP3 protein content in human skeletal muscle. Utilising the Gene SMART cohort ( n = 81) , we investigated whether the ACE I/D gene variant is associated with ACE enzyme content in blood , and ACE , UCP2 , and UCP3 protein content in skeletal muscle at baseline , and following a session of High-Intensity Interval Exercise ( HIIE). Using a stringent and robust statistical analyses , we found that the ACE I/D gene variant was associated with ACE enzyme content in blood ( p < 0.005) at baseline , but not the ACE , UCP2 , and UCP3 protein content in muscle at baseline. A single session of HIIE tended ( 0.005 < p < 0.05) to increase blood ACE content immediately post exercise , while muscle ACE protein content was lower 3 hours post a single session of HIIE ( p < 0.005). Muscle UCP3 protein content decreased immediately post a single session of HIIE ( p < 0.005) , and remained low 3 hours post exercise. However , those changes in the muscle were not genotype-dependent. In conclusion , The ACE I/D gene variant predicts ACE enzyme content in blood but not the ACE , UCP2 and UCP3 protein content of human skeletal muscle.
