  Ectodermal dysplasia ( ED) is a rare hereditary disorder involving two or more of the ectodermal structures , which include the skin , hair , nails , teeth , and sweat<symptom> glands. The two most common forms of the disease are hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ED and hidrotic ED. They are caused by the mutations of several genes. We present a case of a 9-year-old child with hypohidrotic ED , who presented with hypodontia , dyshidrosis , hypotrichosis , and raised body temperature. We treated the raised body temperature symptomatically with cooling techniques and antipyretics. A multidisciplinary approach with physicians from several fields is required to provide comprehensive medical care to patients with ED.
