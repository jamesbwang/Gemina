  To analyze the concentration of 34 kinds of elements in drinking water in Beijing. From September 15 th to 20 th , 2016 , 92 families from four directions in Beijing urban area were randomly selected and drinking water from them were collected. In 24 of the 92 families , water samples were also collected from water treatment devices. The concentrations of 17 kinds of elements were determined then evaluated. The concentration of 17 kinds of elements meet the hygiene standards of drinking water in all of the drinking water samples except that the iron and mercury concentration of one sample exceed the quality limits. The central water supply 18 kinds of elements detection rate was 3. 1 % -63. 1 % , the detection rate of 16 kinds of rare earth elements was 47. 6 % -100 %. Secondary water supply 18 kinds of elements detection rate was 3. 7 % -63. 0 % , 16 kinds of rare earth elements in the detection rate of 48. 9 % -100 %. Water treatment devices 18 kinds of metal elements detection rate was 4. 2 % -75. 0 %. The silver concentration in water samples from water treatment devices and secondary water was significantly higher than that from central water supply ( F _ ( Ag) = 4. 21 , P < 0. 05) , no significant difference was observed in the rest of the 33 elements in watersamples from different water supply significant difference in the concentration of element selenium , nickel and iron was observed among the water samples from four different directions of Beijing ( F _ ( Se) = 3. 64 , P < 0. 05; F _ ( Ni) = 3. 38 , P < 0. 05; F _ ( Fe) = 3. 83 , P < 0. 05). The water quality of central water supply samples and secondary drinking water supply samples in Beijing met the hygiene standards.
