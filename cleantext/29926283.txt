  The capability to remember and execute intentions in the future- termed prospective memory ( PM)- may be of special significance for older adults to enable successful completion of important activities of daily living. Despite the importance of this cognitive function , mixed findings have been obtained regarding age-related decline in PM , and , currently , there is limited understanding of potential contributing mechanisms. In the current study , older ( N = 41) and younger adults ( N = 47) underwent task-functional MRI during performance of PM conditions that encouraged either spontaneous retrieval ( Focal) or sustained attentional monitoring ( Non-focal) to detect PM targets. Older adults exhibited a reduction in PM-related sustained activity within the anterior prefrontal cortex ( aPFC) and associated dorsal frontoparietal cognitive control network , due to an increase in non-specific sustained activation in ( no-PM) control blocks ( i.e. , an age-related compensatory shift). Transient PM-trial specific activity was observed in both age groups within a ventral parietal memory network that included the precuneus. However , within a left posterior inferior parietal node of this network , transient PM-related activity was selectively reduced in older adults during the non-focal condition. These age differences in sustained and transient brain activity statistically mediated age-related declines in PM performance , and were potentially linked via age-related changes in functional connectivity between the aPFC and precuneus. Together , they support an account consistent with the Dual Mechanisms of Control framework , in which age-related PM declines are due to neural mechanisms that support proactive cognitive control processes , such as sustained attentional monitoring , while leaving reactive control mechanisms relatively spared.
