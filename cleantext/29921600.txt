  The mammary epithelium depends on specific lineages and their stem and progenitor function to accommodate hormone-triggered physiological demands in the adult female. Perturbations of these lineages underpin breast cancer risk , yet our understanding of normal mammary cell composition is incomplete. Here , we build a multimodal resource for the adult gland through comprehensive profiling of primary cell epigenomes , transcriptomes , and proteomes. We define systems-level relationships between chromatin-DNA-RNA-protein states , identify lineage-specific DNA methylation of transcription factor binding sites , and pinpoint proteins underlying progesterone responsiveness. Comparative proteomics of estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and- negative cell populations , extensive target validation , and drug testing lead to discovery of stem and progenitor cell vulnerabilities. Top epigenetic drugs exert cytostatic effects; prevent adult mammary cell expansion , clonogenicity , and mammopoiesis; and deplete stem cell frequency. Select drugs also abrogate human breast progenitor cell activity in normal and high-risk patient samples. This integrative computational and functional study provides fundamental insight into mammary lineage and stem cell biology.
