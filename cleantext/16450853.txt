  Recent evidence suggests that cholera<disease> toxin might have multiple functions regarding the ability to regulate the immune system. However , it is unknown whether subsequent administration of cholera<disease> vaccine might affect the mortality rate in patients with prostate cancer. Here we report that patients in Sweden , who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between July 2005 and December 2014 and used cholera<disease> vaccine , have a decreased risk of death from prostate cancer ( HR , 0.57; 95 % CI , 0.40-0.82) as compared to patients with prostate cancer but without cholera<disease> vaccine use , adjusted for a range of confounding factors. In addition , patients using cholera<disease> vaccine show a decreased risk of death overall ( HR , 0.53; 95 % CI , 0.41-0.69). The decreased mortality rate is largely consistent , irrespective of patients ' age or tumor stage at diagnosis. In this population-based study , we suggest that subsequent administration of cholera<disease> vaccine after prostate cancer diagnosis might reduce the mortality rate.
