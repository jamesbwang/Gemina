  Fatal familial insomnia ( FFI) and sporadic fatal insomnia ( sFI) , or thalamic form of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease MM2 ( sCJDMM2T) , are prion diseases originally named and characterized in 1992 and 1999 , respectively. FFI is genetically determined and linked to a D178N mutation coupled with the M129 genotype in the prion protein gene ( PRNP) at chromosome 20. sFI is a phenocopy of FFI and likely its sporadic form. Both diseases are primarily characterized by progressive sleep impairment , disturbances of autonomic nervous system , and motor signs associated with severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of nerve cells in medial thalamic nuclei. Both diseases harbor an abnormal disease-associated prion protein isoform , resistant to proteases with relative mass of 19 kDa identified as resPrP
