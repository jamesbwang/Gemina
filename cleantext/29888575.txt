  To observe the effect of acupuncture intervention on depressive-like behavior and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and nitric oxide ( NO) levels in the prefrontal cortex in chronic stress induced depression<symptom> rats , so as to explore its mechanism underlying antidepressant effect. SD rats were randomly divided into control , model , acupuncture and medication ( Fluoxetine) groups ( 8 rats/group). The depression<symptom> model was established by chro-nic unpredictable stress stimulation ( fasting , water deprivation , cold water swimming , tail clamping , constraining , etc. , and solitary raising) for 28 days. Acupuncture treatment was applied to `` Baihui '' ( GV 20) and unilateral `` Neiguan '' ( PC 6) once every other day for 14 days. Fluoxetine ( 10 mg/kg) was given to rats of the medication group by gavage ( p.o.) before every stress stimulation , once every day for 28 days. The animals ' behavior was tested by using sucrose intake and open field tests ( number of crossings and rearings in 5 min). The expression of NF-κB in the prefrontal cortex was detected by Western blot , and the contents of prefrontal iNOS and NO were detected by ELISA and nitric reductases , respectively. After modeling , the sucrose intake and the numbers of crossing and rearing times were significantly decreased ( Acupuncture treatment can improve the depressive-like behavior of depression<symptom> rats , which is closely related to its effects in down-regulating the levels of NF-κB protein , iNOS and NO in the prefrontal cortex to reduce brain inflammatory damage.
