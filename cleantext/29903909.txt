  Ulp1 and Ulp2 , in the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , are the founding members of deSUMOylating enzymes. These enzymes remove Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( SUMO) from proteins and are conserved in all eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that Ulp1 deSUMOylates the bulk of intracellular SUMOylated proteins , while Ulp2 is a highly specific enzyme. However , the mechanism for Ulp2 's substrate specificity has been insufficiently understood. Here we show that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Ulp2 contains three distinct , yet conserved , motifs that control its in vivo substrate specificity and cell growth. Among them , a SUMO-interacting motif ( SIM) was found to coordinate with the domain of Ulp2 that binds to the nucleolar protein Csm1 to ensure maximal deSUMOylation of Ulp2 's nucleolar substrates. We found that while the Csm1-binding domain of Ulp2 recruits this enzyme to the nucleolus , Ulp2 's C-terminal SIM promotes its SUMO protease activity and plays a key role in mediating the in vivo specificity of Ulp2. Thus , the substrate specificity of Ulp2 is controlled by both its subcellular localization and the SUMOylation status of its substrates. These findings illustrate the highly coordinated and dynamic nature of the SUMO pathways in maintaining homeostasis of intracellular SUMOylation.
