  We compare two approaches for deriving corrections to the `` linear model '' of cavity optomechanics , in order to describe effects that are beyond first order in the radiation pressure coupling. In the regime where the mechanical frequency is much lower than the cavity one , we compare: ( I) a widely used phenomenological Hamiltonian conserving the photon number; ( II) a two-mode truncation of C. K. Law 's microscopic model , which we take as the `` true '' system Hamiltonian. While these approaches agree at first order , the latter model does not conserve the photon number , resulting in challenging computations. We find that approach ( I) allows for several analytical predictions , and significantly outperforms the linear model in our numerical examples. Yet , we also find that the phenomenological Hamiltonian can not fully capture all high-order corrections arising from the C. K. Law model.
