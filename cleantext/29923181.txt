  There has been renewed public interest in manned space exploration owing to novel initiatives by private and governmental bodies. Long-term goals include manned missions to , and potential colonization of , nearby planets. Travel distances and mission length required for these would render Earth-based treatment and telemedical solutions unfeasible. These issues present an anticipatory challenge to planners , and novel or adaptive medical technologies must therefore be devised to diagnose and treat the range of medical issues that future space travellers will encounter. The aim was to conduct a search of the literature pertaining to human physiology , pathology , trauma and surgery in space. Known physiological alterations include fluid redistribution , cardiovascular changes , bone and muscle atrophy , and effects of ionizing radiation. Potential pathological mechanisms identified include trauma , cancer and common surgical conditions , such as appendicitis<disease> Potential surgical treatment modalities must consist of self-sufficient and adaptive technology , especially in the face of uncertain pathophysiological mechanisms and logistical concerns.
