  The risk factors implicated in the genesis of chronic subdural hematomas include old age , alcoholism , diabetes mellitus , arachnoid cysts<symptom> , coagulopathy , anticoagulant ( ACTh) and antiplatelet drugs. However , no study has reported an association between arterial hypertension ( HTA) and chronic subdural hematomas. Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate whether HTA is a risk factor for spontaneous chronic subdural hematomas ( SCSDHs). This multicenter study included patients aged over 60 years and was conducted from January 2009 to the end of 2015. One hundred and twenty-two patients with SCSDHs and 111 controls treated for other reasons with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhages<symptom> on brain computed tomography were enrolled. The patients were separated into three age subgroups to provide a better insight into the role of risk factors with age. The average age in the SCSDH group was 74.45 ± 8.16 years , compared to 71.28 ± 6.69 years in the control group. The SCSDH group was significantly older than the control group ( p = 0.0014). The patients in the 60-69 years age group diagnosed with SCSDHs had significantly higher rates of HTA ( p = 0.0519) , ACTh treatment ( p = 0.0292) and alcoholism ( p = 0.0300) than the control group. The patients in the 70-79 years age group diagnosed with SCSDHs had significantly higher rates of HTA ( p = 0.0071) and ACTh treatment ( p = 0.0158) than the control group. In the subgroup of patients older than 80 years , there were no statistical differences. The incidence of HTA had borderline significance in the patients aged 60-69 years with SCSDHs and statistical significance in the patients aged 70-79 years with SCSDHs. Anticoagulant therapy was the most significant risk factor. Among the patients with SCSDHs aged 60-69 years , the percentage of heavy drinkers was significantly higher than in the control group.
