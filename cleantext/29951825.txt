  The completion of whole-genome sequences has greatly broadened our understanding of genes and genomes. The availability of model organism databases facilitates the sharing of information. However , it is still challenging to predict the pathogenicity of missense mutations , and it is more difficult to evaluate the functional impact of noncoding variants. What is more , it is a primary question to understand what variants interact to express phenotypes. Powerful genetic tools and resources available in Drosophila now make it much easier to replace endogenous genes with exogenous DNA. This allows us to directly investigate and compare the functions of orthologs , variants , and fragments in a single genetic background , the value of which should be widely appreciated. To take one example , we are currently studying so-called ultra-conserved elements , which have been conserved over hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Many highly conserved elements are in noncoding regions and are thought to play a pivotal role in gene regulation. We generated transgenic fly lines carrying human ultra-conserved elements for enhancer reporter assay and indeed observed the reporter expression in one or more tissues of embryos and larvae in all elements tested. Currently , transgenic human-ORF lines expressing human genes under the control of GAL4/UAS system are also been developed , which will greatly facilitate the cross-species in Drosophila. In this chapter , I introduce useful tools and resources available in Drosophila to nonspecialists , encouraging their further use in many applications.
