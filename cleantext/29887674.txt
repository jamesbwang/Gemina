  The viscoelastic/viscoplastic behavior of cement paste may occur due to intrinsic calcium silicate hydrate ( C-S-H) viscoelasticity/viscoplasticity and cement grain dissolution during the hydration process. A numerical model that combines a microstructure model and a finite element calculation model has been developed to predict the time-dependent behavior of cementitious materials based on these two mechanisms , while incorporating C-S-H intrinsic aging. The simulation results from the model suggest that when considering C-S-H aging , the time-dependent properties of C-S-H are capable of generating the aging effect of cement paste , and can become a significant mechanism leading to the overall relaxation of cement paste.
