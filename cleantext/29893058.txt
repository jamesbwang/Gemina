  Due to an increasing number of cancer patients , new follow-up models are being debated , among them follow-up by general practitioners. Before changing surveillance , patients ' views are important to explore. The purpose of this study was to compare attitudes toward follow-up care among patients treated for gynecological cancer who had not yet started a follow-up regimen to those who had been attending a hospital-based follow-up regimen for > 1 year. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among gynecological cancer patients recruited from three Norwegian hospitals in 2013-2015: Sørlandet Hospital Kristiansand , Sørlandet Hospital Arendal , and St. Olavs hospital , Trondheim. 239 patients agreed to participate , 100 who had not yet started follow-up and 139 who had been attending > 1 year of follow-up. Patients reported that they preferred to be followed up by a gynecologist rather than by their GP , whom they viewed as less competent for this purpose. However , patients who had not yet started follow-up were more willing to be followed up by a GP. Overall , patients rated detection of recurrence as the most important aspect of follow-up visits. The gynecological cancer patients in our study preferred a hospital-based follow-up model. However , patients who had not yet started follow-up were more willing to be followed up by a GP. If follow-up is to be provided by GPs for selected patients , it is important that these patients are informed early of the value and limitations of follow-up visits , to ensure that they feel safe.
