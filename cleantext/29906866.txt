  We examine the connection between the singularities or quasisingularities in the solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation ( INSE) and the local energy transfer and dissipation , in order to explore in detail how the former contributes to the phenomenon of intermittency. We do so by analyzing the velocity fields ( a) measured in the experiments on the turbulent von K치rm치n swirling flow at high Reynolds numbers and ( b) obtained from the direct numerical simulations of the INSE at a moderate resolution. To compute the local interscale energy transfer and viscous dissipation in experimental and supporting numerical data , we use the weak solution formulation generalization of the K치rm치n-Howarth-Monin equation. In the presence of a singularity in the velocity field , this formulation yields a nonzero dissipation ( inertial dissipation) in the limit of an infinite resolution. Moreover , at finite resolutions , it provides an expression for local interscale energy transfers down to the scale where the energy is dissipated by viscosity. In the presence of a quasisingularity that is regularized by viscosity , the formulation provides the contribution to the viscous dissipation due to the presence of the quasisingularity. Therefore , our formulation provides a concrete support to the general multifractal description of the intermittency. We present the maps and statistics of the interscale energy transfer and show that the extreme events of this transfer govern the intermittency corrections and are compatible with a refined similarity hypothesis based on this transfer. We characterize the probability distribution functions of these extreme events via generalized Pareto distribution analysis and find that the widths of the tails are compatible with a similarity of the second kind. Finally , we make a connection between the topological and the statistical properties of the extreme events of the interscale energy transfer field and its multifractal properties.
