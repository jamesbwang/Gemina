  Despite extensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control mutagenesis , it is not known how spontaneous mutations are produced in cells with fully operative mutation-prevention systems. By using a mutation assay that allows visualization of DNA replication errors and stress response transcriptional reporters , we examined populations of isogenic
