  Proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EHEC) O157 , but the spectrum of bacterial components involved in the proinflammatory responses is not fully understood. Here , we investigated the abilities of outer membrane vesicles ( OMVs) , nanoparticles released by EHEC O157 during growth , to induce production of proinflammatory cytokines in human intestinal epithelial cells. OMVs from both EHEC O157: H7 and sorbitol-fermenting ( SF) EHEC O157: H
