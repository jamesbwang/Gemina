  A mission-oriented approach to cancer care in Europe was proposed by Julio Celis and Dainius Pavalkis in 2017. The major proposed objective is to achieve long-term survival of 3 out of 4 cancer patients by 2030. The authors are president or president-elect of Organization of European Cancer Institutes ( OECI) EU Life or European Cancer Community Organization ( ECCO). The goal is laudable and ambitious. However , it can only be successful if it is coordinated with active involvement of all stakeholders and interacts with an already well-organized , recognized , and certified European Accreditation and Designation quality approach to identify and select the potential candidates to participate in such a virtual network. The building of a virtual European Cancer Institute based on coordinated networks should refer to unquestioned criteria using a solid and proven methodology operated by an independent arbitration body. The cancer community must share a fundamental responsibility to act collectively and in today 's era of the World Wide Web , it is time to think out of the box and consider the possibility of establishing networks of networks.
