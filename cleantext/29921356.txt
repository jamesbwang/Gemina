  The purpose of this work was to investigate the brain 's rhythmic activity during a simulated microgravity condition ( namely dry immersion). During dry immersion , which lasted for 5 d , nine subjects ( healthy men , 20 to 29 yr of age) were individually placed in a tub ( 2.2 × 1.1 × 0.85 m) filled with water ( temperature was kept constant at about 33 °C). Subject floated in the tub without bodily support in the supine horizontal position , but isolated from the water by waterproof material. Resting state EEGs were registered at the fourth or fifth day of dry immersion. Under the control conditions , resting state EEGs were registered while subjects laid in a supine position on a couch. Compared to the control condition , EEG power in the alpha range ( 8-13 Hz) was greater in dry immersion; this effect was distributed across the whole scalp. No effects of dry immersion were found for the beta , delta , or theta frequency bands. The results of the study , similar to those obtained in a real spaceflight , indicate that support withdrawal is an important contributor to brain activity alterations in weightlessness.Lazarev IE , Tomilovskaya ES , Kozlovskaya IB.
