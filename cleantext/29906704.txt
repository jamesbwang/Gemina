  Retrovirus assembly is driven mostly by Gag polyprotein oligomerization , which is mediated by inter and intra protein-protein interactions among its capsid ( CA) domains. Mason-Pfizer monkey<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( M-PMV) CA contains three cysteines ( C82 , C193 and C213) , where the latter two are highly conserved among most retroviruses. To determine the importance of these cysteines , we introduced mutations of these residues in both bacterial and proviral vectors and studied their impact on the M-PMV life cycle. These studies revealed that the presence of both conserved cysteines of M-PMV CA is necessary for both proper assembly and virus infectivity. Our findings suggest a crucial role of these cysteines in the formation of infectious mature particles.
