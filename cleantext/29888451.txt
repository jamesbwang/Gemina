  Piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials have shown great potential for control of the optical process in emerging materials. There are three ways for them to impact on the optical process in various materials. They can act as external perturbations , such as ferroelectric gating and piezoelectric strain , to tune the optical properties of the materials and devices. Second , ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity as innate attributes may exist in some optoelectronic materials , which can couple with other functional features ( e.g. , semiconductor transport , photoexcitation , and photovoltaics) in the materials giving rise to unprecedented device characteristics. The last way is artificially introducing optical functionalities into ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials and devices , which provides an opportunity for investigating the intriguing interplay between the parameters ( e.g. , electric field , temperature , and strain) and the introduced optical properties. Here , the tuning strategies , fundamental mechanisms , and recent progress in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects modulating the optical properties of a wide spectrum of materials , including lanthanide-doped phosphors , quantum dots , 2D materials , wurtzite-type semiconductors , and hybrid perovskites , are presented. Finally , the future outlook and challenges of this exciting field are suggested.
