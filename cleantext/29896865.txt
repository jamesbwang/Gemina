  Intestinal bacteria carry antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) genes in mobile genetic elements which have the potential to spread to bacteria in other animal hosts including humans. In fecal matter , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> can continue to multiply for 48 hr after being excreted , and in certain environments , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> survive long periods of time. It is unclear the extent to which AMR in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> changes in the environment outside of its host. In this study , we analyzed changes in the population structure , plasmid content , and AMR patterns of 30 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates isolated from 6 chickens ( cloacal swabs) , and 30 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates from fecal samples ( from the same 6 chickens) after 24 hr of incubation. Clonality of isolates was screened using the fumC gene sequence and confirmed in a subset of isolates ( n = 14) by multi-locus sequence typing. Major shifts in the population structure ( i.e. , sequence types) and antibiotic resistance patterns were observed among the numerically dominant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates after 24 hr. Four E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> clones isolated from the cloaca swabs and the corresponding fecal samples ( after 24 hr incubation) showed different antibiotic resistance patterns. Our study reveals that fecal matter in the environment is an intermediate habitat where rapid and striking changes occur in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> populations and antibiotic resistance patterns.
