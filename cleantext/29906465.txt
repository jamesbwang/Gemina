  Lung has critic function in gas exchange , supplying oxygen to all cells. Rapid metastasis and the high rate of mortality characterises lung cancer. There are two types of this disease , small cell and non-small cell , which differs from each other according to histopathologic features. To date , many therapeutic approaches have been developed to destroy this deadly type of cancer , which one of them is mRNA targeted therapies through miRNA. miRNAs are 19-25 base paired molecules be able to suppress and destruct mRNA and found to be involved in development and progression of lung cancer. Transmembrane Protein 48 ( TMEM48) is localised on nuclear pore complex and plays critic roles in nuclear traffic. Known that TMEM48 gene overexpressed in non-small lung cancer cells. Growing TMEM48 suppressed therapeutic studies indicated that decreased TMEM48 level might reveal a therapeutic effect for non-small cell lung cancers. TMEM48 studies based on the same strategy of gene-silencing , however , to our knowledge , any report has been published evaluates TMEM48 's regulation by miRNAs. We aimed to clarify if miR-421 might be therapeutic player for non-small cancer cell lines ( A549) , hereby we suppressed TMEM48 by miR-421 and performed advanced molecular tests. Consequently , we recorded that while miR-421 is significantly suppressing TMEM48 expression; it increased apoptotic and tumor suppressor players CASPASE 3 , PTEN and TP53 in A549 line , which is consistent with Annexin V- PI results: 30,6 % of A549 observed to be apoptotic- 68,5 % of A549 was in GO/G1. Our study indicated that miR-421 can suppress TMEM48 so that leads the cells to apoptosis. But it is not entirely clear how miR-421 triggers apoptosis and whether it interacts with the other cellular death pathways in A549.
