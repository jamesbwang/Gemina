  Folic-acid-based radioconjugates have been developed for nuclear imaging of folate receptor ( FR)- positive tumors; however , high renal uptake was unfavorable in view of a therapeutic application. Previously , it was shown that pre-injection of pemetrexed ( PMX) increased the tumor-to-kidney ratio of radiofolates several-fold. In this study , PMX was combined with the currently best performing radiofolate ( (
