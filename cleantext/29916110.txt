  To compare the effectiveness of intravenous carbetocin to that of intravenous oxytocin for prevention of atonic postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( PPH) after vaginal delivery in high-risk singleton pregnancies. This triple-blind randomized controlled trial included singleton pregnant women who delivered at Siriraj Hospital between August 2016 and January 2017 and who were 20 years or older , had a gestational age of at least 34 weeks , had a vaginal delivery , and had at least one risk factor for atonic postpartum hemorrhage<symptom>. Immediately after vaginal delivery , participants were randomly assigned to receive either 5 U of oxytocin or 100 mcg of carbetocin intravenously. Postpartum blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was measured objectively in mL using a postpartum drape with a calibrated bag. A total of 174 and 176 participants constituted the oxytocin and carbetocin groups , respectively. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The carbetocin group had less postpartum blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 146.7 ± 90.4 vs. 195.1 ± 146.2 mL; p < 0.01) , a lower incidence of atonic PPH ( 0 vs. 6.3 %; p < 0.01) , less usage of additional uterotonic drugs ( 9.1 vs. 27.6 %; p < 0.01) , and a lower incidence of postpartum anemia<symptom> ( Hb ≤ 10 g/dL) ( 9.1 vs. 18.4 %; p < 0.05) than the oxytocin group. No significant differences regarding side effects were evident between the groups. Intravenous carbetocin is more effective than intravenous oxytocin for the prevention of atonic PPH among singleton pregnancies with at least one risk factor for PPH. TCTR20160715004.
