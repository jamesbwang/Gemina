  Feedlot cattle consuming large amounts of feed and gaining weight rapidly generate significant amounts of metabolic heat. In summer , failure to dissipate this heat leads to heat accumulation and heat stress. Respiratory rates , panting scores , and behavioral changes are useful indicators of heat stress in cattle. Ceasing cattle movement , providing supplementary water tanks in the pens , cooling the pen surface , and manipulation of nutrition and feeding management should be considered to mitigate the risk and manage a heat stress crisis. Removing manure from the pens and provisions of shade has been found to be beneficial for cattle exposed to hot climates.
