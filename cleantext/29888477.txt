  Building on the work of Schwartz et al , Joint Bayesian analysis of birthweight and censored gestational age using finite mixture models in Statistics in Medicine , we propose a Bayesian finite mixture of bivariate regression model for causal mediation analyses. Using an identifiability condition within each component of the mixture , we express the natural direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome as functions of the component-specific regression coefficients. On the basis of simulated data , we examine the behavior of the model for estimating these effects in situations where the associations between exposure , mediator , and outcome are confounded or not. Additionally , we demonstrate that this mixture model can be used to account for heterogeneity arising through unmeasured binary or categorical mediator-outcome confounders. Considering gestational age as a potential mediator , we then illustrate our mediation mixture model to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects of exposure to inhaled corticosteroids during pregnancy on birthweight using a cohort of asthmatic women from the province of Quebec ( Canada).
