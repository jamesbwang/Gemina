  The nervous system and the immune system communicate extensively with each other in order to maintain homeostasis and to regulate the immune response. The peripheral nervous system ( PNS) communicates specifically with the immune system according to local interactions , including the `` hardwiring '' of sympathetic/parasympathetic ( efferent) and sensory nerves ( afferent) to lymphoid tissue and organs. To reveal this type of bidirectional neuroimmune interaction at the microscopic level , we used immunofluorescent staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) coupled with confocal microscopy/3D reconstruction to reveal the distribution of non-myelinating Schwann cells ( NMSCs) and their interactions with immune cells inside mouse spleen. Our results demonstrate i) the presence of an extensive network of NMSC processes in all splenic compartments including the splenic nodules<symptom> , periarteriolar lymphoid sheath ( PALS) , marginal zone , trabecula , and red pulp; ii) the close association of NMSC processes with blood vessels ( including central artries and their branches , marginal sinuses , penicillar arterioles and splenic sinuses); iii) the close `` synapse-like '' interaction/association of NMSC processes with various subsets of dendritic cells ( DCs; e.g. , CD4 + CD11c + DCs , B220 + CD11c + DCs , and F4/80 + CD11c + DCs) , macrophages ( F4/80 +) , and lymphocytes ( B cells , CD4 + T helper cells). Our novel findings concerning the distribution of NMSCs and NMSC-leukocytes interactions inside mouse spleen should improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which the PNS affects cellular- and humoral-mediated immune responses in a variety of health conditions and infectious/non-infectious diseases.
