  Many studies of drug delivery nanoplatforms have explored drug loading affinity and controlled release. The nanoplatforms can be influenced by their inherent building blocks. Natural polypeptide silk fibroin ( SF) is an excellent nanoplatform material because of its high biocompatibility and unique structural properties. SF secondary structures have different properties that can be changed by external stimuli. Thus , the characterization of SF-containing platforms is strongly affected by secondary structure transformations. Structural changes can occur spontaneously , which hinders the control of structural variation in aqueous conditions. Herein , we successfully prepared a controllable secondary structure composed of SF/heparin ( HEP) layer-by-layer assembled nanofilms using simple solvents ( glycerol and methanol). SF in the SF/HEP nanofilms takes up than 90 % , which means configurations of SF have a strong effect on the character of the nanofilms. We investigated the degradation profiles of SF/HEP nanofilms depending on their β-sheet contents and demonstrated an immediate correlation between the transformation of secondary structures inside the nanofilms and the degree of degradation of nanofilms. Finally , SF/HEP nanofilms were used as a delivery platform for incorporating the anticancer drug epirubicin ( EPI). We could control the loading efficiency and release profile of EPI with various β-sheet contents of the nanofilms.
