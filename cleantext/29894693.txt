  Inhibitors of poly ( ADP-ribose) ( PAR) polymerase ( PARPi) have recently entered the clinic for the treatment of homologous recombination ( HR)- deficient cancers. Despite the success of this approach , drug resistance is a clinical hurdle , and we poorly understand how cancer cells escape the deadly effects of PARPi without restoring the HR pathway. By combining genetic screens with multi-omics analysis of matched PARPi-sensitive and- resistant Brca2-mutated mouse mammary tumors , we identified loss of PAR glycohydrolase ( PARG) as a major resistance mechanism. We also found the presence of PARG-negative clones in a subset of human serous ovarian and triple-negative breast cancers. PARG depletion restores PAR formation and partially rescues PARP1 signaling. Importantly , PARG inactivation exposes vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.
