  The rate of Caesarean section has dramatically increased in recent decades. Foetal scalp blood sampling and computer software analysing foetal heart rate detection should help in the decision-making for or against Caesarean section. The main aim of this study was to examine how these 2 factors influence the Caesarean section rate. A national survey of all maternity units in Germany was undertaken using a self-reported questionnaire via crowd sourcing. All variables were collected as categorised data sets. Using these data sets , correlation coefficients were calculated. The correlations were additionally analysed using visual mosaic plots. 97 questionnaires were analysed. There were several strong correlations between variables in the data set. Particularly , hospitals that assessed the foetal heart rate in the normal range ( 110-160 bpm) according to the current FIGO guidelines had a lower C-section rate. Computer-assisted foetal heart rate assessment that is based on the FIGO guidelines correlated with a lower Caesarean section rate. The use and further development of computer-based cardiotocograph assessment analysis should be continued.
