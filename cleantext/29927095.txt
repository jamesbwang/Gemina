  To examine whether a JAK inhibitor regulates functional responses of human salivary gland epithelial cells ( SGEC) and disease parameters in a Sjögren 's syndrome<disease> animal model. Common differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were analyzed among peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with primary Sjögren 's syndrome<disease> ( pSS) and other datasets , using blood and salivary gland ( SG) tissue. Validation of expression in SG was analyzed by focus score. Inhibition of mRNA expression of DEGs and BAFF by filgotinib was analyzed using real-time PCR in primary SGECs. SG organoid cultures were used to determine the association between DEGs and B cell activating factor ( BAFF) via knockdown using siRNAs or regulation of BAFF by JAK inhibitor. Filgotinib ( 1.5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into 8-week-old NOD/ShiLtJ mice three times per week to analyze manifestations of disease. Finally , STAT signaling was assessed in human and mouse SGECs. Expression of DEGs IFNG and BAFF increased in pSS patient SGs , as assessed by focus score. There was significant correlation between IFIT2 and BAFF expression. JAK inhibitor suppressed IFN-induced transcription of DEGs and BAFF in human pSGECs. Knockdown of DEGs , or inhibition of JAK caused reduced secretion of BAFF in human SG organoid cultures. In addition , filgotinib-treated mice exhibited increased salivary flow rates and marked reductions in lymphocytic infiltration of the SG. JAK inhibitor regulated pSTAT1 JAK inhibition controls aberrant activation of SGECs and may be a novel therapeutic approach for pSS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
