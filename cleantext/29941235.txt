  Guided by cognitive theory , this study tested an explanatory model for adolescents ' beliefs , feelings , and healthy lifestyle behaviors and sex differences in these relationships. Structural equation modeling evaluated cross-sectional data from a healthy lifestyle program from 779 adolescents 14 through 17 years old. Theoretical relationships among thoughts , feelings , and behaviors were confirmed and sex differences identified. Thoughts had a direct effect on feelings and an indirect effect through feelings on healthy behaviors for both sexes. A direct effect from thoughts to behaviors existed for males only. Findings provide strong support for the thinking-feeling-behaving triangle for adolescents. To promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in adolescents , interventions should incorporate cognitive behavioral skills-building activities , strengthening healthy lifestyle beliefs , and enhancing positive health behaviors.
