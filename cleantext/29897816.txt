  In the event of a radiologic catastrophe , endothelial cell and neutrophil dysfunction play important roles in tissue injury. Clinically available therapeutics for radiation-induced vascular injury are largely supportive. PKCδ was identified as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response , and its inhibition was shown to protect critical organs during sepsis<disease>. We used a novel biomimetic microfluidic assay ( bMFA) to interrogate the role of PKCδ in radiation-induced neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction and endothelial cell function. HUVECs formed a complete lumen in bMFA and were treated with 0.5 , 2 , or 5 Gy ionizing radiation ( IR). At 24 h post-IR , the cells were treated with a PKCδ inhibitor for an additional 24 h. Under physiologic shear flow , the role of PKCδ on endothelium function and neutrophil adherence/migration was determined. PKCδ inhibition dramatically attenuated IR-induced endothelium permeability increase and significantly decreased neutrophil migration across IR-treated endothelial cells. Moreover , neutrophil adhesion to irradiated endothelial cells was significantly decreased after PKCδ inhibition in a flow-dependent manner. PKCδ inhibition downregulated IR-induced P-selectin , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and VCAM-1 but not E-selectin overexpression. PKCδ is an important regulator of neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction post-IR , and its inhibition can serve as a potential radiation medical countermeasure.-Soroush , F. , Tang , Y. , Zaidi , H.
