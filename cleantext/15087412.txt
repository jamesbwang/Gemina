  Toll-like receptor ( TLR) 4 is expressed on normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. The TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways mediate innate immune responses in the host against invading pathogens. However , multiple lines of evidence shows that TLR4 expression is increased in prostate tissues from prostate cancer patients , and altered TLR4 signals may promote cancer development , as well as antitumor effects. In this review , we have summarized key features of the TLR4 signaling pathway and its associated immune responses and focused on the pathologic role of TLR4 in prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
