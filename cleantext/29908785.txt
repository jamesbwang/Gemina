  This study aims to combine multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and digitized pathology with machine learning to generate predictive maps of histologic features for prostate cancer localization. Thirty-nine patients underwent MRI prior to prostatectomy. After surgery , tissue was sliced according to MRI orientation using patient-specific 3-dimensionally printed slicing jigs. Whole-mount sections were annotated by our pathologist and digitally contoured to differentiate the lumen and epithelium. Slides were co-registered to the T2-weighted MRI scan. A learning curve was generated to determine the number of patients required for a stable machine-learning model. Patients were randomly stratified into 2 training sets and 1 test set. Two partial least-squares regression models were trained , each capable of predicting lumen and epithelium density. Predicted density values were calculated for each patient in the test dataset , mapped into the MRI space , and compared between regions confirmed as high-grade prostate cancer. The learning-curve analysis showed that a stable fit was achieved with data from 10 patients. Maps indicated that regions of increased epithelium and decreased lumen density , generated from each independent model , corresponded with pathologist-annotated regions of high-grade cancer. We present a radio-pathomic approach to mapping prostate cancer. We find that the maps are useful for highlighting high-grade tumors. This technique may be relevant for dose-painting strategies in prostate radiation therapy.
