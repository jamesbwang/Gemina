  Vein segmentation is a vascular remodeling process mainly studied in experimental conditions and linked to hemodynamic factors , with clinical implications. The aim of this work is to assess the morphologic characteristics , associated findings , and mechanisms that participate in vein segmentation in humans. To this end , we examined 156 surgically obtained cases of hemorrhoidal disease. Segmentation occurred in 65 and was most prominent in 15 , which were selected for serial sections , immunohistochemistry , and immunofluorescence procedures. The dilated veins showed differently sized spaces , separated by thin septa. Findings associated with vein segmentation were: ( a) vascular channels formed from the vein intima endothelial cells ( ECs) and located in the vein wall and/or intraluminal fibrin , ( b) vascular loops formed by interconnected vascular channels ( venous-venous connections) , which encircled vein wall components or fibrin and formed folds/pillars/papillae ( FPPs; the encircling ECs formed the FPP cover and the encircled components formed the core) , and ( c) FPP splitting , remodeling , alignment , and fusion , originating septa. Thrombosis was observed in some nonsegmented veins , while the segmented veins only occasionally contained thrombi. Dense microvasculature was also present in the interstitium and around veins. In conclusion , the findings suggest that hemorrhoidal vein segmentation is an adaptive process in which a piecemeal angiogenic mechanism participates , predominantly by intussusception , giving rise to intravascular FPPs , followed by linear rearrangement , remodeling and fusion of FPPs , and septa formation. Identification of other markers , as well as the molecular bases , hemodynamic relevance , and possible therapeutic implications of vein segmentation in dilated hemorrhoidal veins require further studies.
