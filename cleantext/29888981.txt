  Oesophageal stents are widely used for palliating dysphagia<symptom> from malignant obstruction. They are also used with increasing frequency in the treatment of oesophageal perforation , as well as benign strictures from a variety of causes. Improved oncological treatments have led to prolonged survival of patients treated with palliative intent; as a consequence , stents need to function and last longer in order to avoid repeat procedures. There is also increasing need for meticulous procedure planning , careful selection of the device most appropriate for the individual patient and planned follow-up. Furthermore , as more patients are cured , there will be more issues with resultant long-term side-effects , such as recalcitrant strictures due to radiotherapy or anastomotic scarring , which will have to be addressed. Stent design needs to keep up with the progress of cancer treatment , in order to offer patients the best possible long-term result. This review article attempts to illustrate the changing realities in oesophageal stenting , differences in current stent designs and behaviour , as well as the pressing need to refine and modify devices in order to meet the new challenges.
