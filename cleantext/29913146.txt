  Glycolysis , the classic pathway for producing energy , has been known to be involved in neural development. Notch signaling also contributes to neural development and regulation of glycolysis in various tissues. However , the role of Notch signaling in glycolysis-related gene regulation during neural development is poorly understood. Here , we analyzed mRNA expression patterns and levels of glucose transporters ( GLUT) as well as rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis using zebrafish mib1
