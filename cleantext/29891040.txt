  Pegylated interferon ( pegIFN) in combination with ribavirin ( RBV) has successfully improved the rate of sustained virological response ( SVR) in chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infected individuals , which reduces the progression of the chronic liver disease. However , the influence of combination therapy ( pegIFN/RBV) on cardiac function has yielded ambiguous results. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of combination therapy with pegIFN/RBV on cardiac function of HCV-infected individuals with SVR. Cardiac function was assessed and correlated in 142 treatment-naïve patients with HCV<pathogen> infections by determining cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography before treatment and for 24 weeks post-treatment. An SVR was achieved by 50.7 % of all patients. Serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher in all patients before treatment and decreased significantly 24 weeks post-treatment in the SVR group ( 62.84 ( 36.98-102.73) versus 22.87 ( 15.64-56.92) pg/mL , P < 0.01). Peak early diastolic annular velocity ( E ') was significantly lower ( 7.69 ± 2.48 versus 9.74 ± 2.68 cm/s , P < 0.001) and E/E ' was higher ( 10.04 ± 2.51 versus 8.18 ± 2.31 , P < 0.001) in all patients with SVR. However , there were no statistically significant differences in biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters for patients without SVR. In addition , multivariate analysis identified age ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.076; 95 % CI: 1.031-1.125; P < 0.001) , NT-proBNP ( OR = 1.122; 95 % CI: 1.002-1.248; P = 0.015) , and SVR ( OR = 0.532; 95 % CI: 0.214-0.895; P = 0.023) as statistically significant independent variables associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The present study showed no adverse effects of combination therapy on cardiac function of HCV-infected individuals with SVR. Subsequent viral eradication resulted in improvement of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
