  Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Previous studies indicated that miR-361-5p was downregulated in breast cancer , however , the exact effect of miR-361-5p on TNBC requires further investigation. In the present study , we investigated whether miR-361-5p can act as a tumor suppressor by targeting required for cell differentiation 1 homolog ( RQCD1) and inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)/ phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ protein kinase B ( Akt) pathway in TNBC. The expression of miR-361-5p and RQCD1 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR) and/or western blot in TNBC and the adjacent tissues. miR-361-5p mimics were constructed and transfected to TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Expression of miR-361-5p and mRNA and protein expression of RQCD1 , PI3K , Akt , EGFR and matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP-9) in MDA-MB-231 were measured by qRT-PCR and/or western blot after transfection. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion ability were evaluated by scratch and transwell assay respectively. Confirmation of miR-361-5p target was determined by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Downregulated miR-361-5p and upregulated RQCD1 were observed in tumor tissues. Expression of EGFR , PI3K , Akt and MMP-9 was inhibited in cells treated with miR-361-5p mimics. Transfection of miR-361-5p mimics also inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR , PI3K , and Akt. Suppressed cell viability , migration , and invasion was found in miR-361-5p mimics groups. Luciferase reporter assay showed that RQCD1 was the target of miR-361-5p. These results indicated that overexpression of miR-361-5p might act as a suppressor in TNBC by targeting RQCD1 to inhibit the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
