  The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif ( ITIM)- containing receptor G6b-B has emerged as a key regulator of platelet homeostasis. However , it remains unclear how it mediates its effects. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITIM and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif ( ITSM) within the cytoplasmic tail of G6b-B provides a docking site for SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 and Shp2 , which are also critical regulators of platelet production and function. In this study , we investigate the physiological consequences of uncoupling G6b-B from Shp1 and Shp2. To address this , we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing a mutant form of G6b-B in which tyrosine ( Y) residues 212 and 238 within the ITIM and ITSM were mutated to phenylalanine ( F) , respectively. Mice homozygous for the mutation ( G6b-B diY/F) were macrothrombocytopenic , due to a reduction in platelet production , had large clusters of megakaryocytes and myelofibrosis at sites of hematopoiesis , similar to that observed in G6b knockout ( G6b KO) mice. Platelets from G6b-B diY/F mice were hypo-responsive to collagen , due to a significant reduction in expression of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ( ITAM)- containing collagen receptor complex GPVI-FcR Î³-chain , and thrombin , that could be partially rescued by co-stimulating the platelets with ADP. In contrast , platelets from G6b-B diY/F , G6b KO and megakaryocyte-specific Shp2 KO mice were hyper-responsive to antibody-mediated cross-linking of the hemi-ITAM-containing podoplanin receptor CLEC-2 , suggesting that G6b-B inhibits CLEC-2-mediated platelet activation through Shp2. Findings from this study demonstrate that G6b-B must engage with Shp1 and Shp2 in order to mediate its regulatory effects on platelet homeostasis.
