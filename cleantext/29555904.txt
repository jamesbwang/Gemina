  The original version of this Article omitted the author N. Penny Holliday from the National Oceanography Centre , European Way , Southampton SO14 3ZH , UK. Consequently , the following was originally omitted from the Acknowledgements: ` N.P.H. and the JR302 cruise were funded through the UK Natural Environment Research Council programmes UK OSNAP ( NE/K010875/1) , RAGNARRoCC ( NE/K002511/1) and the Extended Ellett Line ( National Capability) '. The corrected version of the Acknowledgements also removes the following from the original version: ` The Zonally Accumulated Heat Transport in observation was calculated by N.P.H. from the National Ocean Center , United Kingdom '. Additionally , the following was originally omitted from the Author Contributions: ` N.P.H. calculated the observed Zonally Accumulated Heat Transport along the OSNAP east section '.
