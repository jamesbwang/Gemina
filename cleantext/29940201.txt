  High levels of circulating free fatty acids ( FFAs) , inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress are important causes for insulin resistance ( IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of EGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose , 0.25 mM palmitic acid ( PA) , or 50 μM EGCG for 24 h. EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCG markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors including nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α , interleukin-6 , reactive oxygen species , malondialdehyde and p53 protein , and markedly increased superoxide dismutases ( SOD) , glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCG significantly downregulated the levels of FFAs , triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 ( GLUT2) protein and its downstream proteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator ( PGC) -1 β were significantly increased , and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c ( SREBP-1c) protein , and fatty acid synthase ( FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG in HepG2. Moreover , the foregoing effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GLUT2. Our data demonstrated that EGCG improved IR , possibly through ameliorating glucose ( 25 mM) and PA ( 0.25 mM)- induced inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress , and FFAs via the GLUT2/PGC -1 β/SREBP -1 c/FAS pathway in HepG2 cells.
