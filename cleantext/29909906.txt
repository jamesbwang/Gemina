  Three-year disease-free survival ( DFS) is 80 % for human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) positive tonsillar and base of tongue cancer ( TSCC/BOTSCC) treated with radiotherapy alone , and today 's intensified therapy does not improve prognosis. More markers are therefore needed to more accurately identify patients with good prognosis or in need of alternative therapy. Here , microRNAs ( miRs) 155 , 185 and 193b were examined as potential prognostic markers in TSCC/BOTSCC. 168 TSCC/BOTSCC patients diagnosed 2000-2013 , with known data on HPV-status , CD8 Tumours compared to normal tonsils showed decreased miR-155 and increased miR-193b expression. miR-155 expression was associated with HPV-positivity , low T-stage , high CD8 Increased miR-155 expression was found as a positive predictor of survival , with the effect mainly due to its association with high CD8
