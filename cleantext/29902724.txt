  Interfacial Transition Zone ( ITZ) of coarse aggregate cement matrix is commonly regarded as the weakest element of concrete. In this phase- the first cracks in the material are initiated , and the process of destruction of the composite begins. An improvement of the ITZ properties are positively influenced by the mineral additives used for the composite. One of such a substitute for a binder is , potentially hazardous industrial waste , siliceous fly ash ( FA). In this paper the ITZ between aggregate and cement paste in concretes containing FA is considered. The paper presents the results of tests on the effect of the addition of FA in the amount of: 0 , 20 and 30 % by weight of cement on morphology and size of cracks of the ITZ in composites. In matured concretes the smallest cracks occur in composite with the 20 % FA additive. It can be concluded that composites with 20 % addition of FA are characterized by low permeability and therefore high durability. The results of tests carried out can be helpful in obtaining concrete with the highest possible: strength , durability and reliability of operation. Moreover , such procedures also cause a restriction storage of hazardous materials , i.e. FA- by 160 million tons per year.
