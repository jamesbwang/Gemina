  To describe and evaluate the trends in the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity over a 10-year period in a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong. A retrospective review was performed on all preterm infants screened and/or treated for retinopathy of prematurity from January 2006 to December 2015 at Prince of Wales Hospital , Hong Kong. Preterm infants with incomplete records or transferred-in from other hospitals/region solely for treatment of ROP were excluded. The incidence of any ROP or Type 1 ROP was analysed with gestational age and birth weight over a 10-year period with consecutive 2-year intervals to evaluate the trends. Of all 754 infants included in the study , 234 ( 31.0 %) patients had any ROP and 34 ( 4.5 %) infants developed Type 1 ROP. The incidence of any ROP demonstrated a statistically significant decreasing trend over the five consecutive 2-year intervals ( p = 0.016) , but the incidence trend of Type 1 ROP is not statistically significant. No infants weighing more than 1250 g developed Type 1 ROP. We observed a decreasing trend in the incidence of any ROP across the 10-year period in a tertiary hospital in Hong Kong , while the incidence of Type 1 ROP remained stable at 4.5 %. The factors leading to the trend were unclear. Improved prenatal care , changing proportion of cases with different birth weight and gestational age , oxygenation level practice in neonatal unit may all contribute to the decreasing trend. Revision of screening criteria may be made according to local experience to maximise cost-effectiveness.
