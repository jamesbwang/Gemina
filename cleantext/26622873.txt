  Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) is the most common cancer in humans worldwide. Many highly specific dermoscopic criteria for BCC are well established in the literature. On the contrary , other malignant or benign skin tumors may mimic BCC by exhibiting similar or even the same dermoscopic features and therefore obscuring the diagnosis of BCC in certain situations. We herein report a case of BCC with dermoscopic features of both BCC and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma ( DT). We would like to remind of the often neglected differential diagnosis of DT in a lesion<symptom> with arborizing vessels and otherwise unusual dermoscopic presentation.
