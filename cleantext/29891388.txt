  Quantification of the Î±-subunit of ammonia<pathogen> monooxygenase ( amoA) through PCR is an established technique for estimating the abundance of ammonia<pathogen> oxidizing archaea ( AOA) in environmental samples. This study quantified AOA with two established primer sets in 1 cm increments from the sediment surface ( 0-1 cm) to a depth of 10 cm at two locations within Port Phillip Bay ( PPB) , Australia. Primer choice had a significant effect on within sample estimates of AOA with copy numbers ranging from 10
