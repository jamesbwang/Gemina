  Initial treatment of nasal fractures can result in long-standing cosmetic or functional defects , but the risk factors for subsequent septorhinoplasty have not been explored. To assess the risk factors for septorhinoplasty after the initial treatment of isolated nasal fracture. This retrospective population-based analysis of US patients diagnosed with nasal fracture between January 1 , 2007 , and December 31 , 2015 , used insurance claims data from the Commercial and Medicare Supplemental categories of the Truven Health MarketScan database. Of the 340715 patients diagnosed with nasal fracture , 78474 were included in the final study cohort , excluding those who did not meet enrollment criteria or were diagnosed with concomitant facial fracture. Patients were classified into 1 of 4 groups according to the type and timing of treatment. Septorhinoplasty between 6 and 24 months after nasal fracture diagnosis. Explanatory variables included initial fracture treatment , demographics , comorbidities , and diagnoses associated with a preexisting nasal obstruction or defect. Most of the 78474 patients were under 65 years of age ( 66770 ( 85.1 %)) and male ( 41997 ( 53.5 %)) and lived in an urban area ( 67938 ( 86.6 %)). Among patients with no preexisting diagnosis of nasal obstruction or defect , open treatment within 3 weeks ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) , 1.76; 95 % CI , 1.33-2.32) of nasal fracture and between 3 weeks and 6 months ( aOR , 1.52; 95 % CI , 1.14-2.04) after fracture were associated with increased risk of subsequent septorhinoplasty. In patients with a diagnosis of preexisting nasal obstruction or defect , observation ( aOR , 3.56; 95 % CI , 2.80-4.53) , closed reduction treatment ( aOR , 3.10; 95 % CI , 1.93-4.96) , and open treatment within 3 weeks ( aOR , 2.02; 95 % CI , 1.48-2.77) of fracture were all associated with increased risk of subsequent septorhinoplasty , with observation having the highest risk. Patients were also more likely to undergo subsequent septorhinoplasty if they were younger than 65 years , with the greatest risk seen in patients 18 to 34 years of age ( aOR , 6.02; 95 % CI , 4.26-8.50) , lived in an urban area ( aOR , 1.21; 95 % CI , 1.01-1.44) , or had a history of anxiety<symptom> ( aOR , 1.45; 95 % CI , 1.18-1.78) , but less likely if they were male ( aOR , 0.82; 95 % CI , 0.73-0.91). This study suggests that a preexisting diagnosis of nasal obstruction or defect and other aspects of a patient 's history are factors to consider when assessing the likelihood of surgical revision of initial treatment of nasal fracture.
