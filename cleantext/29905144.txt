  The Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry in London , Ontario , has a mentorship program for all full-time faculty. The school would like to expand its outreach to physician faculty located in distributed medical education sites. The purpose of this study was to determine what , if any , mentorship distributed physician faculty currently have , to gauge their interest in expanding the mentorship program to distributed physician faculty and to determine their vision of the most appropriate design of a mentorship program that would address their needs. We conducted a mixed-methods study. The quantitative phase consisted of surveys sent to all distributed faculty members that elicited information on basic demographic characteristics and mentorship experiences/needs. The qualitative phase consisted of 4 focus groups of distributed faculty administered in 2 large and 2 small centres in both regions of the school 's distributed education network: Sarnia , Leamington , Stratford and Hanover. Interviews were 90 minutes long and involved standardized semistructured questions. Of the 678 surveys sent , 210 ( 31.0 %) were returned. Most respondents ( 136 ( 64.8 %)) were men , and almost half ( 96 ( 45.7 %)) were family physicians. Most respondents ( 197 ( 93.8 %)) were not formal mentors to Schulich faculty , and 178 ( 84.8 %) were not currently being formally mentored. Qualitative analysis suggested that many respondents were involved in informal mentoring. In addition , about half of the respondents ( 96 ( 45.7 %)) wished to be formally mentored in the future , but they may be inhibited owing to time constraints and geographical isolation. Consistently , respondents wished to have mentoring by a colleague in a similar practice , with the most practical being one-on-one mentoring. Our analysis suggests that the school 's current formal mentoring program may not be applicable and will require modification to address the needs of distributed faculty.
