  Rare earth ( RE3 +)- doped NaY ( MoO4) 2 nanocrystals are efficient materials for realizing multicolor emission , which plays an important role in displays , W-LEDs , solar cells and biolabeling. Up to now , research on the multicolor tuning properties of RE3 +- doped NaY ( MoO4) 2 nanoparticles has mostly focused on traditional preparation routes such as the hydrothermal method and sol-gel process. However , the products obtained using these methods are usually large in size ( on the micron/submicron scale) and agglomeration problems are inevitable. With the development of nano optoelectronic devices and bioluminescence labeling , there is an urgent need to find an efficient method to prepare nanoscale , monodispersed and NaY ( MoO4) 2: RE3 + nanocrystals ( NCs) with good crystallinity and stronger emission properties. In this work , we demonstrate a simple , fast , reproducible and one-step synthesis of NaY ( MoO4) 2: Eu3 + NCs with sizes varying from 1-20 nm via a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy. The reaction mechanism and emission intensities of NaY ( MoO4) 2: Eu3 + NCs with various morphologies have been discussed in detail. Furthermore , Tb3 + and Eu3 + ion co-doped NaY ( MoO4) 2 NCs were also prepared , and various emission colors were obtained and tuned from red , orange-red , yellow and yellow-green to green. Energy transfer between the Tb3 + and Eu3 + ions in the NaY ( MoO4) 2 host matrix has also been demonstrated. Finally , a highly efficient and stable NaY ( MoO4) 2:0.05 Tb ,0.04 Eu NC-based W-LED device was built , which indicates the promising future application for this material in the field of lighting. The tunable multicolour emission , ease of preparation and nanosize reveal that NaY ( MoO4) 2: RE3 + NCs have a potential application in full color displays and W-LEDs.
