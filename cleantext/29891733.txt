  To evaluate the functional long-term outcome in patients with macular oedema ( MO) secondary to central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO) treated with dexamethasone implant ( DEX implant) and to identify its clinical predictors. A 24-month , retrospective , multinational , real-world study. Chart review of patients with either naïve or recurrent MO secondary to CRVO/BRVO treated with DEX implant , including best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , central subfield thickness ( CST) , demographic baseline characteristics and details of any additional treatment during follow-up. A total of 155 eyes ( 65 CRVO , 90 BRVO) from 155 patients were included. At 24 months , mean BCVA did not change significantly in CRVO ( -2.1 ± 24.5 letters , p = 0.96) and BRVO patients ( 1.3 ± 27.0 letters , p = 0.07). A worse baseline BCVA ( p < 0.001) , visual acuity ( VA) gain ≥ 5 letters at 2 months ( p = 0.006) and no need for adjunctive intravitreal therapy after first DEX implant ( p = 0.001) were associated with a better final BCVA gain. Treatment-naïve patients ( p = 0.006 , OR: 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.57) and those with a baseline CST ≤ 400 µm ( p = 0.02 , OR: 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.63) were identified as being less likely to need additional intravitreal therapy. Clinical baseline characteristics and the early treatment response were identified as possible predictors for long-term outcome and the need of adjunctive intravitreal therapy in MO secondary to BRVO/CRVO treated by DEX implant.
