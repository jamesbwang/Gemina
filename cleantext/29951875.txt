  The profound influence of gut flora on host immune system and its link with autoimmune disorders have been established. However , the role of certain antibiotic in progression of autoimmune disorder is still confusing. Here , we employed a collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) model to explore the role of clindamycin administration in different scenarios. In the first scenario , mice treated with antibiotics for 4 weeks were performed with the induction of CIA immediately. The results showed that clindamycin administration promoted the incidence and severity of CIA , while the recipients of vancomycin showed completed tolerance. We also found that increased gut-associated Th1 and Th17 cells might be related to the subsequent expansion of collagen-specific immune response. In the second scenario , mice treated with antibiotics for 4 weeks were performed with CIA induction 4 weeks later. Notably , clindamycin administration showed a prolonged impact on the incidence and severity of CIA , as well as the gut immunity as compared to vancomycin administration. In addition , antibody depletion of integrin α4β7 systemically resulted in an impaired CIA response , underlining the influence of gut immunity. In the mice that received clindamycin , the abundance of anaerobic bacteria was significantly decreased and showed little recovery at 4 weeks later. Our observations highlighted the different characteristics of antibiotic administration on the development of autoimmune disorders and indicated its link with gut immunity.
