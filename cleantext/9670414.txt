  To evaluate the deeper choroidal vasculature in eyes with various ocular disorders using spectral domain ( SD) optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCTA) and swept source ( SS) OCTA. Patients underwent OCTA imaging with either SD-OCTA ( Zeiss Cirrus Angioplex or Optovue AngioVue) or SS-OCTA ( Topcon Triton). Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) integrity , structural visualization of deep choroidal vessels on en face imaging , and OCTA of deep choroidal blood flow signal were analyzed. Choroidal blood flow was deemed present if deeper choroidal vessels appeared bright after appropriate segmentation. Structural visualization of choroidal vessels was feasible in all eyes by en face imaging. In both SD-OCTA and SS-OCTA , choroidal blood flow signal was present in all eyes with overlying RPE atrophy ( 100 % of eyes with RPE atrophy , 28.6 % of all imaged eyes , P < .001). While choroidal vessels can be visualized anatomically in all eyes by en face imaging , choroidal blood flow detection in deep choroidal vessel is largely restricted to areas with overlying RPE atrophy. Intact RPE acts as a barrier for reliable detection of choroidal flow using current OCTA technology , inhibiting evaluation of flow in deeper choroidal vessels in most eyes.
