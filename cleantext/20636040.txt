  We propose monochromatic dark-field imaging microscopy ( DFM) to measure the non-faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) of single Au nanorods ( AuNRs). DFM was utilized to monitor the plasmonic scattering of monochromatic incident light by surface-immobilized individual AuNRs. When modulating the surface potential at a certain frequency , non-faradaic charging and discharging of AuNRs altered their electron density , leading to periodical fluctuations in the scattering intensity. Analysis of the amplitude and phase of the optical intensity fluctuation as a function of modulation frequency resulted in the EIS of single AuNRs. High-frequency ( > 100 Hz) modulation allowed us to differentiate the intrinsic charging effect from other contributions such as the periodic migration and accumulation of counterions in the surrounding medium , because the latter occurred at a longer timescale. As a result , single nanoparticle EIS led to the surface capacitance of single AuNRs being closer to the theoretical value. Since interfacial capacitance has been proven sensitive to molecular interactions , the present work also offers a new platform for single nanoparticle sensing by measuring the single nanoparticle capacitance.
