  Forms of selective autophagy have now been recognized to regulate flux in many intracellular processes. Specific pathways and functions have been identified for mitophagy , ERphagy , and other selective autophagies; yet there is no consensus in whether and how autophagy regulates protein maintenance in and around the nucleus. Such processes are of interest for potential degradation of DNA and nuclear envelope proteins in various disease states. The mechanistic details of such nucleus-related autophagic processes remain elusive due to the lack of chemical or genetic regulators to manipulate and follow the process in vitro. Here , we describe a high content screen from which we identified small chemical compounds that can modulate the localization of the autophagy marker MAP1LC3B ( LC3) in renal carcinoma cells. We also describe a pipeline designed for the execution and analysis of high content screens. The chemical tools discerned from this screen will allow for the deeper exploration of the mechanism , regulation , and molecular targets of nuclear-localized LC3 in perturbed cellular states.
