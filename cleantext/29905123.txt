  The orderly spacing of retinal neurons is commonly regarded as a characteristic feature of retinal nerve cell populations. Exemplars of this property include the horizontal cells and the cholinergic amacrine cells , where individual cells minimize the proximity to like-type neighbors , yielding regularity in the patterning of their somata. Recently , two types of retinal bipolar cells in the mouse retina were shown to exhibit an order in their somal patterning no different from density-matched simulations constrained by soma size but being otherwise randomly distributed. The present study has now extended this finding to a type of retinal amacrine cell , the AII amacrine cell. Voronoi domain analysis revealed the patterning in the population of AII amacrine somata to be no different from density-matched and soma-size-constrained random simulations , while analysis of the density recovery profile showed AII amacrine cells to exhibit a minimal intercellular spacing identical to that for those random simulations: AII amacrine somata were positioned side-by-side as often as chance would predict. Regularity indexes and packing factors ( PF) were far lower than those achieved by either the horizontal cells or cholinergic amacrine cells , with PFs also being comparable to those derived from the constrained random simulations. These results extend recent findings that call into question the widespread assumption that all types of retinal neurons are assembled as regular somal arrays , and have implications for the way in which AII amacrine cells must distribute their processes to ensure a uniform coverage of the retinal surface.
