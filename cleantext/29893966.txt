  The mammalian apical-basal determinant Crumbs homolog-1 ( CRB1) plays a crucial role in retinal structure and function by the maintenance of adherens junctions between photoreceptors and MÃ¼ller glial cells. Patients with mutations in the CRB1 gene develop retinal dystrophies , including early-onset retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis. Previously , we showed that Crb1 knockout mice developed a slow-progressing retinal phenotype at foci in the inferior retina , whiles specific ablation of Crb2 in immature photoreceptors lead to an early-onset phenotype throughout the retina. Here , we conditionally disrupted one or both alleles of Crb2 in immature photoreceptors , on a genetic background lacking Crb1 , and studied the retinal dystrophies thereof. Our data showed that disruption of one allele of Crb2 in immature photoreceptors caused a substantial aggravation of the Crb1 phenotype in the entire inferior retina. The photoreceptor layer showed early-onset progressive thinning limited to the inferior retina while the superior retina maintained intact. Surprisingly , disruption of both alleles of Crb2 in immature photoreceptors further aggravated the phenotype. Throughout the retina , photoreceptor synapses were disrupted and photoreceptor nuclei intermingled with nuclei of the inner nuclear layer. In the superior retina , the ganglion cell layer appeared thicker due to ectopic nuclei of photoreceptors. In conclusion , the data suggest that CRB2 is required to maintain retinal progenitor and photoreceptor cell adhesion and prevent photoreceptor ingression into the immature inner retina. We hypothesise , from these animal models , that decreased levels of CRB2 in immature photoreceptors adjust retinitis pigmentosa due to loss of CRB1 into Leber congenital amaurosis phenotype.
