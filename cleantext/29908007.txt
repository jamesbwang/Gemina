  Mesenchymal stem cells homing and migration is a crucial step during bone fracture healing. Hypoxic environment in fracture site induces bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) migration , but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study and studies by other groups have reported the involvement of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) pathway in cell migration. However , the role of STAT3 pathway in hypoxia-induced cell migration is still unknown. In this study , we investigated the role of STAT3 signaling in hypoxia-induced BMSCs migration and osteogenic differentiation. BMSCs isolated from C57BL/6 male mice were cultured in the presence of cobalt chloride ( CoCl
