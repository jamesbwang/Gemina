  1,3-Propanediol ( 1,3-PDO) is important building blocks for the bio-based chemical industry , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> can be an attractive candidate for their production. However , 1,3-PDO production is high but productivity is generally low by K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>. In this study , repeated fed-batch cultivation by a lactate and 2,3-butanediol ( 2,3-BDO) deficient mutant of K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were investigated for efficient 1,3-PDO production from industrial by-products such as crude glycerol. First , optimal conditions for repeated fed-batch fermentation of a ΔldhA mutant defective for lactate formation due to deletion of the lactate dehydrogenase gene ( ldhA) were determined. Maximal 1,3-PDO production level and productivity obtained by repeated fed-batch fermentation under optimized conditions were 81.1 g/L and 3.38 g/L/h , respectively , and these values were successfully maintained for five cycles of fermentation without any loss of fermentation capacity. This results were much higher than that of the normal fed-batch fermentation. The levels of 2,3-BDO , which is a major by-product , reaching up to ~ 50 % of the level of 1,3-PDO , were reduced using a mutant strain ( Δ ( ldhA als)) containing an additional mutation in the biosynthetic pathway of 2,3-BDO ( deletion of the acetolactate synthase gene). The levels of 2,3-BDO were reduced to about 20 % of 1,3-PDO levels by repeated fed-batch fermentation of Δ ( ldhA als) , although maximal 1,3-PDO production and productivity also decreased owing to a defect in the growth of the 2,3-BDO-defective mutant strain. This repeated fed-batch fermentation may be useful for reducing the cost of 1,3-PDO production and may be promising industrialization prospect for the 1,3-PDO production.
