  Lysosomes serve as the degradation hubs for macroautophagic/autophagic and endocytic components , thus maintaining cellular homeostasis essential for neuronal survival and function. LAMP1 ( lysosomal associated membrane protein 1) and LAMP2 are distributed among autophagic and endolysosomal organelles. Despite widespread distribution , LAMP1 is routinely used as a lysosome marker and LAMP1-positive organelles are often referred to as lysosomal compartments. By applying immuno-electron microscopy ( iTEM) and confocal imaging combined with Airyscan microscopy , we expand on the limited literature to provide a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of LAMP1 distribution in various autophagic and endolysosomal organelles in neurons. Our study demonstrates that a significant portion of LAMP1-labeled organelles lack major lysosomal hydrolases. BSA-gold pulse-chase assay further shows heterogeneous degradative capacities of LAMP1-labled organelles. In addition , LAMP1 intensity is not a sensitive readout to assess lysosomal deficits in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked motor neurons in vivo. Our study thus calls for caution when interpreting LAMP1-labeled organelles in the nervous system where LAMP1 intensity , trafficking , and distribution do not necessarily represent degradative lysosomes or autolysosomes under physiological and pathological conditions.
