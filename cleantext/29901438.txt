  The brainstem 's lateral superior olive ( LSO) is thought to be crucial for localizing high-frequency sounds<symptom> by coding interaural sound level differences ( ILD). Its neurons weigh contralateral inhibition against ipsilateral excitation , making their firing rate a function of the azimuthal position of a sound source. Since the very first in vivo recordings , LSO principal neurons have been reported to give sustained and temporally integrating ` chopper ' responses to sustained sounds<symptom>. Neurons with transient responses were observed but largely ignored and even considered a sign of pathology. Using the Mongolian gerbil as a model system , we have obtained the first in vivo patch clamp recordings from labeled LSO neurons and find that principal LSO neurons , the most numerous projection neurons of this nucleus , only respond at sound onset and show fast membrane features suggesting an importance for timing. These results provide a new framework to interpret previously puzzling features of this circuit.
