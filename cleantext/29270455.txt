  In the present study , hydro-geochemical characteristics of groundwater samples collected from South West Delhi , India , have been assessed. 50 sampling locations were recorded with the help of global positioning system , to assess the groundwater quality and evaluate the corrosion and scaling potential. Hydro-geochemical characterization for different parameters such as pH , temperature ( T) , electrical conductivity ( EC) , total dissolved solids ( TDS) , salinity ( SA) , total hardness ( TH) , total alkalinity (
