  Sediment microbial communities from plain river networks exert different effects on pollutant transformation and migration in lake basins. In this study , we examined millions of Illumina reads ( 16S rRNA gene amplicons) to compare lake , lake wetland , and estuary bacterial communities through a technically consistent approach. Results showed that bacterial communities in the sampled lake sediments had the highest alpha-diversity ( Group B) , than in sampled lake wetland sediments and estuary sediments. Proteobacteria was the most abundant ( more than 30 %) phyla in all the sediments. The lake sediments had more Nitrospirae ( 1.63 % -11.75 %) and Acidobacteria ( 3.46 % -10.21 %) than the lake wetland and estuary sediments , and estuary sediments had a greater abundance of the phylum Firmicutes ( mean of 22.30 %). Statistical analysis ( LEfSe) revealed that lake wetland sediments contained greater abundances of the class Anaerolineaceae , orders Xanthomonadales , Pseudomonadales , and genera Flavobacterium , Acinetobacter<pathogen>. The lake sediments had a distinct community of diverse primary producers , such as phylum Acidobacteria , order Ignavibacteriales , and families Nitrospiraceae , Hydrogenophilaceae. Total phosphorus and organic matter were the main factors influencing the bacterial communities in sediments from several parts of the lake wetland and river estuary ( p < .05). The novel insights into basin pollution control in plain river networks may be obtained from microbial distribution in sediments from different basin regions.
