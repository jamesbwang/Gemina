  Rice consumption can be a major pathway for mercury ( Hg) exposure , which can cause health hazards to Chinese residents. To accurately assess the potential health risks , the bioaccessibility of Hg in rice samples collected at background and Hg-contamination sites was examined using four in vitro methods. The results showed that < 50 % of the total mercury ( THg) was bioaccessible in the studied rice samples. The THg bioaccessibility in the rice samples collected at the Hg-contaminated site was higher than that observed at the background area. The bioaccessibility of arsenic ( As) and cadmium ( Cd) was also evaluated for comparison of the four in vitro methods used in this study. The Physiologically Based Extraction Test was found to be the most accurate method based on the consistency of the results compared to those reported in previous studies. The estimated daily intakes of THg via rice consumption using the bioaccessibility data were found to meet the recommendation value set by the JECFA and the WHO in both sites. However , the potential health risk was not negligible at the Hg-contaminated sites , due to the high THg concentration and bioaccessibility in the rice samples.
