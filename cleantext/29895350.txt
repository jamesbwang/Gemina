  A single-laboratory validation of a method using Folin & Ciocalteu 's phenol reagent ( Folin-C reagent) fordetermination of total phenolic content of selected dietary supplement extracts was performed. The method is composed of a water extraction of dried extracts with sonication followed by reaction with the Folin-C reagent. The resulting colorimetric reaction is measured at 765 nm and compared with a standard curve generated with gallic acid standard solutions. The validation results were compared with
