  To show that application of the systemic analysis may significantly improve comparison of different datasets. Different genes and proteins may converge on the same functional outputs. A comparison of 2 datasets by only identification names of affected molecules may miss that , leading to a conclusion that there is nothing in common for these datasets. Systemic analysis may overcome this limitation , by focusing on functions represented by the identification names. Datasets were retrieved from open sources. Systemic analysis of vascularization features and angiogenesis signature was performed by using Cytoscape and its plugs-in. In contrary to the initial statement of the lack of overlap between the vascularization features and the angiogenesis genes-signature in renal carcinomas , we observed an intersection on the functional level. Analysis of the networks built with identification names of vascularization and angiogenesis datasets showed an intersection , which included potent regulators of vessel formation and growth. Analysis of networks may expose functional links , which may be missed by a direct identification names comparison.
