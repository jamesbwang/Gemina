  This study 's main objective was to explore whether beliefs legitimizing dating violence predict dysfunctional social information processing ( SIP) when adolescents deal with ambiguous dating situations , and whether this more proximal cognitive processing acts as a mediator between acceptance of violence beliefs and dating violence perpetration. Participants were 855 high school students who completed self-report measures at three time points , with a 1-year interval between them. SIP did not act as a mediator , but the emergence of anger emotions in dating conflict situations , along with aggression-justifying beliefs , were revealed as essential in explaining dating violence. Previous aggression also explained a subsequent higher anticipation of positive consequences for aggressive acts. We discuss the implications for prevention and treatment strategies with adolescents.
