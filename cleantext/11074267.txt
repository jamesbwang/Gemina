  Human visual recognition activates a dense network of overlapping feedforward and recurrent neuronal processes , making it hard to disentangle processing in the feedforward from the feedback direction. Here , we used ultra-rapid serial visual presentation to suppress sustained activity that blurs the boundaries of processing steps , enabling us to resolve two distinct stages of processing with MEG multivariate pattern classification. The first processing stage was the rapid activation cascade of the bottom-up sweep , which terminated early as visual stimuli were presented at progressively faster rates. The second stage was the emergence of categorical information with peak latency that shifted later in time with progressively faster stimulus presentations , indexing time-consuming recurrent processing. Using MEG-fMRI fusion with representational similarity , we localized recurrent signals in early visual cortex. Together , our findings segregated an initial bottom-up sweep from subsequent feedback processing , and revealed the neural signature of increased recurrent processing demands for challenging viewing conditions.
