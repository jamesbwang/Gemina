  We present a rare and interesting case of a 35-year-old woman who initially underwent an uneventful wide excision for a 13 cm left benign phyllodes tumour. She then noted a slowly growing left thyroid nodule<disease> 8 months postsurgery which on thyroidectomy 4 years later was shown to be a 6.9 cm isolated thyroid metastasis from the phyllodes tumour. As this may be the first reported such case in the literature , implications on histological classification , predictive factors for disease progression , mechanisms of metastasis , and evaluation , management and surveillance of benign phyllodes tumours and thyroid nodule/s with a history of phyllodes tumour can thus be significantly impacted.
