  The composites based on graphitic carbon and transitional metal oxides are regarded as one of the most promising electrochemical materials owing to the synergistic combination of the advantages of both superior electrical conductivity and high pseudocapacitance. In this work , a simple one-pot template-free strategy for the preparation of three-dimensional hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon framework in situ armored NiO nanograins ( NCF/NiO) by an ammonia-induced method assisted by the pyrolysis of a decomposable salt is reported. Due to such unique architecture and homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles , the as-prepared NCF/NiO -2 hybrid exhibits a large specific surface area ( 412.3 m
