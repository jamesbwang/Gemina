  Cardiac surgery patients regularly experience a systemic inflammation<symptom> response to the surgery and a postoperative stay in the intensive care unit. Nutritional support is one strategy to improve the outcome of cardiosurgical patients. A preoperatively diagnosed malnutrition contributes to a higher morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Preoperative fasting , glucose-free infusions during long and invasive operations and delayed postoperative nutrition therapy aggravate the nutrition situation. However , conclusive evidence for this population , consisting of well-conducted clinical trials is lacking.This article outlines the main causes for malnutrition in cardiosurgical patients and summarizes possibilities to identify patients at high nutritional risk , who are most likely to profit from aggressive nutritional therapy. Despite conspicuous knowledge and evidence gaps , a rational nutritional support therapy based on current recommendations of ASPEN , ESPEN and an international multidisciplinary consensus group is presented. The amount and kind of nutrition , as well as the best time to initiate nutrition support , ways to monitor nutrition therapy and the potential use of pharmaconutrition to modulate the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass are presented to benefit patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
