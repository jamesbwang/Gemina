  Dust dominates extraterrestrial flux on the earth ( 30,000 tonnes/yr) , however only ~ 5 % of the cosmic dust survives atmospheric entry which is basically in two forms: melted and unmelted. Melted micrometeorites undergo transformational changes due to heating during atmospheric entry which obliterate evidences regarding their precursors. Unmelted micrometeorites ( UMM) survive atmospheric entry with minimal alteration , they provide direct evidence for their parent bodies. Recent investigations unravelled a wide range of UMM , there are however no quantitative estimates of sources that contribute to the cosmic dust accreted by the Earth.
