  Previous studies have suggested environmental factors may contribute to the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). The current meta-analysis examined ( 1) the difference in the duration of maternal breastfeeding between children with and without ADHD , and ( 2) the association between maternal breastfeeding and ADHD in children. The data of individual studies were synthesized with a random-effects model. Eleven articles were included in this meta-analysis. Children with ADHD had significantly less breastfeeding duration than controls ( Hedges ' g =- 0.36 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) =- 0.61 to- 0.11 , p = 0.005; difference in means:- 2.44 months , 95 % CIs =- 3.17 to- 1.71 , p < 0.001). In addition , the rates of non-exclusive breastfeeding in children with ADHD is significantly higher in `` under 3 months '' ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.90 , 95 % CIs = 1.45 to 2.48 , p < 0.001) but lower in `` 6 to 12 months '' ( OR = 0.69 , 95 % CIs = 0.49 to 0.98 , p = 0.039) and `` over 12 months '' ( OR = 0.58 , 95 % CIs = 0.35 to 0.97 , p = 0.038) than controls. Children with ADHD received significantly higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding duration `` under 3 months '' ( OR = 1.51 , 95 % CIs = 1.20 to 1.89 , p < 0.001) but lower in `` over 3 months '' ( OR = 0.52 , 95 % CIs = 0.29 to 0.95 , p = 0.033) than controls. Furthermore , an association was found between non-breastfeeding and ADHD children ( adjusted OR = 3.71 , 95 % CI = 1.94 to 7.11 , p < 0.001). Our results suggest maternal breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of ADHD in children. Future longitudinal research is required to confirm/refute these findings and to explore possible mechanisms underlying this association.
