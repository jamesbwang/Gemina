  Lightweight and flexible ultraviolet ( UV) photodetectors ( PDs) have wide applications and have attracted more attention. PDs using organic and inorganic nanocomposites as active layers with a photodiode configuration could achieve photomultiplication and narrowband photoresponse via the control of microstructure and thickness of active layers. Here , we fabricated flexible UV PDs on indium tin oxide-coated poly ( ethylene terephthalate) substrates with a nanocomposite active layer composed of ZnO nanoparticles blended with a wide band gap conjugated polymer , poly ( ( 9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)- alt- co- ( bithiophene)) ( F8T2). As a result of the wavelength-dependent penetration depth of light in the active layer , the fabricated flexible UV PDs showed two narrow response peaks at 360 and 510 nm under reverse biases in the external quantum efficiency ( EQE) spectra with full width at half maximum ( FWHM) less than 20 nm. Both responses exhibited greater than 100 % EQE , indicating a photomultiplication effect , whereas the UV response at 360 nm was 10 times stronger under -15 V bias. The fabricated flexible UV PDs were bent under both tensile and compressive stress to a curvature of 2.1 cm
