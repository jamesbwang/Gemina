  Extracellular vesicles ( EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells , under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins , lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers , EV have beneficial effects , as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium ( EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells ( EV release).
