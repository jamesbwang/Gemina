  The structure and antioxidant activity of a neutral polysaccharide ( named as EFPN-1) from Epimedium koreanum Nakai were studied. Based on the results from high performance gel permeation chromatography , methylation GC-MS and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , EFPN-1 was a branched polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 21.9 kD and containing over 60 % of glucose. Its backbone was composed of ( 1 → 4)- β-d-Glcp and ( 1 → 3)- β-d-Galp , branched partially at O-6 of both residues , with a degree of branching of 40.4 % and terminated mainly with Ara and Gal , as well as trace amount of Gal. Antioxidant tests showed that EFPN-1 exhibited a strong capacity on DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging , ferrous ion chelation and reducing antioxidant powder. EFPN-1 has potential to be developed as a natural antioxidant.
