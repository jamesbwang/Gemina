  Antibiotic prophylaxis for contacts of meningitis<disease> cases is not recommended during outbreaks in the African meningitis<disease> belt. We assessed the effectiveness of single-dose oral ciprofloxacin administered to household contacts and in village-wide distributions on the overall attack rate ( AR) in an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis<disease> In this 3-arm , open-label , cluster-randomized trial during a meningococcal meningitis<disease> outbreak in Madarounfa District , Niger , villages notifying a suspected case were randomly assigned ( 1:1:1) to standard care ( the control arm) , single-dose oral ciprofloxacin for household contacts within 24 hours of case notification , or village-wide distribution of ciprofloxacin within 72 hours of first case notification. The primary outcome was the overall AR of suspected meningitis<disease> after inclusion. A random sample of 20 participating villages was enrolled to document any changes in fecal carriage prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL)- producing Enterobacteriaceae before and after the intervention. Between April 22 and May 18 , 2017 , 49 villages were included: 17 to the control arm , 17 to household prophylaxis , and 15 to village-wide prophylaxis. A total of 248 cases were notified in the study after the index cases. The AR was 451 per 100,000 persons in the control arm , 386 per 100,000 persons in the household prophylaxis arm ( t test versus control p = 0.68) , and 190 per 100,000 persons in the village-wide prophylaxis arm ( t test versus control p = 0.032). The adjusted AR ratio between the household prophylaxis arm and the control arm was 0.94 ( 95 % CI 0.52-1.73 , p = 0.85) , and the adjusted AR ratio between the village-wide prophylaxis arm and the control arm was 0.40 ( 95 % CI 0.19 0.87 , p = 0.022). No adverse events were notified. Baseline carriage prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was 95 % and of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was > 90 % , and did not change post-intervention. One limitation of the study was the small number of cerebrospinal fluid samples sent for confirmatory testing. Village-wide distribution of single-dose oral ciprofloxacin within 72 hours of case notification reduced overall meningitis<disease> AR. Distributions of ciprofloxacin could be an effective tool in future meningitis<disease> outbreak responses , but further studies investigating length of protection , effectiveness in urban settings , and potential impact on antimicrobial resistance patterns should be carried out.
