  CpG methylation can regulate gene expression by altering the specific binding of protein and DNA. In order to understand how a single 5mC regulates protein-DNA interactions , we have compared the structures and dynamics of CEBP/Î²protein-DNA complexes before and after methylation , and the results indicate that even a single 5mC can regulate protein-DNA recognition by steric-hindrance effect of methyl group and changing the hydrogen bond interactions. The interactions between the methyl group , mCpG motif , and the conserved residue arginine make the protein read out the variation of local environment , which further enhances the specific recognition and affects the base pair stacking. The stacking interactions can propagate along the backbone of DNA and lead to long-range allosteric effects , including obvious conformational variations for DNA base pairs.
