  Many studies report a relationship between poor static posture<symptom> ( SP) and low back pain ( LBP). This study examined the effects of a biofeedback postural training program on pre-existing LBP , changes to level of physical activity and workability in participants. To determine if static posture<symptom> training with biofeedback alleviates LBP. The control group wore a pedometer to track level of physical activity and the experimental group wore the postural training device , Lumo Lift , for three weeks. Participants completed the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire ( CMDQ) and completed pre- and post-intervention side-view pictures to evaluate changes in posture<symptom>. Participants were predominately-sedentary work environment ( N = 31; 13 men , 18 women; age = 33.1 ± 13.3 years; height = 170.2 ± 9.7 cm; mass = 71.6 ± 17.5 kg). LBP discomfort was statistical significant when comparing pretest and posttest CMDQ mean score in all subjects ( F ( 1 , 18) = 6.25 , p = 0.02). There was no significant evidence of reducing LBP experience and LBP interference at work when comparing in all subjects. There was no statistical difference in level of physical activity by analyzing average steps between the experimental and control groups ( 95 % CI = -1040.4-1845.4 , p = 0.57). Postural training with biofeedback application helps with LBP management by decreasing level of LBP discomfort. People with LBP should be aware of their static posture<symptom> and develop good muscle strength and endurance in order to maintain performance at work , school , or sports.
