  Prenatal exposure to citalopram ( CTM) , an antidepressant drug , has been associated with altered behavior , including autism-like symptoms in both human and rodent offspring. However , the neurological basis underlying these abnormal<symptom> behaviors<symptom> is not well understood. Here , we examined behavioral , morphological , and biochemical alterations in the male and female offspring of C57BL/6 mouse mothers that had been exposed to CTM during the last trimester of gestation. We observed abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> such as anxiety<symptom> , altered locomotion and disordered social interactions in 2-5 months old offspring with prenatal CTM exposure. Using Golgi-Cox staining , we found that CTM caused significantly reduced dendritic length and number of dendritic branches in striatal neurons , as well as altered subunit levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors ( NMDARs) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII). Memantine , a selective NMDAR antagonist , improved prenatal CTM-induced abnormal protein levels and social interaction deficits. These results highlight potential mechanisms underlying the abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> observed in children who are prenatally exposed to CTM.
