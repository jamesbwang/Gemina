  Most classification schemes are based on hazard identification: this is particularly true for carcinogenic and reproductive effects. These schemes are no longer adequate to take adequate decisions on risk management , and they appear outmoded. In addition , the induce communication and perception problems in the population , causing health scares and anxiety<symptom> that are difficult to control and recover. Risk assessment requires an estimation of human exposure to be compared with the safe dose for humans ( exposure or intake limits) estimated after hazard characterization based on dose-response relationship. The risk based approaches provide quantitative information on the potency of the substance that can be compared with duration , frequency and intensity of exposure and , therefore , properly inform graded risk management decisions , in relation to the expected characteristics of exposure.
