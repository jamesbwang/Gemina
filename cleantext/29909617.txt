  Two-dimensional valleytronic systems can provide information storage and processing advantages that complement or surpass those of conventional charge- and spin-based semiconductor technologies. The major challenge currently is to realize valley<disease> polarization for manipulating the valley<disease> degree of freedom. Here , we propose that valley<disease> polarization can be readily achieved in Janus single-layer MoSSe through magnetic doping , which is highly feasible in experiment. Due to inversion symmetry breaking combined with strong spin-orbit coupling ( SOC) , the pure single-layer MoSSe harbors an intriguing multivalleyed band structure and strong coupled spin and valley<disease> physics. After doping Cr/V , the long-sought valley<disease> polarization is successfully achieved with a remarkable energy difference of âˆ¼ 0.06 eV upon switching on SOC. Furthermore , the valley<disease> polarization in Cr/V-doped single-layer MoSSe is tunable via strain engineering. Our work thus provides a promising platform for experimental studies and applications of the valleytronics.
