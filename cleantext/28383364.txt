  Psychostimulant augmentation is considered a potential treatment strategy for individuals with major depressive disorder who do not adequately respond to antidepressant monotherapy. The primary objective of this 12-month open-label extension study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate ( LDX) as augmentation therapy to an antidepressant in adults with major depressive disorder. Eligible adults who completed 1 of 3 short-term antecedent LDX augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy studies were treated with dose-optimized LDX ( 20-70 mg) for up to 52 weeks while continuing on the index antidepressant ( escitalopram , sertraline , venlafaxine extended-release , or duloxetine) assigned during the antecedent short-term studies. Safety and tolerability assessments included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events and vital sign changes. All 3 antecedent studies failed to meet the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint , so this open-label study was terminated early. Headache<symptom> ( 15.5 % ( 241/1559)) , dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> ( 13.6 % ( 212/1559)) , insomnia ( 13.1 % ( 204/1559)) , and decreased appetite<symptom> ( 12.1 % ( 189/1559)) were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events. The greatest mean ± SD increases observed for systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and for pulse were 2.6 ± 10.85 and 1.7 ± 7.94 mm Hg and 6.9 ± 10.27 bpm , respectively. Monitoring determined that less than 1 % of participants experienced potentially clinically important changes in systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 10 ( 0.6 %)) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 8 ( 0.5 %)) , or pulse ( 6 ( 0.4 %)). The overall safety and tolerability of long-term LDX augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy was consistent with the profiles of the short-term antecedent studies , with no evidence of new safety signals.
