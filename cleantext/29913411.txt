  Hysteresis in the coordination of movement can be described in the language of coordination dynamics as an asymmetrical response of a system 's order parameter with respect to opposite changes in a control parameter. For movement tasks involving a large number of active degrees-of-freedom , the order parameter can be modelled with a pattern recognition approach like Self-Organizing Maps ( SOM). This study explored this method in a rope-skipping task , which involves the coordinated oscillation of several segments in the lower and upper limb and trunk and we compared the results to a classical order parameter like continuous relative phase. Five rope skippers completed a task which involved 30 s continuous forward rope-skipping during which the frequency ( set by a metronome) increased linearly , immediately followed by 30 s during which the frequency decreased linearly. CRP was analyzed with statistical parametric mapping and a hysteresis measure for the SOM was calculated based on inter-trial variability. Both the CRP and the SOMs showed that the coordination patterns changed differently during the two conditions , signifying hysteresis. While the CRP captures only the relative coordination of two segments , the SOM is able to accommodate the whole-body multidimensional coordination. Hysteresis is often used as proxy for higher-order information about the movement system. While the low sample size in this study does not allow us to generalize the results , the present methodology can be used in further studies to advance our theoretical understanding of dynamical systems in complex whole-body movements.
