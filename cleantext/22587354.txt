  Protein kinases generate nearly a thousand different protein products and regulate the majority of cellular pathways and signal transduction. It is therefore not surprising that the deregulation of kinases has been implicated in many disease states. In fact , kinase inhibitors are the largest class of new cancer therapies. Understanding polypharmacology within the full kinome , how drugs interact with many different kinases , would allow for the development of safer and more efficacious cancer therapies. A full understanding of these interactions is not experimentally feasible making highly accurate computational predictions extremely useful and important. This work aims at making a machine learning model useful for investigating the full kinome. We evaluate many feature sets for our model and get better performance over molecular docking with all of them. We demonstrate that you can achieve a nearly 60 % increase in success rate at identifying binding compounds using our model over molecular docking scores.
