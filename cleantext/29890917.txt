  Treating great and small saphenous vein trunk insufficiency with cyanoacrylate glue is the least taxing treatment method of all available techniques. Due to long-term unavailability of commercial kits with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate ( histoacryl) in the Czech Republic , we used a modified technique. Fifty-six limbs in 49 patients suffering from great saphenous vein or small saphenous vein insufficiency in combination with symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency and complicating comorbidities were treated with a modified endovascular cyanoacrylate glue application technique. The immediate success rate of the treatment was 98 %. In follow-up intervals of six weeks , six months , one year , and two years , the anatomical success rates of embolization ( recanalization of no more than 5 cm of the junction) were 98 , 96 , 94 , and 94 % , respectively. At identical intervals the venous insufficiency was scored according to the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire and the American Venous Clinical Severity Score. In both cases , improvement was demonstrated over the two-year follow-up , with a 0.5 % significance level. Specific clinical signs of venous insufficiency were also evaluated , such as pain , oedema , clearance of varicose veins , and healing of venous ulceration. One severe complication- a pulmonary embolism- was reported , without consequences. We demonstrated that treating insufficient saphenous veins with modified histoacryl application brought a relief from symptoms of venous insufficiency and that the efficiency of this technique is comparable to commonly used methods.
