  In this work , the effect of humidity and water intercalation on the friction and wear behavior of few-layers of graphene and graphene oxide ( GO) was studied using friction force microscopy. Thickness measurements demonstrated significant water intercalation within GO affecting its surface topography ( roughness and protrusions) , whereas negligible water intercalation of graphene was observed. It was found that water intercalation in GO contributed to wearing of layers at a relative humidity as low as âˆ¼ 30 %. The influence of surface wettability and water adsorption was also studied by comparing the sliding behavior of SiO
