  Many long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been identified as powerful regulators of lung adenocarcinoma ( LAD). However , the role of HOXA-AS3 , a novel lncRNA , in LAD is largely unknown. In this study , we showed that HOXA-AS3 was significantly upregulated in LAD tissues and A549 cells. After knockdown of HOXA-AS3 , cell proliferation , migration , and invasion were inhibited. Xenografts derived from A549 cells transfected with shRNA/HOXA-AS 3 had significantly lower tumor weights and smaller tumor volumes. We also demonstrated that HOXA-AS3 increased HOXA6 mRNA stability by forming an RNA duplex. In addition , HOXA6 promoted cell proliferation , migration , and invasion in vitro. Using a RNA pull-down assay , we found that HOXA-AS3 bonded with NF110 , which regulated the cell localization of HOXA-AS3. Moreover , histone acetylation was involved in upregulation of HOXA-AS3. These results demonstrate that HOXA-AS3 was activated in LAD and supported cancer cell progression. Therefore , inhibition of HOXA-AS3 could be an effective targeted therapy for patients with LAD.
