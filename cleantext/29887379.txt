  Noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles. Here , we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs-a long ncRNA , a circular RNA , and two microRNAs-using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation , which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels , Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as , a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano , excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons , in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA , miR-671. Thus , several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.
