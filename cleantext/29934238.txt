  The repair of flexor tendon lesions<symptom> in zone 2 remains a highly controversial subject in hand surgery. Currently , there is no consensus about the management of these lesions<symptom> intra- and postoperatively , but the literature suggests that a solid suture will allow early active motion. We hypothesized that the management of flexor tendon injury in zone 2 varies widely. Two online surveys were conducted with surgeons and hand therapists. The questions captured the demographics of the surveyed population , surgical technique , common complications , postoperative management ( duration of immobilization , type of splint , rehabilitation techniques and principles of self-rehabilitation). The responses were compared to current literature data. We collected 366 responses to the `` surgery '' survey and 206 responses to `` rehabilitation '' survey. Most surgeons performed suture repair with at least 4 strands ( 75.9 %). Active rehabilitation protocols were used in 48.9 % of cases. The `` rehabilitation '' survey underlined the lack of information provided to therapists by surgeons. Therapists used active protocols in 79.7 % of cases. This study found a large variation in the management of flexor tendon injuries , which is not always consistent with current published recommendations. Ideally , the suture repair should be a 4-strand pattern with an epitendinous circumferential suture and a release of the pulley in the suture area. Mobilization and rehabilitation should be started on the 3rd day using an active protocol.
