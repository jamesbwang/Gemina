  Iron-rich 2:17-type Sm-Co magnets are important for their potential to achieve high coercivity and maximum magnetic energy product. But the evolution of phase structure , which determines magnetic properties , remains an unsolved issue. In this study , the phase constitution and microstructure of solution-treated 2:17-type Sm-Co alloys are studied. The increase of Fe content promotes the ordering transformation from the 1:7 H phase to partially ordered 2:17 R and lamellar Zr-rich 1:3 R phase. This ordering transformation is mainly due to the competitive atoms occupation of Zr , Fe and Sm in the 1:7 H phase. To ease this competition , we modify Sm content in iron-rich 2:17-type Sm-Co magnets. Different solution precursors and corresponding cellular structures are observed. Solution precursor with 1:7 H , partially ordered 2:17 R , 2:17 H and 1:3 R phase evolves into uneven and incomplete cellular structures , while solution precursor with partially ordered 2:17 R phase forms larger cell size with less lamellar phase , thus poor coercivity and magnetic energy product. However , solution precursors with single 1:7 H phase evolve into uniform cellular structures and perform high coercivity and magnetic energy product. Our results indicate if a single 1:7 H phase could be obtained in solution-treated 2:17-type Sm-Co magnets with higher iron content , much higher magnetic properties could be achieved.
