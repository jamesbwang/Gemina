  We hypothesized that 5 weeks of endurance training with blood flow restriction ( R-training) , providing relative ischemia and stimulation of the muscle chemoreflex , would decrease the exercise pressor reflex ( EPR) when compared to training with the same workload in a free-flow condition ( NR-training). 10 subjects performed one-leg knee-extension training four times a week during a 5-week period. Both legs were trained with identical workload , with one leg being trained during flow-restriction induced by lower body positive pressure. The EPR was assessed by measuring the increase in heart rate ( HR) and mean arterial pressure ( MAP) during an isometric knee extension of 35 % of max torque for 90 s , this was done before ( C) , and after training in each leg ( R and NR , respectively). At the end of isometric contraction , the increase in mean AP ( MAP) in the NR-trained leg and in the control condition were 41 ± 4 and 38 ± 4 mmHg , respectively , whereas the increase in the R-trained leg was 30 ± 4 mmHg ( p < 0.05 R vs C and NR) , corresponding to a decrease of about 25 %. A similar patter was observed with respect to responses in HR , where the increase was 28 ± 3 and 28 ± 3 bpm in the NR and C , and 22 ± 4 in the R condition ( p < 0.05 R vs C and NR). Peripheral metabolic changes induced by relative ischemia are important in modifying the EPR in response to exercise training.
