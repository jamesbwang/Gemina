  The canonical role of cohesin is to mediate sister chromatid cohesion. In addition , cohesin plays important roles in processes such as DNA repair and regulation of gene expression. Mounting evidence suggests that various post-translational modifications , including phosphorylation , acetylation and sumoylation regulate cohesin functions. Our mass spectrometry analysis of cohesin purified from
