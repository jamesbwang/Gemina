  Thiopurine metabolite monitoring to proactively dose optimize to achieve therapeutic levels has not been used consistently , and it is unclear if this would lead to better outcomes. We aimed to compare 6-month outcomes between standard and optimized dosing strategies and define long-term predictors of thiopurine durability. Two hundred sixteen pediatric IBD patients with at least 2 6-thioguanine nucleotide ( 6-TGN) levels were grouped for analysis by start dose: > 2.5 mg/kg/day AZA ( group 1) or < 2.5 mg/kg/day ( group 2) and further subgrouped depending on whether dosing was optimized to achieve 6-TGN > 235 pmol/8 × 108 RBC. The metabolites , 6TGN and 6MMP , were univariate and multivariate analyses tested associations among metabolite levels , laboratory data , and the primary outcome of 6-month steroid-free clinical remission ( SFR) ( HBI ≤ 4 for CD; partial Mayo Score ( pMS) ≤ 2 for UC). Thiopurine durability was measured using Kaplan Maier survival analysis. 6-MP , azathioprine , pediatrics , therapeutic drug monitoring , pediatrics were measured a median 59 ( 43-76) days after initiation of thiopurine. Both dosing strategies led to similar initial 6-TGN levels ( group 1 = median 209 ( IQR: 155-272) with 25 % of patients > 235; group 2 = 196 ( 139-274) with 29 % > 235). Steroid-free clinical remission was achieved in 74 % of the 180 still on thiopurines at 6 months. Start dose was not associated with 6-month SFR-73 % in group 1 and 77 % in group 2 within those on thiopurines at 6 months ( P = 0.61). Fixed- and optimized-dosing subgroups had similar 6-month 6-TGN levels , SFR rate , and percentage 6-TGN > 235. Only 6-TGN level > 235 at 6 months predicted thiopurine durability ( 3 years ( 1.7-7.7) vs 2.5 years ( 0.83-5); log-rank P < 0.001) , and this did not retain significant in a multivariate model. Initial dosing strategy , first 6-TGN level , 6-month SFR , 6MMP: 6TGN ratio , and delta-MCV did not predict durability. The rate of adverse events was 22 %. Steroid-free clinical remission and 6-TGN levels at 6 months were no different between a standardized , fixed dosing strategy and a metabolite-driven , optimized dosing strategy.
