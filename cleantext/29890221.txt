  The largest class of rhodopsin mutations causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa ( adRP) is mutations that lead to misfolding and aggregation of the receptor. The misfolding mutants have been characterized biochemically , and categorized as either partial or complete misfolding mutants. This classification is incomplete and does not provide sufficient information to fully understand the disease pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic strategies. A FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET) method was utilized to directly assess the aggregation properties of misfolding rhodopsin mutants within the cell. Partial ( P23H and P267L) and complete ( G188R , H211P , and P267R) misfolding mutants were characterized to reveal variability in aggregation properties. The complete misfolding mutants all behaved similarly , forming aggregates when expressed alone , minimally interacting with the wild-type receptor when coexpressed , and were unresponsive to treatment with the pharmacological chaperone 9-cis retinal. In contrast , variability was observed between the partial misfolding mutants. In the opsin form , the P23H mutant behaved similarly as the complete misfolding mutants. In contrast , the opsin form of the P267L mutant existed as both aggregates and oligomers when expressed alone and formed mostly oligomers with the wild-type receptor when coexpressed. The partial misfolding mutants both reacted similarly to the pharmacological chaperone 9-cis retinal , displaying improved folding and oligomerization when expressed alone but aggregating with wild-type receptor when coexpressed. The observed differences in aggregation properties and effect of 9-cis retinal predict different outcomes in disease pathophysiology and suggest that retinoid-based chaperones will be ineffective or even detrimental.
