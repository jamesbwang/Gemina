  Antiretroviral therapy ( ART) is currently recommended for all persons living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWH) , regardless of their CD4 + T-cell count , and should be continued throughout life. Nonetheless , vigilance of the safety of ART , including its neurotoxicity , must continue. We hypothesized that use of certain ART drugs might be associated with aging-related cerebral degenerative changes among PLWH. Clinicopathological study of PLWH who were using ART drugs at the last clinical assessment. Using multivariable logistic regression , we tested associations between use of each specific ART drug ( with reference to use of other ART drugs) and cerebral degenerative changes including neuronal phospho-tau pathology , β-amyloid plaque deposition , microgliosis , and astrogliosis in the frontal cortex and putamen ( immunohistochemistry) , as well as cerebral small vessel disease ( CSVD) in the forebrain white matter ( standard histopathology) , with relevant covariates being taken into account. The Bonferroni adjustment was applied. Darunavir use was associated with higher likelihood of neuronal phospho-tau pathology in the putamen ( odds ratio ( OR) 15.33 , n = 93 , P = 0.005). Ritonavir use was associated with marked microgliosis in the putamen ( OR 4.96 , n = 101 , P = 0.023). On the other hand , use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with lower likelihood of β-amyloid plaque deposition in the frontal cortex ( OR 0.13 , n = 102 , P = 0.012). There was a trend toward an association between emtricitabine use and CSVD ( OR 13.64 , n = 75 , P = 0.099). Our findings suggest that PLWH treated with darunavir and ritonavir may be at increased risk of aging-related cerebral degenerative changes.
