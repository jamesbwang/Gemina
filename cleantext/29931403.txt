  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) are obligatory plant symbionts that live underground , so few studies have examined their response to light. Responses to blue light by other fungi<pathogen> can be mediated by White Collar-1 ( WC-1) and WC-2 proteins. These wc genes , together with the frequency gene ( frq) , also form part of the endogenous circadian clock. The clock mechanism has never been studied in AMF , although circadian growth of their hyphae in the field has been reported. Using both genomic and transcriptomic data , we have found homologs of wc-1 , wc-2 , and frq and related circadian clock genes in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare ( synonym Rhizophagus irregularis<pathogen>). Gene expression of wc-1 , wc-2 , and frq was analyzed using RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from germinating spores and from fungal material cultivated in vitro with transformed carrot roots. We found that all three core clock genes were expressed in both pre- and post-mycorrhizal stages of R. irregulare growth. Similar to the model fungus Neurospora<pathogen> crassa , the core circadian oscillator gene frq was induced by brief light stimulation. The presence of circadian clock and output genes in R. irregulare opens the door to the study of circadian clocks in the fungal partner of plant-AMF symbiosis. Our finding also provides new insight into the evolution of the circadian frq gene in
