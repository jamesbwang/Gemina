  Ternary CuZnS nanocrystals ( NCs) are synthesized via a facile , scalable , noninjection method at low temperatures for the first time , wherein sodium ascorbate plays the dual roles of reducing agent and capping ligand in the preparation process. These NCs can be dispersed well in a polar solvent like dimethyl sulfoxide , and the average size is âˆ¼ 4 nm as measured by transmission electron microscopy. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the crystal structure of CuZnS NCs displays covellite CuS-like structure and the Zn element partly occupies the Cu position. Also , the crystal structure of CuZnS NCs is completely converted from a covellite CuS structure into a digenite Cu
