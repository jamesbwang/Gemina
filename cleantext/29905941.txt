  Patients with ovarian cancer often report elevated anxiety<symptom> at diagnosis that decreases posttreatment. However , a minority of patients experience sustained anxiety<symptom>. Few studies have examined risk factors for persistent anxiety<symptom> or its physiologic sequelae in ovarian cancer. Therefore , the authors investigated associations between prior life events , anxiety<symptom> , inflammation<symptom> ( plasma levels of interleukin-6) , and diurnal cortisol profiles in patients with ovarian cancer during the first year postdiagnosis. Participants ( n = 337) completed surveys and had blood and salivary sampling prediagnosis , postchemotherapy ( 6 months) , and 12 months after diagnosis. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule was administered to a patient subset ( n = 127) within 1 month of diagnosis. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze relations between anxiety<symptom> and biologic variables over time. Linear regression models assessed whether anxiety<symptom> trajectories mediated associations between prior stress exposure and biologic variables. Age , chemotherapy at 1 year , and cancer stage were covariates. Decreased anxiety<symptom> was associated with a more normalized cortisol slope over time ( β = 0.092; P = .047). Early life adversity was related to flatter cortisol slopes over time ( β = -0.763; P = .002); this relation was partially mediated by anxiety<symptom> trajectory ( P = .046). More danger-related events prediagnosis were associated with sustained anxiety<symptom> ( β = 0.537; P = .019) and flatter cortisol slopes over time ( β = -0.243; P = .047); anxiety<symptom> partially mediated the relation between danger and cortisol slope ( P = .037). Neither anxiety<symptom> nor prior stress exposure was related to levels of interleukin-6. Because dysregulated cortisol has been related to fatigue<symptom> , poorer quality of life , and shorter survival in patients with ovarian cancer , those who have prior life events and chronic anxiety<symptom> during the first year postdiagnosis may be at risk for more negative outcomes.
