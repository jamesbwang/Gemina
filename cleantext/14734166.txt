  Nocellara Etnea is one of the main Sicilian<pathogen> cultivars traditionally used to produce both olive oil and naturally fermented table olives. In the present study , the effect of different salt concentrations on physico-chemical , microbiological , sensorial , and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) formation was evaluated in order to obtain functional Nocellara Etnea table olives. The experimental design consisted of 8 treatments as follow: fermentations at 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 % of salt with ( E1-E4 samples) and without ( C1-C4 samples) the addition of starters. All the trials were carried out at room temperature ( 18 ± 2 °C) and monitored for an overall period of 120 d. In addition , the persistence of the potential probiotic
