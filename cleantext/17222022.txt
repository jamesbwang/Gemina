  Today , Gold Nanorods have promised variety of applications in conjugation with biomolecules of interest. Discovery of functional amyloids has also been highlighted with possible use in designing high performance materials. To exploit dual properties of both Nano and Bio counterparts in new functional materials , this effort has focused on synthesis of a potential hybrid system of Gold nanorods ( GNRs) and HSA amyloid fibrils to develop a conductive nanoscaffold. UV-Vis spectroscopy , Thioflavin T ( ThT) assay , Far-UV Circular Dichroism ( CD) spectropolarimetry , fluorescence and Transmission Electron microscopy were used to characterize formation of the nanostructures and amyloid fibrils. Surface plasmon resonance of GNRs was also monitored upon interaction with HSA amyloid fibrils , showing that the plasmonic component of the hybrid system has maintained its characteristic rod morphology without any perturbations. Analysis of Nyquist plots for the hybrid nanoscaffold showed that the electronic behavior of the hybrid system has been enhanced due to the presence of the assembled GNRs. Results of this investigation highlight the possibility of fabricating hybrid nano-bioscaffolds as promising candidates in versatile biomedical and biosensing applications.
