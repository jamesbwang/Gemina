  Here we report , for the first time , the growth of single-crystalline mesoporous MOFs with well-controlled orientation on the surface of gold nanorods. Importantly , it showed that trace amounts of water could induce the formation of MOFs of different phases and shapes , which was critical for the synthesis of such mesoporous heterostructures.
