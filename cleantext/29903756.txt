  Therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> remains poorly defined due to a lack of large data sets recognizing the defining characteristics of this entity. We reviewed all consecutive cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> treated at our institution between 2000 and 2017 and identified therapy-related cases-defined as acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> preceded by prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. Of 1022 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> , 93 ( 9.1 %) were classified as therapy-related. The median latency for therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> onset was 6.8 years from original diagnosis , and this was shorter for patients carrying the MLL gene rearrangement compared to those with other cytogenetics. When compared to de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> , therapy-related patients were older ( P < 0.01) , more often female ( P < 0.01) , and had more MLL gene rearrangement ( P < 0.0001) and chromosomes 5/7 aberrations ( P = 0.02). Although therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> was associated with inferior 2-year overall survival compared to de novo cases ( 46.0 % vs. 68.1 % , P = 0.001) , prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy ( therapy-related) did not independently impact survival in multivariate analysis ( HR = 1.32; 95 % CI: 0.97-1.80 , P = 0.08). There was no survival difference ( 2-year = 53.4 % vs. 58.9 % , P = 0.68) between the two groups in patients who received allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In conclusion , therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> represents a significant proportion of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> diagnoses and a subset of cases carry clinical and cytogenetic abnormalities similar to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Although survival of therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> was inferior to de novo cases , allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes were comparable for the two entities.
