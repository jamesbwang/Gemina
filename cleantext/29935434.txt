  The present study aimed to elucidate the photosynthetic performance , antioxidant enzyme activities , anthocyanin contents , anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression , and vanadium uptake in mustard genotypes ( purple and green) that differ in photosynthetic capacity under vanadium stress. The results indicated that vanadium significantly reduced photosynthetic activity in both genotypes. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes were increased significantly in response to vanadium in both genotypes , although the purple exhibited higher. The anthocyanin contents were also reduced under vanadium stress. The anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were highly expressed in the purple genotype , notably the genes TT8 , F3H , and MYBL2 under vanadium stress. The results indicate that induction of TT8 , F3H , and MYBL2 genes was associated with upregulation of the biosynthetic genes required for higher anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple compared with the green mustard. The roots accumulated higher vanadium than shoots in both mustard genotypes. The results indicate that the purple mustard had higher vanadium tolerance.
