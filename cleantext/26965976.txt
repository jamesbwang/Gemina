  The new direct acting antivirals ( DAA) have demonstrated low rates of adverse effects in controlled studies. However , real world-studies have disclosed emerging toxicities and drug-drug interactions in special populations. We conducted a retrospective review of HIV/HCV coinfected patients who were treated with DAA at Jackson Memorial Hospital from 2014 to 2017. Our aim was to determine the adverse effects ( AE) and factors that are associated with AE in HIV/HCV individuals who are treated with DAA. There were 78 coinfected patients treated with DAA. AE that were secondary to DAA were reported by 21 ( 26.9 %) patients. The most common AE were fatigue<symptom> ( 47.6 %) , gastrointestinal symptoms ( 38.1 %) , anemia<symptom> ( 14.3 %) , and headache<symptom> ( 14.3 %). In comparison with the rest of the study cohort , the patients who developed AE were more often Caucasian ( 33.3 % vs. 10.5 % , These findings demonstrated good tolerability of DAAs in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. More real-world studies are needed to explore the variables that are associated with AE.
