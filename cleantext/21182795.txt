  Specification of endocrine cell lineages in the developing pancreas relies on extrinsic signals from non-pancreatic tissues , which initiate a cell-autonomous sequence of transcription factor activation and repression switches. The steps in this pathway share reliance on activity-dependent Ca We used high-resolution histochemistry to explore the coincident expression of secretagogin and transcription factors driving Î² cell differentiation. Secretagogin promoter activity was tested in response to genetically manipulating Pax6 and Pax4 expression. Secretagogin null mice were produced with their pancreatic islets morphologically and functionally characterized during fetal development. A proteomic approach was utilized to identify the Ca Here , we show that secretagogin , a Ca In sum , secretagogin scales the temporal availability of a Ca
