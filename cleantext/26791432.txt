  Biochemical , structural and cellular studies reveal Jumonji-C ( JmjC) domain-containing 7 ( JMJD7) to be a 2-oxoglutarate ( 2OG)- dependent oxygenase that catalyzes ( 3S)- lysyl hydroxylation. Crystallographic analyses reveal JMJD7 to be more closely related to the JmjC hydroxylases than to the JmjC demethylases. Biophysical and mutation studies show that JMJD7 has a unique dimerization mode , with interactions between monomers involving both N- and C-terminal regions and disulfide bond formation. A proteomic approach identifies two related members of the translation factor ( TRAFAC) family of GTPases , developmentally regulated GTP-binding proteins 1 and 2 ( DRG1/2) , as activity-dependent JMJD7 interactors. Mass spectrometric analyses demonstrate that JMJD7 catalyzes Fe ( II)- and 2OG-dependent hydroxylation of a highly conserved lysine residue in DRG1/2; amino-acid analyses reveal that JMJD7 catalyzes ( 3S)- lysyl hydroxylation. The functional assignment of JMJD7 will enable future studies to define the role of DRG hydroxylation in cell growth and disease.
