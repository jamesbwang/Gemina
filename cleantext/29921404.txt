  Acne is the most common affection of adolescents , although it can be also found in adult women. Our study was aimed at the comparative assessment of three different therapies over a three-month period , applied to women with moderate comedogenic and papulo-pustular endocrine acne. In the study 116 female patients with endocrine localized face acne were included and divided into three groups: group I with 42 patients was treated with a combination of contraceptive pill + local treatment + pulsed-vacuum light; group II with 38 patients was treated with contraceptives and pulsed-vacuum light and group III with 36 patients was treated only with local treatment. The acne evaluation was made using the Global Acne Grading System ( GAGS<symptom>). Statistical data processing was carried out using the STATA software. For the comedogenic form of acne , the good and very good results were superior in group I vs group II and III ( 83.33 % vs 31.58 % vs 5.56 %) at the end of the three months of treatment. For the papulo-pustulous form of acne , good and very good results were similar in groups I and II ( 92.86 % vs 73.68 %) both after the first month of treatment and at the end of the study , well above the local treatment group ( 13.99 %). Our study highlighted the superiority of laser treatment combined with hormonal treatment , compared to hormonal and local treatment in the comedogenic form of acne , and the superiority of hormonal treatment combined ( or not) with laser treatment in the papulo-pustular form compared to local treatment.
