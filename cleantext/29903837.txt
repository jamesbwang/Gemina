  Surprisingly little information exists of the mechanics in the steps initializing the walk-to-run transition ( WRT) in humans. Here we assess how mechanical work of the limbs ( vertical and horizontal) and the individual joints ( ankle , knee and hip) are modulated as humans transition from a preferred constant walking velocity ( WLK) to a variety of running velocities ( RUN; ranging from a sprint to a velocity slower than WLK). WRTs to fast RUNs occur nearly exclusively through positive horizontal limb work , satisfying the goal of forward acceleration. Contrary to our hypothesis , however , positive mechanical work remains above that of WLK even when decelerating. In these WRTs to slow running , positive mechanical work is remarkably high and is comprised nearly exclusively of vertical limb work. Vertical-to-horizontal work modulation may represent an optimization for achieving minimal and maximal RUN velocity , respectively , while fulfilling an apparent necessity for energy input when initiating WRTs. Net work of the WRT steps was more evenly distributed across the ankle , knee and hip joints than expected. Absolute positive mechanical work exhibited a clearer modulation towards hip-based work at high accelerations ( > 3 m s
