  Self-treatment is a widespread practice among patients with common symptoms and ailments; it is necessary to explore multiple aspects of it. Notably , there is little research into self-treatment among middle-aged and elderly people , who are more likely to fall ill. Our goals are to provide a comprehensive description of self-treatment and explore associated factors with insurance utilization and expenditures among the middle-aged and elderly populations in China. A survey was conducted in July 2016 in Shanxi , China. A stratified sampling scheme was applied to achieve representativeness. A total of 972 subjects were surveyed. Descriptive statistics , t- and Chi-squared tests , multivariate logistic regression , and multivariate linear regression were utilized. In our study , 772 ( 79.4 %) of the surveyed subjects self-treated during the previous twelve months. Among them , 253 ( 32.8 %) used health insurance. Subjects ' characteristics were associated with insurance utilization and expenditures for self-treatment. Total cost was positively associated with insurance utilization. The subjects with a junior high education ( p-value < 0.001 , aOR = 0.049) and senior high education ( p-value = 0.020 , aOR = 0.146) had a lower probability of using insurance. For both total costs and out-of-pocket costs , subjects who were 51 to 60 years old had lower costs. The subjects who were seriously sick and had a primary school education , as well as enterprise occupations , had higher costs. Self-treatment times were also positively associated with costs. Finally , it was found that subjects who did n't use insurance had lower total costs. The prevalence of self-treatment was high ( 79.4 %). Some characteristics were associated with insurance utilization and expenditures in self-treatment. Our results may be helpful for policy interventions , which are needed to further improve the effectiveness of health insurance in China.
