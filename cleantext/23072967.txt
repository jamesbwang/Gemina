  Calcium plays an important role in plant growth , development , and response to environmental stimuli. Copines are conserved plasma membrane-localized calcium-binding proteins which regulate plant immune responses and development. In this study , we found that copine proteins BON2 and BON3 , the paralogs of BON1 , physically interact with calcium pumps ACA8 and ACA10 in Arabidopsis. Notably , ACA9 , the closest homologue of ACA8 and ACA10 functioning in pollen tube growth , interacts with all three copines. This is consistent with the protein ‚Åª protein interactions between the two protein families , the
