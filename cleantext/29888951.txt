  Endocrine-disrupting compounds ( EDCs) are a broad class of chemicals present in many residential products that can disrupt hormone signaling and cause health problems in humans. Multigenerational cohorts , like the Michigan polybrominated biphenyl registry , are ideal for studying the effects of intergenerational exposure. Registry participants report hormone-related health problems , particularly in those exposed before puberty or those in the second generation exposed through placental transfer or breastfeeding. However , more research is needed to determine how EDCs cause health problems and the mechanisms underlying intergenerational exposure. Utilizing existing data in this registry , along with genetic and epigenetic approaches , could provide insight to how EDCs cause human<disease> disease<disease> and help to determine the risk to exposed populations and future generations.
