  Hyperglycemia occurs frequently in hospitalized patients with stroke and peripheral vascular disease ( PVD). Guidelines for inpatient glycemic management are not well established for this patient population. We will review the clinical impact of hyperglycemia in this acute setting and review the evidence for glycemic control. Hyperglycemia in acute stroke is associated with poor short and long-term outcomes , and perioperative hyperglycemia in those undergoing revascularization for PVD is linked to increased post-surgical complications. Studies evaluating tight glucose control do not demonstrate improvement in clinical outcomes , although the risk for hypoglycemia increases substantially. Additional studies are needed to evaluate tight glucose goals relative to our current standard of care and the role of permissive hyperglycemia. Given the limited data to guide glycemic management in these patient populations , it is recommended that general guidelines for inpatient glycemic control be followed. Special considerations should be made to address factors that may impact glucose management , including neurological deficits and clinical changes that occur in the postoperative state.
