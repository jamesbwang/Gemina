  In the United States , young adults have the highest prevalence of tobacco use. The dissemination of mobile phone text messages is a growing strategy for tobacco risk communication among young adults. However , little has been done concerning the design and validation of such text messages. The Texas Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science ( Texas-TCORS) has developed a library of messages based on framing ( gain- or loss-framed) , depth ( simple or complex) and appeal ( emotional or rational). This study validated the library based on depth and appeal , identified text messages that may need improvement , and explored new themes. The library formed the study sample ( N = 976 messages). The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC) software of 2015 was used to code for word count , word length and frequency of emotional and cognitive words. Analyses of variance , logistic regression and scatter plots were conducted for validation. In all , 874 messages agreed with LIWC-coding. Several messages did not agree with LIWC. Ten messages designed to be complex indicated simplicity , while 51 messages designed to be rational exhibited no cognitive words. New relevant themes were identified , such as health ( e.g. ` diagnosis ' , ` cancer ') , death ( e.g. ` dead ' , ` lethal ') and social connotations ( e.g. ` parents ' , ` friends '). Nicotine and tobacco researchers can safely use , for young adults , messages from the Texas-TCORS library to convey information in the intended style. Future work may expand upon the new themes. Findings will be utilized to develop new campaigns , so that risks of nicotine and tobacco products can be widely disseminated.
