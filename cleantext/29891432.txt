  Patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) experience a range of non-motor symptoms , including constipation<symptom> and other gastrointestinal problems. These symptoms are sometimes present in the prodromal disease phase. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is needed considering that PD has been hypothesized to originate in the gut. Delayed gastric emptying time ( GET) is often listed as a prevalent gastrointestinal symptom in PD , but the true prevalence is controversial. The aim of this short review was to investigate if GET in PD is dependent on the applied measuring methodology. A systemic search of Pubmed identified 15 relevant studies , including six using gold standard method gastric scintigraphy and nine using
