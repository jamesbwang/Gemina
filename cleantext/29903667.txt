  To analyse STOPP/START criteria found most frequently in the studies carried out in Spain , in order to identify the main areas of potentially inappropriate prescribing. A literature review was carried out on the original studies performed in Spain that applied the original version of the STOPP/START criteria and that described the most common STOPP and/or START criteria found. In each study , a weighted analysis was performed on the criteria found , by assigning 5 points to the criterion in first position , 4 points to the criterion in second position , and so on to fifth criterion. The total points of each analysed criterion were then obtained. A total of 19 original studies analysing STOPP criteria were selected , 14 of them also studying all START criteria. From the total of studies , 11 were developed in out-of-hospital care , and 8 in hospital care. The STOPP criterion with the highest weighted assessment was B7 ( long-term , long-acting benzodiazepines) , followed by J ( any duplicate drug class prescription). The START criterion with the highest weighted assessment was F4 ( statin therapy in diabetes mellitus if coexisting major cardiovascular risk factors present) , followed by E3 ( calcium and vitamin D supplement in patients with known osteoporosis: previous fragility fracture , acquired dorsal kyphosis). The most common areas of potentially inappropriate prescribing are well defined , and suggest a particular intervention in some specific therapeutic points.
