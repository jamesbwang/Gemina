  When we explore a static visual scene , our eyes move in a sequence of fast eye movements<symptom> called saccades , which are separated by fixation periods of relative eye stability. Based on uncertain sensory and cognitive inputs , the oculomotor system must decide , at every moment , whether to initiate a saccade or to remain in the fixation state. Even when we attempt to maintain our gaze on a small spot , small saccades , called microsaccades , intrude on fixation once or twice per second. Because microsaccades occur at the boundary of the decision to maintain fixation versus starting a saccade , they offer a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that control saccadic triggering. Abnormal saccadic intrusions can occur during attempted fixation in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. We have implemented a model of the triggering mechanism of saccades , based on known anatomy and physiology , that successfully simulates the generation of saccades of any size-including microsaccades in healthy observers , and the saccadic intrusions that interrupt attempted fixation in parkinsonian patients. The model suggests that noisy neuronal activity in the superior colliculus controls the state of a mutually inhibitory network in the brain stem formed by burst neurons and omnipause neurons. When the neuronal activity is centered at the rostral pole , the system remains at a state of fixation. When activity is perturbed away from this center , a saccade is triggered. This perturbation can be produced either by the intent to move one 's gaze or by random fluctuations in activity.
