  A quasi-one-dimensional system of repelling particles undergoes a configurational phase transition when the transverse confining potential decreases. Below a threshold , it becomes energetically favorable for the system to adopt one of two staggered raw patterns , symmetric with respect to the system axis. This transition is a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation for short range interactions. As a consequence , the homogeneous zigzag pattern is unstable in a finite zigzag amplitude range ( h _ ( C1) , h _ ( C2)). We exhibit strong qualitative effects of the subcriticality on the thermal motions of the particles. When the zigzag amplitude is close enough to the limits h _ ( C1) and h _ ( C2) , a transverse vibrational soft mode occurs which induces a strongly subdiffusive behavior of the transverse fluctuations , similar to single-file diffusion. On the contrary , the longitudinal fluctuations are enhanced , with a diffusion coefficient which is more than doubled. Conversely , a simple measurement of the thermal fluctuations allows a precise determination of the bifurcation thresholds.
