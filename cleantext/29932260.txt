  An intermolecular oxidative dearomatization of β-naphthols with N-hydroxycarbamates promoted by visible light was realized by means of photogenerated β-naphthol radical cation intermediates. With a commercially available organic dye , the naphthalenones bearing a fully substituted stereogenic center were obtained with up to 92 % yield under aerobic conditions ( 26 examples). In addition , the rearrangement of C-O coupling products to C-N coupling compounds could be achieved merely in the presence of Cs
