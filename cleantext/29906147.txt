  We realize the quantum regime of a surface acoustic wave ( SAW) resonator by demonstrating vacuum Rabi mode splitting due to interaction with a superconducting artificial atom. Reaching the quantum regime is physically difficult and technologically challenging since SAW devices consist of large arrays of narrow metal strips. This work paves the way for realizing analogues of quantum optical phenomena with phonons and can be useful in on-chip quantum electronics.
