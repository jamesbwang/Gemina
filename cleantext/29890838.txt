  Background Aortic cusp extension is a subjective and operator-dependent technique. In order to facilitate surgical correction of aortic cusp retraction and reestablishment of adequate cusp coaptation , we sought to develop new templates that can be used to cut flat pericardial sheets into precise cusp extension patches. Methods Each template was designed as a two-dimensional unwrap of the natural geometry of a complete aortic cusp , and a series of templates were made available to correspond with all potential aortic cusp sizes. Based on these templates , aortic cusp extension was performed in 2 patients ( aged 54 and 43 years) with significant retraction of the noncoronary aortic cusps and severe aortic valve insufficiency. In each patient , extension of the retracted native noncoronary cusp was undertaken using a bovine pericardial patch that matched the size of adjacent nondiseased native aortic cusps. Results Achieving geometrically perfect aortic cusp extensions was uncomplicated , and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed satisfactory aortic valve repairs ( aortic insufficiency < 1 + and low transvalvular gradients). Early follow-up transthoracic echocardiography confirmed that all valve cusps met at similar heights in the aortic root , and that their excursions were virtually identical. Conclusions The newly designed templates can be used to cut flat pericardial sheets into exact cusp extension patches , and initial clinical experience indicates that they are useful in performing precise aortic cusp extension procedures and restoring adequate aortic valve competence.
