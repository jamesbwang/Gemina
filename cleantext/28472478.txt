  Antibody discovery has become increasingly important in almost all areas of modern medicine. Different antibody discovery approaches exist , but one that has gained increasing interest in the field of toxinology and antivenom research is phage display technology. In this review , the lifecycle of the M13 phage and the basics of phage display technology are presented together with important factors influencing the success rates of phage display experiments. Moreover , the pros and cons of different antigen display methods and the use of na&iuml;ve versus immunized phage display antibody libraries is discussed , and selected examples from the field of antivenom research are highlighted. This review thus provides in-depth knowledge on the principles and use of phage display technology with a special focus on discovery of antibodies that target animal toxins.
