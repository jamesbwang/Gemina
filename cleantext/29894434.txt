  Cosmetic tattoos such as eyeliner , brow liner , and lip liner have become increasingly popular in the United States and throughout the world. For a variety of reasons , patients frequently regret their tattoos and request their removal; however , removal is often complicated by the aesthetically sensitive location of these specialized tattoos and the fact that they often contain white metallic compounds that darken on pigment-specific laser irradiation. To review the clinical use , effectiveness , and safety of an ablative laser technique for cosmetic tattoos. A thorough literature review pertaining to laser treatment of cosmetic tattoos and a discussion of illustrative patient cases showcasing the successful use of ablative carbon dioxide ( CO2) laser to treat cosmetic tattoos is presented. Cosmetic eyeliner and lip liner tattoos were significantly improved after CO2 laser vaporization. Side effects were limited to erythema , edema<symptom> , and serosanguinous drainage. No infection , scarring , nor tattoo ink darkening was observed. Because ablative lasers do not target specific tattoo inks , they do not pose a risk of paradoxical tattoo ink darkening and , thus , can be applied successfully in the treatment of iron oxide- or titanium dioxide-containing cosmetic tattoos.
