  The antitumor effects of a novel antibody drug conjugate ( ADC) was tested against human solid tumor cell lines and against human triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) xenografts in immunosuppressed mice. The ADC targeting activated matriptase of tumor cells was synthesized by using the potent anti-tubulin toxin , monomethyl auristatin-E linked to the activated matriptase-specific monoclonal antibody ( M69) via a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide linker. This ADC was found to be cytotoxic against multiple activated matriptase-positive epithelial carcinoma cell lines
