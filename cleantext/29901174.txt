  Osteosarcoma ( OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor worldwide , primarily affecting children and adolescents. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C) is a ubiquitin ligase that is activated by its co‑activator Cdc20 during the metaphase‑anaphase transition. Apcin is a novel cell‑permeable molecule that blocks the interaction between APC/C and Cdc20. Cdc20 overexpression has been reported in various malignancies and plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In the present study , the antitumor properties of apcin , an inhibitor of Cdc20 , was investigated in OS cell lines. In addition , the possible molecular target by which apcin mediates cell death was explored. Apcin was demonstrated to inhibit OS cell growth and induce significant apoptosis. The invasion and mobile abilities of OS cells were also markedly suppressed by apcin treatment. Furthermore , Bim and p21 were upregulated in OS cells following apcin treatment. The results of the present study indicated that apcin may have therapeutic potential as a treatment for OS and that Cdc20 may be a promising molecular target for chemotherapy.
