  Nowadays , the use of computed tomography ( CT) as a diagnostic tool has been considerably increased. Therefore , implementation of the program to conform the protection regulations on the CT scan is necessary to reduce the detrimental effects of radiation. This study was performed to measure weighted CT dose index ( CTDI In this study , the patient dose was determined in routine CT protocols. The CT scanner used in this study was a single-slice Toshiba model. Scan parameters for each protocol were registered for 10 standard sized patients and then by applying it to the CT system , CTDI The mean values of CTDI Using lower milli Amperes and higher kilo voltage peak as well as minimizing scan area and number of slices should be considered for more reduction in patients ' dose.
