  Uveal melanoma ( UM) is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults , and it carries a high risk of metastasis and mortality. Various proinflammatory cytokines have been found to be significantly increased in the aqueous humor or vitreous fluid of UM patients; however , the role of these cytokines in UM metastasis remains elusive. In the present study , we found that long-term interleukin ( IL) -6 exposure promoted the migration and invasion of UM cells , diminished cell-cell adhesion , and enhanced focal adhesion. Moreover , IL-6 treatment decreased the membranous epithelial marker TJP1 and increased the cytoplasmic mesenchymal marker Vimentin. Further investigation demonstrated that JunB played a critical role in IL-6-induced UM epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT). In UM cells , the expression of JunB was significantly up-regulated during the IL-6-driven EMT process. Additionally , JunB induction occurred at the transcriptional level in a manner dependent on phosphorylated STAT3 , during which activated STAT3 directly bound to the JunB promoter. Importantly , the knockdown of STAT3 prevented the IL-6-induced EMT phenotype as well as cell migration and invasion , whereas JunB overexpression recovered the attenuated aggressiveness of UM cells. Similarly , with IL-6 stimulation , the stable overexpression of JunB strengthened the migratory and invasive capabilities of UM cells and induced the EMT-promoting factors ( Snail , Twist1 , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -2 , MMP-14 , and MMP-19). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) database indicated that JunB was positively correlated with IL-6 and STAT3 in UM tissues. The present study proposes an IL-6/ STAT3/JunB axis leading to UM aggressiveness by EMT , which illustrates the negative side of inflammatory response in UM metastasis.
