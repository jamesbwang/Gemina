  The purpose of this analysis was to compare Aquablation to transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP) with respect to efficacy and safety at 1 year for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) in the United States ( U.S.) cohort from the Waterjet Ablation Therapy for Endoscopic Resection of prostate tissue ( WATER) study. WATER is a double-blinded , multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial for patients with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH. Men were randomized to TURP or Aquablation. The efficacy and safety outcomes at 1 year were evaluated for the U.S. cohort. The efficacy objective was reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS). The safety objective was the occurrence of Clavien-Dindo persistent grade 1 or grade 2 or higher operative complications. Ninety patients were randomized and treated between December 2015 and December 2016. Change in IPSS at 1 year between Aquablation and TURP was similar ( 14.5 versus 13.8 , respectively , p = 0.7117). The number of subjects experiencing persistent Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher adverse events was lower in the Aquablation group compared to the TURP group ( 20 % versus 47 % respectively , p = 0.0132). Amongst sexually active subjects , the rate of anejaculation was lower in patients treated with Aquablation than TURP ( 9 % versus 45 % , respectively , p = .0006). Surgical prostate resection using Aquablation showed improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms at 1 year comparable to TURP , but with a lower risk of adverse events and ejaculatory dysfunction.
