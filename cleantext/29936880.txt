  Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) , the most common cancer affecting young children , have been associated with long-term cognitive impairments that reduce quality of life. Executive dysfunction is one of the most consistently observed deficits and can have substantial and pervasive effects on academic success , occupational achievement , psychosocial function and psychiatric status. We examined the neural mechanisms of executive dysfunction by measuring structural and functional connectomes in 161 long-term survivors of pediatric ALL age 8-21 years who were treated on a single contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol for standard/high or low risk disease. Lower global efficiency , a measure of information exchange and network integration , of both structural and functional connectomes was found in survivors with executive dysfunction compared to those without dysfunction ( p < 0.046). Patients with standard/high versus low risk disease and those who received greater number of intrathecal treatments containing methotrexate had the lowest network efficiencies. Patients with executive dysfunction also showed hyper-connectivity in sensorimotor , visual and auditory processing regions ( p = 0.037) and poor separation between sensorimotor , executive/attention , salience and default mode networks ( p < 0.0001). Connectome disruption was consistent with a pattern of delayed neurodevelopment that may be associated with reduced resilience , adaptability and flexibility of the brain network. These findings highlight the need for interventions that will prevent or manage cognitive impairment in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic
