  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been shown to exert essential roles in development and progression of tumors. Here we discovered a novel lncRNA , RAB11B antisense RNA ( RAB11B-AS1) , which is markedly down-regulated in human osteosarcoma ( OS) and associated with OS metastasis and poor prognosis. We find that reduction of RAB11B-AS1 significantly facilitates proliferation , migration and invasiveness and prevents apoptosis of OS cells and results in lower sensitivity to cisplatin in these cells. In contrast , up-regulation of RAB11B-AS1 suppresses the aggressive<symptom> behaviors<symptom> of OS cells. Mechanistically , down-regulation of RAB11B-AS1 elevates its sense-cognate gene RAB11B expression at both mRNA and protein levels. RAB11B-AS1 expression correlates negatively with RAB11B expression in OS tissues. Luciferase reporter assay illuminated that RAB11B-AS1 regulates RAB11B expression through antisense pairing. Most importantly , all the effects of RAB11B-AS1 were abrogated by RAB11B down-regulation. Thus our findings revealed that lnc-RAB11B-AS1 prevents osteosarcoma development and progression via inhibiting RAB11B expression , indicating lnc-RAB11B-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.
