  The current study aimed to evaluate the negative allelopathic effect of Eucalyptus citriodora essential oil on some of the most noxious weeds in Algeria ( Sinapis arvensis , Sonchus oleraceus , Xanthium strumarium<pathogen> and Avena fatua). Gas chromatography-flame ionization detector ( GC-FID) and GC/mass spectrometry ( MS) were used to define the chemical composition of the oil. Citronellal ( 64.7 %) and citronellol ( 10.9 %) were the major essential oil compounds. Three concentrations of the oil were used for laboratory ( 0.01 , 0.02 and 0.03 %) and greenhouse ( 1 , 2 and 3 %) experiments. Seed germination and seedling 's growth were drastically reduced in response to the oil concentrations where at 0.01 and 0.02 % the oil drastically affects the seed germination of the tested weeds and at 0.03 % the oil suppresses completely the germination of S. arvensis. The oil also exhibited strong allelopathic effect on the 3- 4 leaf-stage plants 1 and 6 days after treatment. A completely death of S. arvensis , S. oleraceus and A. fatua and severe injuries on X. strumarium<pathogen> appeared at 3 % of the oil. Chlorophyll content and membrane integrity were significantly affected after treatment of the plant weeds representing a severe reduction in total chlorophyll and cell membrane disruption. The study concludes that E. citriodora essential oil might has the potential use as bioherbicide and can constitute an alternative process of weed control.
