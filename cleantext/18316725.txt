  Diminished growth factor signaling improves longevity in laboratory models , while a reduction in the somatotropic axis is favorably linked to human aging and longevity. Given the conserved role of this pathway on lifespan , therapeutic strategies , such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R) monoclonal antibodies ( mAb) , represent a promising translational tool to target human aging. To this end , we performed a preclinical study in 18-mo-old male and female mice treated with vehicle or an IGF-1R mAb ( L2-Cmu , Amgen Inc) , and determined effects on aging outcomes. Here we show that L2-Cmu preferentially improves female healthspan and increases median lifespan by 9 % ( P = 0.03) in females , along with a reduction in neoplasms and inflammation<symptom> ( P â‰¤ 0.05). Thus , consistent with other models , targeting IGF-1R signaling appears to be most beneficial to females. Importantly , these effects could be achieved at advanced ages , suggesting that IGF-1R mAbs could represent a promising therapeutic candidate to delay aging.
