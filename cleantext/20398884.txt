  Mutations in C2orf71 are causative for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and occasionally cone-rod dystrophy. We have recently discovered that the protein encoded by this gene is important for modulation of the ciliary membrane through the recruitment of an actin assembly module , and have therefore renamed the gene to PCARE ( photoreceptor cilium actin regulator). Here , we report on the identification of two copies of the c2orf71/pcare gene in zebrafish , pcare1 and pcare2. To study the role of the gene most similar to human PCARE , pcare1 , we have generated a stable pcare1 mutant zebrafish model ( designated pcare1
