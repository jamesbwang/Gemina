  In the cardiomyocyte , CaMKII has been identified as a nodal influencer of excitation-contraction and also excitation-transcription coupling. Its activity can be regulated in response to changes in intracellular calcium content as well as after several post-translational modifications. Some of the effects mediated by CaMKII may be considered adaptive , while effects of sustained CaMKII activity may turn into the opposite and are detrimental to cardiac integrity and function. As such , CaMKII has long been noted as a promising target for pharmacological inhibition , but the ubiquitous nature of CaMKII has made it difficult to target CaMKII specifically where it is detrimental. In this review , we provide a brief overview of the physiological and pathophysiological properties of CaMKII signaling , but we focus on the physiological and adaptive functions of CaMKII. Furthermore , special consideration is given to the emerging role of CaMKII as a mediator of inflammatory processes in the heart.
