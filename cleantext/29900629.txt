  Granular cell tumor is a rare condition that occasionally affects breast parenchyma: approximately , 5 % -15 % of all granular cell tumors represent 1:1000 of breast tumors. In this study , we reported a consecutive series of 12 patients with primary granular cell tumor of the breast observed at our institute , focusing attention on preoperative management , surgical approach , and long-term follow-up. Eight cases ( 8/12; 66.78 %) presented with left-breast tumors; in the majority of patients ( 11/12; 91.7 %) , the lesion<symptom> was identified in one of the upper quadrants. Specifically , upper intern quadrants ( 10 cases) were more affected. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Mean diameter at pathologic section was 11.4 mm ( range: 5-22). Tumor relapse was reported only in one case ( 8.3 %). Mean follow-up was 98.1 months ( range: 1-192). We proposed a model to explain the molecular mechanism of granular cell tumorigenesis associating to the high level of S100 protein. Management of primary granular cell tumor of the breast requires a correct initial diagnosis using breast imaging associated with core biopsy. Surgical procedure with wide resection or quadrantectomy requires a careful evaluation of breast margins.
