  Initial studies have found some evidence for transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP-43) abnormalities after traumatic brain injury ( TBI) , and the presence of protein inclusions<disease> consisting of TDP-43 are a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a condition associated with TBI. However , no study has characterized changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation , mislocalization , and fragmentation ( i.e. , abnormalities linked to hallmark TDP-43 pathology) after TBI , and how these relate to functional outcomes. Furthermore , how TBI affects an individual with a known predisposition to TDP-43 pathology is unknown. Therefore , this study examined the effects of TBI on TDP-43 post-translational processing , localization and behavioral outcomes in wild-type ( WT) mice and mutant TDP-43A315T mice ( i.e. , mice predisposed to TDP-43 pathology) at 24h and one week after TBI. Post-mortem brain tissue from human acute TBI patients was also examined. Western blots found that WT mice given TBI had increased TDP-43 phosphorylation , mislocalization , and fragmentation compared to sham-injured WT mice. The TDP-43A315T mice given a TBI had exacerbated TDP-43 abnormalities , worse cell death , and cognitive deficits compared to all other groups. In the human TBI patients , the only significant finding was increased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 fragments. The discrepancy between the robust mouse findings and the largely non-significant human findings may be due to factors including heterogeneity in clinical TBI , the small group sizes , and temporal complexities with TDP-43 abnormalities. These findings indicate that TBI can induce a number of TDP-43 abnormalities that may contribute to the neurological consequences of TBI , though further research is still needed.
