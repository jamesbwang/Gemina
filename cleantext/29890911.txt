  To compare the outcomes of contracture release by arthroscopic versus open surgical approach in patients with external snapping hip ( ESH) caused by gluteal muscle contracture ( GMC). Medical records of patients with ESH due to GMC who underwent open surgery ( n = 44) or arthroscopic surgery ( n = 48) between October 2008 and October 2014 were reviewed. Patients were followed up at 1 , 3 , 12 , and 24 months postoperatively. Operation time , incision length , postoperative pain , postoperative complication rate , and recurrence rate were compared between the 2 groups. Hip adduction , and Harris Hip Scores ( HHS) at 1 and 2 years postoperatively were compared between the groups and with preoperative data. Mean operation time did not differ between the 2 groups ( p > 0.05). The arthroscopic surgery group had smaller incisions ( p < 0.05) , less postoperative pain ( p < 0.05) , lower complication rates ( p < 0.05) than did the open surgery group. The recurrence rates were similar for the 2 groups ( p > 0.05). Hip adduction , and HHS 1 year and 2 years postoperatively were significantly better postoperatively than they had been preoperatively for both groups ( all p < 0.01) , and were similar for the 2 groups ( all p > 0.05). Arthroscopic release of contracture tissue is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of ESH caused by GMC , with the advantages of small scars , less postoperative pain , fewer complications compared with open surgery.
