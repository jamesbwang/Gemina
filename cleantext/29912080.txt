Validity of the handheld Doppler to determine lower-limb blood flow restriction pressure for exercise protocols. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Handheld ( HH) Doppler is frequently used for determining the arterial occlusion pressure during blood flow restriction exercises; however , it is unknown whether the blood flow is occluded when the auscultatory signal is no longer present. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity between the HH Doppler and the Doppler ultrasound ( US) measurements for determining the arterial occlusion pressure in healthy men. Thirty-five participants underwent 2 arterial occlusion pressure measurements. In the first measure , a pressure cuff ( 17.5 cm wide) was placed at the most proximal region of the thigh and the pulse of posterior tibial artery was detected using an HH Doppler probe. The cuff was inflated until the auscultatory pulse was no longer detected. After 10 minutes of rest , the procedure was repeated with the Doppler US probe placed on the superficial femoral artery. The cuff was inflated up to the point at which the femoral arterial blood flow was interrupted. The point at which the auscultatory pulse and blood flow were no longer detected was deemed the arterial occlusion pressure. There were no significant differences in arterial occlusion pressure level between the HH Doppler and the Doppler US ( 133 ( ± 18) vs. 135 ( ± 17) mm Hg , p = 0.168). There was a significant correlation ( r = 0.938 , p = 0.168) , reasonable agreement , and a total error of the estimate of 6.0 mm Hg between measurements. Arterial occlusion pressure level determined by the HH Doppler and the Doppler US was similar , providing evidence that the HH Doppler is a valid and practical method.
