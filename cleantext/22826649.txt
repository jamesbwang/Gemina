  The possible role of infectious and inflammatory states in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease has been a matter of debate in the literature. There are case reports of active cytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection unmasking underlying dormant systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). CMV infection has also been postulated to be associated with atherosclerosis development in the coronaries. We present a unique case where a patient with newly diagnosed SLE and acute myocardial infarction was found to have high anti-CMV titers suggesting concomitant active CMV infection. A literature review has postulated strong affiliation of CMV infection with the development of coronary artery disease , an avenue which has yet to be explored further by ongoing research.
