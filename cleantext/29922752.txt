  To evaluate the effect of cusp inclination and light-curing time on the microshear bond strength ( μSBS) between zirconia and a dual-cure self-adhesive composite cement and zirconia. Forty U-shaped specimens with angled surfaces , simulating different cusp inclinations ( 0 degrees , 20 degrees , and 30 degrees) , were fabricated from zirconia blocks ( Zenostar , Wieland). The specimens were randomly divided into two groups ( n = 20) according to different light-curing times of the adhesive composite cements ( 20 s and 40 s). Three polyethylene tubes filled with a dual-curing self-adhesive composite cement ( Multilink Speed , Ivoclar Vivadent) were bonded to the surfaces of each specimen with light-curing times of 20 s and 40 s. The μSBS was tested using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure analysis was performed. Two-way ANOVA ( cusp inclination and light-curing time) followed by two independent samples t-test were used for statistical analyses ( α = 0.05). The composite cement showed various bond strengths to angled zirconia surfaces ( 7.07 ± 1.69 to 13.91 ± 3.11 MPa). The μSBS between composite cement and 0-degree zirconia surfaces was statistically higher than that of 20- and 30-degree zirconia surfaces. The composite cement light cured for 40 s showed nonsignificantly higher μSBS than did the composite cement cured for 20 s. Adhesive failure was the most common failure mode. Cusp inclination affected bond strength between the dual-curing self-adhesive composite cement and zirconia.
