  Pulmonary emphysema usually arises in cigarette smokers , and often progresses after smoking cessation and even in ex-smokers. Lung-epithelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1) , an immunoglobulin superfamily member , is extracellularly shed to produce a proapoptotic C-terminal fragment ( CTF) within the cell and contribute to the development of emphysema. Here , we made an ex-smoker model using C57BL/6 mice; mice ( 6-week-old; 5 mice per group) were exposed to passive smoke of eight cigarettes twice a day 5 days a week until 18 weeks of age , and were then left untreated until 30 weeks of age. We calculated the mean linear intercept ( Lm) and the alveolar septal thickness in the lung histologic sections to estimate the alveolar space dilatation. At 18 weeks of age , Lm was marginally enlarged (
