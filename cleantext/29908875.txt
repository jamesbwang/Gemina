  The Adult<disease> Exceptional Aesthetic Referral Protocol ( AEARP) encompasses a series of aesthetic procedures which , as they do not treat an underlying disease process , are not routinely available within the National Health Service. Provision of these services can only be provided on an exceptional basis. In this prospective study , we evaluated the referral process and outcomes of 1122 patients referred under the AEARP over a 3.5-year period. Referrals were screened by a vetting panel comprising of a plastic surgeon , clinical nurse specialist , and clinical psychologist. Following initial vetting , supported patients underwent psychological assessment. Patients supported by psychology were assessed in clinic , and if deemed clinically suitable , were offered surgery. Overall , 20 % ( 225/1122) of referrals were supported for surgery. Following primary vetting , 57 % ( 640/1 ,122) of referrals were supported , 40 % ( 197/492) of referrals to clinical psychology were supported , and 65 % ( 225/345) of the remaining cases referred for consultation were supported for surgery. Unsupported referrals included those not fulfilling the referral guidelines or those with contraindications. The AEARP is simple and effective to implement , and has been instrumental in streamlining the referral-to-outcome process in a centralised , transparent , and fair manner. It reduces a potential high number of clinic appointments where patients do not meet the aesthetic criteria and/or fail to attend- thereby helping to streamline other surgical pathways by improving clinic efficiency. Moreover , it aids referring clinicians and patient education around aesthetic issues including a holistic approach. Wide adoption of such standards may reduce waiting times , facilitate cost savings , and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
