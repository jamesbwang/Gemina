  The non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve ( NRLN) represents a risk factor for nerve injury during thyroid surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the traveling patterns of NRLNs and its relationships to inferior thyroid arteries ( ITAs). We had 11 patients showing NRLNs on the right side who underwent thyroidectomies. The NRLNs were classified into four different types , according to the traveling patterns. We evaluated the anatomical position of the ITA as follows: ( 1) three types according to the joint location with the thyroid gland; and ( 2) three types according to the level of the retro-esophageal subclavian artery ( RSA<pathogen>). The traveling patterns of NRLN could be classified into four types , descending , vertical , ascending , and V-shaped. ITA was joined variably with the thyroid gland on the superior , middle , and inferior positions. The levels of the RSA<pathogen> were also located at different positions , the first thoracic vertebra , the second vertebra , and the third vertebra. During thyroid surgery , the surgeon must be aware of the existence of anatomical variations of NRLNs and ITAs. The anatomy of the NRLN and the ITA are frequently irregular , and there is no correlation between the traveling pattern of NRLN and the level of the
