  The `` FinFET '' design for transistors , developed at the University of California , Berkeley , in the 1990s , represented a major leap forward in the semiconductor industry. Understanding its origins and importance requires deep knowledge of local factors , such as the relationships among the lab 's principal investigators , students , staff , and the institution. It also requires understanding this lab within the broader network of relationships that comprise the semiconductor industry-a much more difficult task using traditional historical methods , due to the paucity of sources on industrial research. This article is simultaneously 1) a history of an impactful technology and its social context , 2) an experiment in using data tools and visualizations as a complement to archival and oral history sources , to clarify and explore these `` big picture '' dimensions , and 3) an introduction to specific data visualization tools that we hope will be useful to historians of technology more generally.
