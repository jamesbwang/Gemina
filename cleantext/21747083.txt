  In myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is 0.6-1.0 per 100 pt-years , and the rate of recurrence after VTE is 6.0-6.5 per 100 pt-yrs. Vitamin K-antagonists ( VKA) reduces the risk of recurrence after VTE at usual sites ( i.e. , deep venous thrombosis ( DVT) of the legs and pulmonary embolism ( PE)) by 48-69 % , with a rate of recurrent thrombosis per 100 pt-yrs of 3.4-4.7 on VKA and 8.9-9.6 off VKA; VKA discontinuation produces a 2.2-fold increased risk of novel thrombotic events with respect to continuation. However , the rate of both recurrent thrombosis and major bleeding on VKA is higher in MPN patients than in non-MPN patients , and the risk-benefit balance<symptom> of long-term VKA treatment is challenging. In the absence of strong evidence , the tailored management of MPN-related VTE should operatively consider the risk categories for recurrence and bleed well established in the non-MPN setting. In summary , MPN patients with VTE are candidates for life-long VKA treatment , especially after unprovoked proximal DVT and PE. Aspirin can offer a moderate benefit in those patients who stop anticoagulation. The use of direct oral anticoagulants should be explored aiming to ameliorate the rate of bleeding.
