  Guidelines for improving maximal concentric strength through resistance training ( RT) have traditionally included large muscle-group exercises , full ranges of motion , and a load approximating 85 % of the 1-repetition maximum ( 1RM). Supramaximal eccentric training ( SME; controlled lowering of loads above the concentric 1RM) has also been shown to be effective at increasing concentric 1RM in the lower body , but concerns regarding injury risk , postexercise soreness<symptom> , and null benefit over traditional methods ( TRAD) may limit the practical utility of this approach. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SME elicits greater lower-body strength improvements than TRAD. Key inclusion criteria were regular exercise modalities typical of nonspecialized exercise facilities ( e.g. , leg press; key exclusion: isokinetic dynamometer) and at least 6 weeks of RT exposure , leading to 5 studies included in the current meta-analysis. Unbiased effect-size measures that quantify the mean difference in lower-body 1RM between SME and TRAD were extracted. Supramaximal eccentric training did not appear to be more effective than TRAD at increasing lower-body 1RM ( ( Formula: see text) = .33 , SE = .26 , z = 1.26 , 95 % CI ( -0.20 , 0.79) , p = .20 , I The selection of SME over TRAD in RT programs designed to increase lower-body 1RM does not appear warranted in all populations. Further research should clarify the merit of periodic SME in TRAD-dominant RT programs as well as whether a differential effect exists in trained individuals.
