  We compared the sample volume of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and biopsy ( EUS-FNAB) specimens obtained by 22-gauge ( 22G) and 25-gauge ( 25G) needles , and the accuracy rate.This was a retrospective study in a single tertiary referral center. We investigated 153 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) who underwent diagnostic EUS-FNAB before neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy between October 2006 and November 2015. We performed immunohistochemical ( IHC) analysis of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 using the remnant cell blocks following pathological PDAC diagnosis. We compared the sampling rate , accuracy rate , and success rate of IHC analysis between 22G and 25G. There were 70 patients in the 22G group and 83 patients in the 25G group. The overall sampling rates on cytology and histology were 100 % and 98.0 % , respectively. The sampling rate did not differ between the 22G and 25G groups. The overall diagnostic accuracy rates on cytology and histology were 94.8 % and 79.7 % , respectively. The accuracy rates of 22G and 25G groups on cytology were 94.3 % and 95.2 % , respectively , whereas those on histology were 80.0 % and 79.5 % , respectively. The diagnostic accuracy on cytology and histology did not differ significantly between the 22G and 25G groups. Of 153 histology specimens , 69.3 % of those with PDAC provided sufficient samples for IHC analysis. The success rate of IHC analysis did not differ significantly between the 22G ( 67.1 %) and 25G ( 71.1 %) groups ( P = .60). Both 22G and 25G provided a high diagnostic yield with equivalent accuracy rates on histology. EUS-FNAB specimens obtained using 22G or 25G can be equally adequate for IHC analysis and may be suitable for diagnostic examination. Further investigations such as EUS-FNAB needle design and novel cell block preparation are needed to obtain adequate samples for use in `` precision medicine. ''
