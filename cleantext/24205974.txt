  Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4) inhibitors are attractive agents to be used in the elderly patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) because of their beneficial effects. In this cross-sectional , observational study , we evaluated and compared the treatment satisfaction using Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( DTSQ) in two groups ( i.e. , regimens containing DPP4 inhibitors vs. other regimens). Efficacy was evaluated by assessing and comparing the glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) values and the percentage of patients who achieved the glycemic control ( HbA1c < 7 %). The adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) were also recorded and compared among two groups. A total of 115 patients participated in the study ( 42 in Group 1 and 73 in Group 2). Significantly better DTSQ scores were observed among Group 1 patients in terms of DTSQ score total ( DPP4 inhibitors seem to offer better treatment satisfaction and efficacy in geriatric T2DM patients but at the expense of increased frequency of ADRs; however , further research is warranted.
