  Elevated progesterone levels on the day of trigger negatively impact the outcome of assisted reproductive technique ( ART) treatment and forced ovarian stimulation might be a cause of progesterone elevation during ovarian stimulation. To analyze the impact of forced and prolonged stimulation on the progesterone elevation , this data analysis from the Ensure study compared hormonal stimulation with corifollitropin alpha ( CFA)- only with CFA plus recombinant ( rec) follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) after day 8 ( CFA-plus group) of ovarian stimulation. In the Ensure study , 268 patients underwent ovarian stimulation with 100 Âµg CFA and 128 patients with recombinant FSH. A total of 35 patients ( 13.1 %) from the CFA-arm received the hCG trigger after stimulation with CFA-only , 233 patients ( 86.9 %) needed additional rec FSH from day 8 onwards to meet the criteria for trigger. Progesterone levels > 0.8 ng/ml on the trigger day occurred in 90 patients ( 38.6 %) from the CFA plus FSH group and only in one patient ( 2.8 %) in the CFA-only group ( p < .001). The ongoing pregnancy rate ( OPR) was 31.4 % ( 11/35) for patients in the CFA-only group and 24.5 % ( 57/233) for patients CFA-plus group with additional recFSH after day 8 ( p = .378). This set of data demonstrates that prolongation of stimulation in combination with intense stimulation leads to a statistically significant increased incidence of progesterone elevation on the day of trigger.
