  For successful bone<disease> marrow transplantation ( BMT) , a preconditioning regime involving chemo and radiotherapy is used that results in DNA damage to both hematopoietic and stromal elements. Following radiation exposure , it is well recognized that a single wave of host-derived thymocytes reconstitutes the irradiated thymus , with donor-derived thymocytes appearing about 7 days post BMT. Our previous studies have demonstrated that , in the presence of donor hematopoietic cells lacking T lineage potential , these host-derived thymocytes are able to generate a polyclonal cohort of functionally mature peripheral T cells numerically comprising ~ 25 % of the peripheral T cell pool of euthymic mice. Importantly , we demonstrated that radioresistant CD44
