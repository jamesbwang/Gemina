  The purpose of this study is to investigate the time dependent growth of silica shells on CdTe quantum dots to get their optimum thicknesses for practical applications. The core/shell structured silica-coated CdTe quantum dots ( CdTe/SiO ₂ QDs) were synthesized by the Str&ouml;ber process , which used CdTe QDs co-stabilized by mercaptopropionic acid. The coating procedure used silane primer ( 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane) in order to make the quantum dots ( QDs) surface vitreophilic. The total size of QDs was dependent on both the time of silica shell growth in the presence of sodium silicate , and on the presence of ethanol during this growth. The size of particles was monitored during the first 72 h using two principally different methods: Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS) , and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM). The data obtained by both methods were compared and reasons for differences discussed. Without ethanol precipitation , the silica shell thickness grew slowly and increased the nanoparticle total size from approximately 23 nm up to almost 30 nm ( DLS data) , and up to almost 60 nm ( SEM data) in three days. During the same time period but in the presence of ethanol , the size of CdTe/SiO ₂ QDs increased more significantly: up to 115 nm ( DLS data) and up to 83 nm ( SEM data). The variances occurring between silica shell thicknesses caused by different methods of silica growth , as well as by different evaluation methods , were discussed.
