  Large scale comprehensive genomic profiling ( CGP) has led to an improved understanding of oncogenic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , as well as identification of alterations that can serve as targets for potential therapeutic intervention. We sought to gain insight into age-associated variants in AML through comparison of extensive DNA and RNA-based GP results from pediatric and adult AML. Sequencing of 932 AML specimens ( 179 pediatric ( age 0-18) , 753 adult ( age â‰¥ 19)) from diagnostic , relapsed , and refractory times points was performed. Comprehensive DNA ( 405 genes) and RNA ( 265) sequencing to identify a variety of structural and short variants was performed. We found that structural variants were highly prevalent in the pediatric cohort compared to the adult cohort ( 57 % vs. 30 %;
