  Systematic reviews have described high rates of attrition in patients with HIV<pathogen> receiving antiretroviral therapy ( ART). However , migration and clinical transfer may lead to an overestimation of attrition ( death and loss to follow-up). Using a newly linked national laboratory database in South Africa , we assessed national retention in South Africa 's national HIV<pathogen> program. Patients receiving care in South Africa 's national HIV<pathogen> program are monitored through regular CD4 count and viral load testing. South Africa 's National Health Laboratory Service has maintained a database of all public-sector CD4 count and viral load results since 2004. We linked individual laboratory results to patients using probabilistic matching techniques , creating a national HIV<pathogen> cohort. Validation of our approach in comparison to a manually matched dataset showed 9.0 % undermatching and 9.5 % overmatching. We analyzed data on patients initiating ART in the public sector from April 1 , 2004 , to December 31 , 2006 , when ART initiation could be determined based on first viral load among those whose treatment followed guidelines. Attrition occurred on the date of a patient 's last observed laboratory measure , allowing patients to exit and reenter care prior to that date. All patients had 6 potential years of follow-up , with an additional 2 years to have a final laboratory measurement to be retained at 6 years. Data were censored at December 31 , 2012. We assessed ( a) national retention including all laboratory tests regardless of testing facility and ( b) initiating facility retention , where laboratory tests at other facilities were ignored. We followed 55,836 patients initiating ART between 2004 and 2006. At ART initiation , median age was 36 years ( IQR: 30-43) , median CD4 count was 150 cells/mm3 ( IQR: 81-230) , and 66.7 % were female. Six-year initiating clinic retention was 29.1 % ( 95 % CI: 28.7 % -29.5 %). After allowing for transfers , national 6-year retention was 63.3 % ( 95 % CI: 62.9 % -63.7 %). Results differed little when tightening or relaxing matching procedures. We found strong differences in retention by province , ranging from 74.2 % ( 95 % CI: 73.2 % -75.2 %) in Western Cape to 52.2 % ( 95 % CI: 50.6 % -53.7 %) in Mpumalanga at 6 years. National attrition was higher among patients initiating at lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads , and among patients initiating ART at larger facilities. The study 's main limitation is lack of perfect cohort matching , which may lead to over- or underestimation of retention. We also did not have data from KwaZulu-Natal province prior to 2010. In this study , HIV<pathogen> care retention was substantially higher when viewed from a national perspective than from a facility perspective. Our results suggest that traditional clinical cohorts underestimate retention.
