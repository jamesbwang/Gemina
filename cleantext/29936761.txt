  One of the commonly accepted merits of cohort studies ( CSs) refers to the exposure precedes outcome superior to other observational designs. We use Directed Acyclic Graphs to construct a causal graph among research populations under CSs. We notice that the substitution of research population in place of a susceptible one can be used for effect estimation. Its correctness depends on the outcome-free status of the substituted population and the performance of both screening and diagnosis regarding the outcomes under study at baseline. The temporal precedence of exposure over outcome occurs theoretically , despite the opposite happens in realities. Correct effect estimate is affected by both the suitability of population substitution and the validities of outcome identification and exclusion.
