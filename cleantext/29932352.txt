  Over the past 15 years , hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in reforms founded on performance-based financing ( PBF) in low- and middle-income countries. While evidence on its effectiveness and efficiency is still controversial , there appears to be an emerging consensus that equity has not been adequately considered. In this article , we show how PBF-type interventions in Africa have not sufficiently taken into account equity of access to care for the worst-off and their financial protection. In reviewing the history of health reforms in Africa , we show that this omission is nothing new. We suggest that strategic purchasing and PBF-type actions would benefit from being implemented in ways that promote equity and the financial protection of populations in Africa. Without such a reorientation of reforms , it will be impossible to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.
