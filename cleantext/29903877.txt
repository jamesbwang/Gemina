  Intraflagellar transport ( IFT) is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and is mediated by IFT particles containing IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. IFT-B powered by heterotrimeric kinesin-II and IFT-A powered by the dynein-2 complex are responsible for anterograde and retrograde protein trafficking , respectively. However , little is known about the molecular basis of the trafficking of these IFT particles regulated by kinesin and dynein motors<symptom>. Using the visible immunoprecipitation assay , we identified in this study a three-to-four protein interaction involving the kinesin-II trimer KIF3A-KIF3B-KAP3 and the IFT-B-connecting tetramer IFT38-IFT52-IFT57-IFT88; among the kinesin-II subunits , KIF3B contributed mainly to IFT-B binding. Furthermore , we showed that the ciliogenesis defect of
