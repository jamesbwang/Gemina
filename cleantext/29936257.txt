  BRCA1/2 variant analysis in tumor tissue could streamline the referral of patients with epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , or primary peritoneal cancer to genetic counselors and select patients who benefit most from targeted treatment. We investigated the sensitivity of BRCA1/2 variant analysis in formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissue using a combination of next-generation sequencing and copy number variant multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. After optimization using a training cohort of known BRCA1/2 mutation carriers , validation was performed in a prospective cohort ( clinical implementation of BRCA1/2 screening in ovarian tumor tissue cohort) in which screening of BRCA1/2 tumor DNA and leukocyte germline DNA was performed in parallel. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation and pedigree analysis were also performed. In the training cohort , 45 of 46 germline BRCA1/2 variants were detected ( sensitivity , 98 %). In the clinical implementation of BRCA1/2 screening on ovarian tumor tissue cohort ( n = 62) , all six germline variants were identified ( sensitivity , 100 %) , together with five somatic BRCA1/2 variants and eight cases with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation. In four BRCA1/2 variant-negative patients , surveillance or prophylactic management options were offered on the basis of positive family histories. We conclude that BRCA1/2 formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissue analysis reliably detects BRCA1/2 variants. When taking family history of BRCA1/2 variant-negative patients into account , tumor BRCA1/2 variant screening allows more efficient selection of epithelial ovarian cancer patients for genetic counseling and simultaneously selects patients who benefit most from targeted treatment.
