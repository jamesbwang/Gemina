  All messenger RNAs in eukaryotes are modified co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. They are all capped at the 5 '- end and polyadenylated at the 3 '- end. However , many mRNAs are also found to be chemically modified internally for regulation of mRNA processing , translation , stability , and to recode the message. This review will briefly summarize the structural basis for formation of the two most common modifications found at internal sites in mRNAs; methylation and deamination. The structures of the enzymes that catalyze these modifications show structural similarity to other family members within each modifying enzyme class. RNA methyltransferases , including METTL3/METTL14 responsible for N
