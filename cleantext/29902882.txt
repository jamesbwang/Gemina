  Nine alkaloids and two phenolic glycosides were isolated from EtOH extract of the whole plants of Corydalis hendersonii by various chromatographic techniques including silica gel , ODS , Sephadex LH-20 , and semi-preparative HPLC. Their structures were identified as groenlandicine ( 1) , berberine ( 2) , protopine ( 3) , cryptopine ( 4) , N-trans-feruloyloctopamine ( 5) , 3- ( 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)- N- ( 2- ( 4-hydroxyphenyl) -2-methoxyethyl) acrylamide ( 6) , N-cis-p-coumaroyloctopamine ( 7) , N-trans-p-coumaroylnoradrenline ( 8) , N-cis-feruloyloctopamine ( 9) , apocynin ( 10) , and glucoacetosyringone ( 11) by the spectroscopic data analysis and comparison with those in the literature. Among them , compounds 10 and 11 were isolated from this genus for the first time , and 1 , 2 , and 5-9 were isolated from the species for the first time. All isolates were tested for their protection for in vitro PC12 cell line and antiplatelet aggregation activity. The results showed that compounds 5 and 7 displayed protective effects at a concentration of 10 μmol · L ⁻¹ , and compound 2 showed antiplatelet aggregation activity induced by THR , ADP , and AA , and compound 3 exhibted inhibitory effect induced by THR.
