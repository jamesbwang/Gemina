  Volatile organic compounds ( VOC) are air pollutants usually found in urban and industrial areas. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an interesting technique used to degrade these compounds. Several approaches may enhance this process; some studies have shown higher VOC conversions by adding ozone to the experimental system , once ozone increases the number of reactive radicals in the reaction. In this context , this work studied the conversion of cyclohexane and toluene by heterogeneous photocatalysis in gas phase , in the presence of titanium dioxide ( TiO
