  Patients with cancer experience many stressors placing them at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) symptoms , yet little is known about factors associated with PTSD symptoms in this population. This study explored relationships among patients ' PTSD symptoms , physical and psychological symptom burden , and risk for hospital readmissions. We prospectively enrolled patients with cancer admitted for an unplanned hospitalization from August 2015-April 2017. Upon admission , we assessed patients ' PTSD symptoms ( Primary Care PTSD Screen) , as well as physical ( Edmonton Symptom Assessment System ( ESAS)) and psychological ( Patient Health Questionnaire 4 ( PHQ-4)) symptoms. We examined associations between PTSD symptoms and patients ' physical and psychological symptom burden using linear regression. We evaluated relationships between PTSD symptoms and unplanned hospital readmissions within 90-days using Cox regression. We enrolled 954 of 1,087 ( 87.8 %) patients approached , and 127 ( 13.3 %) screened positive for PTSD symptoms. The 90-day hospital readmission rate was 38.9 %. Younger age , female sex , greater comorbidities , and genitourinary cancer type were associated with higher PTSD scores. Patients ' PTSD symptoms were associated with physical symptoms ( ESAS physical: B = 3.41; P < .001) , the total symptom burden ( ESAS total: B = 5.97; P < .001) , depression<symptom> ( PHQ-4 depression<symptom> B = 0.67; P < .001) , and anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( PHQ-4 anxiety<symptom>: B = 0.71; P < .001). Patients ' PTSD symptoms were associated with a lower risk of hospital readmissions ( hazard ratio , 0.81; P = .001). A high proportion of hospitalized patients with cancer experience PTSD symptoms , which are associated with a greater physical and psychological symptom burden and a lower risk of hospital readmissions. Interventions to address patients ' PTSD symptoms are needed and should account for their physical and psychological symptom burden. Cancer 2018. Â© 2018 American Cancer Society.
