  Unplanned hospital readmissions contribute significantly to soaring national healthcare expenditures. To alleviate this burden , Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented initiatives to penalize hospitals for unplanned 30-d hospital readmissions. There is a paucity of data identifying patient risk factors independently associated with 30- and 90-d readmissions. To investigate similarities in patient risk factors associated with 30- and 90-d unplanned readmissions following elective lumbar spine surgery. The National Readmission Database ( NRD) was queried to identify patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery between 2013 and 2014. Patients were grouped by no readmission ( Non-R) , unplanned readmission within 30 days ( 30-R) , and unplanned readmission within 31 to 90 days ( 90-R). Multivariate analysis determined factors associated with 30- and 90-d readmissions. We identified 144123 patients with 10592 ( 7.3 %) patients experiencing an unplanned readmission ( 30-R: n = 7228 ( 5.0 %); 90-R: n = 3364 ( 2.3 %); Non-R: n = 133 531). The most common inpatient complication observed in those patients readmitted was dural tear ( 30-R: 7.7 % , 90-R: 4.6 % , Non-R: 4.3 %). The most prevalent 30- and 90-d complication seen among the readmitted cohort was infection ( 30-R: 18.5 % , 90-R: 7.4 %). In multivariate regression analysis , age , insurance status , chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( COPD) , depression<symptom> , hypertension , diabetes , deficiency anemia<symptom> , and obesity were independently associated with 30-d readmission; however , age and obesity were not independently associated with 90-d readmission. Our study demonstrated national unplanned readmission rates after elective spinal surgery to be 7.3 %. With age , insurance status , COPD , depression<symptom> , hypertension , diabetes , deficiency anemia<symptom> , obesity , and depression<symptom> all independently associated with unplanned hospital readmission. Future solutions that focus on reducing preventable readmissions may improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
