  Non-depolarizing magnetic fields , like low frequency-pulsed electromagnetic fields ( LF-PEMFs) have shown the ability to modulate living structures , principally by influencing synaptic activity and ion channels on cellular membranes<symptom>. Recently , the CTU Mega 20 device was presented as a molecular accelerator , using energy up to 200 J and providing high-power ( 2 Tesla) pulsating fields with a water-repulsive ( diamagnetic) action and tissue biostimulation. We tested the hypothesis that LF-PEMFs could modulate long-term corticospinal excitability in healthy brains by applying CTU Mega 20 A significant TIME Ã— TREATMENT interaction was found ( p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons showed a significant effect of TIME , with significant differences at + 0 , + 15 and + 30 min compared to baseline after real stimulation ( all p < 0.05) but not after sham stimulation ( all p < 0.05) and significant effects of TREATMENT , with significant differences at + 0 , + 15 and + 30 min for real stimulation compared to sham stimulation ( all p < 0.005). No significant depolarizing effects were detected throughout the ( real) stimulation. Our proof-of-concept study in healthy subjects supports the idea that non-ionizing LF-PEMFs induced by the CTU Mega 20 diamagnetic acceleration system could represent a new approach for brain neuromodulation. Further studies to optimize protocol parameters for different neurological and psychiatric conditions are warranted.
