  X-ray images exposed in neutral position and radiocarpally centred are essential in imaging of the distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ). The anatomic orientation of the DRUJ is favourable for acquiring transaxial scans to display its anatomy , subtle derangements , osteoarthritis and intra-articular fractures free from superpositions. The triangular fibrocartilage complex ( TFCC) is the most important stabilizer of the DRUJ. Provided that a focused clinical indication is given , high-resolution images are acquired , and an intra-venous or intra-articular contrast-agent is applied , all TFCC structures and destabilizing lesions<symptom> can be displayed with the use of CT and MRI.
