  The primary objective is to assess whether the POC assays to measure infliximab residual trough level in the serum of IBD patients were non-inferior to the ELISA techniques available on the market , and to determine which of them was the most robust. The second is to compare three different ELISA kits for monitoring anti-infliximab antibodies ( ATI). The assays were carried out on patients ' sera using four ELISA kits from four different suppliers ( three with a monoclonal antibody and one polyclonal) and two rapid techniques provided by BÜHLMANN ( Quantum Blue We measured infliximab residual level and ATI in the serum of 90 IBD patients ( 85 treated with infliximab and five with adalimumab). All of the infliximab assays were very well correlated when analyzed with Spearman nonparametric correlation ( 0.93 ≤ r ≤ 0.99) , and the two POC assays were also excellently correlated ( r = 0.98). The ATI monitoring kits revealed a correlation ranging from 0.73 to 0.96 when comparing positive and negative patients. When normalizing the quantitative values between the different ELISA tests ( expressed arbitrarily by using multiples of the positivity limits defined by each supplier) , the Spearman r coefficient ranged from 0.81 to 0.93. The available evidence allows us to conclude that all of the infliximab monitoring assays correlate well and may be used for IFX monitoring; albeit variations in measured IFX concentration among different assays remain present , these assays could be interchangeable. The ATI monitoring techniques are all capable of detecting ATI-positive patients , but because of the difference in the positivity limits and the measurement units , it is better to follow a patient rate with one definite kit.
