  Vaccination against paratuberculosis ( PTB) in goats is a cost-effective control strategy , and is also effective as regards preventing the onset of clinical cases. However , it causes interference in the diagnostic tests used in the control of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). A group of 99 goats from a herd with no history of TB or PTB infection was vaccinated against PTB at seven months of age. They then underwent consecutive intradermal tests ( single ( SIT) and comparative ( CIT) intradermal tuberculin tests) , interferon-gamma release assays ( IGRA) and two serological tests ( p22_CE and DR-ELISA) every three months , until the interference disappeared. When using the SIT test , a variable number of positive reactors were observed at 3 months ( T3; 32.3 % , 95 % CI 23.9-42.1) , 6 months ( T6; 11.5 % , 95 % CI 6.5-19.4) , 9 months ( T9; 6.4 % , 95 % CI 3.0-13.2) and 12 months ( T12; 0 % , 95 % CI 0-4.0) post-vaccination. In contrast , the CIT test had a specificity ( Sp) of 100 % ( 95 % , CI 96.0-100 , regardless of the time post-vaccination. The IGRA also obtained high Sp values throughout the study period. No significant interference in the serological tests was recorded at T3 ( p22_CE , Sp = 96 % ( 95 % CI 90.1-98.4) and DR-ELISA , Sp = 98 % ( 95 % CI 92.9-99.4)) , although an increase in antibody titers was observed in the following herd testing events. In conclusion , the use of the SIT test causes the onset of false-positive reactors if applied before 12 months post-vaccination in a TB-free/PTB-vaccinated herd. Nevertheless , the CIT test and IGRA obtained high Sp values under these epidemiological circumstances. The serological tests were also highly specific in the case of PTB-vaccinated goats , although their Sp decreased significantly after several intradermal tests.
