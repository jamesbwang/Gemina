  Copy number alterations in programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PDL1 or CD274) , programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 ( PDCD1LG2 or PDL2) , and Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2) genes ( chromosome 9p24 .1) characterize Hodgkin lymphoma , resulting in high response rates to programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1)/ programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) blockade. The prevalence and utility of PDL1 amplification as a response biomarker to PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade are unknown in other tumors. To examine the prevalence of PDL1 amplification and its utility as a response biomarker to PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade in solid tumors. This retrospective study ( October 1 , 2012 , to October 1 , 2017) used a deidentified tumor database from a commercial company and annotated clinical records from a subset of patients treated at a university tertiary referral center. The study analyzed 118187 tumors from the deidentified database , including a clinically annotated subgroup of 2039 malignant tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on all samples to determine PDL1 amplification , microsatellite instability , and tumor mutational burden ( TMB). A subset of patients was treated with PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade. The prevalence of PDL1 amplification was determined among 118187 patient samples that underwent next-generation sequencing. Solid tumors treated with checkpoint blockade were evaluated for response and progression-free survival ( PFS). Of the 118187 deidentified tumor samples , PDL1 amplifications were identified in 843 ( 0.7 %) , including more than 100 types of solid tumors. Most PDL1-amplified tumors ( 84.8 %) had a low to intermediate TMB. PDL1 amplification did not always correlate with high-positive PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemical analysis. Six of 9 patients ( 66.7 %) from 1 center with PDL1-amplified solid tumors had objective responses after checkpoint blockade administration. The median PFS among all treated patients was 15.2 months. Responders included 1 patient with glioblastoma ( PFS , ≥ 5.2 months) , 2 patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer ( PFS , ≥ 9 and 15.2 months) , 2 patients with metastatic basal cell cancer ( PFS , 3.8 and ≥ 24.1 months) , and 1 patient with urothelial cancer ( PFS , ≥ 17.8 months). The results of this study suggest that PDL1 amplification occurs in a small subset of malignant tumors. Additional large-scale , prospective studies of PDL1-amplified cancers are warranted to confirm the responses to checkpoint blockade described herein , even in the absence of microsatellite instability , high PD-L1 expression , and a high TMB.
