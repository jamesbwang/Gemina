  Microalgae is a promising biomass source for renewable fuels and chemicals production. To describe microalgal behavior and improve their cultivation , various kinetic models have been proposed. However , previous works have focused on biomass formation and lipids production only , even though carbohydrates and proteins are also important products , not only for understanding the metabolic behavior of microalgae but also for enhancing the economic viability through value-added side products. In this study , a new mathematical model is proposed to explain core biological mechanisms of growth and macromolecules syntheses based on the central metabolism of carbon and nitrogen. In the model , microalgal growth is separated as hyperplasia<disease> and hypertrophy , to describe the cell growth more precisely under nutrient-replete and- deplete conditions. Sensitivity analysis performed using the model indicates that cell state ( e.g. , cell death rate) has a strong effect on the lipid production explaining the difficulty of reproducing a microalgae culture experiment.
