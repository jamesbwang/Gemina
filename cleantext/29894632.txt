  Spectra simulation based on quantum mechanical calculations is often an ultimate tool bringing decisive answers to spectroscopic problems , but in the case of NIR spectroscopy , such studies still remain very rare , particularly those on rather complicated molecules. In the present work we have employed fully anharmonic spectra simulation for saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids ( arachidic acid , palmitic acid , stearic acid , linoleic acid , linolenic acid , and oleic acid). The spectral features corresponding to the saturation of fatty acid were accurately reproduced by deperturbed vibrational second-order perturbation theory ( DVPT2) throughout a wide NIR region ( 8000-4000 cm
