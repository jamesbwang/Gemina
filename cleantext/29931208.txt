  To determine the socio-economic risk factors for pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( PTB) in the Saharia tribal community in Madhya Pradesh , Central India. PTB cases detected during the year 2013-14 through a community active TB prevalence survey in the Shivpuri district , Madhya Pradesh were included in the study. For each case , three controls were selected randomly among the non-cases from the same village and the data on socio-economic risk factors were collected. Using logistic regression analysis , the risk factors for PTB disease were identified. A total of 220 cases and 660 controls participated in the study. Of the 13 risk factors studied , on multivariate analysis the risk of PTB was found to be significantly associated with malnutrition ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) 2.02 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.46 to 2.79)) , living in a kaccha ( built of naturally occurring materials) house ( AOR 2.72 ( 95 % CI 1.44 to 5.11)) and tobacco smoking ( mostly beedis; AOR 1.59 ( 95 % CI 1.12 to 2.18)). The findings highlight that malnutrition , poor living conditions in a Kaccha house ( built of naturally occurring materials) and tobacco smoking are the major risk factors for PTB among Saharias , which need to be studied among other tribal populations in the country. There is a need to strengthen health and nutrition programmes in this community.
