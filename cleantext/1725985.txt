  Class III mandibular resection due to surgical treatment of jaw tumor produces a discontinuity in the mandible which is severely incapacitating to the patient. It leads to a deviation and rotation of the mandible which depends on the amount of tissues resected the manner of surgical site closure , loss of proprioceptive sense of occlusion , the presence , and condition of teeth , and the time of initiation of prosthodontic therapy. These put together makes the task of prosthodontic rehabilitation quite arduous. Guide flange prosthesis is a comparatively simple and cost-effective method of restoring the esthetics and function to an acceptable level. This clinical report describes an innovative and simplified approach to impression making ( sectional two-step impression) to minimize trauma to the underlying and circumoral fragile tissues postsurgery , and to the fabrication of buccal guide flange ( wrought wire supported and reinforced guide flange) for prosthetic rehabilitation of a patient with Class III mandibular resection.
