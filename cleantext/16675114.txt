  E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Caritas B cell lymphoma ( c-cbl) is associated with negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases , signal transduction of antigens and cytokine receptors , and immune response. However , the expression and function of c-cbl in the regulation of neuropathic pain after chronic constriction injury ( CCI) are unknown. In rat CCI model , c-cbl inhibited the activation of spinal cord microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) , interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β) and interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , which alleviated mechanical and heat pain through down-regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) pathway. Additionally , exogenous TNF-α inhibited c-cbl protein level vice versa. In the primary microglia transfected with c-cbl siRNA , when treated with TNF-α or TNF-α inhibitor , the corresponding secretion of IL-1β and IL-6 did not change. In summary , CCI down-regulated c-cbl expression and induced the activation of microglia , then activated microglia released inflammatory factors via ERK signaling to cause pain. Our data might supply a novel molecular target for the therapy of CCI-induced neuropathic pain.
