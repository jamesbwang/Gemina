  New chiral FeIII4 star-shaped complexes have been synthesized starting from enantiomerically pure Schiff bases and chiroptically and magnetically characterized. The structural and magnetic properties of the complete family of 40 Fe4 complexes reported in the literature have been analyzed in the search for synthetic and magnetostructural correlations.
