  Galactosemia has not been recognized as a cause of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , although growing evidence supports this association. In a retrospective cohort study , we identified children with galactosemia due to GALT deficiency using the Danish Metabolic Laboratory Database. Among these , we identified children with extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia or symptoms of ABE. Extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was defined as maximum total serum bilirubin ( TSB We identified 21 children with galactosemia ( incidence: 1:48,000). Seven children developed extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia ( median ( range) TSB Galactosemia is a potential cause of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , ABE , and KSD. It is crucial that putative galactosemic children are treated aggressively with phototherapy to prevent ABE and KSD. Thus it is important that galactosemia is part of the work up for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
