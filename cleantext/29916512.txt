  Due to aluminum 's controversial role in neurotoxicity , the goal of chelation therapy , the removal of the toxic metal ion or attenuation of its toxicity by transforming it into less toxic compounds , has attracted considerable interest in the past years. In the present paper we present , validate and apply a state-of-the-art theoretical protocol suitable for the characterization of the interactions between a chelating agent and Al ( iii). In particular , we employ a cluster-continuum approach based on Density Functional Theory calculations to evaluate the binding affinity of aluminum for a set of two important families of aromatic chelators: salicylic acids and catechols. Our protocol shows very good qualitative agreement between the computed binding affinities and available experimental stability constants ( log β) values for 1: 1 , 1: 2 and 1: 3 complexes. Then , we have investigated the nature of the Al-O bond in an enlarged dataset of 27 complexes of 1: 1 stoichiometry , by means of the QTAIM and Energy Decomposition Analysis ( EDA). Quite interestingly , we have found that although the Al-O interaction is mainly electrostatic , there is a small but significant degree of covalency that explains the modulation of binding affinities in both families of compounds by the addition of electron donating ( CH3 , OCH3) or withdrawing ( NO2 , CF3) substituents. The role of aromaticity and the mechanisms of action of the different functional groups were also evaluated. Finally , we have analyzed the competition between Al ( iii) and proton toward the binding of these chelators , giving a rationalization of the different trends found experimentally between log β and the amount of free aluminum in solution in the presence of a given ligand ( p ( Al)). In summary , we propose a validated and comprehensive computational protocol that can provide a valuable help toward the design and tuning of new efficient aluminum chelators.
