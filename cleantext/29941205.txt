  Whilst a wealth of data indicate that infections by gastrointestinal helminths are accompanied by significant alterations in the composition of the vertebrate gut flora , little is known of the immune-molecular mechanisms that regulate host-parasite-microbiota interactions. ` Traditional ' experimental models of gastrointestinal helminthiases , in which the role ( s) of each of the components of this triad can be tested , provide an opportunity to advance research in this area. In this article , we propose the Echinostoma caproni-mouse system as a potentially useful tool for studies of the role of the host gut microbiota in preventing pathology and inducing parasite clearance via interleukin ( IL) -25 , an epithelial-derived alarmin with key roles in antihelminth immunity and maintenance of gut homeostasis.
