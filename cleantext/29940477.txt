  Tungsten ( W) interferes with molybdenum ( Mo) binding sites and has been associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease ( CVD). We evaluated if ( 1) W exposure is prospectively associated with incident CVD and ( 2) the association between urinary W levels and incident CVD is modified by urinary Mo levels. We estimated multi-adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs) for incident CVD outcomes by increasing W levels for 2726 American Indian participants in the Strong Heart Study with urinary metal levels measured at baseline ( 1989-1991) and CVD events ascertained through 2008. Increasing levels of baseline urinary W were not associated with incident CVD. Fully-adjusted HRs ( 95 % CIs) of incident CVD comparing a change in the IQR of W levels for those in the lowest and highest tertile of urinary Mo were 1.05 ( 0.90 , 1.22) and 0.80 ( 0.70 , 0.92) , respectively ( p-interaction = 0.02); for CVD mortality , the corresponding HRs were 1.05 ( 0.82 , 1.33) and 0.73 ( 0.58 , 0.93) , respectively ( p-interaction = 0.03). The association between W and CVD incidence and mortality was positive although non-significant at lower urinary Mo levels and significant and inverse at higher urinary Mo levels. Although prior cross-sectional epidemiologic studies in the general US population found positive associations between urinary tungsten and prevalent cardiovascular disease , our prospective analysis in the Strong Heart Study indicates this association may be modified by molybdenum exposure.
