  Acetabular and pelvic ring injuries in obese patients are difficult to treat. Obese patients require great attention to detail during the trauma evaluation to prevent medical and anesthetic complications in the perioperative period. Radiographic evaluation is often compromised by modalities available and loss of resolution with plain film imaging. Patient positioning must be meticulous to ensure stability on the bed while allowing access to the operative site , preventing pressure necrosis<symptom> , and minimizing ventilation pressure. Complications after surgical treatment are common and often due to infection and loss of fixation. Careful technique can mitigate but not prevent these complications.
