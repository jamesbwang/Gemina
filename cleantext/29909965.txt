  Previous studies indicate that the risk for diabetes associated with high consumption of potato differs in various populations. We aimed to investigate the associations between total , boiled and fried potato intake and the risk for incident diabetes in Tehranian adults. This cohort study was conducted in 1,981 adults , aged 19 to 70 years , who participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study and were followed up for 6 years. Usual dietary potato intakes were assessed using a valid and reliable food-frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric , biochemical and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> data were determined , and diabetes was defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The mean ( ± SD) age and potato intake of participants was 38.9 ± 13.4 years and 30.2 ± 30.7 g/day , respectively. The risk for incident diabetes in participants was 6.7 % after 6 years of follow up. After adjusting for age , sex , body mass index , physical activity , smoking , family history of diabetes , hypertension , serum triglyceride levels , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels , energy intakes and consumption of saturated fat , fruit , whole grains , vegetables , nuts and legumes , the risk for incident diabetes was lower in subjects with higher intakes of total potato ( OR = 0.46; 95 % CI 0.25 to 0.84) and boiled potato ( OR = 0.47; 95 % CI 0.26 to 0.85) in comparison with those who had the lowest intakes ( p for trend < 0.05). However , there was no significant association between fried potato intake and risk for diabetes ( OR = 0.50; 95 % CI 0.25 to 1.07; p for trend > 0.05). Our findings indicate that , in Tehranian adults , a moderate intake of dietary total and boiled , but not fried , potatoes may be associated with a lower risk for incident diabetes.
