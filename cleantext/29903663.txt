  The emergence of multidrug resistance ( MDR) is a significant challenge in breast carcinoma chemotherapy. Kokusaginine isolated from Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz. has been reported to show cytotoxicity in several human cancer cell lines including breast cancer cells MCF-7. In this study , kokusaginine showed the potent inhibitory effect on MCF-7 multidrug resistant subline MCF-7/ ADR and MDA-MB-231 multidrug resistant subline MDA-MB-231/ ADR. Kokusaginine markedly induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7/ ADR cells. Furthermore , kokusaginine reduced P-gp mRNA and protein levels , and suppressed P-gp function especially in MCF-7/ ADR cells. In addition , kokusaginine showed to inhibit tubulin assembly and the binding of colchicine to tubulin by binding directly to tubulin and affects tubulin formation in vitro. Taken together , these results support the potential therapeutic value of kokusaginine as an anti-MDR agent in chemotherapy for breast carcinoma.
