  A silica gel orthogonal method using acetonitrile: water was developed for the analyses of fractions rich in very polar steviol glycosides and resolve regions of co-elution of these compounds in reversed-phase. Additionally , we also used this normal phase analytical method to scale up the purification process of steviol glycosides. Using these approaches , one novel minor tetra-glucopyranosyl diterpene glycosides together with three known compounds were purified from a commercial Stevia rebaudiana leaf extract. Compound 1 was unambiguously elucidated as 13- ( ( 2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl) oxy) ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid- ( 6-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl) ester ( rebaudioside Y) based on high-performance liquid chromatography retention times , tandem mass spectrometry dissociation pattern and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Known compounds were isolated in gram quantities and identified as rebaudioside D , E and M.
