  Preclinical models indicate that DNA damage induces type I interferon ( IFN) , which is crucial for the induction of an anti-tumor immune response. In human cancers , however , the association between DNA damage and an immunogenic cell death ( ICD) , including the release and sensing of danger signals , the subsequent ER stress response and a functional IFN system , is less clear.
