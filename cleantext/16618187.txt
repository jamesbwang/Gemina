  Identification of surfaces at the molecular level has benefited from progress in dynamic nuclear polarization surface enhanced NMR spectroscopy ( DNP SENS). However , the technique is limited when using highly sensitive heterogeneous catalysts due to secondary reaction of surface organometallic fragments ( SOMFs) with stable radical polarization agents. Here , we observe that in non-porous silica nanoparticles ( NPs) (
