  Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration ( LCBDE) has emerged as a recommended alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP) for the management of choledocholithiasis. However , its use in the elderly has been limited , and evidence of its safety and efficacy in these patients is yet to be established. This study describes our experience of LCBDE in elderly patients , analysing the safety and efficacy of this technique in comparison to younger patients. All patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC) with LCBDE for choledocholithiasis in our unit between January 2015 and January 2017 were included. Data pertaining to patient demographics , comorbidities , investigations , operative technique and outcomes were analysed. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on age ( Group A: < 65 years vs Group B: >/ = 65 years) for comparative analysis. 124 patients ( Group A: 65 , Group B: 59) were included. Group B were more co-morbid and had a higher ASA grade than Group A. However , there was no significant difference between groups in rates of conversion to open or complications , including bile leak ( 3.1 % vs 5.1 % , p = 0.67) , retained stone ( 4.6 % vs 1.7 % , p = 0.62) , or complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification ( p = 0.78). Re-intervention rates were also similar between groups ( 7.7 % vs 3.4 % , p = 0.44 and 3.1 % vs 3.4 % , p = 1.0 respectively) , as was length of stay. Despite higher frequency of comorbidities and ASA grade , LCBDE in elderly patients is safe and effective , and has similar outcomes to younger patients. Therefore elderly patients with choledocholithiasis should be offered LCBDE as an alternative to ERCP.
