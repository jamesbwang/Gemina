  Brown/beige adipocytes dissipate energy as heat. We previously showed that brown/beige adipocytes are present in white adipose tissue ( WAT) of fattening cattle. The present study examined the effect of vitamin A restriction on mRNA expression of brown/beige adipocyte-related genes. In Japan , fattening cattle are conventionally fed a vitamin A-restricted diet to improve beef marbling. Twelve Japanese Black steers aged 10 months were fed control feed ( n = 6) or vitamin A-restricted feed ( n = 6) for 20 months. Subcutaneous<disease> WAT ( scWAT) and mesenteric WAT ( mesWAT) were collected , and mRNA expression levels of molecules related to function of brown/beige adipocytes ( Ucp1 , Cidea , Dio2 , Cox7a and Cox8b) as well as transcriptional regulators related to brown/beige adipogenesis ( Zfp516 , Nfia , Prdm16 , and Pgc-1α) were evaluated. The vitamin A restriction significantly increased or tended to increase expression levels of Cidea and Pgc-1α in scWAT , and Cidea , Dio2 , and Nfia in mesWAT. Previous studies revealed that the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) pathway was responsible for commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to brown/beige adipocyte-lineage cells. The vitamin A restriction increased expression of Bmp7 and some Bmp receptors in WAT. The interrelationship between gene expression levels indicated that expression levels of Nfia , Prdm16 , and Pgc-1α were closely related to those of genes related to function of brown/beige adipocytes in scWAT. Also , expression levels of Nfia , Prdm16 , and Pgc-1α were highly correlated with those of Alk3 in scWAT. In summary , the present results suggest that the vitamin A restriction increases the number or activity of brown/beige adipocytes through regulatory expression of transcriptional regulators to induce brown/beige adipogenesis especially in scWAT of fattening cattle , which may be governed by the Bmp pathway.
