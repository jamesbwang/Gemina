  Radioactive iodine ( RAI) treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer has been used in clinical practice for almost 60 years and is generally accepted to be a safe and efficacious treatment. Severe toxicity in the form of radiation pneumonitis<disease> , sometimes progressing to fibrosis<disease> , and bone<disease> marrow suppression are reported but remain rare. We present a case of severe myelosuppression requiring hospitalization and transfusion support in an otherwise well , young female patient who had received 175 mCi I-131 for low-volume micronodular lung disease one month prior , with a cumulative lifetime administered activity of 575 mCi. The most important risk factors for myelosuppression following RAI are the activity received , the amount of functioning thyroid tissue present , and the lifetime cumulative activity received.
