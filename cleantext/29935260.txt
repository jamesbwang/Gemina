  Altered redox homeostasis including higher levels of copper , reduced glutathione ( GSH) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in cancer cells than in normal cells illustrates their redox vulnerability , and has opened a window for developing prooxidative anticancer agents ( PAAs) to hit this status. However , how to design PAAs with high selectivity in killing cancer cells over normal cells remains a challenge. Herein we designed a 3-hydroxyflavone-inspired copper pro-ionophore ( PHF) as a potent PAA based on the GSH-mediated conversion of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonates to enols. Mechanistic investigation reveals that it is capable of exploiting increased levels of GSH in cancer cells to in situ release an active ionophore , 3-hydroxyflavone , inducing redox imbalance ( copper accumulation , GSH depletion and ROS generation) and achieving highly selective killing of cancer cells upon specific transport of small amounts of Cu ( II). To the best of our knowledge , it is the first example of Cu ( II) pro-ionophore type of PAA which hits ( changes) the three birds ( abnormal copper , GSH and ROS levels in cancer cells) with one stone ( PHF) in terms of its ability to induce preferentially redox imbalance of cancer cells by copper accumulation , GSH depletion and ROS generation.
