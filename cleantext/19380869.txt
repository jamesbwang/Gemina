  The CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been extensively associated with different types of cancer correlating with higher aggressiveness and metastasis. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) , the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is involved in the dissemination of malignant B cells and is a marker of poor prognosis. CXCR7 is a chemokine receptor that binds to the same ligand as CXCR4 and regulates de CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. These findings together with the report of CXCR7 prognostic value in several tumor types , led us to evaluate the expression of CXCR7 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma biopsies. Here , we describe that CXCR7 receptor is an independent prognostic factor that associates with good clinical outcome. Moreover , the expression of CXCR7 associates with increased survival in CXCR4 + but not in CXCR4- DLBCL patients. Thus , the combined immunohistochemical evaluation of both CXCR7 and CXCR4 expression in DLBCL biopsies may improve their prognostic value as single markers. Finally , we show that CXCR7 overexpression in vitro is able to diminish DLBCL cell survival and increase their sensitivity to antitumor drugs. Hence , further studies on the CXCR7 receptor may establish its role in DLBCL and the molecular mechanisms that modulate CXCR4 activity.
