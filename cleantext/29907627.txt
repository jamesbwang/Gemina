  The study aimed to explore the prevalence of human adenovirus-36 ( HAdV-36) infection and the association of HAdV-36 with obesity in Chinese Han population. A qualitative determination using ELISA was performed to determine by duplication of the antibodies to HAdV-36 in the serum samples. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between HAdV-36 seropositivity and obesity. The overall HAdV-36 seroprevalence was 49.8 % amongst 824 participants. The prevalence of HAdV-36 seropositive was 42.9 and 51.4 % in the obese and non-obese participants , respectively , which was not statistically significant (
