  Dhokla , a popular indigenous savoury dish of India , is prepared by soaking bengalgram dal and rice , grinding separately , mixing the batters , and spontaneously fermenting and steaming of mixed batter. Central composite rotatable response surface designs for soaking , fermentation and steaming at five-level combinations were used for optimising preparation of dhokla to achieve reduced contents of antinutrients. Optimum soaking of bengalgram dal ( dal-water ratio of 1:5 w/w , pH 7.0 , 23 °C , 20 h) and rice ( rice-water ratio of 1:5 w/w , pH 5.6 , 16 °C , 18 h) resulted in reduced levels of all the antinutrients , except total biogenic amines in rice. Fermentation of dal-rice ( 3:1 v/v) mixed batter under optimum condition ( added NaCl of 8 g/kg , 32 °C , 18 h) further reduced their levels , but total biogenic amines content was enhanced. However , optimum steaming of dal-rice mixed fermented batter for 20 min was effective in reducing all the tested antinutrients. In dhokla , the content of tannins , phytic acid and total biogenic amines reduced by 100 , 94 and 20 % , respectively; trypsin inhibitor and haemagglutinating activities reduced by 92 and 100 % , respectively , over raw ingredients. The optimally prepared product ( dhokla) ranked `` excellent '' in terms of overall sensory quality.
