  Cholecystokinin ( CCK) is known to cause lower esophageal sphincter ( LES) relaxation through the activation of inhibitory motor neurons. Recent studies show that the longitudinal muscle contraction ( LMC) related axial stretch may play a role in the LES relaxation. The aim of our study was to determine whether the CCK induced LES relaxation and identify the characteristics of associated LMC in humans. Nine healthy volunteers ( 5F , 40 + 12 years) received escalating doses of CCK-octapeptide ( 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 ng/kg). All subjects demonstrated a monophasic response to 5 ng/kg of CCK-8 that in majority it consisted of partial LES relaxation and a biphasic response to 40 ng/kg of CCK-8. The latter consisted of; 1) a period of partial relaxation followed by , 2) complete LES relaxation along with the crural diaphragm inhibition. The length of the esophagus decreased by 0.9 ± 0.4 cm , and muscle thickness ( MT) increased by 40 ± 14 % to 1.4 ± 0.2 mm ( P < 0.05) during initial partial LES relaxation. During complete LES relaxation there was greater LMC as demonstrated by esophageal shortening of 1.9 ± 0.5 cm and an increase in MT of 100 ± 16 % ( P < 0.01). The complete transient LES relaxation typically terminated with a robust after-contraction. Atropine significantly attenuated the CCK-induced esophageal LMC , prevented crural diaphragm inhibition and abolished the phase 2 complete LES relaxation. The strong temporal relationship between the LMC , LES relaxation and crural diaphragm inhibition supports our hypothesis that the LMC plays an important role in the LES relaxation.
