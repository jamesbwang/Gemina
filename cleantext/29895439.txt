  The study evaluated associations between 3-year eGFR trajectory patterns and adverse renal event in diabetic patients. Adverse renal event was defined as sustained eGFR < 60 or one ACR > 300 mg/g creatinine. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated association between eGFR trajectory patterns and adverse renal event. We detected six clusters. Cluster 1 had a stable but relatively low baseline eGFR level ( n = 823 , 20.52 %) , cluster 2 had a high baseline eGFR level , but slightly decreased afterwards ( n = 1708 , 42.59 %) , cluster 3 had an increasing eGFR during the first 15-month follow-up and then a decline rate ( n = 505 , 12.59 %) , cluster 4 decreased during the first 9-month follow-up and then remained stable ( n = 774 , 19.30 %) , cluster 5 had a sharp decline and then was elevated after 21 months until the end of follow-up ( n = 135 , 3.37 %) , and cluster 6 had an extremely fluctuating eGFR and then a sharp increase at the last 12-month period ( n = 65 , 1.62 %). Clusters 1 , 3 , and 4 show increased adverse renal risks compared with cluster 2 ( 2.24 , 1.69-2.97; 2.70 , 2.02-3.61; and 2.15 , 1.64-2.83 , respectively). Patients with sustained low-level renal function , renal decline , or increasing trend in eGFR trajectory encountered an increased CKD risk.
