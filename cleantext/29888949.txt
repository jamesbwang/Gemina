  Complex<pathogen> refractive index dispersion ( CRID) of offset inks is an important spectral property that affects the quality of printing. Due to the strong absorption of offset inks , great difficulty exists when measuring their CRID. In this study , a recently proposed apparatus that can detect the internal reflectance spectra was used to measure the CRID of three strong absorbing offset inks ( magenta , yellow , and cyan). Both anomalous dispersion curve and extinction coefficient curve were well determined over the spectral range of 400-750 nm. This study experimentally proves that the apparatus and related method are feasible for the CRID measurement of strong absorbing materials and could serve as a powerful measuring tool for optical parameters.
