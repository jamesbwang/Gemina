  Growth differentiation factor 11 ( GDF11) has been implicated in a variety of aging conditions and the regulation of organ regeneration after injury; however , the role of GDF11 in liver ischemia reperfusion injury ( IRI) is unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the possible role of GDF11 in liver IRI. We investigated the effects of GDF11 in liver IRI in both young ( 3 mo) and old ( 22 mo) mice in vivo , and in primary young and old mouse hepatocytes in vitro. Both serum and hepatic GDF11 protein expression levels increased with age and after IRI. Treatment with recombinant GDF11 significantly increased IRI-induced elevations of serum aminotransferase levels , worsened the histologic status of livers , and impaired liver regeneration. In contrast , inhibition of GDF11 activity with neutralizing Abs significantly decreased liver injury and improved liver regeneration after IRI. In vitro , treatment with recombinant GDF11 significantly delayed cell proliferation in cultured hepatocytes that were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation insult. Moreover , suppression of cell-cycle progression may be a key mechanism by which GDF11 inhibited hepatocyte regeneration. Collectively , rather than acting as a rejuvenating agent , GDF11 worsens hepatocellular injury and impairs liver regeneration after IRI.-Liu , A. , Dong , W. , Peng , J. , Dirsch , O. , Dahmen , U. , Fang , H. , Zhang , C. , Sun , J.
