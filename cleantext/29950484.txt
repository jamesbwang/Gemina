  The developmental programme of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , involving loss of epithelial and acquisition of mesenchymal properties , plays an important role in the invasion-metastasis cascade of cancer cells. In the present study , we show that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) using A769662 led to a concomitant induction of EMT in multiple cancer cell types , as observed by enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers , decrease in epithelial markers , and increase in migration and invasion. In contrast , inhibition or depletion of AMPK led to a reversal of EMT. Importantly , AMPK activity was found to be necessary for the induction of EMT by physiological cues such as hypoxia and TGFÎ² treatment. Furthermore , AMPK activation increased the expression and nuclear localization of Twist1 , an EMT transcription factor. Depletion of Twist1 impaired AMPK-induced EMT phenotypes , suggesting that AMPK might mediate its effects on EMT , at least in part , through Twist1 upregulation. Inhibition or depletion of AMPK also attenuated metastasis. Thus , our data underscore a central role for AMPK in the induction of EMT and in metastasis , suggesting that strategies targeting AMPK might provide novel approaches to curb cancer spread.
