  The determination of natriuretic peptide levels in patients hospitalized for suspected acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is important for the confirmation of the diagnosis and for the prognosis. Changes in natriuretic peptide levels in response to therapy have a strong prognostic value. To decide whether repeated natriuretic peptide measurements for acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> show changes that could influence the diagnosis and/or the prognosis. Prospective data collection was carried out of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) levels on admission and within 12 hours in patients hospitalized for acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Only the data of those patients were analyzed whose symptoms started within 24 hours prior to admission and were due to acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The 23 patients whose data we analyzed had an average age of 77.9 ± 8.3 years. Most of them had left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an average ejection fraction of 34.1 ± 3.9 %. The time between the start of symptoms and the first measurement was 6.7 ± 2.2 hours , while the time until the repeated determination was 6.5 ± 2.2 hours after the first measurement. The median value of the NT-proBNP levels in the 6 hours control showed an increase from 5064 pg/mL to 8847 pg/mL ( p < 0.0005) , which amounts to a 75 percent increase- mean hs-troponin T showed an increase from 46 ± 25 ng/L to 78 ± 51 ng/L ( p < 0.002). A significant increase in NT-proBNP levels is to be expected in early repeated measurement after hospital admission. This fact could have diagnostic and prognostic consequences if validated in a larger patient population. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159 ( 25): 1009-1012.
