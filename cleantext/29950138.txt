  Objective To investigate the impact of population mammography screening on breast cancer incidence trends in New Zealand. Methods Trends in age-specific rates of invasive breast cancer incidence ( 1994-2014) were assessed in relation to screening in women aged 50-64 from 1999 and 45-69 following the programme age extension in mid-2004. Results Breast cancer incidence increased significantly by 18 % in women aged 50-64 compared with 1994-98 ( p < 0.0001) , coinciding with the 1999 introduction of mammography screening , and remained elevated for four years , before declining to pre-screening levels. Increases over 1994-99 incidence occurred in the 45-49 ( 21 %) and 65-69 ( 19 %) age groups following the 2004 age extension ( p < 0.0001). Following establishment of screening ( 2006-10) , elevated incidence in the screening target age groups was compensated for by lower incidence in the post-screening ⩾ 70 age groups than in 1994-98. Incidence in women aged ⩾ 45 was not significantly higher ( +5 %) after 2006 than in 1994-98. The cumulated risk of breast cancer in women aged 45-84 for 1994-98 was 10.7 % compared with 10.8 % in 2006-10. Conclusions Increases in breast cancer incidence following introduction of mammography screening in women aged 50-64 did not persist. Incidence inflation also occurred after introduction of screening for age groups 45-49 and 65-69. The cumulated incidence for women aged 45-84 over 2006-10 after screening was well established , compared with 1994-98 prior to screening , shows no increase in diagnosis. Over-diagnosis is not inevitable in population mammography screening programmes.
