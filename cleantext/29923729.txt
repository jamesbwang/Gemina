  We present a highly conformable , stretchable , and transparent electrode for application in epidermal electronics based on polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) and Ag nanowire ( AgNW) networks. With the addition of a small amount of a commercially available nonionic surfactant , Triton X , PDMS became highly adhesive and mechanically compliant , key factors for the development of conformable and stretchable substrates. The polar functional groups present in Triton X interacted with the Pt catalyst present in the PDMS curing agent , thereby hindering the cross-linking reaction of PDMS and modulating the mechanical properties of the polymer. Due to the strong interactions that occur between the polar functional groups of Triton X and AgNWs , AgNWs were effectively embedded in the adhesive PDMS ( a-PDMS) matrix , and the highly enhanced conformability , mechanical stretchability , and transparency of the a-PDMS matrix were maintained in the resulting AgNW-embedded a-PDMS matrix. Finally , wearable strain and electrocardiogram ( ECG) sensors were fabricated from the AgNW-embedded a-PDMS. The a-PDMS-based strain and ECG sensors exhibited significantly improved sensing performances compared with those of the bare PDMS-based sensors because of the better stretchability and conformability to the skin of the former sensors.
