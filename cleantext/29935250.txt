  The effects of obesity on organophosphate pesticide-mediated toxicities , including both cholinergic and non-cholinergic targets , have not been fully elucidated. Therefore , the present study was designed to determine if high fat diet intake alters the effects of repeated exposure to chlorpyrifos ( CPS) on the activities of both cholinergic and noncholinergic serine hydrolase targets. Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on either standard rodent chow or high fat diet for four weeks with CPS exposure ( 2.0 mg/kg) for the last 10 days of diet intake. Exposure to CPS did not alter acetylcholinesterase in the central nervous system , but it did significantly inhibit circulating cholinesterase activities in both diet groups. CPS significantly inhibited hepatic carboxylesterase and fatty acid amide hydrolase and this inhibition was significantly greater in high fat fed animals. Additionally , CPS exposure and high fat diet intake downregulated genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis as well as cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in hepatic xenobiotic metabolism. In summary , the present study demonstrates that high fat diet intake potentiates CPS mediated inhibition of both carboxylesterase and fatty acid amide hydrolase in the liver of obese animals following subacute exposure and suggests obesity may be a risk factor for increased non-cholinergic hepatic CPS toxicity.
