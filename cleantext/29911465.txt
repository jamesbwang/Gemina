  To assess prevalence of personality traits and disorders according to Millon 's evolution-based model and to identify the most representative personality profiles among adult ADHD outpatients. Personality traits and disorders were evaluated using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III ( MCMI-III) and an exploratory factor analysis ( EFA) in a consecutive sample of adult ADHD outpatients ( N = 70) diagnosed by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-version 1.1 ( ASRS-v1.1) and the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults ( DIVA 2.0). More than half of our sample ( 57.1 %) showed at least one personality disorder ( PD). The most prevalent PDs were paranoid , schizotypal and negativistic ( 18.6 % for all three PDs) , depressive ( 17.1 %) , and sadistic ( 11.4 %). No patient had a borderline PD. The EFA identified three personality profiles ( `` sadistic-antisocial-negativistic , '' `` masochistic-depressive-dependent-avoidant , '' and `` antihistrionic-schizoid ''). High prevalence of PDs among adult ADHD patients was confirmed. The personality profiles seemed to reflect the persistence of ADHD and related childhood comorbidities in adulthood.
