  Viral myocarditis<disease> ( VM) can be a life-threatening event resulting in cardiac failure , chronic cardiomyopathy , and death. VM typically includes three phases , i.e. , acute , subacute , and resolution/chronic. We prospectively investigated cardiac- and inflammatory-associated plasma-circulating miRNA levels in eight pediatric patients with VM during the three stages of the disease. The level of cardiac-associated miR-208a was significantly elevated during the acute phase compared with the subacute and resolution/chronic phases. The level of cardiac- and inflammatory-associated miR-21 was significantly elevated during the acute phase compared to the resolution/chronic phase. Moreover , cardiac-associated miR-208b levels during the subacute phase correlated with systolic left ventricular function recovery as measured during the resolution/chronic phase. The findings of our study demonstrate an association between cardiac damage and the inflammatory response and the expression of miR-208a and miR-21 during the pathological progression of myocarditis<disease> We also found that miR-208b levels exhibit a prognostic significance for left ventricular functional recovery.
