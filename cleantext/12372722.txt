  The relationship between thymidine phosphorylase ( TP) and angiogenesis at the early stage of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has been unclear. Using 14 samples of normal squamous epithelium , 11 samples of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia , and 64 samples of superficial esophageal cancer , microvessel density ( MVD) was estimated using immunostaining for CD34 and CD105. TP expression was also evaluated in both cancer cells and stromal monocytic cells ( SMCs). We then investigated the correlation between MVD and TP expression in both cancer cells and SMCs. On the basis of the above parameters , MVD was significantly higher in cancerous lesions<symptom> than in normal squamous epithelium. In terms of CD34 and CD105 expression , MVD showed a gradual increase from normal squamous epithelium , to low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia , and then to M1 and M2 cancer , and M3 or deeper cancer. M1 and M2 cancer showed overexpression of TP in both cancer cells and SMCs. There was no significant correlation between TP expression in cancer cells and MVD estimated from CD34 ( rS = 0.16 , P = 0.21) or CD105 ( rS = 0.05 , P = 0.68) expression. Significant correlations were found between TP expression in SMCs and CD34-related ( rS = 0.46 , P < 0.001) and CD105-related ( rS = 0.34 , P < 0.01) MVD. In M3 or deeper cancers , there were no significant correlations between TP expression in cancer cells or SMCs and venous invasion , lymphatic invasion , and lymph node metastasis. TP expression is activated in both cancer cells and stromal monocytic cells at the very early stage of ESCC progression. TP expression in SMCs , rather than in cancer cells , is significantly correlated with angiogenesis.
