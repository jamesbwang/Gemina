  Galanthamine ( GAL) , the well-known Amaryllidaceae alkaloid , is a clinically used drug for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease. L-Phenylalanine ( Phe) and trans-cinnamic acid ( CA) were enzymatically transformed into the catechol portion of GAL. Herein , a Phe ammonia-lyase-encoding gene LrPAL3 and a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase-encoding gene LrC4H were cloned from Lycoris radiata , a GAL-producing plant. LrPAL3 was overexpressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and purified to homogeneity. LrPAL3 catalyzes the forward deamination conversion of L-Phe into trans-CA. The 3-chloro- and 4-fluoro-L-Phe were deaminated to generate the corresponding 3-chloro- and 4-fluoro-trans-CA by LrPAL3. LrPAL3-catalyzed reverse hydroamination was confirmed by the conversion of trans-CA into L-Phe with exceptional regio- and stereo-selectivity. LrC4H was overexpressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> with tCamCPR , a cytochrome P450 reductase-encoding gene. LrC4H catalyzes the regioselective para-hydroxylation on trans-CA to form p-coumaric acid. The transcriptional levels of both LrPAL3 and LrC4H were positively associated with the GAL contents within the leaves and flowers of L. radiata , which suggested that their expression and function are co-regulated and involved in the biosynthesis of GAL. The present investigations on the biosynthetic genes of GAL will promote the development of synthetic biology platforms for this kind of important drug via metabolic engineering.
