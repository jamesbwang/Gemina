  When a patient presents with stroke-type symptoms , the correct diagnosis is imperative to determine appropriate treatment. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( CAA) , a buildup of amyloid proteins on the brain artery walls , is a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom>. Improved diagnostic criteria and enhanced neuroimaging have resulted in earlier detection of CAA , which will hopefully lead to better outcomes for these patients. More research is being conducted , and neuroscience nurses need to stay informed about this condition to be able to appropriately care for and educate their patients who are diagnosed with CAA.
