  Many studies show that animals may prefer earned over free food-a phenomenon referred to as `` contrafreeloading. '' In rodents , dopamine-which is involved in incentive motivation and effort-facilitates the occurrence of such a preference. Here , we investigated the behavioral effects of pramipexole ( PPX) , a dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist , on contrafreeloading in pigeons. In Experiment 1 , 2 groups of pigeons ( PPX and SAL) were simultaneously exposed to a bowl that contained grains only ( easy food option) and a bowl that contained grains covered with sawdust ( harder food option) for 6 sessions. They were tested in two treatment conditions ( high vs. low amount of food available). In Experiment 2 , the two groups of pigeons were first repeatedly presented with the harder food option ( training phase , 6 sessions) and then with the two options at the same time ( test phase , 3 sessions). In order to potentially increase the physiological effects of PPX , the dose was tripled , and there was a 2-week incubation of the drug between Sessions 3 and 4 at training. The results indicate that the pigeons from both groups preferred to forage on the easy food option , and PPX did not alter this preference. Despite indications that PPX was effective , its action consisted of reducing-rather than magnifying-the attractiveness of the harder food option. It is suggested that pigeons are less motivated to deploy foraging effort than rodents in similar tasks. ( PsycINFO Database Record
