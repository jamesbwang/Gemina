  Spt proteins are defined as a large family of transcription regulators of the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> They are crucial components of the SAGA complex that regulates transcription through interaction with the TATA box in the upstream region of the target genes. About 10 % of total gene transcriptions are related to Spt proteins and these genes are highly related to environmental stress response. Such vast regulation network and complex mechanisms have become a hotspot. Spt proteins are also important to suppress transposon-induced mutations , being a switch on regulation of transposon behaviors and adaptive evolution of Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> Besides that , some Spt proteins are directly involved in regulating unsaturated lipid acids synthesis , which could remold the cell membrane to resist environmental stresses. Here , we review Spt proteins , the advances in Spt proteins study , and their potential applications in improving yeast 's stress resistance through transcription regulation , transposon activity regulation and cell membrane alternation.
