  Kinesins are commonly homodimers with two identical heavy chains ( protomers) and play indispensable roles in many intracellular processes. Engineered heterodimeric kinesins with two distinct protomers are important tools for dissecting coordination and regulation of naturally occurring kinesin homodimers. Here , we report a chemical-biology-based approach that generates kinesin heterodimers by combining genetic incorporation of reactive noncanonical amino acids and small-molecule-based cross-linking. We verified using yeast kinesin-8/ Kip3 as a model system that our method yields kinesin heterodimers of desired properties without introducing unintended motility disruption. To demonstrate the utility of our method , we engineered a crippled Kip3 heterodimer that contains both a wild-type-like protomer and a catalytically inactive one , and our results revealed that the resulting heterodimer moves on the microtubule with a significant reduction in velocity but not processivity. Due to its versatility , we expect that our method can be broadly adopted to create novel heterodimers for other kinesins and will thus greatly expand the studies on kinesin mechanisms.
