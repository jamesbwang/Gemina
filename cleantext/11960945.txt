  This study aimed to better understand how subjects with stable asthma and without exercise-induced bronchoconstriction respond to mild exercise. Breathing pattern , chest wall compartmental and operational volumes , and thoracoabdominal asynchrony were assessed in 11 stable asthmatic subjects and 10 healthy subjects at rest and during exercise in a cycle-ergometer through optoelectronic plethysmography. Dyspnea<symptom> and sensation of leg effort were assessed through Borg scale. During exercise , with similar minute ventilation , a significant lower chest wall tidal volume (
