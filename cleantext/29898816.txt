  Primary Health Networks ( PHNs) are tasked to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of general practice. Gold Coast Primary Health Network ( GCPHN) has been collecting de-identified aggregated clinical data from general practices and reporting back on areas for improvement on data coding and some clinical metrics , such as blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> not being recorded. However , aggregated data can not be used to intervene at the individual patient level , and because of the collection-to-reporting time-lag , the data can not help facilitate immediate action in the general practice. GCPHN developed a practice-based population health management approach based on mapping data from general practices to international coding classification systems , and applying evidenced-based algorithms and tools. General practices are provided with a health profile of their entire patient population , from the healthiest to the most complex comorbid patients. The information is conveyed as alerts and reports on areas including medication quality and safety , possible gaps in care and high-risk patients. The information is received based on the practice 's preferences; this can be at the time of data entry , the following day or as specified. Strong clinical governance has ensured GCPHN 's approach and methodologies are evidenced-based and appropriate. The consistent application of clinical governance within general practices is also needed to ensure the approach is sustainable and improves clinical outcomes.
