  Vaccines against human papillomaviruses are covered by statutory health insurances in Germany since March 2007. A reduction of cervical and other HPV-associated cancers is expected. Incidence rates of HPV-associated cancers preceding the introduction of vaccines are unknown. These , however , are important for assessing the effects of HPV vaccines. The aim of the present study was to bridge this knowledge gap. Based on cancer registry data from seven federal states , average yearly incidence rates for cervical , anogenital , oropharyngeal cancers and cancers of the oral cavity were calculated for the period 2003 to 2007. Additionally , estimated numbers of cases give an overview on the total burden of disease caused by HPV-associated cancers in Germany. Incidence trends from 2003 to 2013 are also presented. In Germany , 11,686 cases of invasive HPV-associated cancers occurred yearly before the introduction of HPV vaccines. The most common sites are cervical cancers for women ( 4,387 cases) and oropharyngeal<disease> cancers for men ( 2,770 cases) with age-standardized incidence rates of 8.8 and 5.9 cases per 100,000 persons , respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate for in situ cervical cancers amounts to 23.5 cases per 100 000 women. Incidence trends show significant increases of invasive vulvar , penile and anorectal cancers. This work presents robust incidence data of HPV-associated cancers in Germany prior to the introduction of the HPV vaccine. Effects of HPV vaccines on the incidence of HPV-associated cancers can be estimated for Germany earliest in 2019.
