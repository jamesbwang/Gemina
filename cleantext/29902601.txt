  Haptoglobin ( Hp) comprising 2 light ( α) and 2 heavy ( β) chains has an antioxidant effect following free hemoglobin binding. Among 3 phenotypes-Hp1-1 ( two α1) , Hp2-1 ( α1 and α2) , and Hp2-2 ( two α2)- a greater protective effect for toxic-free hemoglobin was reported for Hp2-2 compared with Hp1-1. However , few studies have focused on the association of Hp2-1 with outcomes. This study examined α1 and α2 expression , and evaluated the correlation of Hp2-1 with outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH). Eighty-seven patients were enrolled prospectively , including 12 in the Hp1-1 group ( 13.8 %) , 36 in the Hp2-1 group ( 41.4 %) , and 39 in the Hp2-2 group ( 44.8 %). Phenotypes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The relative band intensities were measured as α subunit intensities normalized to albumin intensities and expressed as median ( interquartile range). The differences in α intensities according to delayed cerebral ischemia ( DCI) , angiographic vasospasm ( AV) , and outcome were analyzed. DCI and AV were more frequently associated with Hp2-2 than with Hp1-1 ( DCI: 21 ( 53.8 %) vs. 3 ( 25.0 %); AV: 22 ( 56.4 %) vs. 3 ( 25.0 %)). The α1 intensities of Hp2-1 without DCI and AV were significantly higher than those with DCI and AV ( without DCI: 0.70 ( interquartile range ( IQR) , 0.54-0.89); with DCI: 0.24 ( IQR , 0.14-0.32); P < 0.001; without AV: 0.65 ( IQR , 0.32-0.88); with AV: 0.32 ( IQR , 0.17-0.67); P = 0.046). No significant difference was noted with α2 intensities. The α1 ( P = 0.359) and α2 ( P = 0.233) intensities did not differ significantly according to outcome. Higher α1 intensities in Hp2-1 are associated with a lower risk of DCI and AV. The degree of α1 intensity may provide additional information about the individual risk of secondary injury following SAH in patients with Hp2-1.
