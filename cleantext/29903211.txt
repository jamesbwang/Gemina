  Direct determination of 35 trace volatile organic compounds in air by portable gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). The mixed standard gas of different concentration levels was prepared with high purity nitrogen as diluent gas. The samples were injected into the GC-MS by a hand-held probe. Retention time and characteristic ion were used for qualitative analysis , and the internal standard method was usd for quantitation. Under the established experimental conditions , the 35 poisonous substances were separated and determined well. The relative standard deviation was 3. 2 % -15. 1 %. The average recovery was 75. 1 % -121. 4 % ( n = 6). The portable GC-MS method can be used for qualitative and quantitative detection of volatile organic compounds in ambient air.
