  The standard therapeutic strategy recommended for locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( LAPC) is typically chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy ( CRT). Although the clinical benefit of chemotherapy alone versus CRT for LAPC has been compared in a number of clinical trials , the optimal therapy for LAPC remains unclear. Moreover , the clinical benefit derived from treatment in each clinical trial is a matter of controversy , and the superiority of one treatment over another has yet to be definitively demonstrated. The poor outcomes seen among patients with LAPC owe largely to the emergence of metastatic disease; therefore , accurately evaluating occult distant metastasis before choosing a therapeutic strategy could be expected to help stratify patients with LAPC into the most appropriate treatment regimen , namely local control or systemic therapy. In 1998 , we identified the actinin-4 gene ( ACTN4) as an actin-binding protein and showed its molecular mechanisms had clinical implications for cancer metastasis. We also identified ACTN4 gene amplification in pancreatic , ovarian , and salivary gland cancer , and demonstrated its utility as a strong prognostic biomarker for stage I lung adenocarcinoma in patients who had never received chemotherapy. Moreover , we recently reported that ACTN4 gene amplification could be a useful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of CRT for LAPC. In the present review , we summarize current knowledge regarding therapeutic strategies for LAPC and discuss the potential development of personalized medicine using ACTN4 measurement for patients with LAPC.
