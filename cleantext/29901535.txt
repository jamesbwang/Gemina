  Although endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA) has an excellent diagnostic yield , there remain cases where the diagnosis is not obtained. We hypothesized that additional sampling with a 19-G EBUS-TBNA needle may increase diagnostic yield in a subset of cases where additional tissue sampling was required. Indications for use of the 19-G needle following 22-G sampling with rapid on-site cytologic examination were: ( 1) diagnostic uncertainty of the on-site cytopathologist ( eg , nondiagnostic , probable lymphoma , etc.) , ( 2) non-small cell lung cancer with probable need for molecular genetic and/or PD-L1 testing , or ( 3) need for a larger tissue sample for consideration of inclusion in a research protocol. A 19-G EBUS-TBNA needle was utilized following standard sampling with a 22-G needle in 48 patients ( 50 sites) during the same procedure. Although the diagnostic yield between the needles was equivalent , the concordance rate was only 83 %. The 19-G determined a diagnosis in 4 additional patients ( 8 %) and provided additional histopathologic information in 6 other cases ( 12 %). Conversely , in 3 cases ( 6 %) diagnostic information was provided only by the 22-G needle. Compared with 22-G EBUS-TBNA alone , sampling with both the 22- and 19-G EBUS needles resulted in an increase in diagnostic yield from 92 % to 99 % ( P = 0.045) and a number needed to sample of 13 patients to provide one additional diagnosis. There were no significant complications. In select cases where additional tissue may be needed , sampling with a 19-G EBUS needle following standard aspiration with a 22-G needle results in an increase in diagnostic yield.
