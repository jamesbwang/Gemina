  We demonstrate a microfluidic screening platform for studying thiosulfate leaching of Au in a transparent microchannel. The approach permits in situ ( optical) monitoring of Au thickness , reduced reagent use , rapid optimization of reagent chemistry , screening of temperature , and determination of the activation energy. The results demonstrate the critical importance of the ( 1) preparation and storage of the leach solution , ( 2) deposition and annealing of the Au film , and ( 3) lixiviant chemistry. The density of sputter-deposited Au films decreased with depth resulting in accelerating leach rates during experiments. Atomic leach rates were determined and were constant throughout each experiment. Annealing above 270 Â°C was found to prevent leaching , which can be attributed to diffusion of the chromium adhesion layer into the Au film. The microfluidic analysis revealed leach rates that are sensitive to the stoichiometric ratio of thiosulfate , ammonia<pathogen> , and copper in the leach solution and optimized for 10 mM CuSO
