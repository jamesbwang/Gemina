  The bacterium<pathogen> Vibrio<pathogen> coralliilyticus can threaten vital reef ecosystems by causing disease in a variety of coral genera , and , for some strains , increases in virulence at elevated water temperatures. In addition , strains of V. coralliilyticus ( formally identified as V. tubiashii) have been implicated in mass mortalities of shellfish larvae causing significant economic losses to the shellfish industry. Recently , strain BAA-450 , a coral pathogen , was demonstrated to be virulent towards larval Pacific oysters ( Crassostrea gigas). However , it is unclear whether other coral-associated V. coralliilyticus strains can cause shellfish mortalities and if infections are influenced by temperature. This study compared dose dependence , temperature impact , and gross pathology of four V. coralliilyticus strains ( BAA-450 , OCN008 , OCN014 and RE98) on larval C. gigas raised at 23 °C and 27 °C , and evaluated whether select virulence factors are required for shellfish infections as they are for corals. All strains were infectious to larval oysters in a dose-dependent manner with OCN014 being the most pathogenic and BAA-450 being the least. At 27 °C , higher larval mortalities ( p < 0.05) were observed for all V. coralliilyticus strains , ranging from 38.8-93.7 %. Gross pathological changes to the velum and cilia occurred in diseased larvae , but there were no distinguishable differences between oysters exposed to different V. coralliilyticus strains or temperatures. Additionally , in OCN008 , the predicted transcriptional regulator ToxR and the outer membrane protein OmpU were important for coral and oyster disease , while mannose sensitive hemagglutinin type IV pili were required only for coral infection. This study demonstrated that multiple coral pathogens can infect oyster larvae in a temperature-dependent manner and identified virulence factors required for infection of both hosts.
