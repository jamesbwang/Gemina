  Environmental pollutants may cause adverse effects on the immune system of aquatic organisms. However , the cellular effects of pollutants on fish immune system are largely unknown. Here , we exploited the transgenic zebrafish Tg ( lysC: DsRed2) larva as a preliminary screening system to evaluate the potential inflammatory effects of environmental pollutants. Tg ( lysC: DsRED2) larvae aged 7-day-postfertilization ( 7 dpf) were treated with selected environmental chemicals for 24 h ( 24 h) and the number of neutrophils were quantified using both image analysis and fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS). We found that the numbers of neutrophils in the Tg ( lysC: DsRED2) larvae<pathogen> were significantly increased by most of the organic chemicals tested , including E2 ( 17β-estradiol) , BPA ( Bisphenol-A) , NDEA ( N-nitrosodiethylamine) , 4-NP ( 4-Nitrophenol) and Lindane ( γ-hexachlorocyclohexane). Neutrophil numbers were also increased by all the metals tested ( Na2HAsO4 · 7H2O , Pb ( NO3) 2 , HgCl
