  To recover a nitrogen resource from high-ammonia-nitrogen wastewater , two amphitrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria ( HOB) , Paracoccus<pathogen> denitrificans<pathogen> Y5 and P. versutus D6 , capable of nitrogen assimilation for single-cell protein ( SCP) production were isolated. These two HOB strains could grow autotrophically with H
