  Additive manufacturing ( AM) appears poised to provide novel pharmaceutical technology and controlled release systems , yet understanding the effects of processing and post-processing operations on pill design , quality , and performance remains a significant barrier. This paper reports a study of the relationship between programmed concentration profile and resultant temporal release profile using a 3D printed polypill system consisting of a Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved excipient ( Pluronic F-127) and therapeutically relevant dosages of three commonly used oral agents for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( 300-500 mg per pill). A dual-extrusion hydrogel microextrusion process enables the programming of three unique concentration profiles , including core-shell , multilayer , and gradient structures. Experimental and computational studies of diffusive mass transfer processes reveal that programmed concentration profiles are dynamic throughout both pill 3D printing and solidification. Spectrophotometric assays show that the temporal release profiles could be selectively programmed to exhibit delayed , pulsed , or constant profiles over a 5 h release period by utilizing the core-shell , multilayer , and gradient distributions , respectively. Ultimately , this work provides new insights into the mass transfer processes that affect design , quality , and performance of spatially graded controlled release systems , as well as demonstrating the potential to create disease-specific polypill technology with programmable temporal release profiles.
