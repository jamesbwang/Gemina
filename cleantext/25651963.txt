  Radical esophagectomy remains the primary treatment option for resectable esophageal cancer. However , it sometimes induces postoperative complications due to its invasive nature. Recently , the impact of loss of muscle mass on postoperative complications and survival among cancer patients has been highlighted. This study aimed to identify the impact of low hand grip strength ( HGS) on postoperative complications after esophagectomy. A total of 188 patients ( male: 166 , female: 22) who underwent radical esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction between 2008 and 2014 were included. The correlation between HGS and age was analyzed using Pearson 's correlation coefficient. Due to the small patient numbers , only male patients were stratified into two groups according to age ( < 70 years: non-elderly group , â‰¥ 70 years: elderly group). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for each group using postoperative complication occurrence as the endpoint to determine an optimal HGS cutoff value. Postoperative complications occurred in 60.9 % of the elderly group and 47.4 % of the non-elderly group. When the cutoff values were set at 30.5 and 37 kg for the elderly and non-elderly group , respectively , low HGS was an independent predictive factor of postoperative complications on multivariate analysis only in the elderly group ( p = 0.008). In the elderly group , the incidence of postoperative pneumonia<disease> was 39.5 % among patients with low HGS vs. 3.8 % among patients with high HGS. Preoperative HGS is an independent predictive factor of postoperative complications , especially postoperative pneumonia<disease> , for elderly male patients with esophageal cancer treated with radical esophagectomy.
