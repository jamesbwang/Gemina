  The objective of this study was to examine the effect of feeding systems ( component and total mixed rations ( TMR)) and dietary grain sources ( barley , commercial concentrate , corn grain , and high-moisture corn) on lactation characteristics and milk composition. A total of 852,242 test-day records , information on animal characteristics , feed composition , and feeding systems from 104,129 Holstein cows in 4,319 herds covering a period of 5 yr were obtained from Quebec 's Dairy Herd Improvement Association ( Valacta). We performed descriptive statistics and graphical representations of the data for each type of feeding system and grain source by parity ( 1 to 3). The milk records were binned in 15-d in milk blocks. Mixed models using a combination of forward and backward stepwise selections were developed to predict milk and milk component yields. The TMR-fed cows had greater yield of milk , fat , protein , and lactose and lower milk urea N ( MUN) concentration than component-fed cows at all parities. Cows fed a TMR had higher peak milk yields and greater persistency after peak lactation compared with component-fed cows. In addition , greater yields of milk fat and protein from peak to mid-lactation were found in TMR- versus component-fed cows. In general , greater milk fat and protein yields as well as lower MUN concentration were observed in cows fed corn grain or high-moisture corn compared with barley or commercial concentrate , but parity influenced these relationships. The feeding system by day in milk blocks interaction was significant in models of milk and components yields for all parities , but only for second-lactation cows for MUN concentration. This means that effect of TMR and component feeding differs with stage of lactation. In conclusion , feeding TMR and corn-based diets are associated with greater yield of milk and milk components under commercial conditions.
