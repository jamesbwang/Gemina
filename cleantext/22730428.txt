  Children with neuromuscular disease ( NMD) are at risk of acquiring respiratory complications. Both clinical assessments and respiratory diagnostic tests are important to optimize the respiratory health and care of such children. The following respiratory diagnostic tools and their utility for evaluating children with NMD are discussed in this article: lung function testing ( spirometry and lung volumes) , peak cough<symptom> flow ( PCF) , respiratory muscle strength testing , oximetry , capnography , and polysomnography.
