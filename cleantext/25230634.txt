  Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM) undergraduate research experiences improve success , persistence , and promote a feeling of belonging to a community. Like their hearing peers , deaf STEM majors often participate in undergraduate research experiences. However , deaf students typically interact with hearing faculty lacking experience with deaf students and awareness of Deaf culture , which unintentionally impacts their research experiences. This interview study sought to understand deaf students ' research experiences and their relationships with hearing mentors. Findings indicate that lack of awareness of Deaf culture and lack of communication access impact students ' experiences. We make recommendations on improving deaf students ' research experiences.
