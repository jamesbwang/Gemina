  Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase ( PPO) , the last enzyme that is common to both chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis pathways , catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX. PPO has several isoforms , including the oxygen-dependent HemY and an oxygen-independent enzyme , HemG. However , most cyanobacteria encode HemJ , the least characterized PPO form. We have characterized HemJ from the cyanobacterium
