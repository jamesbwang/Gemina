  Oral and maxillofacial infections are generally treated by primary dental or medical caregivers. Nevertheless , because these infections are known to have life-threatening complications , there is a need of clear indicators for emergency services medical staff , particularly in determining when morbidity can be expected and when in-hospital treatment is required. This retrospective study aimed to identify variables that were observable at admission , which could indicate high complication rates , long hospital stays , and/or a need for tracheostomy. We examined data from all cases of severe oral and maxillofacial infections that were treated at the University Hospital of Leuven , between January 2013 and June 2017. 64 cases were identified after applying exclusion criteria. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. A univariate analysis showed that body temperature , C-reactive protein ( CRP) levels , white blood cell counts , and positive bacterial cultures were significantly associated with longer hospital stays , which indicated potential future morbidity. A multivariate analysis showed that dyspnoea , age , and CRP comprised the most significant combination for predicting the length of hospital stay. Based on the statistical analysis of this population , the research group concludes that a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination should be accompanied by a blood analysis of CRP and white blood cell counts. Only then can a well-founded decision be reached on the severity of the case and the need for hospital admission. In an acute setting , radiological imaging is not required for assessing future morbidity , but it should be performed when accessible.
