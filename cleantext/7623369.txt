  The aim of this study was to describe , through a systematic review , the acute and chronic effects of isometric handgrip exercise on cardiovascular variables in hypertensive individuals. In this systematic review , we included studies that analyzed whether a single bout or a program with isometric exercises affect cardiovascular variables in hypertensive adults. The electronic database PubMed/Medline was searched for relevant studies published until May 2017. Of the 2927 studies initially identified , 2916 were excluded based on title and abstract and five on the basis of full-text assessment , leaving six studies remaining. In addition , one further study cited in the references of the included articles was included in this review , totaling seven studies included ( five studies on the chronic effects of isometric handgrip exercise on cardiovascular parameters). None of the acute studies observed post-exercise hypotension<symptom>. The majority of the chronic studies found decreases in office blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> after isometric handgrip training , with training ranging from 6 to 10 weeks , while heart rate variability parameters were improved in one study and did not change in another. Reduction in oxidative stress was observed; however , this variable was only analyzed in one study. In hypertensives , acute responses to isometric handgrip exercise are very limited due to the small number of studies , therefore more research is required. Furthermore , chronic isometric handgrip training reduces blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>; however , there is still a gap in the knowledge on the effects of this modality of exercise on other cardiovascular variables-such as endothelial function , oxidative stress , and cardiac autonomic modulation-which should be addressed in future studies.
