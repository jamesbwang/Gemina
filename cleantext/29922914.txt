  Morphea can lead to considerable cosmetic or functional impairment; nevertheless , health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) is rarely documented in adult morphea patients. To investigate the impact of morphea on HRQoL and to identify determinants of impaired HRQoL. A cross-sectional study has been carried out among adult morphea patients. HRQoL was evaluated by the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI). The modified Localised Scleroderma Skin Severity Index ( mLoSSI) and the Localised Scleroderma Damage Index ( LoSDI) were applied to evaluate disease activity and damage , respectively. Physician Global Assessment of Activity and Damage ( PGA-A , PGA-D) were also completed. Determinants of HRQoL were analysed by multiple regression. A total of 101 patients ( 84 % females) entered the study , with a mean age of 56.8 Â± 14.8 years. Median mLoSSI , LoSDI , PGA-A and PGA-D scores were 8 , 5 , 9 and 9 points , respectively. Patients with generalised localised ( 51 %) and plaque-type morphea ( 45 %) had median total DLQI scores of 4 and 1 , respectively. Embarrassment ( 53 %) , itchy or painful skin ( 46 %) , and clothing issues ( 43 %) were the most commonly reported problems in the DLQI. Female gender , generalised morphea , higher disease activity ( PGA-A score) and involvement of hands and/or feet were significant predictors of impaired HRQoL ( p < 0.05). This study represents the largest sample of adult morphea patients surveyed about their HRQoL in Europe. The frequent occurrence of embarrassment warrants an increased attention to improve patients ' mental health. Care must be taken in case of involvement of functionally sensitive areas , as these cases might require more intensive treatment.
