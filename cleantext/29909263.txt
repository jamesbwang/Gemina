  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hysterectomy with or without concomitant prolapse surgery on subject-reported pelvic floor disorders ( PFD) with a 5-year follow-up. This prospective longitudinal study was carried out in two Finnish central hospitals among 286 women who had undergone hysterectomy for benign reasons. The presence of urinary incontinence , urinary frequency , feeling of vaginal bulging , constipation<symptom> and anal incontinence was evaluated at baseline , 1 and 5 years postoperatively. Analysis was performed on 256 ( 895 %) patients who answered at least one of the follow-up questionnaires. Hysterectomy with concomitant native tissue prolapse surgery significantly reduced urinary incontinence , urinary frequency , constipation<symptom> and the feeling of vaginal bulging , and the results were maintained over the following five years. Plain hysterectomy reduced urinary frequency and the feeling of vaginal bulging but did not relieve urinary incontinence. Hysterectomy had no effect on anal incontinence. The total subsequent prolapse and/or incontinence operation rate was 2,7 % , and was higher among patients who underwent hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse. During a 5-years follow-up a hysterectomy alone or with native tissue prolapse surgery did not worsen pelvic floor disorders.
