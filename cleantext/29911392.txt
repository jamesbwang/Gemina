  The efficacy of remote ischaemic conditioning in clinical trials of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) or elective percutaneous coronary intervention is controversial. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse whether remote ischaemic conditioning reduces myocardial damage in those patients. We searched PubMed , Embase and Web of Science from inception until December 2017 for randomised clinical trials evaluating remote ischaemic conditioning versus a control group. Two independent reviewers extracted data of 23 trials ( 2118 patients with STEMI; 2048 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention) which were meta-analysed using random-effects models. Remote ischaemic conditioning reduced infarct size in STEMI patients when assessed by imaging ( mean difference of infarct size as percentage of left ventricle -2.43 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) -4.37 to -0.48; P = 0.01; I Despite a statistically significant reduction of myocardial damage in STEMI patients , the magnitude of the reduction was small and a significant impact on clinical events is unlikely. With respect to elective percutaneous coronary intervention , remote ischaemic conditioning had no influence on myocardial injury and its use is not supported by our analysis.
