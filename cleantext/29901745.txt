  We performed the first epidemiologic investigation to examine association of demographics and clinical characteristics at diagnosis , as well as health care expense coverage , with survival of US children with aplastic anemia<symptom> ( AA). We obtained electronic medical record data of 1140 children aged 0-19 years diagnosed with AA followed at a pediatric health system between 2004 and 2014. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazards regressions were used. Self-pay patients had a mortality risk five times higher than that of those insured by publicly funded insurance ( hazards ratio , 95 % CI: 6.0 , 3.7-9.8). Other features associated with higher mortality risk include pancytopenia ( hazards ratio , referent: 4.2 , constitutional AA); underweight ( 2.0 , normal-weight); platelet count < 50 × 109/l ( 1.3 , ≥ 50 × 109/l); male sex ( 1.3 , female); and ages at diagnosis 6-11 , 11-16 and 16-19 years ( 1.6 , 1.9 , 2.3 , 1-3 years) , respectively. Self-pay was the strongest prognostic factor for pediatric AA mortality. Older age , pancytopenia , underweight , male sex and lower platelet count were also associated with increased risk of mortality. These findings may be useful for providers , researchers and policymakers to ensure effective health care delivery to this population and to motivate future etiologic research and establishment of a surveillance registry.
