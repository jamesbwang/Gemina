  The growth in the utilization of systems thinking principles has created a paradigm shift in the regulatory sciences and drug product development. Instead of relying extensively on end product testing and one-size-fits-all regulatory criteria , this new paradigm has focused on building quality into the product by design and fostering the development of product-specific , clinically relevant specifications. In this context , this commentary describes the evolution of bioequivalence regulations up to the current day and discusses the potential of applying a Bayesian-like approach , considering all relevant prior knowledge , to guide regulatory bioequivalence decisions in a patient-centric environment.
