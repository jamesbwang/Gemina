  Hip fracture patients in general are elderly and they often have comorbidities that may necessitate anticoagulation treatment , such as warfarin. It has been emphasized that these patients benefit from surgery without delay to avoid complications and reduce mortality. This creates a challenge for patients on warfarin and especially for those with trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fractures treated with intramedullary nailing , as this is associated with increased bleeding compared to other types of hip fractures and surgical methods. The aim of the study was to evaluate if early surgery ( within 24 h) of trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fractures using intramedullary nailing is safe in patients on warfarin treatment after fast reversal of the warfarin effect. A retrospective case-control study including 198 patients: 99 warfarin patients and 99 patients without anticoagulants as a 1:1 ratio control group matched for age , gender and surgical implant. All patients were operated within 24 h with a cephalomedullary nail due to a trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fracture. All patients on warfarin were reversed if necessary to INR ≤ 1.5 before surgery using vitamin K and/or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC). Per- and postoperative data , transfusion rates , adverse events and mortality was compared. There were no significant differences in the calculated blood-loss , in-house adverse events or mortality ( in-house , 30-day or 1-year) between the groups. There were no significant differences in the pre- or peroperative transfusions rates , but there was an increased rate of postoperative transfusions in the control group ( p = 0.02). We found that surgical treatment with intramedullary nailing within 24 h of patients with trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fractures on warfarin medication after reversing its effect to INR ≤ 1.5 using vitamin K and/or PCC is safe.
