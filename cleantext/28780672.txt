  A growing body of evidence supports the involvement of long noncoding RNA 00152 ( LINC00152) in the progression and metastasis of multiple cancers. However , the exact roles of LINC00152 in the progression of human retinoblastoma ( RB) remain unknown. We explored the expression and biological function of human RB. The expression level of LINC00152 in RB tissues and cells was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. The function of LINC00152 was determined using a series of in vitro assays. In vivo , a nude mouse model was established to analyze the function of LINC00152. Gene and protein expressions were detected using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assays , respectively. The expression of LINC00152 mRNA was upregulated in RB tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of LINC00152 significantly inhibited cell proliferation , colony formation , migration , and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis and caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in vitro , as well as suppressing tumorigenesis in vivo. We identified several genes related to proliferation , apoptosis , and invasion including Ki-67 , Bcl-2 , and MMP-9 that were transcriptionally inactivated by LINC00152. Taken together , these data implicate LINC00152 as a therapeutic target in RB.
