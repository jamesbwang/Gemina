  Promoters with enhancer activity have been described recently. In this point of view , we will discuss current findings highlighting the commonality of this type of regulatory elements , their genetic and epigenetic characteristics , their potential biological roles in the regulation of gene expression and the underlining molecular mechanisms. TSS: transcription start site; IFN: interferon; STARR-seq: Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region sequencing; MPRA: Massively Parallel Reporter Assay; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; lncRNA: long non-coding RNA.
