  A novel theory for the origin of the westward drift of the Earth 's magnetic field is proposed , based upon the propagation of hydrodynamic Rossby waves in the liquid outer core. These waves have the obscure property that their crests always progress eastwards-but , for a certain subset , energy can nevertheless be transmitted westwards. In fact , this subset corresponds to sheet-like flow structures , extended in both the axial and radial directions , which are likely to be preferentially excited by convective upwellings in the Earth 's rapidly rotating outer core. To enable their analysis , the
