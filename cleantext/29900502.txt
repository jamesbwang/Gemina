  Bacteriophages of the Leviviridae family are small viruses with short single-stranded RNA ( ssRNA) genomes. Protein-RNA interactions play a key role throughout the phage life cycle , and all of the conserved phage proteins- the maturation protein , the coat protein and the replicase- are able to recognize specific structures in the RNA genome. The phage-coded replicase subunit associates with several host proteins to form a catalytically active complex. Recognition of the genomic RNA by the replicase complex is achieved in a remarkably complex manner that exploits the RNA-binding properties of host proteins and the particular three-dimensional structure of the phage genome. The coat protein recognizes a hairpin structure at the beginning of the replicase gene. The binding interaction serves to regulate the expression of the replicase gene and can be remarkably different in various ssRNA phages. The maturation protein is a minor structural component of the virion that binds to the genome , mediates attachment to the host and guides the genome into the cell. The maturation protein has two distinct RNA-binding surfaces that are in contact with different regions of the genome. The maturation and coat proteins also work together to ensure the encapsidation of the phage genome in new<pathogen> virus<pathogen> particles. In this chapter , the different ssRNA phage protein-RNA interactions , as well as some of their practical applications , are discussed in detail.
