  The weak base antipsychotic clozapine is the most effective medication for treating refractory schizophrenia. The brain-to-plasma concentration of unbound clozapine is greater than unity , indicating transporter-mediated uptake , which has been insufficiently studied. This is important , because it could have a significant impact on clozapine 's efficacy , drug-drug interaction , and safety profile. A major limitation of clozapine 's use is the risk of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis/granulocytopenia ( CIAG) , which is a rare but severe hematological adverse drug reaction. We first studied the uptake of clozapine into human brain endothelial cells ( hCMEC/D3). Clozapine uptake into cells was consistent with a carrier-mediated process , which was time-dependent and saturable ( V
