  There are few data on the incidence of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( UGIB and LGIB) from observational studies of low-dose aspirin users. We aimed to estimate incidence rates of UGIB and LGIB in a large cohort of new users of low-dose aspirin in the United Kingdom , with sub-analyses of hospitalization status and fatalities. We performed a population-based study of 199,079 new users of low-dose aspirin ( median age , 64.0 years) identified from the Health Improvement Network primary care database ( 2000-2012). Individuals were followed for a median 5.4 years ( maximum , 14 years) to identify new cases of UGIB and LGIB. Following multi-step validation , we calculated overall and age- and sex-specific incidence rates; we performed sub-analyses for healthcare use and death within 30 days of GIB. We also estimated rates within a matched ( 1:1) cohort of non-users of low-dose aspirin at the start of the follow-up period. The low-dose aspirin users had 1115 UGIB events and 1936 LGIB events; most subjects with UGIB events ( 58.9 %) were hospitalized , whereas most subjects with LGIB events were referred to secondary care ( 72.8 %). Crude incidence rates of GIB per 1000 person-years were 0.97 for subjects with UGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.91-1.02) and 1.68 for subjects with LGIB ( 95 % CI , 1.60-1.75). Incidence rates per 1000 person-years for hospitalized patients with GIB were 0.57 for UGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.53-0.61) and 0.45 for LGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.42-0.49); for referred ( but not hospitalized) cases , these values were 0.39 for UGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.36-0.43) and 1.22 for LGIB ( 1.16-1.29). Incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 0.06 for fatal UGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.04-0.07) , 0.01 for fatal LGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.01-0.02) , 0.91 for non-fatal UGIB ( 95 % CI , 0.86-0.97) , and 1.66 for non-fatal LGIB ( 95 % CI , 1.59-1.74). Among non-users of low-dose aspirin , incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 0.67 ( 95 % CI , 0.63-0.75) for UGIB and 0.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.72-0.82) for LGIB. In a population-based study of low-dose aspirin users , the incidence of LGIB was higher than the incidence of UGIB. However , patients with LGIB had higher rates of hospitalization or death within 30 days than patients with UGIB. These estimates are valuable for benefit-risk assessments of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular and colorectal cancer prevention.
