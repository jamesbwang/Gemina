  Nowadays , there is no doubt that the development of infectious process is determined not only by individual features of a human , but also by features of infection agent. It is commonly known that ability to form an adequate immune response is based on immunogenetic peculiarities of macroorganism. The immunogenetic study was performed in 228 children from 1 to 15 years old with different manifestations of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). Control group was consisted of 446 adult healthy donors-residents of the Northwestern region of Russia. Human leukocyte antigens ( HLA)- DRB1 * allelic genes were assessed in all individuals. HLA-DRB1 alleles * 01 , * 03 , * 11 , * 13 , * 07 , and * 15 were observed significantly rare in children with TB in comparison with healthy donors that may indicate their protective role in the development of the disease. It was also noticed that DRB1 * 07 and * 15 alleles were observed significantly rare in children with lung TB in comparison with other forms of disease that allows to assume a protective function of these alleles for lung TB with no influence on development of generalized TB. This assumption requires further researches. As a result of the study , statistically significant differences in the distribution of HLA-DRB1 * alleles in children with TB in comparison with a control group for * 01 , * 03 , * 11 , * 13 , * 07 , * 15 , and * 16 alleles were found. It may indicate their protective role in the development of TB. DRB1 * 07 and * 15 alleles were observed significantly rare in children with single TB than in children with generalized TB and healthy controls.
