  The myxoma virus ( a microparasite) reduced wild rabbit numbers worldwide when introduced in the 1950s , and is known to interact with co-infecting helminths ( macroparasites) causing both increases and decreases in macroparasite population size. In the 1990s Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( RHDV) infected rabbits and also significantly reduced rabbit numbers in several countries. However , not much is known about RHDV interactions with macroparasites. In this study , we compare prevalence and intensity of infection for three gastrointestinal nematode species (
