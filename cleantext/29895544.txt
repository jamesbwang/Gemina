  Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder worldwide , especially in women. Postmenopausal status is the most common risk factor for osteoporosis in elderly women. The operational diagnosis of osteoporosis is usually made with the help of central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan. Clinically , osteoporosis is suspected in the background of one or more fractures of the hip , vertebra , proximal humerus or pelvis in the absence of local disease or high-energy trauma. Serious underlying illness can present with vertebral fractures and can be missed if other clues from clinical examination and investigations are overlooked. We report a case emphasising this aspect.
