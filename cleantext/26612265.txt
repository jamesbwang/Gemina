  Iron terephthalate coordination network thin films can be fabricated using the state-of-the-art gas-phase atomic/molecular layer deposition ( ALD/MLD) technique in a highly controlled manner. Iron is an Earth-abundant and nonhazardous transition metal , and with its rich variety of potential applications an interesting metal constituent for the inorganic-organic coordination network films. Our work underlines the role of the metal precursor used when aiming at in-situ ALD/MLD growth of crystalline inorganic-organic thin films. We obtain crystalline iron terephthalate films when FeCl
