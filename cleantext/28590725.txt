  Whole genome sequencing of actinomycetes has uncovered a new immense realm of microbial chemistry and biology. Most biosynthetic gene clusters present in genomes were found to remain & ldquo; silent & rdquo; under standard cultivation conditions. Some small molecules-- chemical elicitors-- can be used to induce the biosynthesis of antibiotics in actinobacteria and to expand the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites. Here , we outline a brief account of the basic principles of the search for regulators of this type and their application.
