  As a hot research topic in the field of psychology and psychiatry , trait optimism reflects the tendency to expect positive outcomes in the future. Consistent evidence has demonstrated the role of trait optimism in reducing anxiety<symptom> among different populations. However , less is known about the neural bases of trait optimism and the underlying mechanisms for how trait optimism protects against anxiety<symptom> in the healthy brain. In this investigation , we examined these issues in 231 healthy adolescent students by assessing resting-state brain activity ( i.e. , fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations , fALFF) and connectivity ( i.e. , resting-state functional connectivity , RSFC). Whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of trait optimism were linked with decreased fALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC) and increased RSFC between the right OFC and left supplementary motor cortex ( SMC). Mediation analyses further showed that trait optimism mediated the influence of the right OFC activity and the OFC-SMC connectivity on anxiety<symptom>. Our results remained significant even after excluding the impact of head motion , positive and negative affect and depression<symptom> Taken together , this study reveals that fALFF and RSFC are functional neural markers of trait optimism and provides a brain-personality-symptom pathway for protection against anxiety<symptom> in which fALFF and RSFC affect anxiety<symptom> through trait optimism.
