  An efficient and step-economic new approach to alkyl citrate natural products from a cyclobutene diester is presented. The key sequence involves a formal ( 2 + 2)- cycloaddition of a silylketene acetal with dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate to provide the cyclobutene diester 14 with 4.5:1 stereoselectivity. Exposure of diester 14 in acidic methanol effected a hydrolysis , intramolecular oxy-Michael reaction , and cyclobutanone methanolysis cascade to give the triester 15. Iodination and elimination then afforded a key alkyl citrate alkene intermediate , which was converted into the natural products (-)- CJ-13,982 ( 1) , (-)- CJ-13,981 ( 2) , and (-)- L-731,120 ( 3) via a cross-metathesis and subsequent reduction.
