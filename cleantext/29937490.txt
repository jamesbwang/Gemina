  Carbonic anhydrase II ( CAII) is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme whose aberrant activity is associated with various diseases such as glaucoma , osteoporosis , and different types of tumors; therefore , the development of CAII inhibitors , which can represent promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of these pathologies , is a current topic in medicinal chemistry. Molecular docking is a commonly used tool in structure-based drug design of enzyme inhibitors. However , there is still a need for improving docking reliability , especially in terms of scoring functions , since the complex pattern of energetic contributions driving ligand ⁻ protein binding can not be properly described by mathematical functions only including approximated energetic terms. Here we report a novel CAII-specific fingerprint-based ( IFP) scoring function developed according to the ligand ⁻ protein interactions detected in the CAII-inhibitor co-crystal structures of the most potent CAII ligands. Our IFP scoring function outperformed the ability of Autodock4 scoring function to identify native-like docking poses of CAII inhibitors and thus allowed a considerable improvement of docking reliability. Moreover , the ligand ⁻ protein interaction fingerprints showed a useful application in the binding mode analysis of structurally diverse CAII ligands.
