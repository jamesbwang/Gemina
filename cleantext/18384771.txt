  Obesity has deleterious effects on cognitive function in the elderly adults. In mice , aging exacerbates obesity-induced oxidative stress , microvascular dysfunction , blood-brain barrier ( BBB) disruption , and neuroinflammation , which compromise cognitive health. However , the specific mechanisms through which aging and obesity interact to remain elusive. Previously , we have shown that Nrf2 signaling plays a critical role in microvascular resilience to obesity and that aging is associated with progressive Nrf2 dysfunction , promoting microvascular impairment. To test the hypothesis that Nrf2 deficiency exacerbates cerebromicrovascular dysfunction induced by obesity Nrf2 +/ + and Nrf2-/- , mice were fed an adipogenic high-fat diet ( HFD). Nrf2 deficiency significantly exacerbated HFD-induced oxidative stress and cellular senescence , impairment of neurovascular coupling responses , BBB disruption , and microglia activation , mimicking the aging phenotype. Obesity in Nrf2-/- mice elicited complex alterations in the amyloidogenic gene expression profile , including upregulation of amyloid precursor protein. Nrf2 deficiency and obesity additively reduced long-term potentiation in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Collectively , Nrf2 dysfunction exacerbates the deleterious effects of obesity , compromising cerebromicrovascular and brain health by impairing neurovascular coupling mechanisms , BBB integrity and synaptic function and promoting neuroinflammation. These results support a possible role for age-related Nrf2 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease.
