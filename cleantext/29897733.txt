  Gene interference-based therapeutics represent a fascinating challenge and show enormous potential for cancer treatment , in which microRNA is used to correct abnormal gene. On the basis of the above , we introduced microRNA-31 to bind to 3 '- untranslated region of mtEF4 , resulting in the downregulation of its messenger RNA and protein to trigger cancer cells apoptosis through mitochondria-related pathway. To achieve better therapeutic effect , a mesoporous silica nanoparticle-based controlled nanoplatform had been developed. This system was fabricated by conjugation of microRNA-31 onto doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a poly ( ethyleneimine)/ hyaluronic acid coating , and drug release was triggered by acidic environment of tumors. By feat of surface functionalization and tumor-specific conjugation to nanoparticles , our drug delivery system could promote intracellular accumulation of drugs via the active transport at tumor site. More importantly , microRNA-31 not only directly targeted to mtEF4 to promote cell 's death , but had synergistic effects when used in combination with doxorubicin , and achieved excellent superadditive effects. As such , our research might provide new insights toward detecting high mtEF4 cancer and exploiting highly effective anticancer drugs.
