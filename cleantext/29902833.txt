  Dislocated pelvic fractures which require surgical repair are usually operated on via open surgery. Approach-related morbidity is reported with a frequency of up to 30 %. The aim of this anatomical study was to prove the feasibility of endoscopic visualisation of the relevant anatomical structures in pelvic surgery and to perform completely endoscopic plate osteosynthesis of the acetabulum with available standard laparoscopic instruments. In four human cadavers , we established an endoscopic preparation of the complete pelvic ring , from the symphysis to the iliosacral joint , including the quadrilateral plate and the sciatic nerve , and performed endoscopic plate osteosynthesis along the iliopectineal line. The endoscopic preparation of the complete pelvic ring and the quadrilateral plate was demonstrated step-by-step , followed by completely endoscopic plate osteosynthesis along the pelvic brim. Endoscopic , radiographic , and schematic pictures are used to illustrate the technique. The completely endoscopic preparation of the pelvic brim and the quadrilateral plate is feasible with available standard laparoscopic instruments. Moreover , plate osteosynthesis could be performed endoscopically. Further research on reduction techniques is necessary when planning to implement this technique into a clinical scenario.
