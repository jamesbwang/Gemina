  This study follows 70 children determined to have Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) before age three ( Time 1). Parents filled out questionnaires and standardized measures about their child when he/she was school-aged ( Time 2) , including information about their children 's preschool , kindergarten , and grade school educational settings. At Time 2 , the researchers placed children in three diagnostic groups of No ASD , ASD-Higher Functioning , and ASD-Lower Functioning. Retrospective results showed that most children were receiving intensive services at the preschool level. In kindergarten , there was some divergence among the three groups , with more intensive services continuing for the ASD groups. At school age , classroom placement and services reflected service patterns that were consistent with these three levels of disability.
