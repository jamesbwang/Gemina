  Herpesviruses have evolved to encode multiple microRNAs ( viral miRNAs ( v-miRs)) , a unique feature of this family of double stranded DNA ( dsDNA) viruses<pathogen> However , functional role of these v-miRs in host-pathogen interaction remains poorly studied. In this data , we examined the impact of oral disease associated v-miRs
