  The case of Jahi McMath has captured the attention of the public , healthcare professionals , and ethicists. Jahi was declared brain dead in late 2013 , but her family transferred her to New Jersey to continue organ support. A lengthy legal battle has been ongoing since then. Jahi 's family and two neurologists , Drs. Calixto Machado and Alan Shewmon , believe that she is not brain dead. Her family and Dr. Shewmon think that she is capable of following commands , thus making her minimally conscious. Review of case materials. Because brain death is an irreversible coma<symptom> , one of three conclusions must be drawn: 1) Jahi was never dead; 2) Jahi met the criteria for brain death , but she is n't dead now; or 3) Jahi 's movements are not purposeful responses , and she has been brain dead since 2013. The possibility that a person who was declared brain dead is now following commands threatens to erode the notion that brain death should be considered legal death. The discordant ideas that Jahi is brain dead and is following commands can only be reconciled if a formal evaluation for determination of death is repeated by reputable examiners.
