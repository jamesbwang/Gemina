  Although the stability of β-lactam antibiotics is a known issue , none of the previously reported bioanalytical methods had an adequate evaluation on their stability. In the current study , the stability of cefepime , meropenem , piperacillin , and tazobactam under various conditions was comprehensively evaluated. The evaluated parameters include stock solution stability , short-term stability , long-term stability , freeze-thaw stability , processed sample stability and whole blood stability. When stored at -20 °C , the stock solution of meropenem in methanol is stable for up to 3 weeks , and the stock solutions of cefepime , piperacillin , and tazobactam are stable for up to 6 weeks. All four antibiotics were stable in human plasma for up to 3 months when stored at -80 °C and stable in whole blood for up to 4 hours at room temperature. Short-term stability results indicated that all four β-lactams are stable at room temperature for 2 hours , but substantial degradation was observed when their plasma samples were stored at room temperature for 24 hours , with the degradation of cefepime , meropenem , piperacillin and tazobactam being 30.1 % , 75.6 % , 49.0 % and 37.7 % , respectively. As the stability information is method-independent , our stability results can be used as a reference by other research groups that work with these antibiotics.
