  Stroke-induced dysarthria<symptom> is caused by muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , sacral or muscular dystonia , and incoordination<symptom> of the articulatory organ formed by organic lesions<symptom> caused by cerebral vascular obstruction or sudden bursting of blood vessels in the brain , which may cause abnormal breathing patterns , pronunciation , resonance , rhythm , and unclear articulation. The Six Character Formula , or Liuzijue qigong ( LQG) , is an essential part of Chinese traditional exercises and focuses on breathing-speech synchronization. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of LQG with traditional breathing training ( combined with basic articulation training in both groups) in patients with post-stroke dysarthria<symptom>. The proposed study will be a single-center randomized controlled trial. A total of 100 patients , with a modified Frenchay Dysarthria<symptom> Assessment ( FDA) dysarthria<symptom> assessment score < 27 and with a FDA speech breathing level â‰¥ b will be randomly divided into study ( LQG , n = 50) and control ( conventional breathing training , n = 50) groups. Basic articulation training will be conducted once a day , five times a week for 3 weeks. Data collection will be conducted at baseline , 1 week , and 2 weeks post-treatment initiation and after completion of the treatment ( 3 weeks). Comprehensive analyses will be conducted to measure and compare any differences in speech breathing dysfunction levels , comprehensive evaluation of dysarthria<symptom> , maximum phonation time ( MPT) , maximal counting ability , signal-noise ( S/Z) ratio , and loudness scales between the study and control groups. This trial will provide evidence about the effectiveness of LQG for improvement of speech breathing function and speech ability in patients with post-stroke dysarthria<symptom> complicated with abnormal breathing.
