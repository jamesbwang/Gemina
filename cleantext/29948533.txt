  Inclusion of stakeholder voices in the allocation of research funding can increase the relevance of results and improve community engagement in research. We describe the results of an online survey that gathered input from community stakeholders regarding autism research priorities. A demographically diverse sample of respondents ( N = 6004; 79.1 % female; 72.5 % ages 30-59; 86.4 % USA) completed the survey. Results indicated a preference for applied relative to basic science topics , though both basic and applied science areas were rated as important. Respondents gave their highest ratings to research focused on co-occurring conditions , health and well-being , adult transition , and lifespan issues. These results can guide decision-making by public and private funders when developing science funding priorities and engaging in science dissemination activities.
