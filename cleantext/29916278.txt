  In physiological and pathological environments , the concentration of oxygen around osteoblasts varies widely. No studies have systematically evaluated the effects of different oxygen concentrations on the proliferation , survival , migration , and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. In this study , we cultured the osteoblast precursor cell line MC3T3-E1 in small individual chambers with oxygen concentrations of 1 % , 3 % , 6 % , 9 % , and 21 %. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the proliferation index test and EdU staining. To test cell survival , a live/dead assay was performed. A tablet scratch assay was performed to detect the migratory ability of the cells. Bone nodule<disease> formation experiments and immunofluorescence and Western blotting analyses of osteogenic-related proteins were performed to assess the osteogenic differentiation of the cells. We found that the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ability of MC3T3-E1 cells in different oxygen concentrations were both approximately bell-shaped curves and that the optimal oxygen concentrations were approximately 6 % and 9 % , respectively. The live/dead assay showed that the survival of MC3T3-E1 cells in different oxygen concentrations was affected by the amount of serum. The tablet scratch experiment showed that there was greater cell migration with oxygen concentrations of 1 % , 3 % , and 21 % than with oxygen concentrations of 6 % and 9 %. Our results have significant reference value for the intervention of the pathological processes involving osteoblasts , such as fracture , osteoporosis , and some vascular diseases. These results also have an important guiding role for the new scientific idea that osteoblasts can function as treatment cells to repair bone defects.
