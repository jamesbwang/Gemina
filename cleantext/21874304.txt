  The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of delivering tumor antigens and enhancing the antigen cross-presentation of dendritic cells ( DCs) by aluminum hydroxide nanoparticle with polyethyleneimine ( PEI) modification ( LV@HPA/ PEI). The LV@HPA nanoparticles were modified by PEI first , then the influence of LV@HPA/ PEI on DCs was examined. The distinct expression of ovalbumin ( OVA) protein transported into DCs by LV@HPA/ PEI was observed by flow cytometry and Western blot. The biocompatibility of LV@HPA/ PEI , maturity and antigen cross-presentation of DCs was observed in vitro. Tumor derived autophagosomes ( DRibbles) combined with LV@HPA/ PEI were loaded into DCs , and DC vaccines were used to immunize mice. The percentage of CD3 In our study , we described how LV@HPA/ PEI can be a functionalized antigen delivery system with notable antigen transport effect and negligible cytotoxicity. It was found that LV@HPA/ PEI could be easily internalized into DCs to assist antigen release into the cytoplasm. In addition , DCs matured gradually after loading with LV@HPA/ PEI-OVA , which increased significantly the cytokine IL-12 secretion and expression of surface molecules CD80 and CD86. Interestingly , DCs loaded with LV@HPA/ PEI-DRibbles could promote the activation of tumor-specific T cells both in murine and in human T cells. In the following in vivo experiments , the vaccine of LV@HPA/ PEI-DRibble-DCs significantly inhibited tumor growth and improved the survival rate of the PancO2 tumor-bearing mice. We established a high-performance anti-tumor vaccine of DCs loaded with LV @ HPA/PEI nanoparticles and tumor-associated antigens in autophagosomes ( DRibbles) , which could serve as a therapeutic strategy in cancer immunotherapy.
