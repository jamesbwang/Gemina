  Mitochondria are essential organelles , found within eukaryotic cells , which contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) has traditionally been used in population genetic and biogeographic studies as a maternally-inherited and evolutionary-neutral genetic marker. However , it is now clear that polymorphisms within the mtDNA sequence are routinely non-neutral , and furthermore several studies have suggested that such mtDNA polymorphisms are also sensitive to thermal selection. These observations led to the formulation of the `` mitochondrial climatic adaptation '' hypothesis , for which all published evidence to date is correlational. Here , we use laboratory-based experimental evolution in the fruit fly , Drosophila melanogaster , to test whether thermal selection can shift population frequencies of two mtDNA haplogroups whose natural frequencies exhibit clinal associations with latitude along the Australian east-coast. We present experimental evidence that the thermal regime in which the laboratory populations were maintained drove changes in haplogroup frequencies across generations. Our results strengthen the emerging view that intra-specific mtDNA variants are sensitive to selection , and suggest spatial distributions of mtDNA variants in natural populations of metazoans might reflect adaptation to climatic environments rather than within-population coalescence and diffusion of selectively-neutral haplotypes across populations.
