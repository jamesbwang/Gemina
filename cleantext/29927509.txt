  Nursing students traditionally find bioscience difficult and anxiety<symptom> provoking. This has important ramifications , as anxiety<symptom> can hinder comprehension and lead to poor exam performance. The aim of the present study was to assess whether there was any difference between the anxiety<symptom> levels of nursing students during their bioscience laboratory classes compared to their clinical laboratory classes. Students were recruited from a first year Bachelor of Nursing program. The self-report State-Trait Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( short form) was administered at the start of all classes throughout the semester. Anxiety<symptom> scores of students between the units were compared using paired t-tests , and repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to measure anxiety<symptom> scores within units over time. There were no significant differences in anxiety<symptom> scores in the bioscience and clinical classes; however , the students were significantly more anxious in the theory classes. These findings suggest that nursing students do not find the subject of bioscience any more anxiety<symptom> provoking than other nursing subjects. Bioscience educators should continue to focus on the integration of bioscience with nursing practice , while broader anxiety-reduction strategies throughout the curriculum should be implemented.
