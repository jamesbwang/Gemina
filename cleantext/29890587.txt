  Tricolsan ( TCS) , an antimicrobial agent , is considered as emerging pollutant due to its wide dispersive use in personal care products and high aquatic toxicity. In the present study , phase I metabolism of triclosan was investigated through laboratory electrochemical simulation studies. The products formed in the electrochemical ( EC) cell were identified by online and offline coupling with QTRAP and high-resolution FTICR mass spectrometers , respectively. The sequential formation and disappearance of each product , with the continuous increase of voltage from 0 to 3500 mV , was observed to reveal the transformation pathways of TCS. The toxic potential of TCS and the identified products was estimated using Quantitative structure-activity relationship ( QSAR) modeling on 16 target proteins. The toxicity change of TCS during simulated metabolism and toxicological effects of reaction mixture were assessed by Fish embryo toxicity ( FET) test ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR). Eight metabolites formed during the simulated metabolism of TCS mainly via the mechanisms of hydroxylation , ether-bond cleavage and cyclization. In FET test , the reaction mixture ( LC
