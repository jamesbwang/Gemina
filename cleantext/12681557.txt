  Epidermoid cysts<symptom> are slow-growing benign tumors that represent less than 1-2 % of all intracranial tumors. They are even rarer in supratentorial intraparenchymal location accounting for 2 % of all intracranial epidermoid cysts<symptom>. We present a rare case of pediatric supratentorial intraparenchymal epidermoid cyst<symptom> with its variable radiographic features , surgical management , histopathology , and a review of the literature.
