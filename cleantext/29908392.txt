  Social anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms are relatively common in adolescents with Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disabilities ( MBID). Unfortunately , there are only a few studies that focus on examining processes underlying social anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in these adolescents. The aim was to examine the differences between self- and peer-rated likability in relation to social anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in the classroom environment. 631 normative non-clinical adolescents with MBID completed questionnaires to measure social anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and the estimation of their own likability by peers. Peer-reported likability was derived from peer-rating scales on likability. Adolescents with higher levels of social anxiety<symptom> significantly rated their own likability as lower than their non-anxious peers. However , socially adolescents were equally liked by their peers. Adolescents with higher levels of depression<symptom> were significantly less liked by their peers , but still underestimated their own likability than adolescents with lower levels of depression<symptom> Social anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> are linked to a biased interpretation of likability , but only depression<symptom> is linked to actually being less liked by peers. Social anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> are partly based on similar underlying cognitive biases.
