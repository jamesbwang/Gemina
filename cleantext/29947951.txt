  The RING-type E3 ligase AtARRE participates in the plant ABA responding as a negative regulator. Ubiquitination protease system ( UPS) is significant in post-transcriptional regulation. In UPS , E3 ligase recognizes the substrate protein and mediates the polyubiquitin chain onto the substrate. Here , we identified a new gene , named Arabidopsis thaliana ABA-related RING-type E3 ligase ( AtARRE) , which induced by ABA and NaCl. AtARRE encodes a functional RING-type E3 ligase protein localized in nucleus and plasma membrane of Arabidopsis. Physiological analysis demonstrated that mutation of AtARRE ( T-DNA insert mutants atarre-1 and atarre-2) caused plants hypersensitivity<disease> to ABA , including enhanced stomatal closure , reduced root elongation and seed germination. However , overexpression of AtARRE transgenic lines caused plants hyposensitive to ABA compared with WT and mutant atarre plants. Under the treatment of ABA , the transcript abundances of ABA-responsive genes RD29A , RD29B , RD22 and ABI5 in atarre mutant plants were markedly higher than those of WT and AtARRE overexpression lines. Hence , these results indicate that AtARRE acts as a negative regulator of ABA-mediated stress responses in Arabidopsis.
