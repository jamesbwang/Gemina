  Tandem devices combining perovskite and silicon solar cells are promising candidates to achieve power conversion efficiencies above 30 % at reasonable costs. State-of-the-art monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem devices have so far featured silicon bottom cells that are polished on their front side to be compatible with the perovskite fabrication process. This concession leads to higher potential production costs , higher reflection losses and non-ideal light trapping. To tackle this issue , we developed a top cell deposition process that achieves the conformal growth of multiple compounds with controlled optoelectronic properties directly on the micrometre-sized pyramids of textured monocrystalline silicon. Tandem devices featuring a silicon heterojunction cell and a nanocrystalline silicon recombination junction demonstrate a certified steady-state efficiency of 25.2 %. Our optical design yields a current density of 19.5 mA cm
