  Catalyst- , and chemical oxidant-free electrochemical azole C-H aminations were accomplished via cross-dehydrogenative C-H/N-H functionalization. The catalyst-free electrochemical C-H amination proved feasible on azoles with high levels of efficacy and selectivity , avoiding the use of stoichiometric oxidants under ambient conditions. Likewise , the C ( sp3)- H nitrogenation proved viable under otherwise identical conditions. The dehydrogenative C-H amination featured ample scope , including cyclic and acyclic aliphatic amines as well as anilines , and employed sustainable electricity as the sole oxidant.
