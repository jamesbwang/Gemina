  This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and concentration of total aflatoxin ( TAF) ochratoxin A ( OTA) , zearalenone ( ZEN) and deoxynivalenol ( DON) in bread , cornflakes , breakfast cereals and pasta-based products through meta-analysis. The required databases including ( PubMed and Scopus databases) were investigated to collect data on the concentration and prevalence of mentioned mycotoxins in cereal-based products. Among 2461 explored articles in identification step , 38 articles with 9627 samples were included in the conducted meta-analysis. The prevalence and concentration of studied mycotoxins varied with the cereal-based food studied. In this context , the overall rank order of mycotoxins prevalence in the cereal foods was OTA > DON > ZEN > TAF > 15-ADON > 3-ADON. Also , the overall rank order of mycotoxins based on concentration in the cereal foods investigated was DON > ZEN > 15-ADON > OTA > 3-ADON > TAF. The findings of this meta-analysis may be useful for the building of risk assessment models aiming to derive data for the development of specific actions to reduce the exposure to OTA , ZEN , TAF , and DON through the consumption of the cereal-based products.
