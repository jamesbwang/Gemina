  Silkworm cocoon was recorded to cure carbuncle in the Compendium of Materia Medica. Previous studies have demonstrated that the supplemental silk protein sericin exhibits anticancer activity. In the present study , we investigated the effects of silk fibroin peptide ( SFP) extracted from silkworm cocoons against human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and its possible anticancer mechanisms. SFP that we prepared had high content of glycine ( ~ 30 %) and showed a molecular weight of ~ 10 kDa. Intragastric administration of SFP ( 30 g/kg/d) for 14 days did not affect the weights , vital signs , routine blood indices , and blood biochemical parameters in mice. MTT assay showed that SFP dose-dependently inhibited the growth of human lung cancer A549 and H460 cells in vitro with IC
