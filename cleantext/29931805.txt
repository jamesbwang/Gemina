  Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease caused by atherosclerosis. In fact , an arterial wall lesion<symptom> centered on the accumulation of cholesterol-rich lipids and the accompanying inflammatory response generates a plaque , whose rupture may result in a thrombus with fatal consequences. Plaque characterization for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis is generally performed through standard histopathological examination based on hematoxylin/eosin staining , which is operator-dependent and requires relatively long procedures. In this framework , nonlinear optical microscopy is a valid , label-free alternative to standard diagnostic methods. We combined second-harmonic generation ( SHG) , two-photon excited fluorescence ( TPEF) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in a multimodal scheme for obtaining morphological and molecular information on human carotid ex vivo specimens affected by atherosclerosis. In this study , discrimination between different tissues within the atherosclerotic plaque was achieved based on both lifetime , TPEF-to-SHG ratio , and image pattern analysis. The presented methodology aims to be a starting point for future fully automated and fast characterization of atherosclerotic biopsies; moreover , it could be extended to the study of other tissues and pathologies.
