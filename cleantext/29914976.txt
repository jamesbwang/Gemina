  Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T-cells demonstrate efficacy in B-cell malignancies , leading to FDA approval of axicaptagene ciloleucel in October 2017 and tisagenlecleucel in May 2018 for large B-cell lymphomas after two prior lines of therapy. Durable remissions are seen in 30-40 % of study-treated patients , but unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome<disease> and neurotoxicity require administration in specialized centers.
