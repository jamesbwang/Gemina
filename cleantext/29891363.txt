  Resistance to the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase ( ACCase)- and acetolactate synthase ( ALS)- inhibiting herbicides in shortawn foxtail ( Alopecurus aequalis) has been reported in wheat fields of eastern China. To better understand the distribution of the resistant populations and the occurrence of the target-site mutations , 74 populations collected from Anhui , Jiangsu and Shandong province were surveyed , and the ACCase and ALS gene fragments , encompassing all the documented mutant codon positions , were amplified and sequenced. Plants from 37 and 34 populations survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl treatment at 62.1 g a.i. ha
