  To evaluate and characterize long-term clinical changes in keratoconus cases not requiring surgical treatment because of the absence of clinically significant visual degradation and to design a predictive model for the progression rate. This retrospective longitudinal study enrolled 68 nonsurgically treated keratoconic eyes of 46 patients ( age range , 18-66 years) , with a follow-up period of 6 years ± 12 months. Visual , refractive , topographic , and aberrometric changes were evaluated , detecting the abnormal levels of longitudinal changes in each clinical variable analyzed ( percentiles 10 % or 90 %). Subsequently , the eyes were stratified into progression and no-progression groups based on the different variables evaluated , analyzing baseline differences between them. A progression index ( PI %) was defined , and its relationship with baseline data was modeled using multiple linear regression analysis. Significant differences were detected in more quantity of baseline parameters between progression and no-progression groups for changes in sphere , spherical-like and coma-like root mean square , central mean keratometry ( KM3mm) , corneal asphericity ( Q80mm) , and central astigmatism ( Ast3mm). The progression index ( PI %) was defined using these variables , obtaining a mean value of 24.39 ± 51.09 % and a median of 1.85 %. This parameter was significantly related to the baseline sphere , K23 mm ( steepest central keratometry) , and Q80 mm ( P < 0.001 , R = 0.429). More pronounced progression seems to be present in myopic eyes with central localized steepening but normal mid-periphery flattening. A new index has been defined to characterize and predict the level of progression in nonsurgically treated keratoconus in a medium-long term.
