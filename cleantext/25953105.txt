  The fabrication of perovskite solar cells in an N-I-P structure with compact titanium dioxide blocking , mesoporous titanium dioxide scaffold , single-step perovskite and hole-transport layers deposited using the slot-die coating technique is reported. Devices on fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrates with evaporated gold top contacts and four slot-die-coated layers are demonstrated , and best cells reach stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 7 %. This work demonstrates the suitability of slot-die coating for the production of layers within this perovskite solar cell stack and the potential to transfer to large area and roll-to-roll manufacturing processes.
