  This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments ( 2016 ‚Åª 2018 period) in the nano and micromotors field for biosensing applications. Nano and micromotor designs , functionalization , propulsion modes and transduction mechanism are described. A second important part of the review is devoted to novel in vitro and in vivo biosensing schemes. The potential and future prospect of such moving nanoscale biosensors are given in the conclusions.
