  Cryptochromes ( CRYs<symptom>) are blue light receptors that mediate light regulation of plant growth and development. Land plants possess various numbers of cryptochromes , CRY1 and CRY2 , which serve overlapping and partially redundant functions in different plant species. Cryptochromes exist as physiologically inactive monomers in darkness; photoexcited cryptochromes undergo homodimerization to increase their affinity to the CRY-signaling proteins , such as CIBs ( CRY2-interacting bHLH) , PIFs ( Phytochrome-Interacting Factors) , AUX/IAA ( Auxin/INDOLE -3-ACETIC ACID) , and the COP1-SPAs ( Constitutive Photomorphogenesis 1-Suppressors of Phytochrome A) complexes. These light-dependent protein-protein interactions alter the activity of the CRY-signaling proteins to change gene expression and developmental programs in response to light. In the meantime , photoexcitation also changes the affinity of cryptochromes to the CRY-regulatory proteins , such as BICs ( Blue-light Inhibitors of CRYs<symptom>) and PPKs ( Photoregulatory Protein Kinases) , to modulate the activity , modification , or abundance of cryptochromes and photosensitivity of plants in response to the changing light environment.
