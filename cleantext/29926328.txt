  Around 2.7 billion people in the world cook with polluting fuels , such as wood , crop residue , animal dung , charcoal , coal , and kerosene. Household air pollution from cooking with polluting fuels is recognized as a major risk factor for the disease burden. In this study , we examine the effect of using polluting fuels for cooking on the respiratory health of children in Pakistan. This study uses cross-sectional data from Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2012-13 , with the sample size of 11,040 children under 5 years of age. Using logistic regression model , we control for factors such as averting activities , child characteristics , household characteristics , mother characteristics , and the unobserved factors using fixed effects. The results show that children in households using polluting fuels are 1.5 times more likely to have symptoms of acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infection<disease> ( ARI) than children in households using cleaner fuels.
