  Treatment of fetal rat and embryonic chicken with exogenous glucocorticoids induces premature differentiation of growth hormone ( GH) secreting cells. The effect of corticosterone ( CORT) on somatotroph differentiation was mostly studied in pituitary cells in vitro. Currently , there is no evidence for glucocorticoid-mediated induction of somatotroph differentiation during pituitary development in bird species other than chicken. In this study , we sought to find out if in ovo injection of corticosterone into developing goose embryos could induce premature increase of GH in somatotrophs. On embryonic day ( e) 15 , the albumen of fertile goose eggs was injected with 300 μl of 0.9 % saline , 300 μl 5 × 10
