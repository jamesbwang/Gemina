  The study reported in this article examined the relationship between psychosocial functioning and tendency to forgive , social support , and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) symptoms of terror survivors ( N = 108). Structural equation modeling was used to examine whether PTSD symptoms mediated the association between tendency to forgive , social support , and psychosocial functioning. The findings demonstrated that the association between tendency to forgive and psychosocial functioning was mediated exclusively by PTSD symptoms , whereas the association between social support and psychosocial functioning was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms. The study reinforces the importance of addressing trauma survivors ' psychosocial functioning as an emotional state associated with tendency to forgive , social support , and PTSD symptoms. In addition , the findings suggest that when treating trauma survivors , therapists should be aware of PTSD not only as an emotional consequence of trauma , but also as a mediator of numerous emotional and cognitive coping mechanisms.
