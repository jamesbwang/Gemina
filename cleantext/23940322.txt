  As an important oil crop , growth habit of sesame ( Sesamum indicum L.) is naturally indeterminate , which brings about asynchronous maturity of capsules and causes loss of yield. The genetic basis of determinate growth habit in sesame was investigated by classical genetic analysis through multiple populations , results revealed that it was controlled by an unique recessive gene. The genotyping by sequencing ( GBS) approach was employed for high-throughput SNP identification and genotyping in the F This study dissected genetic basis of determinate growth habit in sesame , constructed a new high-density bin map and mapped a novel determinacy gene. Results of this study demonstrate that we employed an optimized approach to get fine-accuracy , high-resolution and high-efficiency mapping result in sesame. The findings provided important foundation for sesame determinacy gene cloning and were expected to be applied in breeding for cultivars suited to mechanized production.
