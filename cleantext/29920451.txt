  The aim of the present study is to investigate the expression profiles of circular RNAs ( circRNAs) in IDH-wild type ( IDH-wt) glioblastoma and explore the differences in circRNAs expression between IDH-wt glioblastoma and adjacent normal brain. circRNA expression profiles were detected by circRNA microarray in three matched pairs of IDH-wt glioblastoma and adjacent normal brain. qRT-PCR was used to verify the differential expression of circRNAs from microarray analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze potential functions of the differentially expressed circRNAs in IDH-wt glioblastoma. Compared with the adjacent normal brain tissues , 254 circRNAs were upregulated and 361 circRNAs were downregulated in IDH-wt glioblastoma with a â‰¥ 1.5-fold change. A total of 12 differentially expressed circRNAs were randomly selected and validated a good correlation of results from circRNA-seq with qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology ( GO) analysis revealed the differentially expressed circRNAs possibly involved in cell division , DNA damage repair , cytoskeleton , and protein ubiquitination. 46 and 50 miRNAs were predicted to be adsorbed by the top 10 upregulated circRNAs and top 10 downregulated circRNAs , respectively. Differential expression of circRNAs may be associated with IDH-wt glioblastoma development and progression , and these circRNAs can be identified as biomarkers for prognosis prediction and targets for treatment.
