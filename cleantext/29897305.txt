  With rates of obesity among adults and youth rising in Canada , it is clear that the current approaches currently used to reduce the prevalence of obesity , with an emphasis on individual weight management interventions focused on restrictive dieting , are not proving successful at a population level. Given that obesity is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes , is placing a multi-billion-dollar economic burden on Canada and disproportionately affects disadvantaged groups , such as Aboriginal Canadians and women of low socioeconomic status , it is a health and social issue that must be addressed immediately by social workers and policy makers. This article discusses the benefits of implementing a multifaceted population-level intervention that is health centered , evidence based , antistigmatizing to obese individuals , and accessible to all Canadians. The proposed intervention includes increased education for primary care physicians , the development of walkable neighborhoods , taxation of junk food , financial incentives , clear nutrition labelling , public awareness campaigns , regulation of food advertising ( especially targeted to children) , and school-based health promotion initiatives. This article also discusses the unique role that social workers must play in leading the charge against the stigmatization of obese individuals , while also championing policies to effectively reduce the prevalence of obesity in Canada.
