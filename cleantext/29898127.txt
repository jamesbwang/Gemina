  The role of epidemics in the demographic collapse of the Amerindians in Mexico and Andean America after the arrival of the Spanish is discussed. Ernst Mayr 's categories of ultimate ( or evolutionary) and proximal ( or functional) causes are used to argue that ultimate causes , such as genetics , which gave the Spanish immunological resistance , were manifested in a very stratified setting , triggering the destruction of the Incas and Aztecs. Recent interpretations of colonization have played down the importance of epidemics or combined them with social , economic , and political factors , interpreted here as proximate causes. We understand that only by articulating these two categories can the importance of epidemics in the Spanish conquest of Latin America be understood.
