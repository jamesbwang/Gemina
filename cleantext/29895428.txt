  Adaptation in mating signals and preferences has generally been explained by sexual selection. We propose that adaptation in such mating traits might also arise via a non-mutually exclusive process wherein individuals preferentially disperse to habitats where they experience high mating performance. Here we explore the evolutionary implications of this process.
