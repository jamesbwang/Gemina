  A multistep paper-based analytical device ( mPAD) was designed and applied to the voltammetric determination of total inorganic arsenic. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on a boron-doped diamond ( AuNP/BDD) electrode and the determination of total inorganic arsenic is accomplished with a single device. Total inorganic arsenic can be determined by first reducing As ( V) to As ( III) using thiosulfate in 1.0 mol L
