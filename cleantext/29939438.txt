  Iridium ( III) is often considered to be one of the most inert octahedral metal ions. Herein we present a phenanthroimidazole-based bis-cyclometalated iridium ( III) chloride undergoing a facile chloro ligand exchange with iodine in a gas-solid reaction under ambient conditions. Monitoring the progress of the reaction by X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the crystal-packing-induced exceptional stereoselectivity of this topochemical transformation. The results provide excellent opportunities to modulate the geometry and kinetic properties of cyclometalated iridium ( III) complexes that may be very promising in catalysis and design of anticancer agents.
