  Thermalization losses limit the photon-to-power conversion of solar cells at the high-energy side of the solar spectrum , as electrons quickly lose their energy relaxing to the band edge. Hot-electron transfer could reduce these losses. Here , we demonstrate fast and efficient hot-electron transfer between lead selenide and cadmium selenide quantum dots assembled in a quantum-dot heterojunction solid. In this system , the energy structure of the absorber material and of the electron extracting material can be easily tuned via a variation of quantum-dot size , allowing us to tailor the energetics of the transfer process for device applications. The efficiency of the transfer process increases with excitation energy as a result of the more favorable competition between hot-electron transfer and electron cooling. The experimental picture is supported by time-domain density functional theory calculations , showing that electron density is transferred from lead selenide to cadmium selenide quantum dots on the sub-picosecond timescale.
