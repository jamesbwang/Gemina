  Observe the association of foods habits , body composition , lifestyle habits , and loss of gustatory function with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). This comparative study enrolled 75 patients with AD ( mean age 77.5 years) and 267 healthy volunteers ( mean age 73 years). Weight , height , body mass index ( BMI) , body fat , visceral fat , muscle mass , and waist circumference were measured. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was measured by the Mediterranean-Diet-Adherence Screener. Gustatory function was investigated using a threshold and triangle test. Cases with AD presented lower BMI and weight and higher sleep hours , being statistically significant the difference between cases and controls ( P = .02; P = .001; P = .001 , respectively). Patients with AD showed lower adherence to exercise and Mediterranean diet as shown by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener-score ( 8.12 ± 2.5 vs 8.65 ± 2.4). The gustatory function was impaired in patients with AD when compared to controls. Patients with AD show worst outcomes in terms of anthropometric measurements , lifestyle habits ( diet , exercise) , and gustatory function than controls.
