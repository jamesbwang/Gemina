  High legume intake has been shown to have beneficial effects on the health of humans. The use of nutritional biomarkers , as a complement to self-reported questionnaires , could assist in evaluating dietary intake and downstream effects on human health. The aim of this study was to investigate potential biomarkers of the consumption of pulses ( i.e. , white beans , chickpeas , and lentils) by using untargeted NMR-based metabolomics. Meals rich in pulses were consumed by a total of 11 participants in a randomized crossover study and multilevel partial least-squares regression was employed for paired comparisons. Metabolomics analysis indicated that trigonelline , 3-methylhistidine , dimethylglycine , trimethylamine , and lysine were potential , though not highly specific , biomarkers of pulse intake. Furthermore , monitoring of these metabolites for a period of 48 h after intake revealed a range of different excretion patterns among pulses. Following the consumption of pulses , a metabolomic profiling revealed that the concentration ratios of trigonelline , choline , lysine , and histidine were similar to those found in urine. In conclusion , this study identified potential urinary biomarkers of exposure to dietary pulses and provided valuable information about the time-response effect of these putative biomarkers.
