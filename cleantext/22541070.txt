  Amplified inflammation<symptom> is important for the progression of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). However , how this enhanced inflammation<symptom> is regulated remains largely unknown. Deletion of DICER leads to progressive dopamine neuronal loss and induces gliosis. We hypothesized that the homeostasis of microglial DICER would be responsible for the amplified inflammation<symptom> in the mouse model of PD. The microglia or C57BL/6 mice were treated or injected with l-methyl-4-phenyl-l ,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP) or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( MPP Microglial DICER was phosphorylated at serine 1456 by c-jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) and downregulated in response to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( MPP JNK-mediated microglial DICER degradation potentiates inflammation<symptom> to induce dopaminergic neuronal loss. Thus , preventing microglial DICER degradation could be a novel strategy for controlling neuroinflammation in PD.
