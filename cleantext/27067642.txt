  The affordability of diets modelled on the current ( less healthy) diet compared to a healthy diet based on Dietary Guidelines was calculated for population groups in New Zealand. Diets using common foods were developed for a household of four for the total population , Māori and Pacific groups. Māori and Pacific nutrition expert panels ensured the diets were appropriate. Each current ( less healthy) diet was based on eating patterns identified from national nutrition surveys. Food prices were collected from retail outlets. Only the current diets contained alcohol , takeaways and discretionary foods. The modelled healthy diet was cheaper than the current diet for the total population ( 3.5 % difference) and Pacific households ( 4.5 % difference) and similar in cost for Māori households ( 0.57 % difference). When the diets were equivalent in energy , the healthy diet was more expensive than the current diet for all population groups ( by 8.5 % to 15.6 %). For households on the minimum wage , the diets required 27 % to 34 % of household income , and if receiving income support , required 41 ⁻ 52 % of household income. Expert panels were invaluable in guiding the process for specific populations. Both the modelled healthy and current diets are unaffordable for some households as a considerable portion of income was required to purchase either diet. Policies are required to improve food security by lowering the cost of healthy food or improving household income.
