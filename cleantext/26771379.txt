  In India , 59 % of urban slums are `` non-notified '' or lack legal recognition by the government. We use data on 2,901 slums from four waves of the National Sample Survey spanning nearly 20 years to assess the relationship between a slum 's legal status and the severity of deprivation in access to basic services , including piped water , latrines , and electricity. Our analysis reveals a progressive reduction in deprivation the longer that a slum has been notified. These findings suggest that legally recognizing non-notified slums and targeting government aid to these settlements may be crucial for improving health outcomes and diminishing urban disparities.
