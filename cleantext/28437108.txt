  Advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have facilitated the manufacturing of many valuable-added compounds and commodity chemicals using microbial cell factories in the past decade. However , due to complexity of cellular metabolism , the optimization of metabolic pathways for maximal production represents a grand challenge and an unavoidable barrier for metabolic engineering. Recently , cell-free protein synthesis system ( CFPS) has been emerging as an enabling alternative to address challenges in biomanufacturing. This review summarizes the recent progresses of CFPS in rapid prototyping of biosynthetic pathways and genetic circuits ( biosensors) to speed up design-build-test ( DBT) cycles of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.
