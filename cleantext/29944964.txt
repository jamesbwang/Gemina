  Interoception , the capacity to perceive internal bodily states , is thought to influence cognitive , affective and interpersonal functioning. It is frequently assessed using the heartbeat counting task , introduced recently in interoceptive research. In this task participants are requested to count their heartbeats without relying on external cues. Interoceptive Accuracy ( i.e. , IAcc) scores are then computed based on absolute comparisons between actual and reported heartbeats. In a large sample of participants ( N = 572) , we observed that , whereas IAcc scores are meant to be theoretically agnostic to error type ( i.e. , over- or underestimation of heartbeats) , these scores massively ( i.e. , > 95 %) reflect under-reports. Of concern too , the correlation between actual and reported heartbeats is low overall ( r = .16) , varies non-linearly across IAcc score quantiles , and suggests undistinguishable interoceptive capacities within the top 60 % IAcc scorers. We also found that IAcc scores , which are conceptually independent from actual heart rates , are structurally bound to them. Finally , we show that IAcc scores vary across the time intervals used in the task. We encourage researchers using this score for studying cognitive and emotional processes to reconsider its meaning.
