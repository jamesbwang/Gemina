  Fungalysins from several phytopathogenic fungi<pathogen> have been shown to be involved in cleavage of plant chitinases. While fungal chitinases are responsible for cell wall remodeling during growth and morphogenesis , plant chitinases are important components of immunity. This study describes a dual function of the Ustilago maydis fungalysin UmFly1 in modulation of both plant and fungal chitinases. Genetic , biochemical and microscopic experiments were performed to elucidate the in vitro and in planta functions of U. maydis UmFly1. U. maydis ∆ umfly1 mutants show significantly reduced virulence , which coincides with reduced cleavage of the maize chitinase ZmChiA within its chitin-binding domain. Moreover , deletion of umfly1 affected the cell separation of haploid U. maydis sporidia. This phenotype is associated with posttranslational activation of the endogenous chitinase UmCts1. Genetic complementation of the ∆ umfly1 mutant with a homologous gene from closely related , but nonpathogenic , yeast fully rescued the cell separation defect in vitro , but it could not recover the ∆ umfly1 defect in virulence and cleavage of the maize chitinase. We report on the dual function of the secreted fungalysin UmFly1. We hypothesize that co-evolution of U. maydis with its host plant extended the endogenous function of UmFly1 towards the modulation of plant chitinase activity to promote infection.
