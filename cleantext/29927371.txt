  Ribavirin ( RBV) has been used for the last 20 years to treat patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection. This pluripotent drug is believed to induce mutagenesis in HCV<pathogen> RNA. However , for cell-cultured HCV<pathogen> ( HCVcc) this phenomenon has only been investigated in genotype 2a recombinants. Here we studied the mutations that developed in HCVcc of genotypes 1a and 3a treated with RBV or ribavirin triphosphate ( RBV-TP) compared to non-treated controls. Analysis was performed on the amplified full-length open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>) of recovered viruses following next-generation sequencing and clonal analyses. Compared to non-treated controls , the spread of TNcc ( 1a) and DBN3acc ( 3a) HCVcc was delayed by RBV and RBV-TP at concentrations of 40 ÂµM or higher. The delay in HCVcc spread was associated with increased new single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP). Significantly higher numbers of new SNP were observed in TNcc ( 1a) viruses<pathogen> treated with RBV or RBV-TP compared to matched non-treated controls. RBV or RBV-TP treatment led to significantly increased proportions of new G-to-A and C-to-U SNP compared to non-treated TNcc ( 1a). Clonal analyses confirmed a significantly increased mutation rate in RBV-treated TNcc ( 1a). Synonymous pairwise distances increased in both viruses across the complete ORF<pathogen> under RBV and RBV-TP treatment compared to controls. Consensus-shifts in single samples of RBV- or RBV-TP-treated TNcc ( 1a) viruses<pathogen> occurred in proteins E1 , p7 , NS3 and NS4B. No non-synonymous consensus changes were observed in DBN3acc ( 3a). This study supports a biased G-to-A and C-to-U mutagenic effect of RBV and RBV-TP throughout the entire ORF<pathogen> of HCV<pathogen> genotypes 1a and 3a.
