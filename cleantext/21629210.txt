  There is an increasing awareness of the prevalence of iron deficiency ( ID) in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) and its contributory role in the morbidity and mortality of HF. It is important to note that many HF patients have ID without being anaemic , hence it is vital to screen for ID even in patients with haemoglobin within the normal laboratory range. This review summarises the pathophysiology and epidemiology of ID in HF before discussing the evidence for iron replacement therapy in HF patients. Finally , it discusses the ongoing large outcome trials evaluating iron replacement in HF.
