  After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT) plus surgery for oesophageal cancer , 29 per cent of patients have a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen. Active surveillance after nCRT ( instead of standard oesophagectomy) may improve health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) , but patients need to undergo frequent diagnostic tests and it is unknown whether survival is worse than that after standard oesophagectomy. Factors that influence patients ' preferences , and trade-offs that patients are willing to make in their choice between surgery and active surveillance were investigated here. A prospective discrete-choice experiment was conducted. Patients with oesophageal cancer completed questionnaires 4-6 weeks after nCRT , before surgery. Patients ' preferences were quantified using scenarios based on five aspects: 5-year overall survival , short-term HRQoL , long-term HRQoL , the risk that oesophagectomy is still necessary , and the frequency of clinical examinations using endoscopy and PET-CT. Panel latent class analysis was used. Some 100 of 104 patients ( 96 Â· 2 per cent) responded. All aspects , except the frequency of clinical examinations , influenced patients ' preferences. Five-year overall survival , the chance that oesophagectomy is still necessary and long-term HRQoL were the most important attributes. On average , based on calculation of the indifference point between standard surgery and active surveillance , patients were willing to trade off 16 per cent 5-year overall survival to reduce the risk that oesophagectomy is necessary from 100 per cent ( standard surgery) to 35 per cent ( active surveillance). Patients are willing to trade off substantial 5-year survival to achieve a reduction in the risk that oesophagectomy is necessary.
