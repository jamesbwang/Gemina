  We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of budesonide oral suspension ( BOS) maintenance therapy in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE). We performed an open-label extension study of a 12-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial. Patients with EoE ( 11-40 years old) who completed double-blind BOS ( n = 45) or placebo therapy ( n = 37) received 24 weeks ' open-label BOS ( 2.0 mg once daily for 12 weeks , with optional dose increase ( 1.5-2.0 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks thereafter). Predefined efficacy outcomes included: proportion of patients with a histologic response ( â‰¤ 6 eosinophils/high-power field ( eos/hpf)) and change in mean peak eosinophil counts after 24 weeks. Analyses were stratified by patients who received placebo ( placebo/BOS) or BOS ( BOS/BOS) during the double-blind trial. BOS was well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were uncommon ( placebo/BOS , 19 % ( 7/37); BOS/BOS , 4 % ( 2/45)). Incidence of oral candidiasis ( 1 per group) and esophageal candidiasis ( placebo/BOS group , n = 4) remained low. Changes in morning serum cortisol levels were not clinically relevant. A histologic response was observed in 49 % ( 16/33) of patients receiving placebo/BOS and 23 % ( 9/39) receiving BOS/BOS. Mean peak eosinophil counts ( baseline vs week 24 or early termination) were: placebo/BOS , 118.8 vs 29.1; P < .001 and BOS/BOS , 38.1 vs 72.4; P = .01. Of the patients who responded to double-blind therapy , 42 % maintained a histologic response during the open-label extension; 4 % of non-responders gained response. In an open-label extension study of patients with EoE , BOS was well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were uncommon. BOS maintained a histologic response in some initial responders but few initial non-responders had a response. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01642212.
