  Long-term steroid therapy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity. Whether to use a stress dose of glucocorticoids ( GCs) in surgical patients remains controversial. In the present study , we reported our experience in perioperative GC treatment of 6 patients on long-term steroid therapy for autoimmune diseases undergoing hand reconstruction using reversed interosseous flap. The reversed interosseous flap reconstructions were performed after local extended resection of hand neoplasms. The patients were all diagnosed with autoimmune diseases and were undergoing long-term steroid therapy. Stress dose of GCs was not given in any case , and all the patients either remained on their baseline maintenance dose or decreased the dose until the morning of the operation day. Hypotension<symptom> , water-electrolyte imbalance , hypoglycemia , and other symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were carefully assessed. Appearances of flap complications were recorded. None of the patients developed hypotension<symptom> or other symptomatic adrenal insufficiency. Flap infection , venous congestion<symptom> , or complete or partial<symptom> loss<symptom> of flap was not observed in any patient. Effusion<symptom> underneath the flap was developed in only 1 case and was solved by proper drainage. It is safe , reliable , and versatile to use reversed interosseous flap to repair hand defects in patients on long-term steroid therapy. A stress dose of GCs might not be necessary in this procedure and other equally moderate soft tissue reconstructive surgeries.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
