  Synthesizing energetic metal-organic frameworks at ambient temperature and pressure has been always a challenge in the research area of energetic materials. In this work , through in situ controllable synthesis , energetic metal-organic framework gem-dinitromethyl-substituted dipotassium 4,5-bis ( dinitromethyl) -1,2,3-triazole with a `` cage-like '' crystal packing was obtained and characterized. Most importantly , for the first time , we found that it could be successfully afforded with a catalytic effect of trifluoroacetic acid. This new compound exhibited its high density ( 2.04 g cm
