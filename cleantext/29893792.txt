  Variants within non-coding genomic regions can greatly affect disease. In recent years , increasing focus has been given to these variants , and how they can alter regulatory elements , such as enhancers , transcription factor binding sites and DNA methylation regions. Such variants can be considered regulatory variants. Concurrently , much effort has been put into establishing international consortia to undertake large projects aimed at discovering regulatory elements in different tissues , cell lines and organisms , and probing the effects of genetic variants on regulation by measuring gene expression. Here , we describe methods and techniques for discovering disease-associated non-coding variants using sequencing technologies. We then explain the computational procedures that can be used for annotating these variants using the information from the aforementioned projects , and prediction of their putative effects , including potential pathogenicity , based on rule-based and machine learning approaches. We provide the details of techniques to validate these predictions , by mapping chromatin-chromatin and chromatin-protein interactions , and introduce Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 ( CRISPR-Cas9) technology , which has already been used in this field and is likely to have a big impact on its future evolution.We also give examples of regulatory variants associated with multiple complex<disease> diseases<disease>. This review is aimed at bioinformaticians interested in the characterization of regulatory variants , molecular biologists and geneticists interested in understanding more about the nature and potential role of such variants from a functional point of views , and clinicians who may wish to learn about variants in non-coding genomic regions associated with a given disease and find out what to do next to uncover how they impact on the underlying mechanisms.
