  The role of tumour-associated macrophages ( TAMs) in colorectal cancer ( CRC) remains elusive. In this study , we aimed to examine the correlation between TAMs , clinicopathological features , tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) and prognosis in CRC by the use of image analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68 and CD163 was performed as pan-macrophage and M2-macrophage markers , respectively. Each marker was analysed separately for intra-epithelial and stromal area densities. All four macrophage densities showed a significant correlation with one another ( P = 0.001). Intra-epithelial CD68 Our results indicate that the density of intratumoural macrophages is a useful prognostic indicator for further stratifying T cell populations in CRC.
