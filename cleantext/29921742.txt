  It is important to understand the attitude of medical students towards homosexuality , as this may affect patient care. Year 2 and 3 students at Calcutta National Medical College , Kolkata , India were asked to selfadminister an 18-item questionnaire anonymously. Internal consistency of the questionnaire statements was high ( Cronbach 's alpha of 0.91). There were five responses for each statement: strongly agree , generally agree , unsure , generally disagree , and strongly disagree. Of 290 students , 270 ( 93.1 %) ( 148 males and 122 females) completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Overall , 55.6 % strongly disagreed that homosexuality was an illness; 70.8 % agreed that homosexuals were capable of forming stable relationships. Only 31.1 % believed that homosexual doctors would better understand homosexual patients. About 71.8 % reported that talking about homosexuality did not embarrass them , and 81.8 % believed that problems associated with homosexuality could be reduced if society was more liberal. Nonetheless , negative attitudes were reflected in the stereotypical image of homosexuality. About 15.9 % of respondents believed that homosexuality was an illness; 24.8 % considered homosexuals neurotic , 28.1 % considered homosexuals promiscuous; and 8.2 % thought that they posed a danger to children. Although the overall attitude of Indian medical students towards homosexuality is positive , the percentage of students with negative attitudes remains quite high. Further work on the medical curriculum is needed to change these negative attitudes so that patients receive appropriate care.
