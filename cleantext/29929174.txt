  Post marketing analysis of anti-epileptic drug ( AED) efficacy and tolerability is of great value to the clinician since it is more representative of clinical practice than clinical trial data. We analyzed our experience with lacosamide ( LCM) in patients treated after marketing. We identified all patients who were treated with LCM during the four year period after marketing , excluding patients who were in clinical trials. We recorded demographic data and analyzed efficacy and tolerability in patients who had at least one follow up visit or telephone call 3 months after the initiation of LCM. A total of 165 patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age was 41 years. The majority of the cohort had focal epilepsy ( 146 patients) ( 88.4 %). The mean duration of treatment was 31.2 months. Eighty one patients ( 49.1 %) were continuing LCM at last follow up. Adverse effects ( AEs) and discontinuation were significantly more common when LCM was added to one or more Na-channel blocking agents ( NCB) ( p = 0.0003 and 0.17). The 50 % responder rate was 26 % at 3 months and increased to 49 % at 36 months. Patients were more likely to continue the drug and less likely to have AEs with slower titration over > 4 weeks ( p = 0.02 for each). Four or more previously failed AEDs predicted poorer response rate compared to three or less AEDs ( p = 0.001). LCM use in clinical practice was associated with greater rate of seizure<symptom> freedom than in clinical trials. Discontinuation and occurrence of AEs were significantly more likely with faster titration and adding LCM to NCB agents.
