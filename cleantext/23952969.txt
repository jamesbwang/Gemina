  We derive expressions for the scattering , extinction and conversion of the chirality of monochromatic light scattered by bodies which are characterized by a T-matrix. In analogy to the conditions obtained from the conservation of energy , these quantities enable the classification of arbitrary scattering objects due to their full , i.e. either chiral or achiral , electromagnetic response. To this end , we put forward and determine the concepts of duality and breaking of duality symmetry , anti-duality , helicity variation , helicity annhiliation and the breaking of helicity annihilation. Different classes , such as chiral and dual scatterers , are illustrated in this analysis with model examples of spherical and non-spherical shape. As for spheres , these concepts are analysed by considering non-Rayleigh dipolar dielectric particles of high refractive index , which , having a strong magnetic response to the incident wavefield , offer an excellent laboratory to test and interpret such changes in the chirality of the illumination. In addition , comparisons with existing experimental data are made.
