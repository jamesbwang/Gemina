  A nickel-catalyzed three-component coupling reaction between perfluoroarenes and two molecules of a 1,3-diene in the presence of an alkyl Grignard reagent , which acted as a hydride source , provided 3-perfluoroarylated-1,7-octadienes via 1,3-diene dimerization and subsequent perfluoroarylation upon C-F bond cleavage. The reaction proceeded smoothly in a regioselective manner by simply combining NiCl
