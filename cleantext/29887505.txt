  Raw milk may be a risk for public health if it is contaminated with zoonotic pathogens. To study the prevalence in unpasteurized milk from Swedish farms , bovine and small ruminant dairy farms were sampled. Since the sampling method and transport conditions may influence the outcome of analyses , efforts were made to optimize the methodology. Culturing of bacteria was done from in-line milk filters collected from the milk pipe at the point where it enters the milk bulk tank at the farms and this way of sampling was compared to sampling bulk tank milk ( BTM) directly. Analysing milk filters were found to be superior to analysing BTM directly. Conditions for transport of milk filter samples were further improved by the addition of Cary Blair transport medium , which significantly increased the number of positive samples for pathogenic bacteria. The isolation of several foodborne pathogens from milk filters was demonstrated. The prevalence of samples with Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was 71 % and 64 % , and Listeria<pathogen> spp. 21 % and 29 % from dairy cow and goat/sheep farms , respectively. Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen> , Yersinia<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> and verotoxigenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( VTEC) O157 were detected in 9 % , 2 % and 2 % of samples from bovine milk , respectively. We conclude that the choice of sampling method and sample handling influence the results of bacterial culturing. From the results of this study , we strongly recommend to sample in-line milk filters instead of BTM directly and to use Cary Blair medium during transport , especially if the samples are to be analysed for Campylobacter<pathogen> spp. and/or Listeria<pathogen> spp.. The findings also show that unpasteurized milk from Swedish farms occasionally contain bacteria with zoonotic potential.
