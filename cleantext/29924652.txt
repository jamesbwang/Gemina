  In this article we develop a novel online framework to visualize news data over a time horizon. First , we perform a Natural Language Processing analysis , wherein the words are extracted , and their attributes , namely the importance and the relatedness , are calculated. Second , we present a Mathematical Optimization model for the visualization problem and a numerical optimization approach. The model represents the words using circles , the time-varying area of which displays the importance of the words in each time period. Word location in the visualization region is guided by three criteria , namely , the accurate representation of semantic relatedness , the spread of the words in the visualization region to improve the quality of the visualization , and the visual stability over the time horizon. Our approach is flexible , allowing the user to interact with the display , as well as incremental and scalable. We show results for three case studies using data from Danish news sources.
