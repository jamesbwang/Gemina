  A promising approach capitalizing on the specific and highly sensitive characteristics of the body 's own immune system is demonstrated in the context of revealing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer ( PDAC). IgA from a local biofluid called gastrointestinal lavage fluid ( GLF) is used to investigate glycan reactivity to show the potential of this approach. IgA antibody responses , just as with IgG , result in amplification of a small signal which aids in detecting changes from a healthy state. IgA from GLF was screened against glycan arrays containing 609 glycan structures to investigate differential binding patterns associated with the disease. Samples included PDAC ( n = 14) and non-PDAC ( n = 6). Non-PDAC conditions included samples from healthy patients and the potentially confounding conditions of colon cancer and its precancerous lesion<symptom> , colon adenoma. Results demonstrated characteristic reactivity in the PDAC sample group to a glycan structure. Also , IgA non-reactive motifs arose showing remarkable consistency within and between sample groups. While sample sizes are too small to identify putative biomarkers , these data show the use of IgA from GLF to be a promising avenue of research for local disease biomarker discovery.
