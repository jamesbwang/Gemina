  Heteronemin , a marine sesterterpenoid-type natural product , possesses diverse bioactivities , especially antitumor effect. Accumulating evidence shows that heteronemin may act as a potent anticancer agent in clinical therapy. To fully understand the antitumor mechanism of heteronemin , we further explored the precise molecular targets in prostate cancer cells. Initially , heteronemin exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against LNcap and PC3 prostate cancer cells with IC
