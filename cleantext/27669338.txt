  Large auto-generated databases of magnetic materials properties have the potential for great utility in materials science research. This article presents an auto-generated database of 39,822 records containing chemical compounds and their associated Curie and Néel magnetic phase transition temperatures. The database was produced using natural language processing and semi-supervised quaternary relationship extraction , applied to a corpus of 68,078 chemistry and physics articles. Evaluation of the database shows an estimated overall precision of 73 %. Therein , records processed with the text-mining toolkit , ChemDataExtractor , were assisted by a modified Snowball algorithm , whose original binary relationship extraction capabilities were extended to quaternary relationship extraction. Consequently , its machine learning component can now train with ≤ 500 seeds , rather than the 4,000 originally used. Data processed with the modified Snowball algorithm affords 82 % precision. Database records are available in MongoDB , CSV and JSON formats which can easily be read using Python , R , Java and MatLab. This makes the database easy to query for tackling big-data materials science initiatives and provides a basis for magnetic materials discovery.
