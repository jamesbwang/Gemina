  To analyze the sequelae of Neer type 2 distal end clavicle fractures treated with superior anterior locking plate. From June 2012 to February 2015 a study was conducted with 14 male patients; 12 with unilateral and two with bilateral distal clavicle fractures treated with superior anterior plate. They were evaluated at intervals , with mean follow up of 16 months ( 14-18 months). All patients were evaluated clinically by both the Oxford Shoulder Score and the QuickDASH score. Union was seen in all fractures within 7-9 weeks ( mean time: 8.2 weeks). All patients had good shoulder range-of-motion. The average Oxford Shoulder Score and QuickDASH score were 45.6 and 7.1 , respectively. All patients returned to work within 3-4 months of the postoperative period. Displaced distal clavicle fractures treated with superior anterior plates accomplished superlative results in terms of bony union , with rarely any complications.
