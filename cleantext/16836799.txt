  Over the last years , a number of stochastic models have been proposed for analysing the spread of nosocomial infections in hospital settings. These models often account for a number of factors governing the spread dynamics: spontaneous patient colonization , patient-staff contamination/colonization , environmental contamination , patient cohorting or healthcare workers ( HCWs) hand-washing compliance levels. For each model , tailor-designed methods are implemented in order to analyse the dynamics of the nosocomial outbreak , usually by means of studying quantities of interest such as the reproduction number of each agent in the hospital ward , which is usually computed by means of stochastic simulations or deterministic approximations. In this work , we propose a highly versatile stochastic modelling framework that can account for all these factors simultaneously , and which allows one to exactly analyse the reproduction number of each agent at the hospital ward during a nosocomial outbreak. By means of five representative case studies , we show how this unified modelling framework comprehends , as particular cases , many of the existing models in the literature. We implement various numerical studies via which we ( i) highlight the importance of maintaining high hand-hygiene compliance levels by HCWs , ( ii) support infection control strategies including to improve environmental cleaning during an outbreak and ( iii) show the potential of some HCWs to act as super-spreaders during nosocomial outbreaks.
