  The number of centrioles is tightly controlled to ensure bipolar spindle assembly , which is a prerequisite to maintain genome integrity. However , our understanding of the fundamental principle that governs the formation of a single procentriole per parental centriole is incomplete. Here , we show that the local restriction of Plk4 , a master regulator of the procentriole formation , is achieved by a bimodal interaction of STIL with Plk4. We demonstrate that the conserved short coiled-coil region of STIL binds to and protects Plk4 from protein degradation at the site of procentriole formation. On the other hand , the conserved C-terminal region of STIL named truncated in microcephaly ( TIM) domain promotes autophosphorylation and degradation of adjacent Plk4 by the direct interaction. Thus , we propose that positive and negative regulation based on the bimodal binding of Plk4 and STIL ensures the formation of a single procentriole per parental centriole.
