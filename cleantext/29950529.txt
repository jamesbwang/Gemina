  proliferative lupus nephritis ( LN) has higher prevalence and worse prognosis than non-proliferative LN. Renal biopsy plays an important role in diagnosis and therapy of LN , but there are some obstacles in its implementation. A diagnostic scoring system for proliferative LN is necessary , especially for cases in which renal biopsy can not be performed. This study aimed to develop a diagnostic scoring system of proliferative LN based on its diagnostic determinants including hypertension , proteinuria<symptom> , hematuria<symptom> , eGFR , anti-dsDNA antibody , and C3 levels. a cross-sectional study with total sampling method was conducted. Our subjects were adult LN patients who underwent renal biopsy in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital between January 2007 and June 2017. from a total of 191 subjects with biopsy-proven LN in this study , we found a proportion of proliferative LN of 74.8 %. There were 113 subjects included for analysis of proliferative LN determinants. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that determinants for proliferative LN were hypertension ( OR 3.39; 95 % CI 1.30-8.84) , eGFR < 60ml/min/1 .73 m2 ( OR 9.095; 95 % CI 1.11-74.68) , and low C3 levels ( OR 3.97; 95 % CI 1.41-11.17). After further analysis , we found that hypertension , eGFR < 60ml/min/1 .73 m2 , low C3 levels , and hematuria<symptom> were essential components of the diagnostic scoring system on proliferative LN. The scoring system was tested with ROC curve and an AUC of 80.4 % was obtained ( 95 % CI 71.9-89). the proportion of proliferative LN in biopsy-proven LN patients of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital is 74.8 %. Components of scoring system for proliferative LN consist of hypertension , eGFR < 60ml/min/1 .73 m2 , low C3 levels , and
