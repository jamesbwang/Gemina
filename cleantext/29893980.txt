  Objectives We examined associations between labor market and health ( LM-H) trajectories in the United States between 1988 and 2011 and whether associations differed across macroeconomic expansion/recession periods. Methods Working-age cohorts , derived from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics , were followed over time to characterize LM-H trajectories. Poisson regression provided relative risks ( RR) with robust 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) for the association between trajectories , adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results LM trajectories ending in unemployment ( RR 1.7 2.5 across periods) or inactivity ( RR 2.3-3.2) had a greater risk of worsening health trajectories , compared to stable employment. In contrast , RR for individuals returning to work following an intermediary period of unemployment/inactivity were attenuated across most periods. Stable-employed individuals had the highest probability of remaining in good health , whereas trajectories ending in unemployment or inactivity had the lowest probability. These overall relationships were consistent across macroeconomic periods. Conclusions We found strong and consistent relationships between LM-H trajectories across macroeconomic periods. The attenuated ( but not eliminated) risk among individuals returning to work following a period of unemployment/inactivity suggests that health outcomes are not only dependent on the LM end-state , but also on the distinct pattern over time.
