  Sirtuin inhibitors as physiological research tools and therapeutic potentials have caught many attentions in last decades. The mimics of acyl lysine have been approved to be a very efficient strategy for development of mechanism-based sirtuin inhibitors. In current study , a novel scaffold of l-S- ( 3-carboxamidopropyl) cysteine ( l-CAPC) has been exploited for design and synthesis of sirtuin inhibitors. As a result , the mimics of N
