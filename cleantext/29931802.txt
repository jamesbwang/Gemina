  Maximized specific loss power and intrinsic loss power approaching theoretical limits for alternating-current ( AC) magnetic-field heating of nanoparticles are reported. This is achieved by engineering the effective magnetic anisotropy barrier of nanoparticles via alloying of hard and soft ferrites. 22 nm Co
