  Plasticizer pollution brought huge risks to ecological environment and human health. Surface discharge plasma ( SDP) was employed to eliminate plasticizer in natural water , with dimethyl phthalate ( DMP) as a typical plasticizer. Experimental results showed that DMP degradation efficiency reached 82.8 % within 60 min 's SDP treatment , and the elimination process fitted well the first-order kinetic model. Low initial DMP concentration , alkaline condition , and low natural organic matter content were all conducive for DMP degradation. The contributions of OH radical and O
