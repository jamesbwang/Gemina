  The purpose of the present study was to assess the long-term success rate of a single 3-min freeze per vein ablation strategy in the setting of pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI) by means of second-generation cryoballoon ( CB-A; Arctic Front Advance , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA) in a large cohort of patients. Three hundred and one patients with drug resistant atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) having undergone PVI by means of CB-A using a single 3-min freeze per vein ablation strategy were included in the analysis. Paroxysmal AF ( PAF) was documented in 70.8 % of the patients , while 29.2 % presented with persistent AF ( PersAF). The mean number of CB applications was 1.09 ± 0.3 in the left superior pulmonary vein ( LSPV) , 1.04 ± 0.2 in the left inferior pulmonary vein ( LIPV) , 1.12 ± 0.3 in the right superior pulmonary vein ( RSPV) , and 1.12 ± 0.3 in the right inferior pulmonary vein ( RIPV). All PVs were successfully isolated with a 28-mm CB-A only. After a mean follow-up of 38.1 ± 7.5 months , 207 ( 68.8 %) patients were free of atrial tachyarrhythmia ( ATa) recurrences following a single procedure. Specifically , 72.8 % of patients presenting with PAF and 59.1 % of individuals with PersAF did not experience a recurrence. A single 3-min freeze per vein strategy is effective in treating AF on a long term follow-up of 38 months. Specifically , it can afford freedom from ATa recurrences in 72.8 % of patients affected by PAF and 59.1 % of patients initially presenting with PersAF after a single CB-A procedure.
