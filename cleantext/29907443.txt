  Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressing , chronic multifactorial disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids , inflammatory cells , and fibrous tissue that drives to the formation of asymmetric focal thickenings in the tunica intima of large and mid-sized arteries. Despite the high therapeutic potential of ApoA-1 proteins , the purification and delivery into the disordered organisms of these drugs is still limited by low efficiency in these processes. We report here a novel production and delivery system of anti-atherogenic APOA-1Milano muteins ( APOA-1M) by means of genetically modified rice plants. APOA-1M , delivered as protein extracts from transgenic rice seeds , significantly reduced macrophage activation and foam cell formation in vitro in oxLDL-loaded THP-1 model. The APOA-1M delivery method and therapeutic efficacy was tested in healthy mice and in Apoe The delivery of therapeutic APOA-1M full length proteins via oral administration of rice seeds protein extracts ( the ` rice milk ') to the disordered organism , without any need of purification , might overcome the main APOA1-based therapies ' limitations and improve the use of this molecules as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular patients.
