  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been demonstrated to modulate cellular processes in the liver. However , the role of miRNAs in liver fibrosis<disease> is poorly understood. Because the activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) is a pivotal event in the initiation and progression of hepatic fibrosis<disease> , we investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in activated and quiescent rat HSCs by microarray analysis and find that miR-214 ( miR-214-3p) is significantly upregulated during HSC activation. Moreover , the robust induction of miR-214 is correlated with liver fibrogenesis in carbon tetrachloride ( CCl
