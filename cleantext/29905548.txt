  Cutaneous polypoid melanoma is an uncommon subtype of malignant melanoma. The clinical behavior of this subtype has been described as aggressive. Tumors can be sessile or pedunculated. The typical patient is a younger adult Authors have analyzed the case histories of patients with polypoid melanomas of the head and neck region treated at our clinic from 2001 to 2018. We identified 3 female patients with tumors of the neck and cheek. In contrast to other reports , all patients were older than 80-years of age. None of them had a metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis. Treatment was delayed Mohs surgery. Polypoid melanomas of the head and neck region can occur in elderly patients without an aggressive course. In those patients a number of differential diagnoses have to be considered including Merkel cell carcinoma , metatypical basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and tumor metastases.
