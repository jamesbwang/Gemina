  In this article , we present the results of the regional estimation of the evolution of monthly mean aerosol size over the Arabian Gulf Region , based on the data collected during the period July 2002- September 2016. The dataset used is complete , without missing values. Two methods are introduced for this purpose. The first one is based on the partition of the regional series in sub-series and the selection of the most representative one for fitting the regional trend. The second one is a version of the first method , combined with the k-means clustering algorithm. Comparison of their performances is also provided. The study proves that both methods give a very good estimation of the evolution of the aerosol size in the Arabian Gulf Region in the study period.
