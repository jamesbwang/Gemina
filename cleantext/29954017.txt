  Neuropsychological assessment should be an integral component of clinical psychiatric diagnostics. Yet , the commonly used tests have not been investigated adequately for this population so far. The current study evaluated a clinically approved neuropsychological test battery by analyzing data on 226 mentally ill patients using factor and regression analyses. The extraction of three factors ( Speed , Memory , and Executive Functions) proved to be adequate as the tests could be allocated properly. Regression analysis revealed an economical basis assessment consisting of three tests ( TAP Alertness , VLMT , and Matrices Test). Based on acceptance , economy , and factorial structure aspects , we recommend the investigated test battery for neuropsychological assessment of psychiatric and psychosomatic patients.
