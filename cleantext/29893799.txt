  Tools that provide personalized risk prediction of the outcomes after surgical procedures help patients to make preference-based decisions amongst the available treatment options. However , it is unclear which modeling approach provides the most accurate risk estimation. We constructed and compared several parametric and non-parametric models for predicting prosthesis survivorship after knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis. We used 430,455 patient-procedure episodes between April 2003 and September 2015 from the National Joint Registry for England , Wales , Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. The flexible parametric survival and random survival forest<disease> models most accurately captured the observed probability of remaining event-free. The concordance index for the flexible parametric model was the highest ( 0.705; 95 % confidence interval: 0.702 , 0.707) for total knee replacement , 0.639 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.634 , 0.643) for unicondylar knee replacement and 0.589 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.586 , 0.592) for patellofemoral replacement. The observed-to-predicted ratios for both the flexible parametric and the random survival forest<disease> approaches indicated that models tended to underestimate the risks for most risk groups. Our results show that the flexible parametric model has a better overall performance compared to other tested parametric methods , and better discrimination compared to the random survival forest<disease> approach.
