  Cellular morphology on and in a scaffold composed of extracellular matrix generally represents the cellular phenotype. Therefore , morphology-based cell separation should be interesting method that is applicable to cell separation without staining surface markers in contrast to conventional cell separation methods ( e.g. , fluorescence activated cell sorting and magnetic activated cell sorting). In our previous study , we have proposed a cloning technology using a photodegradable gelatin hydrogel to separate the individual cells on and in hydrogels. To further expand the applicability of this photodegradable hydrogel culture platform , we here report an image-based cell separation system imaging cell picker for the morphology-based cell separation on a photodegradable hydrogel. We have developed the platform which enables the automated workflow of image acquisition , image processing and morphology analysis , and collection of a target cells. We have shown the performance of the morphology-based cell separation through the optimization of the critical parameters that determine the system 's performance , such as ( i) culture conditions , ( ii) imaging conditions , and ( iii) the image analysis scheme , to actually clone the cells of interest. Furthermore , we demonstrated the morphology-based cloning performance of cancer cells in the mixture of cells by automated hydrogel degradation by light irradiation and pipetting.
