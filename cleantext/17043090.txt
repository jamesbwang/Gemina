  The aim of the present study was to test if incidences of ischaemic heart disease ( IHD) and usage of antihypertensive drugs are independent of weekly working hours ( WWH) among full-time employees in Denmark. Data on WWH from participants of the Danish labour force surveys , 1999-2013 , were linked on an individual level to national registers with data on socioeconomic status ( SES) , industry , emigrations , redeemed prescriptions , hospital contacts and deaths. Participants were followed until the end of 2014 ( on average 7.7 years). Poisson regression was used to model incidence rates as a function of WWH. The analyses were controlled for calendar time , time passed since start of follow-up , employment in the healthcare industry , age , sex , SES and night work. In total , we found 3635 cases of IHD and 20 648 cases of antihypertensive drug usage. The rate ratio of IHD was 0.95 ( 95 % CI 0.85 to 1.06) for 41-48 compared with 32-40 WWH and 1.07 ( 0.94 to 1.21) for > 48 compared with 32-40 WWH. The corresponding rate ratios for antihypertensive drug usage were 0.99 ( 0.95 to 1.04) and 1.02 ( 0.97 to 1.08). No statistically significant interactions between WWH and sex , SES and night work , respectively , were found. In this Danish sample , we did not find any statistically significant association between WWH and IHD or antihypertensive drug usage.
