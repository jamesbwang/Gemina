  To determine and compare the prevalence and risk factors of metabolic syndrome<symptom> ( MS) among Tarahumara Indians living in rural and urban communities. Conducted in 2010 , this cross-sectional study included 204 Tarahumara ( 100 urban and 104 rural individuals 18-75 years old ( yo)). Data obtained includes: Anthropometric , lifestyle , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and fasting blood tests. Analyses were stratified by gender and age. The total prevalence of MS in rural and urban Tarahumara were 41 % and 28 % ( p = 0.04) , respectively. In urban cohorts , the prevalence of MS increased linearly with age. Women presented with a higher MS prevalence than men in urban ( 44.6 % vs. 34.3 % , p = 0.4) and rural ( 50 % vs. 12.5 % , p = 0.0001) cohorts. In men , urban residents presented with a higher MS prevalence vs. rural subjects; The same was not true for women. Age-related increment in waist circumference was linear and significantly higher in urban men compared to their rural counterpart ( urban 6.5 ( 95 % CI 4.24-8.79) vs. rural 2.7 ( 95 % CI 1.19-4.24) centimeters/decade , p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed a significant relationship between urban residency and MS in men , but not in women. The overall prevalence of MS is higher in women than men , but the latter are more susceptible to the urbanization-associated worsening of cardiometabolic health.
