  We established Fe ( III)- reducing co-cultures of two species of metal-reducing bacteria , the Gram-positive Desulfotomaculum reducens MI-1 and the Gram-negative Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. Co-cultures were given pyruvate , a substrate that D. reducens can ferment and use as electron donor for Fe ( III) reduction. G. sulfurreducens relied upon products of pyruvate oxidation by D. reducens ( acetate , hydrogen) for use as electron donor in the co-culture. Co-cultures reduced Fe ( III) to Fe ( II) robustly , and Fe ( II) was consistently detected earlier in co-cultures than pure cultures. Notably , faster cell growth , and correspondingly faster pyruvate oxidation , was observed by D. reducens in co-cultures. Global comparative proteomic analysis was performed to observe differential protein abundance during co-culture vs. pure culture growth. Proteins previously associated with Fe ( III) reduction in G. sulfurreducens , namely c-type cytochromes and type IV pili proteins , were significantly increased in abundance in co-cultures relative to pure cultures. D. reducens ribosomal proteins were significantly increased in co-cultures , likely a reflection of faster growth rates observed for D. reducens cells while in co-culture. Furthermore , we developed multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) assays to quantitate specific biomarker peptides. The assays were validated in pure and co-cultures , and protein abundance ratios from targeted MRM and global proteomic analysis correlate significantly.
