  Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation<symptom> resulting from airway hyper-responsiveness to diverse stimuli. In this study , we investigated whether microRNA-142 ( miR-142) expression affects proliferation and apoptosis in airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs) during airway remodeling in asthmatic rats. Thirty six Wistar rats were randomly classified into a control group and an model group. miR-142 mimics and inhibitors were constructed , and ASMCs were transfected using liposomes according to the following groups: blank , negative control ( NC) , miR-142 mimics , miR-142 inhibitors , si-TGF-β and miR-142 inhibitors + si-TGF-β. We verified that miR-142 targets TGF-β using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression levels of miR-142 , TGF-β , EGFR and apoptosis signaling pathway-related genes were determined using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Changes in cell proliferation , cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed using MTT assays and flow cytometry. Rats with asthma had higher expression levels of EGFR and Akt and lower miR-142 levels. miR-142 was negatively correlated with TGF-β expression. In ASMCs , the expression of TGF-β , EGFR , Akt , phosphorylated-Akt ( p-Akt) , Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and the rate of early apoptosis were decreased while expression of Bax and p21 and the proliferation rate were elevated with the upregulation of miR-142. The opposite results were observed with the downregulation of miR-142. Finally , the proliferative rate was decreased while the apoptosis rate was increased and expression levels of EGFR , Akt , p-Akt , Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl were reduced while Bax and p21 were elevated in the ASMCs transfected with miR-142 inhibitors and si-TGF-β. The results of our study suggest that miR-142 inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in ASMCs during airway remodeling in asthmatic rats by inhibiting TGF-β expression via a mechanism involving the EGFR signaling pathway.
