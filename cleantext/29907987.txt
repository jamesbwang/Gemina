  Intracellular subtilisin proteases ( ISPs) have important roles in protein processing during the stationary phase in bacteria. Their unregulated protein degrading activity may have adverse effects inside a cell , but little is known about their regulatory mechanism. Until now , ISPs have mostly been described from Bacillus<pathogen> species , with structural data from a single homolog. Here , we study a marine ISP originating from a phylogenetically distinct genus , Planococcus sp.. The enzyme was successfully overexpressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and is active in presence of calcium , which is thought to have role in minor , but essential , structural rearrangements needed for catalytic activity. The ISP operates at alkaline pH and at moderate temperatures , and has a corresponding melting temperature around 60 Â°C. The high-resolution three-dimensional structure reported here , represents an ISP with an intact catalytic triad albeit in a configuration with an inhibitory pro-peptide bound. The pro-peptide is removed in other homologs , but the removal of the ISP pro-peptide in Planococcus sp.. AW02J18 appears to be different , and possibly involves several steps. A first processing step is described here as the removal of two immediate N-terminal residues. Furthermore , the pro-peptide contains a conserved LIPY/F-motif , which was found to be involved in inhibition of the catalytic activity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
