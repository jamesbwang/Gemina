  This study aimed to identify the effect of preoperative serum total cholesterol on postoperative pain outcome in patients who had undergone laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer who had undergone laparoscopic colorectal surgery from January 1 , 2011 , to June 30 , 2017 , to identify the relationship of total cholesterol levels within a month prior to surgery with the numeric rating scale ( NRS) scores and total opioid consumption on postoperative days ( PODs) 0-2. We included 1,944 patients. No significant correlations were observed between total cholesterol and the NRS ( POD 0) , NRS ( POD 1) , and oral morphine equivalents ( PODs 0-2) ( This study showed that there was no meaningful association between preoperative total cholesterol level and postoperative pain outcome after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
