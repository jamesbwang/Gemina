  Highly fused , fully conjugated aromatic compounds are interesting candidates for organic electronics. With higher crystallinity their electronic properties improve. It is shown here that the crystallization of three archetypes of such molecules-pentacenetetrone , indigo , and perinone-can be achieved hydrothermally. Given their molecular structure , this is a truly startling finding. In addition , it is demonstrated that perinone can also be synthesized in solely high-temperature water from the starting compounds naphthalene bisanhydride and o-phenylene diamine without the need for co-solvents or catalysts. The transformation can be drastically accelerated by the application of microwave irradiation. This is the first report on the hydrothermal generation of two fused heterocycles.
