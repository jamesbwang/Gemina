  Many pathways connect stress and obesity , two highly prevalent problems facing society today. First , stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second , stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories , fat , or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third , stress triggers physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , reward processing in the brain , and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally , stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin , ghrelin , and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes , ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.
