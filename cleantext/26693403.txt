  The classification of bamboos based on floral morphology and reproductive characters is very hard due to erratic flowering behavior and unusually long reproductive cycle. The application of reliable and effective DNA molecular markers is highly essential to address this problem. In the present investigation , inter-simple sequence repeats ( ISSR) markers were employed to study phylogenetic relationship of 15 different bamboos of North-East India. The 10 ISSR primers generated 116 polymorphic loci or scorable bands with average of 11.6 bands per primer. The genetic similarity coefficient ranged from 0.41-0.76 showing high genetic polymorphism among different bamboo species. The phylogenetic tree constructed based on genetic similarity matrix revealed genetic proximity of endemic
