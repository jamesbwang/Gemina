  The treatment of newly diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) was predicted by an ovarian cancer computed tomography ( CT) evaluation model combined with serum CA125. Clinical data for 194 patients with advanced EOC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT) combined with interval debulking surgery ( IDS) or primary debulking surgery ( PDS) were retrospectively analyzed , and the appropriate treatment was predicted by comparing the subgroup differences in intraoperative situations , postoperative situations and survival rates. There were no significant differences with respect to operation time , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , ideal tumor cytoreductive rate or postoperative complication rate between the NACT + IDS group and the PDS group with scores less than 5 ( score < 5) ( p = 0.764 , p = 0.504 , p = 0.906 , p = 0.176). However , there was a statistically significant difference in overall survival rate between the two groups ( p = 0.029) , with better survival in the PDS group than in the NACT + IDS group. There were significant differences between the NACT + IDS group and the PDS group with scores greater than or equal to 5 ( score ≥ 5). The former was better than the latter in terms of operation time , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , ideal tumor cytoreductive rate , and postoperative complication rate ( p = 0.002 , p = 0.040 , p = 0.014 , p = 0.021). However , there was no significant difference in overall survival rate between the two groups ( p = 0.383). According to the new evaluation system , for a score < 5 , we suggest that patients with newly diagnosed advanced EOC undergo PDS; for a score ≥ 5 , we recommend NACT + IDS.
