  Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have shared etiology , including key etiological changes ( e.g. , DNA damage and epigenetics change) and lung function impairment. Focusing on those shared targets may help in the prevention of both. Certain micronutrients ( vitamins and minerals) and phytochemicals ( carotenoids and phenols) have potent antioxidant or methyl-donating properties and thus have received considerable interest. We reviewed recent papers probing into the potential of nutrients with respect to lung function preservation and prevention of lung cancer risk , and suggest several hypothetical intervention patterns. Intakes of vitamins ( i.e. , A , C , D , E , B
