  Nickel is a major carcinogen that is implicated in tumor development through occupational and environmental exposure. Although the exact molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by low-level nickel remain unclear , inhibition of DNA repair is frequently considered to be a critical mechanism of carcinogenesis. Here , we investigated whether low concentrations of nickel would affect p53-mediated DNA repair , especially nucleotide excision repair. Our results showed that nickel inhibited the promoter binding activity of p53 on the downstream gene GADD45A , as a result of the disturbance of p53 oligomerization by nickel. In addition , we demonstrated that nickel exposure trigger the reduction of GADD45A-mediated DNA repair by impairing the physical interactions between GADD45A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen or xeroderma pigmentosum G. Notably , in the GADD45A-knockdown system , the levels of unrepaired DNA photoproducts were higher than wild-type cells , elucidating the importance of GADD45A in the nickel-associated inhibition of DNA repair. These results imply that inhibition of p53-mediated DNA repair can be considered a potential carcinogenic mechanism of nickel at low concentrations.
