  Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is a clinically aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Conventional chemotherapeutics are generally able to shrink the tumor mass , but often fail to completely eradicate cancer stem-like cells ( CSCs) that are responsible for high risk of relapse and frequent metastases. In this study , we examined thermal sensibility of CSCs , developed an approach that enabled concurrent elimination of both the bulk of cancer cells and CSCs , and investigated the underlying mechanism. We designed a platform consisting of gold nanoparticle-coated porous silicon microparticle ( AuPSM) that was also loaded with docetaxel micelles ( mDTX) to enable concurrent killing of the bulk of cancer cells by released mDTX and CSCs by mild<symptom> hyperthermia<symptom> upon stimulation of AuPSM with near infrared. In addition , we examined the role of heat shock<symptom> proteins in sensitizing CSC killing. Finally , we applied mDTX-loaded AuPSM to treat mice with SUM159 and 4T1 orthotopic tumors , and evaluated tumor growth and tumor metastasis. MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells treated with mDTX-loaded AuPSM and mild<symptom> hyperthermia<symptom> displayed significantly reduced efficiencies in mammosphere formation than those treated with mDTX alone or mild<symptom> hyperthermia<symptom> alone. Combination treatment also completely inhibited SUM159 orthotopic tumor growth and 4T1 tumor metastasis. Mechanistically , DTX treatment suppressed expression of heat shock<symptom> protein 27 in cancer cells including the CSCs , rendering cells sensitive to mild<symptom> hyperthermia<symptom>. Our results indicate that chemotherapy sensitizes CSC to mild<symptom> hyperthermia<symptom>. We have developed an effective therapeutic approach to eliminate therapy-resistant cells in TNBC.
