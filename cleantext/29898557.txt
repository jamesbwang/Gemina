  Despite the implementation of strict air pollution control measures in recent years , severe haze events were still encountered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei ( Jing-Jin-Ji) region during the winter 2016. In this work , seasonal differences in correlations between air pollution and geographic terrain , atmospheric dynamical and thermal structures , and PBL height over the Jing-Jin-Ji region in history and recent years were investigated and a comprehensive model of atmospheric factors affecting winter air pollution formation was proposed. We found that the distribution of PM
