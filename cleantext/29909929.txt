  Interventional radiology is a subspecialty of diagnostic radiology that uses minimally invasive techniques performed under imaging guidance. Interventional radiology has its roots in angiography , which is the radiologic examination of blood vessels after the introduction of a contrast medium that allows them to be imaged. Going forward , the collaboration between human and veterinary interventional radiologists will persist as a two-way street and will continue to innovate together and learn from each other and from the patients.
