  Congenital aniridia , a severe bilateral panocular visual disorder , is an autosomal dominantly inherited eye anomaly. Mutations in the paired box 6 gene ( PAX6) have been shown to be responsible for congenital aniridia in most patients. The purpose of the present study was to report clinical features of a Chinese family with congenital aniridia and to screen novel genetic mutations for congenital aniridia. All members of a three-generation family underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination , and 8 of its 25 members were diagnosed with congenital aniridia. The proband was analyzed by exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing , and linkage analysis was performed for the family. The mutation was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Using Illumina 's Human Linkage-12 beadchip microarray ( including 6090 SNPs) whole genome scan , the LOD score value showed that the interval on chromosome 11 between rs1389423 to rs910090 exhibited a strong linkage. A novel heterozygous 469 kb deletion mutation within the downstream region of PAX6 ( chr11: 31189937-31659379) was identified in all affected family members , but not in unaffected family members or 2000 ethnically matched controls. A novel deletion mutation was identified within the PAX6 downstream region that results in congenital aniridia.
