  Carnosic acid was used as starting material to synthesize royleanone derivatives featured C11-C14 para quinone. The importance of C-20 group of royleanone derivatives was verified by the cytotoxicity assay of royleanonic acid , miltionone I and deoxyneocrptotanshinone. Following our synthetic route , 15 amide derivatives were synthesized and 8 compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against three human cancer lines in vitro.
