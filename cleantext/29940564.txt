  Fibrosis<disease> and angiogenesis are the most common processes that result in progressive peritoneal tissue remodeling and , eventually , peritoneal membrane dysfunction. The role of exosomes , which contributes to intercellular communication , in these processes has been neglected. Various biomolecules , including DNA , mRNA , proteins , lipids , and particular certain miRNAs , can be transferred by exosomes to local , neighboring and distal cells. Upon stimulation by cytokines or other microenvironment stimuli , donor cells release a mass of exosomes to peritoneal mesothelial cells , further affecting fibrosis<disease> and angiogenesis. This important exosomes-mediated intracellular communication is thought to regulate peritoneal membrane function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these processes , targeting changes in exosomes and regulating exosomal miRNAs will advance therapeutic methods for protecting peritoneal membrane function.
