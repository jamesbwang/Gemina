  Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for fracture independent of FRAX ( fracture risk assessment) probability. We directly compared four proposed methods to improve the performance of FRAX for type 2 diabetes by: ( 1) including the rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) input to FRAX; ( 2) making a trabecular bone score ( TBS) adjustment to FRAX; ( 3) reducing the femoral neck T-score input to FRAX by 0.5 SD; and ( 4) increasing the age input to FRAX by 10 years. We examined major osteoporotic fractures ( MOFs) and hip fractures ( HFs) over a mean of 8.3 years observation among 44,543 women and men 40 years of age or older ( 4136 with diabetes) with baseline lumbar spine and hip DXA from 1999 through 2016. Controlled for unadjusted FRAX probability , diabetes was associated with an increased risk for MOFs and HFs. All four FRAX adjustments attenuated the effect of diabetes , but a residual effect of diabetes was seen on MOF risk after TBS adjustment , and on HF risk after the RA and TBS adjustments. Among those with diabetes , unadjusted FRAX risk underestimated MOF ( observed/predicted ratio 1.15; 95 % CI , 1.03 to 1.28) , but this was no longer significant after applying the diabetes adjustments. HF risk was more severely underestimated ( observed/predicted ratio 1.85; 95 % CI , 1.51 to 2.20) and was only partially corrected with the diabetes adjustments ( still significant for the RA and TBS adjustments). Among those with diabetes , there was moderate reclassification based upon a fixed MOF cut-off of 20 % ( 4.1 % to 7.1 %) or fixed HF cut-off of 3 % ( 5.7 % to 16.5 %). Net reclassification improvement increased for MOF with each of the diabetes adjustments ( range 3.9 % to 5.6 % in the diabetes subgroup). In conclusion , each of the proposed methods for addressing limitations in the ability of FRAX to assess fracture risk in individuals with diabetes was found to improve performance , though no single method was optimal in all settings.
