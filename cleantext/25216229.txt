  An unusual variant of prostate adenocarcinoma ( PC) expressing nuclear p63 in secretory cells instead of the typical basal expression has been reported in men. Nevertheless , the biological behavior and clinical significance of this phenomenon is unknown. In dogs , this unusual PC subtype has not been described. In this study , p63 immunoexpression was investigated in 90 canine PCs and 20 normal prostate tissues ( NT). The p63 expression pattern in luminal or basal cells was confirmed in a selected group of 26 PCs and 20 NT by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blotting assays. Eleven canine PC samples aberrantly expressing p63 ( p63 +) in secretory cells were compared with 15 p63 negative ( p63-) cases in the context of several molecular markers ( high molecular weight cytokeratin-HMWC , CK8/18 , CK5 , AR , PSA , chromogranin , NKX3 .1 , PTEN , AKT and C-MYC). P63 + samples were positive for CK5 , HMWC and CK8/18 and negative for PSA , NKX3 .1 , PTEN and chromogranin. Five p63 + PCs were negative for AR , and the remaining six samples had low AR expression. In contrast , p63- PC showed AR and PSA positive expression in all 15 samples. Only five p63- PCs were positive for CK5. Both p63 + and p63- PC samples showed higher cytoplasmic AKT expression and nuclear C-MYC staining in comparison with normal tissues. Metastatic ( N = 12) and non-metastatic ( N = 14) PCs showed similar immunoexpression for all markers tested. In contrast to human PC , canine PC aberrantly expressing p63 showed higher expression levels of HMWC and CK5 and lower levels of NKX3 .1. Canine p63 + PC is a very rare PC group showing a distinct phenotype compared to typical canine PC , including AR and PSA negative expression. Although in a limited number of cases , p63 expression was not associated with metastasis in canine PC , and cytoplasmic p63 expression was observed in animals with shorter survival time , similar to human PC cases.
