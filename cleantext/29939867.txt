  Since the first description of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease a century ago , the diagnosis , staging , prognosis , and treatment decisions have been based on plain radiographs. The goal of treatment is prevention of femoral head deformity , yet radiographic prognostic classifications are applied in the fragmentation stage , often after deformity occurs. These classifications are assigned too late in the progression of the disease to maximize the effects of intervention. Thus , alternative mechanisms to determine femoral head involvement earlier in the disease course are warranted. Increasingly , MRI has been used in the study of the disease. Gadolinium-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI has shown promising results that correlate with radiographic classifications and the early radiographic outcome. Advanced imaging has improved the assessment of hinge abduction , yet the exact definition remains controversial. The role of imaging in the management of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is rapidly evolving. New or refined imaging techniques may eventually allow earlier prognosis and treatment.
