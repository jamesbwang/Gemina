  The objective of this work was assessing the sensitivity of leeches to several water quality attributes in lowlands streams. We used occupancy modelling that account explicitly for detectability , to estimate the influence of four variables ( dissolved oxygen , 5-days biochemicals oxygen demand , conductivity , and dissolved inorganic nitrogen) affecting nine species. We described the sensitivity as a change in the occupancy along the range of water quality attributes. We found at least one species of Helobdella in 81 % of sites and Helobdella , as genus , was detected along the entire gradient of each attribute. However , differences in the sensitivity were observed between species. For example , if we analyse the sensitivity of the genus Helobdella to dissolved oxygen , we can say that it is very tolerant. However , if we analyse the response to dissolved oxygen of each one of the species of Helobdella , we will realize that H. michaelseni , and H. simplex<disease> showed a high occupancy at high levels of dissolved oxygen; while H. hyalina and H. triserialis lineata showed high occupancy at low levels. Describe the sensitivity of the species in terms of occupancy , offers a new methodology to understand how the species behave along a stressor gradient.
