  Potent adjuvants are highly demanded for most protein and peptides based vaccine candidates in clinical development. Recognition of viral single stranded ( ss) RNA by innate toll-like receptors 7/8 in dendritic cells results in a cytokine environment supportive to the establishment of long lasting antibody responses and Th1 oriented T cell immunity. To fully exploit the immunestimulatory properties of ssRNA , it needs to be adequately formulated to ensure its optimal delivery to dendritic cells in the vaccine draining lymph nodes. In the present paper , we report on the design of ssRNA nanocomplexes formed by complexation of the cationic poly ( carbonic acid 2-dimethylamino-ethyl ester 1-methyl-2- ( 2-methacryloylamino)- ethyl ester) ( pHPMA-DMAE) based polymeric carrier and ssRNA. The resulting ssRNA nanocomplexes were subsequently PEGylated through copper-free click chemistry using PEG-bicyclo ( 6.1.0) nonyne ( PEG-BCN) and cross-linked via disulfide bonds to increase their stability. The obtained near-neutral charged PEGylated ssRNA nanocomplexes ( ~ 150 nm) combined ssRNA protection with highly efficient delivery of ssRNA to DCs in the vaccine draining lymph nodes after subcutanuously administration. When co-administrated with a model antigen ( soluble ovalbumin ( OVA)) , ssRNA nanocomplexes were far more efficient at inducing CD8 cytolytic T cells when compared to OVA co-adminstarted with naked ssRNA. Furthermore , IgG2c antibody titers , indicative of Th1 skewed T cell responses , were > 10 times increased by complexing ssRNA into the PEGylated nanocomplexes. This study highlights the potential of post-functionalizing ssRNA nanocomplexes by copper-free click chemistry and these findings indcate that this potent ssRNA adjuvant may profoundly improve the efficacy of a variety of vaccines requiring Th1-type immunity.
