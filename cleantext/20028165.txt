  Aggregation-induced emission ( AIE) is the long-sought solution to the problem of aggregation-caused quenching that has hampered efficient application of fluorescent organic materials. An important goal on the way to fully understand the working mechanism of the AIE process was , for more than a decade , and still remains obtaining more comprehensive insights into the correlation between the ultrafast excited-state dynamics in tetraphenylethylene ( TPE)- based molecules and the AIE effect in them. Here we report a number of TPE-based derivatives with varying structural rigidities and AIE properties. Using a combination of ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy and computational studies , we observe a direct correlation between the state-dependent coupling motions and inhibited fluorescence , and prove the existence of photocyclized intermediates in them. We demonstrate that the dominant non-radiative relaxation dynamics ,
