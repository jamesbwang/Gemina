  The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the effect of violet-blue light on the metabolic activity of early Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> biofilm , reincubated at 0 , 2 , and 6 h after 5 min of violet-blue light treatment. S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> UA159 biofilm cells were cultured for 12 to 16 h in microtiter plates with Tryptic Soy broth ( TSB) or TSB with 1 % sucrose ( TSBS) and irradiated with violet-blue light for 5 min. After irradiation , the plates were reincubated at 37 Â°C for 0 , 2 , or 6 h in 5 % CO
