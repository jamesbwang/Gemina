  With the growing recognition of the extent and prevalence of human cerebellar disorders , an understanding of developmental programs that build the mature cerebellum is necessary. In this chapter we present an overview of the basic epochs and key molecular regulators of the developmental programs of cerebellar development. These include early patterning of the cerebellar territory , the genesis of cerebellar cells from multiple spatially distinct germinal zones , and the extensive migration and coordinated cellular rearrangements that result in the formation of the exquisitely foliated and laminated mature cerebellum. This knowledge base is founded on extensive analysis of animal models , particularly mice , due in large part to the ease of genetic manipulation of this important model organism. Since cerebellar structure and function are largely conserved across species , mouse cerebellar development is highly relevant to humans and has led to important insights into the developmental pathogenesis of human cerebellar disorders. Human fetal cerebellar development remains largely undescribed; however , several human-specific developmental features are known which are relevant to human<disease> disease<disease> and underline the importance of ongoing human fetal research.
