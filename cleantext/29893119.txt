  Brown adipose tissue ( BAT) has been identified as a promising target for the treatment of obesity , diabetes , and relevant metabolism disorders because of the adaptive thermogenesis ability of this tissue. Visualizing BAT may provide an essential tool for pathology study , drug screening , and efficacy evaluation. Owing to limitations of current nuclear and magnetic resonance imaging approaches for BAT detection , fluorescence imaging has advantages in large-scale preclinical research on small animals. Here , fast BAT imaging in mice is conducted based on polymer dots as fluorescent probes. As early as 5 min after the intravenous injection of polymer dots , extensive fluorescence is detected in the interscapular BAT and axillar BAT. In addition , axillar and inguinal white adipose tissues ( WAT) are recognized. The real-time in vivo behavior of polymer dots in rodents is monitored using the probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging , and the preferred accumulation in BAT over WAT is confirmed by histological assays. Moreover , the whole study is conducted without a low temperature or pharmaceutical stimulation. The imaging efficacy is verified at the cellular , histological , and whole-body levels , and the present results indicate that fluorescent polymer dots may be a promising tool for the visualization of BAT in living subjects.
