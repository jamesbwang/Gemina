  Studies of neighborhood food environments typically focus on select stores ( especially supermarkets) and/or restaurants ( especially fast-food outlets) , make presumptions about healthfulness without assessing actual items for sale , and ignore other kinds of businesses offering foods/drinks. The current study assessed availability of select healthful and less-healthful foods/drinks from all storefront businesses in an urban environment and considered implications for food-environment research and community health. Cross-sectional assessment in 2013 of all storefront businesses ( n = 852) on all street segments ( n = 1,253) in 32 census tracts of the Bronx , New<pathogen> York. Investigators assessed for healthful items ( produce , whole grains , nuts , water , milk) and less-healthful items ( refined sweets , salty/fatty fare , sugar-added drinks , and alcohol) , noting whether items were from food businesses ( e.g. , supermarkets and restaurants) or other storefront businesses ( OSB , e.g. , barber shops , gyms , hardware stores , laundromats). Data were analyzed in 2017. Half of all businesses offered food/drink items. More than one seventh of all street segments ( more than one third in higher-poverty census tracts) had businesses selling food/drink. OSB accounted for almost one third of all businesses offering food/drink items ( about one quarter of businesses offering any healthful items and more than two thirds of businesses offering only less-healthful options). Food environments include many businesses not primarily focused on selling foods/drinks. Studies that do not consider OSB may miss important food/drink sources , be incomplete and inaccurate , and potentially misguide interventions. OSB hold promise for improving food environments and community health by offering healthful items; some already do.
