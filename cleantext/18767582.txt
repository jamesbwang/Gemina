  This retrospective study evaluated the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES) for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain ( EAP). A total of 154 patients with EAP were included and were divided into 2 groups in this retrospective study. Eighty-three patients were assigned a treatment group , and underwent NMES therapy , while 71 subjects in the control group were at waiting list. The primary outcome of pain was measured by the numerical rating scale ( NRS) and the Endometriosis Symptom Severity scale ( ESSS). The secondary outcome was quality of life , measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36). All outcomes were measured before and after 5-week and 10-week treatment. Moreover , we also recorded the adverse events in this study.After 5-week treatment , no significant differences in all outcome measurements were found between the 2 groups. However , after 10-week treatment , NMES therapy exerted better outcomes in NRS ( P = .02) , ESSS ( P = .04) , and SF-36 ( Physical Component Summary ( PCS) , P < .01; Mental Component Summary ( MCS) , P < .01) , compared with the patients at the waiting list. Moreover , no significant differences of all adverse events were found between the 2 groups , although mild and acceptable adverse events occurred in the treatment group.This study demonstrated that NMES is effective for treating patients with EAP.
