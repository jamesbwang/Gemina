  Recent studies have shown that the long non-coding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated ( UCA1) plays a key role in cardiovascular injury. However , the potential biological role of UCA1 in progression of atherosclerosis ( AS) remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to identify the regulation of lncRNA UCA1 on atherosclerosis-related vascular dysfunction via miR-26a targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN) , and investigate the underlying mechanisms in the development of atherosclerosis. The proliferation and migration were detected using CCK-8 assay , Wound healing assay and Transwell assay. The expression of miR-26a and its target gene in vascular smooth muscle cells was detected by qRT-PCR , the complementary binging of miRNA and lncRNA was verified by luciferase assays. PTEN was predicted to be the target of miR-26a and the prediction was verified by luciferase assays. Expression of miR-26a was up-regulated in ox-LDL ( 50 mg/l) induced vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMCs) , and overexpression of miR-26a inhibited PTEN expression and promoted PCNA α-SMA and SM22-α expression ( qRT-PCR and WB). The expression of UCA1 antagonized the effect of miR-26a on the downregulation of its target PETN and contraction phenotype. This study reveals that lncRNA UCA1 act as an endogenous sponge of miR-26a and downregulates miR-26a expression levels , and thereby relieving the inhibition of its target gene PTEN and alleviates VSMCs proliferation against atherosclerosis.
