  n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 HUFA) directly and indirectly regulate lipid metabolism , energy balance<symptom> and the inflammatory response. We investigated changes to the n-3 HUFA score of healthy adults , induced by different types and amounts of conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA)- enriched ( ENCH) cheeses consumed for different periods of time , compared to dietary fish oil ( FO) pills ( 500 mg , each containing 100 mg of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids-- EPA+DHA) or & alpha;- linolenic acid ( ALA)- rich linseed oil ( 4 g , containing 2 g of ALA). A significant increase in the n-3 HUFA score was observed , in a dose-dependent manner , after administration of the FO supplement. In terms of the impact on the n-3 HUFA score , the intake of ENCH cheese ( 90 g/day) for two or four weeks was equivalent to the administration of one or two FO pills , respectively. Conversely , the linseed oil intake did not significantly impact the n-3 HUFA score. Feeding ENCH cheeses from different sources ( bovine , ovine and caprine) for two months improved the n-3 HUFA score by increasing plasma DHA , and the effect was proportional to the CLA content in the cheese. We suggest that the improved n-3 HUFA score resulting from ENCH cheese intake may be attributed to increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( PPAR- & alpha ;-RRB- activity. This study demonstrates that natural ENCH cheese is an alternative nutritional source of n-3 HUFA in humans.
