  Childhood risk factors for long-term lung health often co-exist and their specific patterns may affect subsequent lung function differently. To identify childhood risk factor profiles , their influence on lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) in middle-age and potential pathways. Profiles of 11 childhood respiratory risk factors , documented at age 7 , were identified in 8352 participants from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study using latent class analysis. We investigated: associations between risk profiles and lung function , and COPD at age 53; mediation by childhood lung function and adult asthma; and interaction with personal smoking. Six risk profiles were identified: 1- `` unexposed or least exposed '' ( 49 %) , 2- `` parental smoking '' ( 21.5 %) , 3- `` allergy '' ( 10 %) , 4- `` frequent asthma , bronchitis<symptom> '' ( 8.7 %) , 5- `` infrequent asthma , bronchitis<symptom> '' ( 8.3 %) and 6- `` frequent asthma , bronchitis<symptom> , allergy '' ( 2.6 %). Profile 6 was most strongly associated with lower FEV1 :-LRB- -261; 95 % CI: -373 , -148 mL); lower FEV1/FVC :-LRB- -3.4; -4.8 , -1.9 %) and increased COPD risk ( OR: 4.9; 2.1,11.0) at age 53. The effect of profile 6 on COPD was largely mediated by adult active asthma ( 62.5 %) and reduced childhood lung function ( 26.5 %). Profiles 2 and 4 had smaller adverse effects than profile 6. Notably effects of profiles 2 and 6 were stronger for smokers. Profiles of childhood respiratory risk factors predict middle-age lung function and COPD risk. Adult active asthma is a dominant mediator in associations between childhood asthma-related risk profiles and middle-age lung function/COPD. Specifically , children with frequent asthma attacks and allergies , especially if they also become adult smokers , are the most vulnerable group that should be targeted for interventions.
