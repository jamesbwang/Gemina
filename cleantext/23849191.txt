  Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion<symptom> to spare during surgery. To this end , noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However , taking into account this information is often still insufficient , as the complex nonlinear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction , an appropriate computational model has to be selected , after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end , we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain , an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong-Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition , the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed ( 1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; ( 2) local model parameters that can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor , regions distant from a tumor , and regions in a healthy brain; and ( 3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.
