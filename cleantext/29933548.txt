  To advance the field of time-use epidemiology , a tool capable of monitoring 24 h movement behaviours including sleep , physical activity , and sedentary behaviour is needed. This study explores compliance with a novel dual-accelerometer system for capturing 24 h movement patterns in two free-living samples of children and adults. A total of 103 children aged 8 years and 83 adults aged 20-60 years were recruited. Using a combination of medical dressing and purpose-built foam pouches , participants were fitted with two Axivity AX3 accelerometers-- one to the thigh and the other to the lower back-- for seven 24 h periods. AX3 accelerometers contain an inbuilt skin temperature sensor that facilitates wear time estimation. The median ( IQR) wear time in children was 160 ( 67) h and 165 ( 79) h ( out of a maximum of 168 h) for back and thigh placement , respectively. Wear time was significantly higher and less variable in adults , with a median ( IQR) for back and thigh placement of 168 ( 1) and 168 ( 0) h. A greater proportion of adults ( 71.6 %) achieved the maximum number of complete days when compared to children ( 41.7 %). We conclude that a dual-accelerometer protocol using skin attachment methods holds considerable promise for monitoring 24-h movement behaviours in both children and adults.
