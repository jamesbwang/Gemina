  Advances in carbohydrate chemistry have certainly made common oligosaccharides much more accessible. However , many current methods still rely heavily upon specialized knowledge of carbohydrate chemistry. The application of automated technologies to chemical and life science applications such as genomics and proteomics represents a vibrant field. These automated technologies also present opportunities for their application to organic synthesis , including that of the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However , application of automated methods to the synthesis of carbohydrates is an underdeveloped area as compared to other classes of biomolecules. The overarching goal of this review article is to present the advances that have been made at the interface of carbohydrate chemistry and automated technology.
