  Perillyl alcohol , ( 4-isopropylene-1-cyclohexene) methanol , is a monocyclic monoterpene alcohol with special odorous similar to that of linalool and terpineol. It has application potential in pharmaceutical , daily chemical and food industries. In this study , one method for the synthesis of perillyl alcohol through the MVA pathway was studied. First , the MVA metabolic pathway originated from Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> was constructed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> to synthesize limonene. Limonene was further transformed to perillyl alcohol by the hydroxylation of cytochrome P450 alkane hydroxylase. Furthermore , the shake flask fermentation condition of the engineered E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain was optimized. The results showed that the engineered E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> could produce about 50.12 mg/L perillyl alcohol through MVA pathway using glucose as raw material. In this study , the method of the MVA pathway for perillyl alcohol synthesis was constructed successfully in engineered E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , which provides both theoretical and technical support for terpenoids biosynthesis.
