  Half-circle illumination-based differential phase contrast ( DPC) microscopy has been utilized to recover phase images through a pair of images along multiple axes. Recently , the half-circle based DPC using 12-axis measurements significantly provides a circularly symmetric phase transfer function to improve accuracy for more stable phase recovery. Instead of using half-circle-based DPC , we propose a new scheme of DPC under radially asymmetric illumination to achieve circularly symmetric phase transfer function and enhance the accuracy of phase recovery in a more stable and efficient fashion. We present the design , implementation , and experimental image data demonstrating the ability of our method to obtain quantitative phase images of microspheres , as well as live fibroblast cell samples.
