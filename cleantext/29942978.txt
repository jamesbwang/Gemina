  We have previously demonstrated that cardiac shock<symptom> wave therapy ( CSWT) effectively improves myocardial ischemia through coronary neovascularization both in a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia and in patients with refractory angina pectoris ( AP). In this study , we further addressed the efficacy and safety of CSWT in a single-arm multicenter study approved as a highly advanced medical treatment by the Japanese Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare. Fifty patients with refractory AP ( mean age 70.9 Â± 12.6 ( SD) years , M/F 38/12) without the indications of percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) were enrolled in 4 institutes in Japan. Ischemic myocardial regions in the left ventricle ( LV) were identified by drug-induced stress myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI). Shock<symptom> waves ( 200 shots/spot at 0.09 mJ/mm
