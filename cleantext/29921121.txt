  Cyclodextrins ( CDs) are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides , whose unique hydrophilic outer surface and lipophilic central cavity facilitate the formation of inclusion complexes with various biomolecules , such as cholesterol and phospholipids , via multi-interactions. Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) is the main carrier of cholesterol in bloodstream and is associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. The surface of LDL is composed of a shell of phospholipids monolayer containing most of the free unesterified cholesterol as well as the single copy of apolipoprotein B-100. To date , various LDL adsorbents have been fabricated to interact with the biomolecules on LDL surface. Owing to its elegant structure , CD is considered to be a promising choice for preparation of more economical and effective LDL-adsorbing materials. Therefore , in this study , interaction between β-CD and LDL in solution was investigated by dynamic light scattering , circular dichroism , and ultraviolet spectroscopy. Further , a supramolecular surface based on β-CD was simply prepared by self-assembled monolayer on gold surface. The effect of hydrogen bond and the cavity of β-CD on the interaction between β-CD and LDL was particularly explored by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) analysis. The SPR results showed that such β-CD-modified surface exhibited good selectivity and could be largely regenerated by sodium dodecyl sulfate wash. This study may extend the understanding of the interaction between LDL and LDL adsorbent or the design and development of more efficient and lower-cost LDL adsorbents in the future.
