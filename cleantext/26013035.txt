  Influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. miRNAs are a class of small noncoding single-stranded RNA molecules that can negatively regulate gene expression and play important roles in virus-host interaction. However , the roles of miRNAs in IAV<pathogen> infection are still not fully understood. Here , we profiled the cellular miRNAs of A549 cells infected with A/goose/Jilin/ hb/2003 ( H5N1<pathogen>) and a comparison A/Beijing/501/ 2009 ( H1N1<pathogen>). miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR analysis showed that several miRNAs were differentially expressed in A549 cells during IAV<pathogen> infection. Subsequently , we demonstrated that IAV<pathogen> replication was essential for the regulation of these miRNAs , and bioinformatic analysis revealed that the targets of these miRNAs affected biological processes relevant to IAV<pathogen> replication. Specifically , miR-21-3p was found to be down-regulated in IAV-infected A549 cells and selected for further detailed analysis. Target prediction and functional study illustrated that miR-21-3p repressed the expression of HDAC8 by targeting its 3 ` UTR. Furthermore , we confirmed miR-21-3p could promote virus replication , which was similar to the result of knocking down HDAC8 , indicating that miR-21-3p promoted IAV<pathogen> replication by suppressing HDAC8 expression. Altogether , our results suggest a potential host defense against IAV<pathogen> through down-regulation of miR-21-3p.
