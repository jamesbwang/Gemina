  Oxide semiconductors typically show superior device performance compared to amorphous silicon or organic counterparts , especially when they are physical vapor deposited. However , it is not easy to reproduce identical device characteristics when the oxide field-effect transistors ( FETs) are solution-processed/printed; the level of complexity further intensifies with the need to print the passive elements as well. Here , we developed a protocol for designing the most electronically compatible electrode/channel interface based on the judicious material selection. Exploiting this newly developed fabrication schemes , we are now able to demonstrate high-performance all-printed FETs and logic circuits using amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide ( a-IGZO) semiconductor , indium tin oxide ( ITO) as electrodes , and composite solid polymer electrolyte as the gate insulator. Interestingly , all-printed FETs demonstrate an optimal electrical performance in terms of threshold voltages and device mobility and may very well be compared with devices fabricated using sputtered ITO electrodes. This observation originates from the selection of electrode/channel materials from the same transparent semiconductor oxide family , resulting in the formation of In-Sn-Zn-O ( ITZO)- based-diffused a-IGZO-ITO interface that controls doping density while ensuring high electrical performance. Compressive spectroscopic studies reveal that Sn doping-mediated excellent band alignment of IGZO with ITO electrodes is responsible for the excellent device performance observed. All-printed n-MOS-based logic circuits have also been demonstrated toward new-generation portable electronics.
