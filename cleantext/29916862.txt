  Oxytocin has known antinociceptive effects and is upregulated perinatally. This pilot study investigated the association of plasma oxytocin and postcesarean incisional pain. Plasma samples from 18 patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery were drawn at 1 hour preoperatively and 1 and 24 hours postoperatively and analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pain was assessed at 1 day , 8 weeks , 3 months , and 6 months postoperatively. Incisional pain at 24 hours was inversely correlated with 1- and 24-hour oxytocin levels , with higher plasma oxytocin associated with lower pain ( œÅ , -0.52 and -0.66; P < .05).
