  Bone turnover markers ( BTMs) are proposed as alternative indicators for bone mineral density in diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. However , little is known about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on BTMs in nonwhite populations. We aimed to investigate the responses in BTMs after vitamin D supplementation in Asians. In this secondary data analysis of a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , 448 Chinese adults ( mean ± SD age: 31.9 ± 8.0 y; mean ± SD body mass index ( kg/m2): 22.1 ± 2.6; 69 % were women) with vitamin D deficiency ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D < 50 nmol/L) received 2000 IU/d cholecalciferol or placebo for 20 wk. Serum concentrations of 25 ( OH) D , parathyroid hormone ( PTH) , calcium , and markers of bone formation and resorption were measured at weeks 0 and 20. Intention-to-treat analysis was applied , and between-group differences were compared by general linear models with adjustments. Cholecalciferol supplementation increased the serum bone alkaline phosphatase ( BALP) concentration ( +1.7 ± 1.9 µg/L) significantly more than placebo ( +1.1 ± 1.7 µg/L; P = 0.004) , but not circulating concentrations of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide ( PINP) , β-isomerized C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ( β-CTX) , or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b ( TRAP5b) ( P ≥ 0.53). Notably , a pooled analysis indicated that changes in serum 25 ( OH) D were positively associated with changes in serum BALP , PINP , and TRAP5b ( r = 0.07-0.16 , P ≤ 0.02) , but inversely with changes in PTH ( r = -0.15 , P < 0.001). Among cholecalciferol-treated participants , individuals who achieved serum 25 ( OH) D ≥ 75 nmol/L had greater increases in serum β-CTX ( 224 % compared with 146 %; P = 0.02) and TRAP5b ( 22.2 % compared with 9.1 %; P = 0.007) , but smaller decreases in serum calcium ( -1.3 % compared with -1.9 %; P = 0.005) and calcium-phosphorus product ( -2.6 % compared with -3.3 %; P = 0.02) compared with those with serum 25 ( OH) D < 75 nmol/L. Daily supplementation with 2000 IU cholecalciferol for 20 wk may promote bone formation in Chinese adults with vitamin D deficiency. More studies are needed to elucidate the potential clinical implications of BTMs. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01998763.
