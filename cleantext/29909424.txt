  Objectives The aim of this study was to examine blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD) and parathyroid hormone ( PTH) among indoor , outdoor , permanent and rotating night workers and the association with hours spent outdoors on and off work days. Methods Blood samples were collected from 425 workers ( 162 indoor , 112 outdoor , 118 rotating night and 33 permanent night workers) throughout all seasons. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD) and parathyroid hormone ( PTH) were analyzed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS) and an automated immune analyzer , respectively. Personal light exposure levels were continuously recorded and used to estimate hours spent outdoors ( all workers). Results Permanent night workers had 25.3 % ( 95 % CI 11.9-36.6) lower 25OHD concentration , 4.55 ( 95 % CI 1.39-14.94) higher odds of vitamin D insufficiency ( < 50 nmol/L) and 14.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.1-31.1) higher PTH concentration than indoor workers. Outdoor workers had similar 25OHD concentrations but 7.5 % ( 95 % CI -0.5-14.9) lower PTH concentration compared to indoor workers. Rotating night workers 25OHD and PTH concentrations did not differ from indoor workers. Concentration of 25OHD increased by 5.2 % ( 95 % CI 1.1-9.5) per hour spent outdoor at workdays in the summer. Conclusion Clinicians should be aware that vitamin D insufficiency may be more prevalent among permanent night workers and human resources should consider the positive effect of allowing workers to spend time outdoor during work hours.
