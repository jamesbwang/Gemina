  Large benthic foraminifera ( LBF) are marine calcifying protists that commonly harbor algae<pathogen> as symbionts. These organisms are major calcium carbonate producers and important contributors to primary production in the photic zones. Light is one of the main known factors limiting their distribution , and species of this group developed specific mechanisms that allow them to occupy different habitats across the light gradient. Operculina ammonoides ( Gronovius , 1781) is a planispiral LBF that has two main shell morphotypes , thick involute and flat evolute. Earlier studies suggested morphologic changes with variation in water depth and presumably light. In this study , specimens of the two morphotypes were placed in the laboratory under artificial low light and near the sea floor at depths of 15 m , 30 m , and 45 m in the Gulf of Aqaba-Eilat for 23 days. Differences in growth and symbionts content were evaluated using weight , size , and chlorophyll a. Our results show that O. ammonoides exhibit morphological plasticity when constructing thinner chambers after relocation to low light conditions , and adding more weight per area after relocation to high light conditions. In addition , O. ammonoides exhibited chlorophyll content adaptation to a certain range of light conditions , and evolute specimens that were acclimatized to very low light did not survive relocation to a high light environment , possibly due to photo-oxidative stress.
