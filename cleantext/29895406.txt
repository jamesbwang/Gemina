  To compare the postprandial cardiometabolic response to prolonged sitting , continuous moderate-intensity physical activity ( PA) followed by prolonged sitting , and interrupting prolonged sitting with hourly high-intensity PA breaks. Three-condition randomised crossover trial. Fourteen sedentary and inactive adults aged 29 ± 9 years took part in three , 8-h conditions: ( 1) prolonged sitting ( SIT) , ( 2) a continuous 30-min moderate-intensity PA bout followed by prolonged sitting ( CONT-SIT) , and ( 3) sitting interrupted hourly with 2 min 32s high-intensity PA bouts ( SIT-ACT). The treadmill PA in conditions 2 and 3 were matched for energy expenditure. Two standardised test meals were consumed during each condition. Incremental area under the curve ( iAUC) for each 8-h condition was calculated for glucose , insulin , triglyceride , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) concentrations. Statistical analyses were completed using linear mixed models. Compared with SIT , SIT-ACT lowered triglyceride iAUC by 2.23 mmol/L ∙ 8h ( 95 % CI -4.33 , -0.13) and raised HDL-C iAUC by 0.99 mmol/L ∙ 8h ( 0.05 , 1.93) ( all p ≤ 0.038). There was no significant difference in triglyceride or HDL-C iAUC between CONT-SIT and SIT or SIT-ACT ( p ≥ 0.211). There were no significant differences between conditions for glucose or insulin iAUC ( p ≥ 0.504). This study suggests that interrupting prolonged sitting with hourly high-intensity PA breaks acutely improves postprandial triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations compared with prolonged sitting , whereas a continuous moderate-intensity PA bout does not.
