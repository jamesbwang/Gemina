  To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of endoscopic dilatation of anastomotic stricture ( AS). An observational study. Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology , Shaikh Zayed Hospital , Lahore , Pakistan from November 2016 to November 2017. Patients presenting with anastomotic biliary stricture following living donor liver transplant ( LDLT) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography ( ERCP) and treatment of their strictures with dilatation with or without stenting. The patients were then followed up to see adequate resolution of stricture and repeat therapeutic ERCP was performed , if required. The patients were labelled as cured if stricture resolution persisted for a period of up to six months following ERCP. Forty-three patients ( 32 males and 11 females) , with post-LDLT AS , who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Thirty-six ( 83.7 %) patients had a single biliary anastomosis while seven ( 16.3 %) patients had two anastomoses. Ductoplasty was done in 15 ( 34.9 %) of the enrolled patients. Patients with post-LDLT AS required 3.65 +1.15 sessions of ERCP. Plastic type biliary stent was used in seven ( 16.3 %) patients , balloon dilatation alone was done in five ( 11.6 %) patients and combined balloon dilatation and stent placement was performed in 29 ( 67.4 %) patients , and combined graduated dilator and stent placement was performed in two ( 4.7 %) patients. Five ( 11.6 %) patients required rendezvous procedure ( whereby a radiologist placed a guidewire percutaneously into the biliary system) as guidewire placement across stricture site was endoscopically unsuccessful. The overall success rate was 88.4 %. Mean stent free follow-up was 7.18 +1.38 months. Recurrence of AS was noted in one ( 2.3 %) patient. Endoscopic management of post-LDLT AS has an efficacious long-term outcome.
