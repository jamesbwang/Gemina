  Linear growth is best estimated by serial anthropometric data or height velocity ( HV). In the absence of recent data on growth velocity , we undertook to establish normative data in apparently healthy North Indian children. Prospective longitudinal study in a representative sample of 7710 apparently healthy children , aged 3-17 years from different regions of Delhi. Height was measured at baseline and at 12 months while pubertal examination was performed at baseline in a subset of children. The data on HV and puberty were available in 5635 participants ( 73.08 %; 2341 boys and 3294 girls) and 1553 participants ( 622 boys; and 931 girls) , respectively. The mean peak height velocity ( PHV) was 7.82 ± 2.60 cm in boys seen at 12-12.9 years and 6.63 ± 1.81 cm in girls at 10-10.9 years Although late maturing boys had a greater HV than early or normal maturers , it did not vary with the age of pubertal maturation in girls. HV correlated with parental height in prepubertal boys , girls , and pubertal boys ( The study presents normal height velocities in North Indian children. A secular trend was observed in achieving PHV in both boys and girls.
