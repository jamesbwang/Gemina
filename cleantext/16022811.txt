  Metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) is a collection of metabolic disorders which leads to early cardiovascular disease and diabetes type II. Regarding the wide range of its prevalence in Iran , this systematic review and meta-analysis determined the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome<disease> in Iran. In this systematic review and meta-analysis , the Medline , ISI , IranMedex , and SID were searched using `` metabolic syndrome<disease> '' , `` syndrome<disease> X '' , `` prevalence '' , and `` Iran '' keywords from 2002 to 2012. A total of 223 articles were found in which 14 studies were considered for meta-analysis. Data were analyzed using fixed and random model and meta-regression in STATA. The prevalence of MS for those who were 20 yr and older was 23.8 % ( 95 % CI: 18.99-28.67) and in under 20 was 10.98 % ( 95 % CI: 7.75-14.2). Metabolic syndrome<disease> was more frequent in women ( 25.5 %) than in men ( 17.16 %) and was increased with increasing age. The most frequent component of metabolic syndrome<disease> was low HDL cholesterol ( 59.7 %) followed by hypertriglyceridemia ( 39.5 %). Regarding a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> and some of its components such as low HDL and high triglyceride in our country , implementation of programs for metabolic syndrome<disease> prevention is necessary.
