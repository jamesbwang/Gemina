  Thyroid hormone deficiency can impair testicular function. However , knowledge of the effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathways on testicular mitochondrial oxidative damage induced by hypothyroidism is still rudimentary. This study aims to explore the possible mechanisms of testicular mitochondrial oxidative damage in hypothyroidism rats. Wistar male rats were randomly divided into control ( C) , low- ( L) , and high-hypothyroidism ( H) groups ( 1 ml/100 g body weights ( BWs)/ day 0 , 0.001 % and 0.1 % propylthiouracil , respectively) by intragastric gavage for 60 days. Blood samples were collected to measure the levels of serum triiodothyronine ( T
