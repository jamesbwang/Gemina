  From 2010 to 2015 , young ( 13-24 years) Hispanic/Latino gay , bisexual and other men who have sex with men ( MSM) experienced the largest increase ( 18 %) in numbers of HIV<pathogen> diagnoses among all racial/ethnic groups. In 2016 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) assembled a team of scientists and public health analysts to develop a programmatic approach for addressing the increasing HIV<pathogen> diagnosis among Hispanic/Latino MSM. The team used a data driven review process , i.e. , comprehensive review of surveillance , epidemiologic , and programmatic data , to explore key questions from the literature on factors associated with HIV<pathogen> diagnoses among Hispanic/Latino MSM and to inform the approach. This paper describes key findings from the review and discusses the approach. The approach includes the following activities: increase awareness and support testing by expanding existing campaigns targeting Hispanic/Latino MSM to jurisdictions where diagnoses are increasing; strengthen existing efforts that support treatment as prevention and increase engagement in care and viral suppression among Hispanic/Latino MSM living with HIV<pathogen> and promote prevention , e.g. , PrEP uptake and condom use , among Hispanic/Latino MSM who are at high-risk for HIV<pathogen> infection.
