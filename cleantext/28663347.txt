  Focal adhesions ( FAs) and stress fibers ( SFs) act in concert during cell motility and in response to the extracellular environment. Although the structures of mature FAs and SFs are well studied , less is known about how they assemble and mature de novo during initial cell spreading. In this study using live-cell Airyscan microscopy , we find that FAs undergo `` splitting '' during their assembly , in which the FA divides along its longitudinal axis. Before splitting , FAs initially appear as assemblies of multiple linear units ( FAUs) of 0.3-Î¼m width. Splitting occurs between FAUs , resulting in mature FAs of either a single FAU or of a small number of FAUs that remain attached at their distal tips. Variations in splitting occur based on cell type and extracellular matrix. Depletion of adenomatous polyposis coli<pathogen> ( APC) or vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP) results in reduced splitting. FA-associated tension increases progressively during splitting. Early in cell spreading , ventral SFs are detected first , with other SF sub-types ( transverse arcs and dorsal SFs) being detected later. Our findings suggest that the fundamental unit of FAs is the fixed-width FAU , and that dynamic interactions between FAUs control adhesion morphology.
