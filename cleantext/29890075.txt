  Recent work has shown that diarylmethyl radicals generated by pulsed laser excitation in nanocrystalline ( NC) suspensions of tetraarylacetones constitute a valuable probe for the detailed mechanistic analysis of the solid-state photodecarbonylation reaction. Using a combination of reaction quantum yields and laser flash photolysis in nanocrystalline suspensions of ketones with different substituents on one of the α-carbons , we are able to suggest with confidence that a significant fraction of the initial α-cleavage reaction takes place from the ketone singlet excited state , that the originally formed diarylmethyl-acyl radical pair loses CO in the crystal with time constants in the sub-nanosecond regime , and that the secondary bis ( diarylmethyl) triplet radical pair has a lifetime limited by the rate of intersystem crossing of ca. 70 ns.
