  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) has a prevalence of 25-30 % in unselected populations and has become the main reason for referrals to hepatology services. From the perspective of liver disease , NAFLD has a high prevalence but low severity. Screening studies in people at risk for NAFLD have shown a prevalence of advanced fibrosis<disease> of 5 % , which underlines the need for robust pathways for risk stratification in primary care , with subsequent referrals as required. In this Review , we discuss the interface between primary and secondary care with regards to risk stratification and management of patients with NAFLD. We focus on selected issues of epidemiology and natural history and discuss the burden of disease in primary care , the evidence on screening for NAFLD , the rationale for testing for advanced fibrosis<disease> , and the optimal management of the disease in primary care.
