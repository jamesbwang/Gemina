  Physical restraints in home care and residential care settings in the form of restraining devices have been reduced in the last years. Now psychotropic drugs with sedating and thus potentially restraining effect are of increasing interest. The objective of this study was to describe prescription of psychotropic drugs for insurants in need of care and factors influencing such prescription. On the `` Annual Word Elder Abuse Awareness Day '' , the Medical Service of the Statutory Health Insurance undertook a reference day analysis. During the regular assessment of care needs , distribution of psychotropic drugs according to relevant aspects of care were analyzed. Additionally , prescribed drugs were rated with respect to inappropriateness for elder people according to the Priscus list. Data on 706 insured people were analyzed; 43 % of them received at least one psychotropic drug as a regular medication , 22 % of them at least one potentially sedating drug. According to the Priscus list , 16 % of prescribed drugs were identified as potentially inappropriate for elder people. Significant correlation was shown between prescription of psychotropic drugs and location of assessment , care need , diagnosis and the degree of limitation in daily living skills. This paper supports results in literature and emphasizes the discrepancy between restraint in the prescription of psychotropic drugs as advised by experts and distribution of these drugs in reality. Further studies analyzing the quality of prescriptions taking into consideration the individual circumstances of patients are desirable.
