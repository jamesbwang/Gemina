  This case is one of an eight-case multidisciplinary curriculum designed and implemented at the University of Ottawa by simulation educators with specialty training in obstetrics and gynecology ( OB/GYN) and anesthesiology. Consultation with a nurse educator maintained the quality and relevance of objectives for nursing participants. The curriculum was prepared to train OB/GYN and anesthesiology residents and labor and delivery nurses to hone crisis resource management skills and to recognize and manage rare/critical medical events in an obstetrical setting. Obstetricians , anesthesiologists , and nurses often work together in acute , high-stakes situations and this curriculum provides a safe environment to practice team-based management of such emergencies. Over an eight-year period , this curriculum has been executed in scenario couplets in a four-year cycle to allow OB/GYN and anesthesiology residents exposure to all scenarios during a five-year residency , beginning in their second year. Prospective evaluative data has been positive. For example , over 90 % of participants rated these simulations to be 5 out of 5 for `` Was an effective use of my educational time '' and `` Will influence/enhance my future practice. '' In this scenario , participants must evaluate and treat a postpartum preeclamptic woman who is being treated with magnesium sulfate for the purpose of seizure<symptom> prophylaxis. The patient experiences magnesium sulfate toxicity and subsequent respiratory arrest. Any mannequin that can display vital signs can be used for this scenario. This simulation case includes a case template , critical actions checklist , debriefing guide , summary of key medical content , and an evaluation form for learners to provide feedback.
