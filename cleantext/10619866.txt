  Therapies based on circulating proangiogenic cells ( PACs) have shown promise in ischemic disease models but require further optimization to reach the bedside. Ischemia-associated hypoxia robustly increases microRNA-210 ( miR-210) expression in several cell types , including endothelial cells ( ECs). In ECs , miR-210 represses EphrinA3 ( EFNA3) , inducing proangiogenic responses. This study provides new mechanistic evidences for a role of miR-210 in PACs. PACs were obtained from either adult peripheral blood or cord blood. miR-210 expression was modulated with either an inhibitory complementary oligonucleotide ( anti-miR-210) or a miRNA mimic ( pre-miR-210). Scramble and absence of transfection served as controls. As expected , hypoxia increased miR-210 in PACs. In vivo , migration toward and adhesion to the ischemic endothelium facilitate the proangiogenic actions of transplanted PACs. In vitro , PAC migration toward SDF-1Î±/ CXCL12 was impaired by anti-miR-210 and enhanced by pre-miR-210. Moreover , pre-miR-210 increased PAC adhesion to ECs and supported angiogenic responses in co-cultured ECs. These responses were not associated with changes in extracellular miR-210 and were abrogated by lentivirus-mediated EFNA3 overexpression. Finally , ex-vivo pre-miR-210 transfection predisposed PACs to induce post-ischemic therapeutic neovascularization and blood flow recovery in an immunodeficient mouse limb ischemia model. In conclusion , miR-210 modulates PAC functions and improves their therapeutic potential in limb ischemia.
