  Partial ventricular septal defect ( VSD) ( Pacman heart) is extremely rare heart defect which may be a complication of myocardial infarction or congenital deformity. In this image , a 65-year-old male patient admitted with headache<symptom> and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> dysregulation. Incidentally , transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography revealed partial VSD which was ensuingly confirmed in thoracic computed tomography. This is the fourth case in light of current literature. Partial VSDs are clinically silent , which can be diagnosed with echocardiography , computed tomography , or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging modalities.
