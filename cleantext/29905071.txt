  A Cu-mediated stereoselective ( 4 +2) annulation between N-hydroxybenzimidoyl cyanides and norbornene ( NBE) has been developed for the synthesis of 4 H-1,2-oxazin-4-ones. The reaction proceeds through sequentially forming C-O/C-C bonds. The advantage of this reaction includes high stereoselectivity , excellent yields , as well as simple and mild reaction conditions. A total of 26 examples are presented along with some control experiments.
