  Exercise pulmonary hypertension ( ePH) is an underappreciated form of exertional limitation. Despite normal resting pulmonary artery pressures , patients with ePH demonstrate early pulmonary vascular changes with reduced pulmonary arterial compliance ( PAC) and vascular distensibility ( α). Recent data suggest that targeted vasodilator therapy may improve hemodynamics in ePH , but it is not well-known whether such medications alter pulmonary vascular distensibility. Thus , we sought to evaluate if vasodilator therapy improved α a marker of early pulmonary vascular disease in ePH. Ten patients performed supine exercise right heart catheterization ( exRHC) with bicycle ergometer to peak exercise. Patients diagnosed with ePH were treated with pulmonary vasodilators. A repeat symptom-limited exercise RHC was performed at least six months after therapy. Patients with ePH had evidence of early pulmonary vascular disease , as baseline PAC and α were reduced. After pulmonary vasodilator therapy , a number of peak exercise hemodynamics statistically improved , including a decrease of total pulmonary resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance , while cardiac output increased. Importantly , vasodilator therapy partially reversed the pathogenic decreases of α at the time of repeat exRHC. Pulmonary vascular distensibility , α , a marker of early pulmonary vascular disease , improves in ePH after therapy with pulmonary vasodilators.
