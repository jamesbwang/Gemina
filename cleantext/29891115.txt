  We aimed to compare treatments for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) in terms of survival. Medline , Web of Science , Scopus , the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched. Randomized controlled trials ( RCT) that had compared esophageal SCC treatments were included. The hazard ratio ( HR) with 95 % credible interval ( CrI) was used to summarize the effect measures in the Bayesian network meta-analysis. Out of 23,256 references , 43 RCTs with 34 treatments were included. Carboplatin and paclitaxel plus radiotherapy plus surgery ( carbo-pacli + RT + S) compared with surgery alone decreased risk of death ( HR = 0.49; 95 % CrI: 0.26 , 0.90). The HRs for carbo-pacli + RT + S versus surgery plus cisplatin and fluorouracil and surgery plus cisplatin and vindesine were 0.44 ( 0.22 , 0.86) and 0.41 ( 0.20 , 0.83) , respectively. Among all treatments in network , carbo-pacli + RT + S ranked as first treatment. It seems carbo-pacli + RT + S was a better treatment among available treatments in network in terms of survival in patients with esophageal SCC.
