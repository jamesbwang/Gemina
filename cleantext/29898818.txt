  Sperm cryopreservation and thawing reduces fertility and alters the content and function of various sperm proteins. Previously , we reported that a testes-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( tACE) was required for capacitation of bovine spermatozoa. The aim of the present study was to determine effects of sperm cryopreservation and thawing on the content , activity and localisation of tACE in bovine spermatozoa. Relative median fluorescence intensity ( flow cytometry) was greater ( P < 0.01) , tACE content ( 110 kDa protein) in sperm proteins was higher ( P < 0.01) and there was greater tACE enzyme activity ( mean ( ± s.e.m.) 0.16 ± 0.01 vs 0.06 ± 0.02UmL-1; P < 0.01) in fresh versus frozen-thawed spermatozoa ( n = 6 bulls). In fresh spermatozoa , tACE was immunolocalised in the acrosomal and principal piece regions of the sperm head and tail respectively. However , in frozen-thawed spermatozoa , there were four patterns of localisation: most frozen-thawed spermatozoa ( 64 %) had fluorescence in the acrosomal ridge , whereas in 17 % and 9 % of spermatozoa the signal was limited to the post-acrosomal region and the equatorial segment respectively; in the remainder ( 10 %) , there was no signal. We conclude that cryopreservation and thawing decrease the content and activity of tACE and cause it to be translocated to other parts of the sperm head.
