  To assess the diagnostic accuracy of placental alpha- microglobulin-1 ( PAMG-1) , fetal fibronectin ( fFN) , and phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 ( phIGFBP-1) tests in the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth in women with symptoms of preterm labor within 7 days ( sPTB ≤ 7d) of testing using formal methods for systematic review. Further analysis looking into performance in low , intermediate and high-risk patient groups. Two reviewers independently searched the Cochrane , MEDLINE , PubMed and ResearchGate bibliographic databases. The search was done from inception- October 2017. Cohort studies that reported on the predictive accuracy of PAMG- 1 , fFN , and phIGFBP-1 for the prediction of sPTB in women with symptoms of preterm labor within 7 days of testing were included. Summary ROC curve , SN , SP , PPV , NPV and LRs were generated using indirect methods for the calculation of pooled effect sizes with a bivariate linear mixed model for the logit of sensitivity and specificity , with each diagnostic test as a covariate described by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy. Bivariate mixed model pooled sensitivities ( SN) for PAMG-1 , fFN and phIGFBP-1 for sPTB ≤ 7d were 76 % ( 95 % CI , 0.57-0.89) , 58 % ( 95 % CI , 0.47-0.68) , and 93 % ( 95 % CI , 0.88-0.96). Bivariate mixed model pooled specificities ( SP) were 97 % ( 95 % CI , 0.95-0.98) , 84 % ( 95 % CI , 0.81-0.87) , and 76 % ( 95 % CI , 0.70-0.80). Bivariate mixed model pooled positive predictive values ( PPV) for PAMG-1 , fFN , and phIGFBP-1 for sPTB ≤ 7d were 76.3 % ( 95 % CI , 0.69-0.84) ( p < 0.05) , 34.1 % ( 95 % CI , 0.29-0.39) , and 35.2 % ( 95 % CI , 0.31-0.40). Bivariate mixed model pooled negative predictive values ( NPV) were 96.6 % ( 95 % CI , 0.94-0.99) , 93.3 % ( 95 % CI , 0.92-0.95) , and 98.7 % ( 95 % CI , 0.98-0.99). Bivariate mixed model pooled positive likelihood ratio ( LR +) for PAMG-1 , fFN , and phIGFBP-1 for sPTB ≤ 7d were 22.51 ( 15.09-33.60) ( p < 0.05) , 3.63 ( 2.93-4.50) , and 3.80 ( 3.11-4.66). Bivariate mixed model pooled negative likelihood ratio ( LR-) for PAMG-1 , fFN , and phIGFBP-1 for sPTB ≤ 7d were 0.24 ( 0.12-0.48) ( p < 0.05) , 0.50 ( 0.39-0.64) , and 0.09 ( 0.05-0.16). Area under the curve ( AUC) for PAMG-1 , fFN , and phIGFBP-1 for sPTB ≤ 7d were 0.961 , 0.874 , and 0.801. It is well understood that prevalence affects a diagnostic test 's predictive performance , and that in lower-prevalence syndromes<disease> such as sPTB , using highly specific assays may optimize management. Our study confirms that the PAMG-1 test was found to have the highest PPV and LR + across all risk stratification groups with statistical significance while the NPV and LR- remained similarly high across all three biomarkers.
