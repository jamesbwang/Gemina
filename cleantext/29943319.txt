  Our previous studies report epidemics of non-tsetse-transmitted equine trypanosomosis in Mongolia. However , the current status of non-tsetse-transmitted equine trypanosomosis endemicity remains to be clarified in some parts of Mongolia. We previously reported the potential application of rTeGM6-4r-based diagnostic tools , an rTeGM6-4r-based immunochromatographic test ( ICT) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , in the serological surveillance of equine trypanosomosis in Mongolia. In the present study , the utility of the rTeGM6-4r-based ICT was validated. The rTeGM6-4r-based ICT accurately diagnosed positive reference sera that had been prepared from dourine horses in Mongolia , similarly to the rTeGM6-4r-based ELISA. The diagnostic performance of the rTeGM6-4r-based ICT was maintained when the strips were preserved for at least 2 months under dry conditions. The ICT detected 42 positive serum samples from a total of 1701 equine sera that had been collected from all 21 provinces of Mongolia. The Îº-value , sensitivity and specificity of rTeGM6-4r-based ICT were 0.58 , 50.0 % ( 95 % CI , 37.7-62.3 %) and 99.3 % ( 95 % CI , 98.7-99.6 %) , respectively , in comparison to the rTeGM6-4r-based ELISA. Our field-friendly rTeGM6-4r-based ICT was found to be useful for the serological diagnosis of non-tsetse-transmitted equine trypanosomosis in rural areas of Mongolia.
