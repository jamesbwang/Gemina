  The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and type of ponticulus posticus and to evaluate its relationship to gender , chronologic age , skeletal maturity , and skeletal malocclusion. The sample included the longitudinal lateral cephalograms of 734 patients ( 378 males and 356 females) retrieved from the American Association of Orthodontists Craniofacial Growth Legacy Collection. The presence of ponticulus posticus ( complete and partial forms) was assessed by visual inspection , and the cervical vertebral maturation method was used to determine the skeletal maturation stage. The presence and type ( complete or partial) of ponticulus posticus were assessed by gender , age at first appearance of ponticulus posticus , skeletal maturation stage as determined by the cervical vertebral maturation method , and skeletal malocclusion. The overall prevalence of ponticulus posticus was 12.6 % ( 93 of 734) with complete and partial forms observed respectively in 8.7 % ( 64 of 734) and 3.9 % ( 29 of 734) of the sample. Both forms of ponticulus posticus occurred mainly in the age range of 7 to 13 years ( P = .04). No differences were found in groups based on gender , skeletal maturity stages , or skeletal malocclusion ( P > .05). However , approximately 90 % of ponticulus posticus occurred before and after the circumpubertal stage. Ponticulus posticus should be expected mainly during childhood and the pubertal age. This may support the theory of a genetic cause of this vertebral anomaly.
