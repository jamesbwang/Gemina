  Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH) is one of the most common causes of premature myocardial infarction ( MI). However , The patterns of FH remained unrecognized in clinical care , especially in very young patients ( VYPs , ≤ 35 years) with MI. The present study enrolled a total of 1,093 VYPs ( ≤ 35 years) presenting a first MI. Clinical diagnosis of FH was made using Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. Coronary severity was assessed by Gensini score ( GS). Patients were followed for a median of 40-months with cardiac death , stroke , MI , post-discharge revascularization or unstable angina as primary endpoints. The detected rates of definite/probable FH were 6.5 %. The prevalence reached up to 10.3 % in patients ≤ 25 years. The FH had similar levels of comorbidities but was younger , more likely to be very high risk ( VHR) and had higher GS ( p < 0.05) than unlikely FH. Notably , the FH on prior lipid-lowering medication presented a lower GS compared to those untreated. Differences in event rates were similar in FH as unlikely FH ( 11.8 % vs. 8.1 % , adjusted hazard ratio 1.35 ( 0.64-2.86) , p = 0.434) but patients on treatment improved outcome ( 6.5 % vs. 10.5 % , adjusted hazard ratio 0.35 ( 0.13-0.95) , p = 0.039). The early identification and treatment might be critical to reduce cardiovascular risk in VYPs with MI.
