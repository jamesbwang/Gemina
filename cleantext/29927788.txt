  Hemorrhagic shock<symptom> ( HS) accounts for 30-40 % of trauma-induced mortality , which is due to multi-organ-failure subsequent to systemic hyper-inflammation , triggered by hypoxemia<symptom> and tissue ischemia. The slow-releasing , mitochondria-targeted H2S donor AP39 exerted beneficial effects in several models of I/R-injury and acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. Therefore , we tested the effects of AP39-treatment in a murine model of combined blunt chest trauma ( TxT) and HS with subsequent resuscitation. After blast wave-induced TxT or sham procedure , anesthetized and instrumented mice underwent 1 hour of hemorrhage<symptom> followed by 4 hours of resuscitation comprising an i.v. bolus injection of 100 or 10nmol kg AP39 or vehicle , re-transfusion of shed blood , fluid resuscitation , and norepinephrine. Lung mechanics and gas exchange were assessed together with hemodynamics , metabolism , and acid-base status. Blood and tissue samples were analyzed for cytokine and chemokine levels , western blot , immunohistochemistry , mitochondrial oxygen consumption ( JO2) and histological changes. High dose AP39 attenuated systemic inflammation<symptom> and reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and IκBα expression in lung tissue. In the combined trauma group ( TxT + HS) , animals treated with high dose AP39 presented with the lowest mean arterial pressure ( MAP) and thus highest norepinephrine requirements and higher mortality. Low dose AP39 had no effects on hemodynamics , leading to unchanged norepinephrine requirements and mortality rates. AP39 is a systemic anti-inflammatory agent. In our model of trauma with HS , there may be a narrow dosing and timing window due to its potent vasodilatory properties , which might result in or contribute to aggravation of circulatory shock-related
