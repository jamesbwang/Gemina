  Multinuclear lanthanide-containing supramolecular cages have received increasing attention recently because of their unique electroptical and magnetic properties. Here we report the hierarchical self-assembly and chiroptical studies of a group of 4d-4f heterometallic cages synthesized from a preformed dimetalloligand ( ( bpy)
