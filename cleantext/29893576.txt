  the aim of this study was to determine predictive factors for an incomplete capsule endoscopy and an inadequate small-bowel preparation in capsule endoscopy. predictive factors for an incomplete capsule endoscopy were evaluated. Therefore , all patients with incomplete examinations performed between June 2009 and February 2016 were retrospectively included and compared with all patients with complete procedures performed between January 2014 and February 2016. Predictive factors of an inadequate small-bowel cleanliness were assessed. Therefore , the subset of patients that underwent capsule endoscopy between January 2014 and February 2016 , including incomplete examinations , were evaluated. Small-bowel cleanliness was evaluated according to a quantitative index and a qualitative evaluation scale. Data with regard to patient and capsule endoscopy was analyzed. 31 incomplete and 122 complete capsule endoscopies were included in the analysis of predictive factors for an incomplete capsule endoscopy. The degree of dependency ( OR = 4.67; p = 0.028) , performance of a capsule endoscopy in hospitalized patients ( OR = 4.04; p = 0.006) and prior abdominal surgery ( OR = 3.45; p = 0.012) were independent predictive factors of an incomplete procedure. 130 patients were included in the analysis of predictive factors for an inadequate small-bowel cleanliness. The mean quantitative index value was 7.3 ( s.d. Â± 2.3); 41.6 % and 58.5 % of capsule endoscopies were classified as poor-fair and good/excellent respectively , according to the qualitative evaluation. Independent predictive factors for an inadequate preparation according to the quantitative index included male gender ( Beta = -0.79; p = 0.028) , small-bowel transit time ( Beta = -0.007; p < 0.0001) and cardiac disease ( Beta = -1.29; p = 0.001). Associated factors according to the qualitative evaluation included male gender ( OR = 0.406; p = 0.027) and small-bowel transit time ( SBTT) ( OR = 0.993; p < 0.0001). inpatient status , higher degrees of dependency and abdominal surgery are predictive factors for an incomplete capsule endoscopy; male gender and higher small-bowel transit time are predictive factors for an inadequate cleanliness.
