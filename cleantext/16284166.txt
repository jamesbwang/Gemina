  Communicating about science with the public can present a number of challenges , from participation to engagement to impact. In an effort to broadly communicate messages regarding biodiversity , evolution , and tree-thinking with the campus community at The College of New Jersey ( TCNJ) , a public , primarily undergraduate institution , we created a campus-wide , science-themed meal , `` Tasting the Tree of Life: Exploring Biodiversity through Cuisine. '' We created nine meals that incorporated 149 species/ingredients across the Tree of Life. Each meal illustrated a scientific message communicated through interactions with undergraduate biology students , informational signs , and an interactive website. To promote tree-thinking , we reconstructed a phylogeny of all 149 ingredients. In total , 3,262 people attended the meal , and evaluations indicated that participants left with greater appreciation for the biodiversity and evolutionary relatedness of their food. A keynote lecture and a coordinated social media campaign enhanced the scientific messages , and media coverage extended the reach of this event. `` Tasting the Tree of Life '' highlights the potential of cuisine as a valuable science communication tool.
