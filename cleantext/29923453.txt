  To compare periprocedural complications and in-stent restenosis rates associated with open- vs closed-cell stent designs used in carotid artery stenting ( CAS). A systematic search was conducted to identify all randomized and observational studies published in English up to October 31 , 2017 , that compared open- vs closed-cell stent designs in CAS. Identified studies were included if they reported the following outcomes: stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA) , myocardial infarction ( MI) , hemodynamic depression<symptom> , new ischemic lesions<symptom> detected on imaging , and death within 30 days , as well as the incidence of in-stent restenosis. A random-effects model meta-analysis was employed. Model results are reported as the odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI). The I Thirty-three studies ( 2 randomized trials) comprising 20 , 291 patients ( mean age 71.3 ± 3.0 years; 74.6 % men) were included. Patients in the open-cell stent group had a statistically significant lower risk of restenosis ⩾ 40 % ( OR 0.42 , 95 % CI 0.19 to 0.92; I Use of open-cell stent design in CAS is associated with a decreased risk for restenosis when compared to the closed-cell stent , without significant differences in periprocedural outcomes.
