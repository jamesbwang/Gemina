  Pelvic exenteration surgery remains the only curative option for recurrent rectal cancer. Microscopically involved surgical margins ( R1) are associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and decreased survival. Our study aimed to develop a post hoc multidisciplinary case conference review and investigate its potential for identifying areas for improvement. Patients who underwent pelvic exenteration surgery for recurrent rectal cancer with R1 resections at a tertiary referral centre between April 2014 and January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Patients with non-rectal cancers or who underwent palliative surgery were excluded. Cases , imaging and histopathology were evaluated by a dedicated panel including colorectal surgeons , an abdominal radiologist and a gastrointestinal pathologist. R1 resections were reported in 32 of 110 pelvic exenterations. Patients with other tumours were excluded and one patient had a palliative resection. Nine male patients with 11 exenterations were included with a median age of 56 years. All patients had positive soft tissue margins , and one patient also had an involved bony margin. Failures were due to ( interdisciplinary) communication problems , specific management of tumour biology ( multifocality , spiculated tumours) , which can lead to radiological undercalling , and inadequate surgical technical planning. In hindsight , surgery would have been withheld from one patient. A retrospective multidisciplinary case evaluation of pelvic exenteration patients with involved surgical margins led to a list of recommendations which included the need to plan for wider surgical soft tissue resections and improvement in interdisciplinary communication. Lessons learned may increase clear margin rates in future resections.
