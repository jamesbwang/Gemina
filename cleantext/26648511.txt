  In Multiple Mini<pathogen> Interviews ( MMIs) , the candidates start out with different stations depending on the sequence of rotation they are assigned; thus , their perceived difficulty level and nervousness with their first station may differ. We examined whether such differences influenced the candidates ' overall performance in the MMI. A 32-item questionnaire was developed and administered to candidates for admission interviews at a medical school regarding their perceptions of the MMI. Candidates ' interview scores were also obtained and were compared across groups who differed in the sequence of rotation of MMI stations. Candidates felt nervous when they encountered the first station , which did not differ regardless of which station was their first encounter. Candidates were neutral regarding whether their first station was more difficult than the others and about whether its difficulty level influenced their overall performance in the test. Although candidates ' perceived station difficulty differed across stations , there were no differences in their performance in each station between those it was their first station and those it was not. Candidates ' total interview scores also did not differ across groups of different sequence of rotations. The MMI is a fair process as it does not give disadvantage to those who encounter a more difficult station than others for their first station.
