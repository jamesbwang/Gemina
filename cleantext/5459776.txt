  Rapid destructive osteoarthritis of the hip is a separate entity different from the usual osteoarthritis. It is usually seen in elderly women , and the characteristic feature is the rapid progression within 6 to 12 months to complete destruction of the joint. The exact etiology is not known. We present a rare case of rapid destructive osteoarthritis of the hip in a 62-year-old woman who developed it within 2 months of intra-articular steroid injection , which was managed well with uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Through this report , we emphasize the possibility of the disastrous complication of injection , which should be informed to the patient before any intra-articular injection.
