  Extramedullary hematopoiesis ( EMH) usually occurs in hematological disease , but more rarely develops in cases of malignant solid tumors. Due to its features on computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) that are atypical , EMH in tumor patients might easily be misdiagnosed as metastasis leading to the improper TNM staging and inappropriate therapy. Here , we reported the first case of pleural EMH occurring in a patient with esophageal carcinoma whose pleural lesion<symptom> was first diagnosed as metastasis and confirmed EMH after the needle biopsy. In addition , a retrospective review was conducted by analyzing patients presented with EMH with malignant solid tumors from PubMed and Medline databases. A total of 42 solid tumor patients with EMH were enrolled , and breast cancer was the most common ( n = 13 , 31.0 %) , followed by renal carcinoma ( n = 7 , 16.7 %) and lung cancer ( n = 6 , 14.3 %). A wide variety of body sites may be affected by EMH in malignant solid tumor patients , of which the lymph nodes ( n = 8 , 19.0 %) and liver ( n = 7 , 16.7 %) were the most common , followed by the kidney ( n = 6 , 14.3 %). All patients were diagnosed with EMH by excision , biopsy , or autopsy. Treatment strategies for EMH included surgery ( n = 25 , 59.5 %) , hydroxyurea ( n = 1 , 2.4 %) , and blood transfusions ( n = 2 , 4.8 %); a further 14 patients ( 33.3 %) were subjected to clinical observation without intervention. Of the patients for whom outcome was reported , 10 patients maintained a good performance status ( 23.8 %) and a further six patients died from the malignant tumor. This was the first study to summarize the presentations of EMH in malignant solid tumors , and our findings might provide some useful guidance for clinical practice , especially for treating patients harboring nonresponse lesions<symptom> during the antitumor treatment.
