  Women are disproportionately affected by posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) , and gonadal hormones are implicated in fear learning processes associated with PTSD. In rodents , lower estradiol , particularly during metestrus when progesterone is also low , is associated with impaired extinction. Based on theories that extinction deficits underlie PTSD , individuals with lower estradiol and progesterone may exhibit fear learning deficits and higher PTSD symptomatology. A systematic review was conducted in PsycInfo , PubMed , and Medline databases for studies examining estradiol , progesterone , or menstrual phase in relation to fear learning or PTSD symptoms. Twenty-three studies are organized into fear learning ( k = 17) and PTSD symptom ( k = 12) studies. Across fear learning studies , higher estradiol was consistently associated with enhanced fear extinction recall and inconsistently and weakly associated with better extinction learning and fear acquisition , respectively. Extending to PTSD symptoms , the association with hormonal status was reversed , such that luteal phase , associated with higher estradiol and progesterone , was generally associated with higher re-experiencing symptoms. Overall , human fear learning studies were consistent with rodent studies. Despite strong experimental links between fear learning processes and PTSD , the clinical translation was inconsistent and may reflect varying methods , imprecise measurement , and greater complexity of hormonal effects on symptomatology.
