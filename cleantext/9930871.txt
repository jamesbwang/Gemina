  Prostaglandins ( PGs) are important lipid mediators produced from arachidonic acid via the sequential catalyzation of cyclooxygenases ( COXs) and specific prostaglandin synthases. There are five subtypes of PGs , namely PGE2 , PGI2 , PGD2 , PGF2Î± , and thromboxane A2 ( TXA2). PGs exert distinct roles by combining to a diverse family of membrane-spanning G protein-coupled prostanoid receptors. The distribution of these PGs , their specific synthases and receptors vary a lot in the kidney. This review summarized the recent findings of PGs together with the COXs and their specific synthases and receptors in regulating renal function and highlighted the insights into their roles in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases.
