  We describe an unusual presentation of papillary renal cell carcinoma in a 40-year old male where radiological evaluation revealed a Bosniak type 2 cyst<symptom> ( probably benign) , and clinical signs as well as symptoms also suggested an infected cyst<symptom> l. However , on histopathological examination , an intra cystic type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed. This is an extremely rare presentation of papillary renal cell carcinoma because it usually present as a heterogenous mass. Hence , even the radiologically benign cyst<symptom> should be evaluated and managed cautiously.
