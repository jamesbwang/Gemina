  To examine the association of glycemic control , including strict glycemic control , with 24-hour ( 24-h) urine risk factors for uric acid and calcium calculi. With IRB approval , we identified 183 stone formers ( SFs) with 459 24-h urine collections. Hemoglobin A1c ( HgbA1c) measures were obtained within 3 months of the urine collection. Collections were separated into normoglycemic ( NG , HgbA1c < 6.5) and hyperglycemic ( HG , HgbA1c â‰¥ 6.5) cohorts; 24-h urine parameters were compared. The NG cohort was further divided into patients with and without a history of diabetes type 2 ( DM). Variables were analyzed using chi squared , Welch 's t-test and multivariate linear regression to adjust for clustering , BMI , age , gender , thiazide and potassium citrate use. Patients in the HG group were older with higher BMI. Multivariate analysis of the total study population revealed that hyperglycemia correlated with lower pH , higher uric acid relative saturation ( RS) , lower brushite RS and higher citrate. NG SFs with and without a history of DM had similar risk factors for uric acid stone formation. Among NG SFs , those with DM had higher urine calcium ( UCa) and calcium oxalate RS than those without DM. However , this difference may be related to other factors since neither parameter correlated with DM on multivariate regression ( p > 0.05). Successful glycemic control may be associated with reduced urinary risk factors for uric acid stone formation. Patients with well controlled DM had equivalent risk factors to those without DM. Glycemic control should be considered a target of the multidisciplinary medical management of stone disease.
