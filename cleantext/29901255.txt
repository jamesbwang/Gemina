  Many studies indicate that bipolar disorders are underdiagnosed. Yet from 2007 to 2008 , a series of publications asserted that bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed. This review examines the methods used in the studies that reported bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed. A literature search for studies with original data related to overdiagnosis of bipolar disorders was performed. Four studies were found indicating bipolar disorders were being overdiagnosed. The Structured Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( SCID) was used in the diagnostic process. The studies compared the clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder to a single SCID interview without interviewing family or reviewing old records. The studies assumed the SCID diagnosis was correct. Numerous concerns were found. The SCID frequently missed diagnosis of bipolar , the definitions of bipolar disorder are so narrow and conservative that the outcomes of the studies may have been predetermined. Ultimately , the studies compared the strength of a diagnosis made by a treating psychiatrist to a SCID diagnosis collected with virtually no information from the clinician. The assumption that the SCID diagnosis is always correct and the clinician is always wrong is unsupportable. The premise that bipolar disorders are being overdiagnosed is unsupported by reasonable science.
