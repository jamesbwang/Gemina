  Dimercaprol as the chelating agent of Au ( III) was loaded on chitosan aerogel. Dimercaprol supported on chitosan aerogel efficiently was complexed with Au ( III). The new organometallic compound showed good catalytic activity in the oxidation reaction of some aliphatic alcohols , benzyl alcohol , and ethylbenzene. High conversions and excellent selectivities were obtained in the solvent-free oxidation reactions under mild reaction conditions. Also , turnover numbers were calculated for the oxidation reactions with 203 , 134 , 308 , 282 , 392 , and 153 for 1-pentanol , 1-octanol , 2-propanol , 2-butanol , benzyl alcohol , and ethylbenzene , respectively. The organometallic compound is applicable as a heterogeneous Au ( III) catalyst with high chemical stabilityand recyclability up to 6 times.
