  Hemophilia A is a common hereditary bleeding disorder that is characterized by a deficiency of human blood coagulation factor VIII ( hFVIII). Previous studies with adeno-associated viral ( AAV) vectors identified two liver-specific promoter and enhancer combinations ( E03.TTR and E12.A1AT) that drove high level expression of a codon-optimized , B-domain-deleted hFVIII transgene in a mouse model of the disease. This study further evaluated these enhancer/promoter combinations in cynomolgus macaques using two different AAV capsids ( AAVrh10 and AAVhu37). Each of the four vector combinations was administered intravenously at a dose of 1.2 Ã— 10
