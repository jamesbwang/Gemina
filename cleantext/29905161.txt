  Post-mortem diagnostics are an important tool for disease diagnosis and therefore early detection of ( re-) emerging animal diseases and zoonoses as well as nationwide disease surveillance programs. To counteract the decline of porcine necropsies in Switzerland over the last ten years , the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office ( FSVO) launched a national project in 2014 called PathoPig. Post-mortem examinations of pigs from herds with health problems were financially supported by the FSVO. During the first 3 years of the project , the number of pig necropsies increased by 195 % ( mean). An underlying cause of disease was identified in 74 % of the cases. These findings resulted in specific recommendations by the attending veterinarians or by the Swiss Porcine Health Service. A follow-up survey revealed that herd health had improved in 90 % of the farms implementing the recommendations.
