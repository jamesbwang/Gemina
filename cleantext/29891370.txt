  Rhinella icterica is a poisonous toad whose toxic secretion has never been studied against entomotoxic potential. Sublethal doses of Rhinella icterica toxic secretion ( RITS) were assayed in Nauphoeta cinerea<pathogen> cockroaches , in order to understand the physiological and behavioral parameters , over the insect central and peripheral nervous system. RITS ( 10 μg/g) injections , induced behavioral impairment as evidenced by a significant decrease ( 38 ± 14 %) in the distance traveled ( p < .05) , followed by an increase ( 90 ± 6 %) of immobile episodes ( p < .001 , n = 28 , respectively). In cockroaches semi-isolated heart preparations , RITS ( 16 μg/200 μl) induced a significant irreversible dose-dependent negative chronotropism , reaching ~ 40 % decrease in heart rate in 20 min incubation. In in vivo cockroach neuromuscular preparations , RITS ( 20 , 50 and 100 μg/g of animal weight) induced a time-dependent inhibition of twitch tension that was complete for 20 μg/g , in 120 min recordings. RITS ( 10 μg/g) also induced a significant increase in the insect leg grooming activity ( 128 ± 10 % , n = 29 , p < .01) , but not in the antennae counterparts. The RITS increase in leg grooming activity was prevented in 90 % by the pretreatment of cockroaches with phentolamine ( 0.1 μg/g). The electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous neural compound action potentials showed that RITS ( 20 μg/g) induced a significant increase in the number of events , as well as in the rise time and duration of the potentials. In conclusion , RITS showed to be entomotoxic , being the neuromuscular failure and cardiotoxic activity considered the main deleterious effects. The disturbance of the cockroaches ' behavior together with the electrophysiological alterations , may unveil the presence of some toxic components present in the poison with inherent biotechnological potentials.
