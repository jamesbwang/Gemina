  Ground Beetles ( Carabidae) have been suggested to be used as indicators of ecological status under the effects of anthropogenic land use and land cover changes in highly biodiverse regions such as the Neotropics. In this study Ground Beetles ' assemblages from a region in the Brazilian Amazon were investigated for evaluating their applicability as disturbance indicators. Differences in assemblages between ecosystems , discriminated by complimentary methodologies , demonstrate a sensitive reaction from the most pristine forests to increasingly disturbed systems. Besides capturing the influence of different prevailing conditions between ecosystems , Ground Beetles are easy to communicate and to link with the other components of the system , being effortless and routinely measurable using standard methodologies. This study represents a step forward in using Ground Beetles for the purposes of planning , management and public reporting on the ecological status of Neotropical ecosystems. Additionally , the methods depicted could support projections for trends of relevant ecosystem attributes under realistic social-ecological change scenarios , which can be used to guide effective conservation planning.
