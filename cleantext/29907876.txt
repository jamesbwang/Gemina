  In this study , we developed a lentiviral two-step transcriptional amplification ( TSTA) system expressing bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( BMP-2) under the control of a GAL4FF transactivator to enhance gene expression and limit toxicity for bone repair applications. To this end human MSCs , isolated from bone<disease> marrow or adipose tissue , were transduced overnight with a LV-TSTA system ( GAL4FF or GAL4vp16) expressing BMP-2 or GFP and evaluated in vitro for transduction efficiency , mean fluorescence intensity , cell viability , and BMP-2 production. FACS analysis of GFP-transduced MSCs confirmed successful transduction with the GAL4FF + GFP vector. Moreover , ELISA demonstrated abundant BMP-2 production by GAL4FF + BMP2-transduced human MSCs over a period of 8 weeks , with minimal cytotoxicity at all time points. Compared to GAL4vp16 , GAL4FF was superior with respect to BMP production at 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 weeks in BMSCs. In ASCs , GAL4FF was still associated with higher BMP-2 production at weeks 2-8 , but this difference was not as prominent as in BMSCs. To our knowledge , this is the first report of GAL4FF-mediated BMP-2 production by human BMSCs and ASCs. Compared to the standard GAL4vp16TSTA vector , GAL4FF was associated with lower cytotoxicity and higher in vitro gene expression in both BMSCs and ASCs.
