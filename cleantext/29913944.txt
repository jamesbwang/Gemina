  Background and objective Perioperative low-dose ketamine has been useful for postoperative analgesia. In this study we wanted to assess the analgesic effect and possible side-effects of perioperative low-dose S ( +) ketamine when added to a regime of non-opioid multimodal pain prophylaxis. Methods Seventy-seven patients scheduled for haemorrhoidectomy were enrolled in this randomized , double-blind , controlled study. They received oral paracetamol 1-2 g , total intravenous anaesthesia , intravenous 8 mg dexamethasone , 30 mg ketorolac and local infiltration with bupivacaine/epinephrine. Patients randomized to S ( +) ketamine received an intravenous bolus dose of 0.35 mg kg-1 S ( +) ketamine before start of surgery followed by continuous infusion of 5 Î¼g kg-1 min-1 until 2 min after end of surgery. Patients in the placebo group got isotonic saline ( bolus and infusion). BISTM monitoring was used. Pain intensity and side-effects were assessed by blinded nursing staff during PACU stay and by phone 1 , 7 and 90 days after surgery. Results In patients randomized to S ( +) ketamine emergence from anaesthesia was significantly longer ( 13.1 min vs. 9.3 min; p < 0.001). BIS values were significantly higher during anaesthesia ( maximal value during surgery: 62 vs. 57; p = 0.01) and when opening eyes ( 81 vs. 70 , p < 0.001). Pain scores ( NRS and VAS) did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions The addition of perioperative S ( +) ketamine for postoperative analgesia after haemorrhoidectomy on top of multimodal non-opioid pain prophylaxis does not seem to be warranted , due to delayed emergence and recovery , more side-effects , altered BIS readings and absence of additive analgesic effect.
