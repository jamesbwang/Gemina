  To analyze the fatty acids in human milk , bovine milk and powdered formulas with the change of lactation period and suitable object. A total of 50 human milk samples of healthy maternal , 35 Holstein milk samples and 30 formula samples were selected. The fatty acids in different samples were tested by gas chromatography. 28 fatty acids were detected in powdered formulas , 30 fatty acids were detected in bovine milk and 27 fatty acids were detected in human milk. The proportions of palmitic acid , oleic acid and linoleic acid were at a high proportion in all powdered formulas samples. The most common type of human milk fatty acids were oleic acid , linoleic acid and palmitic acid. The proportion of γ-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in bovine milk samples decreased , the proportion of arachidonic acid was significantly higher , and palmitic acid , gadoleic acid , cis-13-docosenoic acid and erucylacetic acid decreased with the change of lactation period. Linoleic acid , arachidonic acid , α-linoleic acid and docosahexenoic acid decreased significantly with change of suitable object. The production of powdered formulas must refer to fatty acids in human milk composition rationally , focus on adjusting the content of linoleic acid , linolenic acid , docosahexenoic acid and arachidonic acid in order to promote the best nutrition supply.
