  The simplest Klein-Gordon ( KG) breather is a compacton on a string subject to the force of gravity in a frictionless V-shaped trough. Its dynamics , spectrum , and energy are discussed and it is compared to sine-Gordon breathers. A generalization of this problem consists of a charged string subject to the electrostatic force of two semi-infinite coplanar charged planes separated by a gap of constant width. For motion in the midplane between these planes , the string 's displacement u ( x , t) satisfies the nonlinear KG equation ( ∂ _ ( t) ^ ( 2)- ∂ _ ( x) ^ ( 2)) u =- tan ^ ( -1) u in dimensionless form. Simulations of this equation reveal long-lived , breatherlike states , or `` pseudobreathers , '' which preserve shape and speed to high accuracy when Lorentz-transformed to simulate collisions.
