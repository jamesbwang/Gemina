  Centrosome aberrations disrupt tissue architecture and may confer invasive properties to cancer cells. Here we show that structural centrosome aberrations , induced by overexpression of either Ninein-like protein ( NLP) or CEP131/AZI1 , sensitize polarized mammalian epithelia to basal cell extrusion. While unperturbed epithelia typically dispose of damaged cells through apical dissemination into luminal cavities , certain oncogenic mutations cause a switch in directionality towards basal cell extrusion , raising the potential for metastatic cell dissemination. Here we report that NLP-induced centrosome aberrations trigger the preferential extrusion of damaged cells towards the basal surface of epithelial monolayers. This switch in directionality from apical to basal dissemination coincides with a profound reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton , which in turn prevents the contractile ring repositioning that is required to support extrusion towards the apical surface. While the basal extrusion of cells harbouring NLP-induced centrosome aberrations requires exogenously induced cell damage , structural centrosome aberrations induced by excess CEP131 trigger the spontaneous dissemination of dying cells towards the basal surface from MDCK cysts<symptom>. Thus , similar to oncogenic mutations , structural centrosome aberrations can favour basal extrusion of damaged cells from polarized epithelia. Assuming that additional mutations may promote cell survival , this process could sensitize epithelia to disseminate potentially metastatic cells.
