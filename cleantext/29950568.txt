  Double-strand breaks in the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) result in the formation of linear fragments that are rapidly degraded. However , the identity of the nuclease ( s) performing this function is not known. We found that the exonuclease function of the mtDNA polymerase gamma ( POLG) is required for this rapid degradation of mtDNA fragments. POLG is recruited to linearized DNA fragments in an origin of replication-independent manner. Moreover , in the absence of POLG exonuclease activity , the prolonged existence of mtDNA linear fragments leads to increased levels of mtDNA deletions , which have been previously identified in the mutator mouse , patients with POLG mutations and normal aging.
