  Many patients with epilepsy need a second antiepileptic drug ( AED) , due either to inefficacy or side effects of the first tried one. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of lacosamide ( LCM) as first add-on therapy in the real-life setting. LACONORTE is a multicenter , retrospective , one-year study. Patients with focal epilepsy on monotherapy with another AED who were started on lacosamide as first add-on therapy were included. Clinical data was obtained at 3 , 6 and 12 months and then analyzed. Seventy-three patients ( 48.6 % men) with a mean age of 50.3 and a median duration of the epilepsy of 3.0 years ( range 0-65) were included. At 1 year , 91.8 % were responders ( with at least 50 % reduction in the number of seizures<symptom>) and 64.4 % of all patients and 75.8 % of those with secondary generalization were seizure-free. Fifteen patients ( 20.5 %) had adverse events ( AE) , most of them were transient and no severe AEs were reported. LCM was withdrawn in 2 patients due to intolerance and in 1 patient because of inefficacy. Neither side effects nor withdrawal seemed to be related to total dose or to escalating regimes. Seventy patients ( 95.9 %) continued on LCM after the last visit ( median dose 200 mg/day , ranging 100-400). Eighteen ( 24.7 %) converted to monotherapy during the 12-month period , 83.3 % of them remaining seizure-free. These results of real-life setting show LCM to be efficacious and safe when used as first add-on therapy for focal-onset epilepsy. Most adverse events were mild and/or transient.
