  The main aim of this study was to test whether mothers ' ( n = 116) and fathers ' ( n = 116) mind-mindedness predicts infants ' physiological emotion regulation ( heart rate variability; HRV) across the first year of life. Three hypotheses were examined: ( a) parents ' mind-mindedness at 4 and 12 months predicts infants ' HRV at 12 months over and above infants ' initial HRV levels at 4 months , ( b) mothers ' and fathers ' mind-mindedness independently predict infant HRV , and ( c) the effects of mind-mindedness on infant HRV ( partially) operate via parenting behaviour. Infants ' HRV was assessed during rest and a stranger approach. Mind-mindedness was assessed by calculating the proportions of appropriate and non-attuned mind-related comments during free-play interactions , and parenting quality was observed at 4 and 12 months in the same interactions. Path analyses showed that mothers ' appropriate mind-related comments at 4 and 12 months predicted higher baseline HRV at 12 months , whereas mothers ' non-attuned comments predicted lower baseline HRV at 12 months. Similar , but concurrent , relations were found for fathers ' appropriate and non-attuned mind-related comments and infant baseline HRV at 12 months. In addition , fathers ' appropriate mind-related comments showed an indirect association with infant baseline HRV at 12 months via fathers ' parenting quality. With regard to infant HRV reactivity during the stranger approach , mothers ' appropriate mind-related comments at 4 months and fathers ' non-attuned mind-related comments at 12 months predicted a larger HRV decline during the stranger approach at 12 months. Infants ' HRV at 4 months did not predict parents ' later mind-mindedness. The results indicate that mothers ' and fathers ' appropriate and non-attuned mind-related speech uniquely impacts the development of infants ' physiological emotion regulation.
