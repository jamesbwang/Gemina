  To assess the quality of mean uterine artery pulsatility index ( UtAPI) measurement in a first trimester pre-eclampsia screening program. Consecutive patients attending first trimester screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities also had combined screening for pre-eclampsia based on the Fetal Medicine Foundation ( FMF) algorithm , in a large practice in Sydney , Australia , from May 2014 to February 2017. Distributions of mean UtAPI multiples of the median ( MoM) on the logarithmic scale were plotted in relation to the normal median with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) for each operator and for each month. Central tendency and dispersion and cumulative sum ( CUSUM) charts were produced. Mean values between 0.95 and 1.05 MoM were considered ideal and between 0.90 and 1.1 MoM were considered acceptable. The screen positive rates for preterm pre-eclampsia in different groups of sonographers according to their mean Log 21,010 women attended for first trimester ultrasound and had screening for pre-eclampsia. The overall median UtAPI MoM was 1.042 MoM ( IQR 0.85-1.26). Of 46 sonographers , 42 ( 91.3 %) performed more than 50 examinations and , of those , 41 ( 97.6 %) measured UtAPI within the acceptable range. Sonographers measuring below 0.95 MoM and above 1.05 MoM had , respectively , lower and higher screen positive rates ( SPR) when compared to those with measurements within the 0.95-1.05 MoM interval ( 7.2 % and 13.2 % vs. 11.2 % , respectively , p < 0.001). Uterine artery Doppler is well measured among trained operators when following an established protocol. While slight variations are expected , systematic error in this measurement impacts on the screen positive rate. Therefore , a quality control process must be in place and retraining of staff may be required. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
