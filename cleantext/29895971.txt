  The availability of large-scale drug screening data on cell line panels provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers for targeted drug efficacy. Analysis of diverse drug data on ~ 990 cancer cell lines revealed enhanced sensitivity of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/ Insulin Receptor ( IGF-1R/ IR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) in colon cancer cells. Interestingly , β-catenin/TCF ( T cell factor)- responsive promoter activity exhibited a significant positive association with IGF-1R/ IR TKI response , while the mutational status of direct upstream genes , such as CTNNB1 and APC , was not significantly associated with the response. The β-catenin/TCF activity high cell lines express components of IGF-1R/ IR signaling more than the low cell lines explaining their enhanced sensitivity against IGF-1R/ IR TKI. Reinforcing β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity by introducing CTNNB1 gain-of-function mutations into IGF-1R/ IR TKI-resistant cells increased the expression and activity of IGF-1R/ IR signaling components and also sensitized the cells to IGF-1R/ IR TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of TCGA data revealed that the stronger β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity was associated with higher IGF-1R and IGF2 transcription in human colon cancer specimens as well. Collectively , compared to the mutational status of upstream genes , β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity has potential to be a stronger predictive positive biomarker for IGF-1R/ IR TKI responses in colon cancer cells. The present study highlights the potential of transcriptional activity as therapeutic biomarkers for targeted therapies , overcoming the limited ability of upstream genetic mutations to predict responses.
