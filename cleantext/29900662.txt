  Pazopanib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a standard treatment for chemotherapy-refractory recurrent or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma<disease>. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib for treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma<disease> in the Asian population. Fifty patients with chemotherapy-refractory recurrent or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma<disease> , who had received pazopanib treatment between 2015 and 2016 were enrolled. We reviewed patients ' clinical characteristics and studied survival outcomes following pazopanib treatment. Median follow-up was 5.7 months. Seven patients were still on pazopanib by the end of this study and the disease had progressed in the other 43 patients , leading to 23 deaths. We found that despite treatment more than half the patients experienced disease progression ( 56 % vs 14 % partial response and 30 % stable disease). The median progression-free survival and overall survival was 3.1 and 11.0 months , respectively. Multivariate analysis identified good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( 0 or 1) and occurrence of hand-foot skin reaction as independent factors associated with better outcome. Hand-foot skin reaction was 32 % in our cohort and the median onset time was 4 ( 1.00-8.29) weeks. It had dose-dependent effect by clinical observation. Our study showed that the incidence rate of hand-foot skin reaction in Taiwan is higher than western population , and it is an independent predictive factor for better treatment outcomes.
