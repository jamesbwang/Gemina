  The Antarctic Ice Sheet is an important indicator of climate change and driver of sea-level rise. Here we combine satellite observations of its changing volume , flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance<symptom> to show that it lost 2,720 ± 1,390 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017 , which corresponds to an increase in mean sea level of 7.6 ± 3.9 millimetres ( errors are one standard deviation). Over this period , ocean-driven melting has caused rates of ice loss from West Antarctica to increase from 53 ± 29 billion to 159 ± 26 billion tonnes per year; ice-shelf collapse has increased the rate of ice loss from the Antarctic Peninsula from 7 ± 13 billion to 33 ± 16 billion tonnes per year. We find large variations in and among model estimates of surface mass balance<symptom> and glacial isostatic adjustment for East Antarctica , with its average rate of mass gain over the period 1992-2017 ( 5 ± 46 billion tonnes per year) being the least certain.
