  The vibrational spectra of 4,6-dimethyl-2-mercaptopyrimidine ( DMMP) in acetonitrile , methanol , and water were assigned by resonance Raman spectroscopy through a combination of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , FT-Raman UV-vis spectroscopy , and density functional theoretical ( DFT) calculations. The FT-Raman spectra show that the neat solid DMMP is formed as a dimer due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In methanol and water , however , the majority of the Raman spectra were assigned to the vibrational modes of DMMP ( solvent)
