  Efficient conversion of cellulosic sugars in cellulosic hydrolysates is important for economically viable production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass , but the goal remains a critical challenge. The present study reports a new approach for simultaneous fermentation of cellobiose and xylose by using the co-culture consisting of recombinant Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> specialist strains. The co-culture system can provide competitive advantage of modularity compared to the single culture system and can be tuned to deal with fluctuations in feedstock composition to achieve robust and cost-effective biofuel production. This study characterized fermentation kinetics of the recombinant cellobiose-consuming S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> strain EJ2 , xylose-consuming S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> strain SR8 , and their co-culture. The motivation for kinetic modeling was to provide guidance and prediction of using the co-culture system for simultaneous fermentation of mixed sugars with adjustable biomass of each specialist strain under different substrate concentrations. The kinetic model for the co-culture system was developed based on the pure culture models and incorporated the effects of product inhibition , initial substrate concentration and inoculum size. The model simulations were validated by results from independent fermentation experiments under different substrate conditions , and good agreement was found between model predictions and experimental data from batch fermentation of cellobiose , xylose and their mixtures. Additionally , with the guidance of model prediction , simultaneous co-fermentation of 60 g/L cellobiose and 20 g/L xylose was achieved with the initial cell densities of 0.45 g dry cell weight/ L for EJ2 and 0.9 g dry cell weight/ L SR8. The results demonstrated that the kinetic modeling could be used to guide the design and optimization of yeast co-culture conditions for achieving simultaneous fermentation of cellobiose and xylose with improved ethanol productivity , which is critically important for robust and efficient renewable biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass.
