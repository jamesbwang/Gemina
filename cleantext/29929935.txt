  To evaluate the feasibility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the lungs to detect impaired organ function in a porcine model of ischemic injury within an ex-vivo lung perfusion system ( EVLP) prior to transplantation. Twelve pigs were anesthetized , and left lungs were clamped to induce warm ischemia for 3hours. Right lungs remained perfused as controls. Lungs were removed and installed in an EVLP for 12hours. Lungs in the EVLP were imaged repeatedly using computed tomography , proton MRI ( Eleven pigs were included in the final analysis. Ischemic lungs showed significantly higher wet/dry ratios ( p = 0.024) , as well as IL-8 tissue levels ( p = 0.0098). Histologic assessment as well as morphologic scoring of computed tomography and Multiparametric pulmonary MRI is feasible in lung allografts within an EVLP system. Oxygen-enhanced imaging seems to be a promising marker for ischemic injury , enabling detection of affected lung segments prior to transplantation.
