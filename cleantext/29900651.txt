  Surgical management in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) has a significant impact in overall survival and progression-free survival. The Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology ( BSSO) supported a taskforce of experts to reach a consensus: experienced and specialised trained surgeons , in cancer centres , provide the best EOC surgery. Laparoscopic and/or radiological staging prognosticates the possibility of complete cytoreduction ( CC0) and helps to reduce unnecessary laparotomies. Surgical techniques were reviewed. Multidisciplinary input is essential for treatment planning. Quality assurance criteria are proposed and require national consensus. Genetic testing is mandatory. This consensus states the final recommendations from BSSO for management of EOC. Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology consensus for surgery in epithelial ovarian cancer patients.
