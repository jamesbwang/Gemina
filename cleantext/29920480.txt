  Dry eye is the most prominent pathology among those involving the ocular surface: a decrease of the aqueous ( less frequent) or the lipid ( more frequent) component of the tear film is the cause of the diminished stability of tears that is observed in this pathology. Dry eye shows a clear distribution linked to both sex ( being more frequent among women) and age ( increasing with aging). Therefore , specific treatments taking into account the etiology of the disease would be desired. The role of lactoferrin and its functional mimetic lactobionic acid are reported here as a possible remedy for age-related dry eye.
