  A bipyridine ruthenium ( ii) complex<pathogen> ( Ru-1) with a flavin moiety connected to one of the bipyridine ligands via an acetylene bond was designed and synthesized , and its photophysical properties were investigated. Compared with the tris ( bipyridine) Ru ( ii) complex<pathogen> ( Ru-0) , which has an extinction coefficient ε = 1.36 × 104 M-1 cm-1 at 453 nm , the introduction of the flavin moiety endows Ru-1 with strong absorption in the visible range ( ε = 2.34 × 104 M-1 cm-1 at 456 nm). Furthermore , Ru-1 exhibits phosphorescence ( λem = 643 nm , ΦP = 1 % , τP = 1.32 μs at 293 K and 4.53 μs at 77 K). We propose that the emission of Ru-1 originates from the low lying triplet excited state of 3IL according to the time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra , the calculated T1 spin density and the T1 thermo-vibration modes localized on the flavin-decorated bipyridine ligand. This is the first time that the phosphorescence of flavin was observed within Ru ( ii) complexes. Consequently , Ru-1 was used for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion , showing a reasonable quantum yield of 0.7 % with respect to the phosphorescence quantum yield of 1 %. These findings pave the way for the rational design of phosphorescence transition metal complexes. Also , further approaches that may improve the performance of flavin-decorated Ru ( ii) bipyridine complexes are proposed.
