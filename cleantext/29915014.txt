  Muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA) has shown that sympathetic activation may occur in essential hypertension ( EHT). However , the small sample size of the studies , the heterogeneity of the patients examined , and the presence of confounders represented major weaknesses<symptom> not allowing to draw definite conclusions. Among the 432 studies identified providing information in EHT on MSNA , 63 were eligible ( 1216 patients) and meta-analyzed grouping them on the basis of clinically relevant questions: ( 1) Is MSNA increased in hypertension of mild/moderate-to-severe degree? ( 2) Does sympathetic activation occur in borderline , white-coat , and masked EHT? ( 3) Is MSNA related to clinic and ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and target organ damage? ( 4) Are heart rate and venous plasma norepinephrine valuable surrogate markers of MSNA in clinical practice? The results show that MSNA was significantly greater ( 1.5 Ã—;
