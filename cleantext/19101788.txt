  Self-care practices in diabetes patients are crucial to keep the illness under control and prevent complications. Effective management of diabetes will be a difficult task without adequate understanding of the existing level of practice related to diabetes self-care. This study is , therefore , aimed at assessing the self-care practice and its associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital , Ethiopia. A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 type 2 diabetes patients from March 29 , 2013 , to May 16 , 2013. The data were collected by face-to-face interview using structured and pretested questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association between determinant factors and adherence to self-monitoring of blood glucose. Adjusted odds ratios ( AOR) with its 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were estimated to identify factors associated with the outcome variables in the multivariable analysis. In this study , 318 ( 75.9 %) diabetes patients did not adhere to the recommended diet management , 350 ( 83.5 %) did not adhere to self-monitoring of blood glucose level , while 18 ( 4.3 %) of the respondents did not adhere to the prescribed medications. Diabetic patients who were unemployed were 2.4 times more likely to practice blood glucose monitoring than merchants ( AOR ( 95 % CI) = 2.4 ( 1.3-5.9)). Those who attended primary education were 70 % less likely to adhere to blood glucose self-monitoring than those educated to a tertiary educational level ( AOR ( 95 % CI) = 0.3 ( 0.1-0.9)). Respondents within the age group of 40-49 years were 11 times more likely to adhere to their medication than those aged 60-76 years ( AOR ( 95 % CI) = 11 ( 1.03-13.6)). The study showed that the extent to which individuals adhere to the recommended management of type 2 diabetes is substantially low. Improving awareness of patients and the community at large is imperative especially on medication adherence , glycemic control and diet management.
