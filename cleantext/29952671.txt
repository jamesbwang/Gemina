  The present study examined the construct validity and reliability of a new dribbling agility test ( DAT) that incorporates reactive agility and multiple change of direction. To check its ' validity , ( a) DAT was performed by four groups ( under 10 , under 12 , under 14 and under 16 yrs) of young soccer players ( n = 125 in each group) and ( b) a regression analysis was conducted to define the best DAT predictors. The reliability of DAT was assessed with repeated measurements. This test can differentiate the dribbling skill between groups ( p < 0.01). Furthermore , 68 % of the observed variance in DAT was explained by zigzag dribbling test , Illinois agility test , reaction time and running speed. The test-retest reliability was high in all groups ( ICC = 0.77- 0.90 , p < 0.01). It was concluded that DAT can be a potential tool to evaluate the dribbling performance in young soccer players.
