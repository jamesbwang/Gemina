  During extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for ARDS , a range of 1-4 mL/kg predicted body<symptom> weight tidal volume ( V We attached a lung model to 5 ICU ventilators set in volume controlled mode and body temperature and pressure saturated. We ran 2 protocols over a 100-280 mL V For the 5 ventilators used , the slope ( 95 % CI) between measured V Low V
