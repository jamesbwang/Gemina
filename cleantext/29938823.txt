  This study explored mothers ' perspectives of the experiences and impact on themselves and their family when their child has a life-limiting neurodevelopmental disability. Twelve mothers were interviewed and topics included mothers ' experiences of caring , the impact on themselves and their family of care provision , and the management of day-to-day life. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified. `` Starting Out '' relates to mothers ' experiences of the birth of their child and the aftermath. `` Keeping the Show on the Road '' describes the strategies families employ to manage life day to day and the resources they use. `` Shouldering the Burden '' describes the range of physical , psychological , and social consequences of the situation for mothers and the family. `` The Bigger Picture '' relates to the world outside the family and how this is navigated. Findings suggest mothers ' overall experiences are characterized by a constant struggle , with evidence of negative impacts on family life , though there is also evidence of resilience and coping. Implications regarding the provision of services are discussed.
