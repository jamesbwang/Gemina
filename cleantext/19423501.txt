  Colorectal cancer patients often relapse after chemotherapy , owing to the survival of stem or progenitor cells referred to as cancer stem cells ( CSCs). Although tumor stromal factors are known to contribute to chemoresistance , it remains not fully understood how CSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment escape the chemotherapy. Here , we report that hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1α) and cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs)- secreted TGF-β2 converge to activate the expression of hedgehog transcription factor GLI2 in CSCs , resulting in increased stemness/dedifferentiation and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. Genetic or small-molecule inhibitor-based ablation of HIF-1α/ TGF-β2-mediated GLI2 signaling effectively reversed the chemoresistance caused by the tumor microenvironment. Importantly , high expression levels of HIF-1α/ TGF-β2/ GLI2 correlated robustly with the patient relapse following chemotherapy , highlighting a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. Our study thus uncovers a molecular mechanism by which hypoxic colorectal tumor microenvironment promotes cancer cell stemness and resistance to chemotherapy and suggests a potentially targeted treatment approach to mitigating chemoresistance.
