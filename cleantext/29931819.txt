  The quantification of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) in biological fluids is challenging. We aimed to measure plasma LPS concentration using a new method of direct quantification of 3-hydroxymyristate ( 3-HM) , a lipid component of LPS , and to evaluate correlations between 3-HM and markers of liver function , endothelial activation , portal hypertension and enterocyte damage. Plasma from 90 noninfected cirrhotic patients ( 30 Child-Pugh ( CP)- A , 30 CP-B , 30 CP-C) was prospectively collected. The concentration of 3-HM was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. 3-HM levels were higher in CP-C patients ( CP-A/CP-B/CP-C: 68/70/103 ng/mL , P = 0.005). Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis<disease> ( n = 16; 113 vs 74 ng/mL , P = 0.012) , diabetic patients ( n = 22; 99 vs 70 ng/mL , P = 0.028) and those not receiving beta blockers ( n = 44; 98 vs 72 ng/mL , P = 0.034) had higher levels of 3-HM. We observed a trend towards higher baseline levels of 3-HM in patients with hepatic encephalopathy ( n = 7; 144 vs 76 ng/mL , P = 0.45) or SIRS ( n = 10; 106 vs 75 ng/mL , P = 0.114). In multivariate analysis , high levels of 3-HM were associated with CP ( OR = 4.39; 95 % CI = 1.79-10.76) or MELD ( OR = 8.24; 95 % CI = 3.19-21.32) scores. Patients dying from liver insufficiency ( n = 6) during a 12-month follow-up had higher baseline levels of 3-HM ( 106 vs 75 ng/mL , P = 0.089). In noninfected cirrhotic patients , 3-HM arises more frequently with impairment of liver function , heavy alcohol consumption , diabetic status , nonuse of beta blockers and a trend towards poorer outcome is also observed. The direct mass measurement of LPS using 3-HM appears reliable to detect transient endotoxaemia and promising to manage the follow-up of cirrhotic patients.
