  Operators perform physically demanding jobs associated with a variety of overuse and acute musculoskeletal injuries. The current management of musculoskeletal complaints in the Air Force includes plane radiographs and 6 weeks of physical therapy ( PT) before consideration of orthopedic consultation and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI); however , MRI shows a clear advantage compared with plane radiographs. We conducted a performance improvement project and conclude that ( 1) MRI allowed for definitive diagnosis as well as definitive triage for care in a timely manner , ( 2) guidelines for ordering lumbosacral MRIs should be followed and not ordered for pain that is not progressive and severe or not associated with a neurological finding , and ( 3) because of the risk of X-ray exposure in patients in their 20 and 30s , X-rays should be avoided in this setting unless definitely indicated.
