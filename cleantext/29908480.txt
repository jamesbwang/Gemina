  Approximately 1 % of women in the United States will be diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) during their lifetime. It is most likely to present at a more advanced stage , requiring aggressive therapeutic measures , and most women will succumb to this illness. Due to advancements in therapy , the oncology community has begun to shift its focus to molecular targeted agents , alternative dosing schedules , and maintenance therapy. Women who achieve a response to initial adjuvant chemotherapy may be candidates for maintenance therapy , with the goal of inducing a lasting remission or prolonging the disease-free interval before recurrence. The rationale for maintenance therapy is to delay disease progression by eliminating residual , slowly-dying cancerous cells , or impeding cell turnover. This review discusses the goals of maintenance therapy for EOC with antiangiogenic agents or poly ( adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) inhibitors , and reviews clinical studies that have demonstrated improvements in survival outcomes. The side-effect profiles for PARP inhibitors and the implications for preserving quality of life during maintenance therapy will also be discussed.
