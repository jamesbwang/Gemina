  Physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to short-term environmental stressors , such as infection , can have long-term consequences for fitness , particularly if the responses are inappropriate or nutrient resources are limited. Genetic variation affecting energy acquisition , storage , and usage can limit cellular energy availability and may influence resource-allocation tradeoffs even when environmental nutrients are plentiful. Here , we utilized Drosophila mitochondrial-nuclear genotypes to test whether disrupted mitochondrial function interferes with nutrient-sensing pathways , and whether this disruption has consequences for tradeoffs between immunity and fecundity. We found that an energetically-compromised genotype was relatively resistant to rapamycin- a drug that targets nutrient-sensing pathways and mimics resource limitation. Dietary resource limitation decreased survival of energetically-compromised flies. Furthermore , survival of infection with a natural pathogen was decreased in this genotype , and females of this genotype experienced immunity-fecundity tradeoffs that were not evident in genotypic controls with normal energy metabolism. Together , these results suggest that this genotype may have little excess energetic capacity and fewer cellular nutrients , even when environmental nutrients are not limiting. Genetic variation in energy metabolism may therefore act to limit the resources available for allocation to life-history traits in ways that generate tradeoffs even when environmental resources are not limiting.
