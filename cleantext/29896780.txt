  Single-stage repair of complex cardiac abnormalities in high-risk neonates presents formidable challenges. The majority of hybrid strategies involving bilateral pulmonary artery banding ( bPAB) with or without patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) stenting is described in the setting of hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease>. We present a series of cases describing two-stage repair with initial palliative hybrid procedures involving bPAB with or without PDA stenting. This allows weight gain and stabilization of circulation before complete repair , provides good results , and may overcome risk factors associated with single-stage repair in neonates.
