  A novel composite , EPIDMA/D301 , with high adsorption capacity and particular affinity toward Cr ( Ⅵ) was well prepared utilizing cationic polyelectrolyte poly-epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine ( EPIDMA) impregnated in the networking pores of the styrene macroporous weak basic anion exchange resin D301. The physicochemical characteristics of EPIDMA/D301 were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET) , zeta potential , FTIR , SEM-Mapping and XPS. The adsorption properties were researched via the influence of the concentration of EPIDMA , adsorbent dose , pH , the initial concentration of Cr ( Ⅵ) solution , contact time and temperature. Results presented that the weakly basic anion exchange resin supported cationic polymer showed the excellent potential of removing Cr ( VI) ions primarily due to the nonspecific Cr ( VI) adsorption resulted from the polymeric host D301 , the electrostatic attraction of amino groups fixed on the D301 matrix and the embedded EPIDMA with Cr ( VI) ions and the ion exchange by the displacement of Cl
