  The purpose of this study is to assess caries<disease> and enamel fluorosis in a sample of 1433 children aged 6-8 , 12 , and 15 years from 48 schools in 6 regions of Lebanon , selected by probability proportional to size. Children were examined according to the World Health Organization criteria. Our results showed a mean of decayed , missing , and filled teeth ( DMFT) of 0.6 ( dft of 5.15) , 3.42 , and 5.44 corresponding respectively to the groups of 6-8- , 12- , and 15-year-old children. In the same groups , the percentage of DMFT = 0 for the 6-8-year-old category was 74 % , the 12-year-old category was 20.9 % , and for the 15-year-old category was 9.7 %; Ten ( 2.1 %) 12 year olds had moderate and one ( 0.2 %) severe scores; these children had been born in other countries. Survey results confirm the need to implement nationwide dental<disease> caries<disease> prevention measures. Since water fluoridation is not feasible , salt fluoridation would be the alternative.
