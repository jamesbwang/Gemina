  Meningiomas are the most frequently diagnosed intracranial masses , oftentimes requiring surgery. Especially procedure-related morbidity can be substantial , particularly in elderly patients. Hence , reliable imaging modalities enabling pretherapeutic prediction of tumor grade , growth kinetic , realistic prognosis , and-as a consequence-necessity of surgery are of great value. In this context , a promising diagnostic approach is advanced analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data. Therefore , our study investigated whether histogram profiling of routinely acquired postcontrast T1-weighted images is capable of separating low-grade from high-grade lesions<symptom> and whether histogram parameters reflect Ki-67 expression in meningiomas. Pretreatment T1-weighted postcontrast volumes of 44 meningioma patients were used for signal intensity histogram profiling. WHO grade , tumor volume , and Ki-67 expression were evaluated. Comparative and correlative statistics investigating the association between histogram profile parameters and neuropathology were performed. None of the investigated histogram parameters revealed significant differences between low-grade and high-grade meningiomas. However , significant correlations were identified between Ki-67 and the histogram parameters skewness and entropy as well as between entropy and tumor volume. Contrary to previously reported findings , pretherapeutic postcontrast T1-weighted images can be used to predict growth kinetics in meningiomas if whole tumor histogram analysis is employed. However , no differences between distinct WHO grades were identifiable in out cohort. As a consequence , histogram analysis of postcontrast T1-weighted images is a promising approach to obtain quantitative in vivo biomarkers reflecting the proliferative potential in meningiomas.
