  Currently , in the United States and worldwide , the vast majority of children and adolescents in need of mental health services receive no treatment. Although there are many barriers , a key barrier is the dominant model of delivering psychosocial interventions. That model includes one-to-one , in-person treatment , with a trained mental health professional , provided in clinical setting ( e.g. , clinic , private practice office , health-care facility). That model greatly limits the scale and reach of psychosocial interventions. The article discusses many novel models of delivering interventions that permit scaling treatment to encompass children and adolescents who are not likely to receive services. Special attention is accorded the use of social media , socially assistive robots , and social networks that not only convey the ability to scale interventions but also encompass interventions that depart from the usual forms of intervention that currently dominate psychosocial treatment research.
