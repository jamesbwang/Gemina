  5-Hydroxyoxindole is a urinary metabolite of indole that exhibits antioxidant activity. In the present study , we found that a 5-hydroxyoxindole derivative ( 5-HI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory effects in the murine macrophage cell line , RAW264 .7. 5-HI induced the expression of the transcription factor , Nrf2 , which is typically ubiquitinated by Keap1 , an adaptor component of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex , resulting in its proteasomal degradation. By utilizing Keap1-/- MEFs reconstituted with Keap1 mutants harboring substitutions in their major cysteine residues , we clarified the importance of Cys151 in Keap1 as a sensor for 5-HI in the induction of Nrf2 expression. Furthermore , 5-HI induced the activation of the MKK3/6-p 38 pathway , which is required for the transcriptional activation of Nrf2. The knockdown of Nrf2 enhanced the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory mediators , including iNOS , NO , and CCL2 , and effectively repressed the inhibitory effects of 5-HI on their expression. Although 5-HI and antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC) both reduced LPS-induced ROS generation , the treatment with NAC did not affect the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory mediators , suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of 5-HI mediated by Nrf2 is independent of redox control. Furthermore , when injected into mice with 5-HI , the expression of Nrf2 was significantly increased , and the LPS-induced mRNA expression of CXCL1 , CCL2 , TNFÎ± , and IL-6 were remarkably inhibited in the kidneys , liver , and lungs , and the production of these cytokines in serum was effectively reduced. Collectively , these results suggest that 5-HI has potential in the treatment of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> through the activation of Nrf2.
