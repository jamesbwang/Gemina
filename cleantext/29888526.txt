  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean-language versions of Pain Knowledge and Use ( PKU-K) , Collaboration and Satisfaction About Care Decisions ( CSACD-K) , and Environmental Complexity Scale ( ECS-K). A cross-sectional design was used with a convenience sample of 159 Korean nurses in seven neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs). The data were collected by surveying the nurses with the PKU-K , CSACD-K , and ECS-K. Internal consistency reliability was assessed and Horn 's parallel analysis , a confirmatory factor analysis , and a convergent construct validity test were conducted in order to evaluate the psychometric properties of the instruments. The PKU-K , CSACD-K , and ECS-K exhibited strong internal consistency reliability. Horn 's parallel analysis showed four factor structures for the PKU-K , one for the CSACD-K , and three for the ECS-K. The confirmatory factor analysis showed a good model fit for the PKU-K and CSACD-K , but the ECS-K model showed a poor fit. Most factor loadings were statistically significant. The CSACD-K 's convergent validity was supported by significant correlations for collegial nurse-physician relations with a validated instrument. The findings support the reliability and validity of the PKU-K , CSACD-K , and ECS-K for measuring nurses ' knowledge about neonatal pain care , nurse-physician collaboration , and the work environment in NICUs. However , the ECS-K needs further refinement before it is applied to Korean NICU nurses.
