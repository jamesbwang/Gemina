  Carotenoids are among the most abundant natural pigments available in nature. These pigments have received considerable attention because of their biotechnological applications and , more importantly , due to their potential beneficial uses in human healthcare , food processing , pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. These bioactive compounds are in high demand throughout the world; Europe and the USA are the markets where the demand for carotenoids is the highest. The in vitro synthesis of carotenoids has sustained their large-scale production so far. However , the emerging modern standards for a healthy lifestyle and environment-friendly practices have given rise to a search for natural biocompounds as alternatives to synthetic ones. Therefore , nowadays , biomass ( vegetables , fruits , yeast and microorganisms) is being used to obtain naturally-available carotenoids with high antioxidant capacity and strong color , on a large scale. This is an alternative to the in vitro synthesis of carotenoids , which is expensive and generates a large number of residues , and the compounds synthesized are sometimes not active biologically. In this context , marine biomass has recently emerged as a natural source for both common and uncommon valuable carotenoids. Besides , the cultivation of marine microorganisms , as well as the downstream processes , which are used to isolate the carotenoids from these microorganisms , offer several advantages over the other approaches that have been explored previously. This review summarizes the general properties of the most-abundant carotenoids produced by marine microorganisms , focusing on the genuine/rare carotenoids that exhibit interesting features useful for potential applications in biotechnology , pharmaceuticals , cosmetics and medicine.
