  Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT) of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) has shown an effect on mediating tumor regression in some patients with highly advanced , refractory metastatic malignancy. Here , the in vitro generation of TILs isolated from malignant pleural effusion<symptom> and ascites was compared with which using engineered cells for costimulatory enhancement ( ECCE) and 3 common γ-chain cytokines , interleukin ( IL) -2 , IL-7 , and IL-15 , alone or in combination. We showed the robust clinical-scale production of TILs with a less differentiated ` young ' phenotype by expansion in the presence of ECCE combined with IL-2 / 7/15. Furthermore , a major fraction of the TILs generated in this fashion was shown to produce much more IFN-γ and TNF-α , and displayed cytolytic activity against target cells expressing the relevant antigens. To our knowledge , this is the first time that the combination of ECCE and IL-2 / 7/15 has been applied for the generation of TILs isolated from malignant pleural effusion<symptom> and ascites.
