  Harmful algal blooms are an annual phenomenon that cause environmental damage , economic losses , and disease outbreaks. A fundamental solution to this problem is still lacking , thus , the best option for counteracting the effects of algal blooms is to improve advance warnings ( predictions). However , existing physical prediction models have difficulties setting a clear coefficient indicating the relationship between each factor when predicting algal blooms , and many variable data sources are required for the analysis. These limitations are accompanied by high time and economic costs. Meanwhile , artificial intelligence and deep learning methods have become increasingly common in scientific research; attempts to apply the long short-term memory ( LSTM) model to environmental research problems are increasing because the LSTM model exhibits good performance for time-series data prediction. However , few studies have applied deep learning models or LSTM to algal bloom prediction , especially in South Korea , where algal blooms occur annually. Therefore , we employed the LSTM model for algal bloom prediction in four major rivers of South Korea. We conducted short-term ( one week) predictions by employing regression analysis and deep learning techniques on a newly constructed water quality and quantity dataset drawn from 16 dammed pools on the rivers. Three deep learning models ( multilayer perceptron , MLP; recurrent neural network , RNN; and long short-term memory , LSTM) were used to predict chlorophyll-a , a recognized proxy for algal activity. The results were compared to those from OLS ( ordinary least square) regression analysis and actual data based on the root mean square error ( RSME). The LSTM model showed the highest prediction rate for harmful algal blooms and all deep learning models out-performed the OLS regression analysis. Our results reveal the potential for predicting algal blooms using LSTM and deep learning.
