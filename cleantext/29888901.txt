  Electrospinning and annealing methods are applied to prepare cobalt nanoparticles decorated in N-doped carbon nanofibers ( Co/N-C NFs) with solid and macroporous structures. In detail , the nanocomposites are synthesized by carbonization of as-electrospun polyacrylonitrile/cobalt acetylacetonate nanofibers in an argon atmosphere. The solid Co/N-C NFs have lengths up to dozens of microns with an average diameter of ca. 500 nm and possess abundant cobalt nanoparticles on both the surface and within the fibers , and the cobalt nanoparticle size is about 20 nm. The macroporous Co/N-C NFs possess a hierarchical pore structure , and there are macropores ( 500 nm) and mesopores ( 2-50 nm) existing in this material. The saturation magnetization ( M
