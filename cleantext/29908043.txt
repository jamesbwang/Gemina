  Essentials Tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI) is an antagonist of FXa and the TF-FVIIa complex. PF-06741086 is an IgG Background Tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI) is a protease inhibitor of the tissue factor-activated factor VII complex and activated FX. PF-06741086 is a mAb that targets TFPI to increase clotting activity. Objectives This study was a randomized , double-blind , sponsor-open , placebo-controlled , single intravenous or subcutaneous dose escalation study to evaluate the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PF-06741086. Patients/Methods Volunteers who provided written informed consent were assigned to cohorts with escalating dose levels. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) , infusion/injection site reactions , vital signs , electrocardiogram , and coagulation and hematology laboratory parameters. Pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic ( PD) endpoints included exposures of PF-06741086 in plasma and measures of PF-06741086 pharmacology , respectively. Results Forty-one male volunteers were recruited overall. Thirty-two were dosed with PF-06741086 from 30 mg subcutaneously to 440 mg intravenously. All doses were safe and well tolerated. TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity , laboratory abnormalities were transient , there were no serious adverse events , there were no infusion/injection site reactions , and no dose escalation stopping criteria were met. Plasma exposures of PF-06741086 increased greater than proportionally with dose under the same dosing route. Coagulation pharmacology was demonstrated via total TFPI , dilute prothrombin time , D-dimer , prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and thrombin generation assay parameters. Conclusions Single doses of PF-06741086 at multiple dose levels were safe and well tolerated in a healthy adult male population. The safety , PK and PD data from this study support progression to a multiple-dose study in hemophilic patients.
