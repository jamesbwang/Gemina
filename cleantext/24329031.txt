  Australian guidelines advocate primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI) as the reperfusion strategy of choice for ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) in patients in whom it can be performed within 90 minutes of first medical contact; otherwise , fibrinolytic therapy is preferred. In a large health district , the reperfusion strategy is often chosen in the prehospital setting. We sought to identify a distance from a PCI centre , which made it unlikely first medical contact to balloon time ( FMCTB) of less than 90 minutes could be achieved in the Hunter New England health district and to identify causes of delay in patients who were triaged to a PPCI strategy. We studied 116 patients presenting via the ambulance service with STEMI from January 2016 to December 2016. In patients who were taken directly to the cardiac catheterisation lab , a maximum distance of 50 km from hospital resulted in 75 % of patients receiving PCI within 90 minutes and approximately 95 % of patients receiving PCI within 120 minutes. Patients who bypassed the emergency department ( ED) were significantly more likely to have FMCTB of less than 90 minutes ( Patients who do not bypass the ED have a longer FMCTB across all spectrum of distances from the PCI centre; therefore , bypassing the ED is key to achieving target FMCTB times. Using a cutoff distance of 50 km may reduce human error in estimating travel time to our PCI centre and thereby identifying patients who should receive prehospital thrombolysis.
