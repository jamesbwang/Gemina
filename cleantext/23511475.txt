  Atherosclerosis is driven by an inflammatory milieu in the walls of artery vessels. Initiated early in life , it progresses to plaque formation and form cell accumulation. A culprit in this cascade is the deposition of cholesterol crystals ( CC). The involvement of smaller crystals in the early stage of atherosclerotic changes may be critical to the long-term pathological development. How these small crystals initiate the pro-inflammatory events is under study. We report here an unexpected mechanism that microscopic CC interact with cellular membrane in a phagocytosis-independent manner. The binding of these crystals extracts cholesterol from the cell surface. This process causes a sudden catastrophic rupture of plasma membrane and necrosis<symptom> of the bound cells independent of any known cell death-inducing pathways , releasing inflammatory agents associated with the necrotic cell death. Our results , therefore , reveal a biophysical aspect of CC in potentially mediating the inflammatory progress in atherosclerosis.
