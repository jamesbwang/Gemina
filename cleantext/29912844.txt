  An inactivated Vero cell culture derived Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> vaccine ( IXIARO) requires a booster dose 1 year after primary schedule for long-term antibody persistence in adults. To evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose in children aged 2 months to < 18 years. A randomized , controlled open-label study in the Philippines. Three hundred children vaccinated with IXIARO in a previous trial were randomized 1:1 to receive either no booster or a booster 12 months after initiation of the primary series. Neutralizing antibody ( NT) titers were assessed before and after the booster as well as up to 3 years after primary series. Safety endpoints included the rate of subjects with solicited AEs , unsolicited AEs and SAEs within 1 month following the booster. GMT declined by 1 year after the primary series but titers remained above the established protective threshold in 85-100 % of children depending on age group. The booster led to a pronounced increase in GMT as well as 100 % seroprotection rate in all age groups. The booster was well tolerated , with AE rates lower compared to the primary series. Most AEs were mild. A booster dose of IXIARO administered 12 months after the primary immunization was well tolerated and highly immunogenic.
