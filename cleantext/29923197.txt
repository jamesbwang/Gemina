  We aimed to explore the effects of Inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1β , IFN-γ , TNF-α) on pancreatic β-cells. CCK-8 assay showed that the cell viability decreased after 24 hr treatment of TNF-α , 48 hr of IFN-γ , and 84 hr of IL-1β. EdU assay illustrated that after 24 hr treatment , there were significantly reduced EdU-labeled red fluorescence cells in TNF-α group while not in IFN-γ and IL-1β groups. Flow Cytometry results displayed that TNF-α and IFN-γ groups increased apoptosis while IL-1β group did not. Cell apoptosis results found that there was an increase in the S-phase population of IL-1β and TNF-α groups , however , there was no significant difference in cell cycle between IFN-γ group and the control. TEM images showed that there were reduction in the number of granules and mitochondria in IL-1β and IFN-γ groups , in particular paucity of insulin granules and mitochondria in TNF-α group. Radioimmunoassay results presented that TNF-α inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion , while there were no significant changes in IL-1β and IFN-γ groups when compared with the control. Metabolomic analysis found amino acid metabolism and Krebs cycle were the most robust altered metabolism pathways after inflammatory cytokines treatments. Overall , the altered amino acid metabolism and Krebs cycle metabolism might be important mechanisms of TNF-α induced mouse pancreatic β-cells dysfuction.
