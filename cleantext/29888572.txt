  To observe the effect of acupuncture on the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and the level of serum interleukin 10 ( IL-10) in rats with depression<symptom> , so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of depression<symptom> Thirty-two male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: control , model , acupuncture , and medication ( Fluoxetine , Flu) ( After modeling , the sucrose consumption , the crossing numbers and rearing times , hippocampal GFAP protein expression and serum IL-10 content were significantly decreased and prefrontal GFAP protein expression was up-regulated markedly in the model group relevant to the control group ( Acupuncture intervention plays a positive role in anti-depression in rats , which may be related to its effects in regulating the expression of GFAP in the hippocampal and prefrontal astrocytes , and in increasing the content of serum anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
