  Metro system is a vital component of mass transportation infrastructure , providing crucial social and economic service in urban area. Flood events may cause functional disruptions to metro systems; therefore , a better understanding of their vulnerability would enhance their resilience. A comparative study of flood risk in metro systems is presented using the analytic hierarchy process ( AHP) and the interval AHP ( I-AHP) methods. The flood risk in the Guangzhou metro system is evaluated according to recorded data. Evaluated results are validated using the flood event occurred in Guangzhou on May 10 , 2016 ( hereinafter called `` May 10th event '') , which inundated several metro stations. The flood risk is assessed within a range of 500 m around the metro line. The results show that > 50 % of metro lines are highly exposed to flood risk , indicating that the Guangzhou metro system is vulnerable to flood events. Comparisons between results from AHP and I-AHP show that the latter yields a wider range of high flooding risk than the former.
