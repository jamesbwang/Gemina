  Fluorescence spectroscopy of protein-bound molecular rotors Cy3 and Cy5 is used to monitor the effective viscosity inside the pores of two types of mesoporous silica ( SBA-15 and MCF) with pore diameters between 8.9 and 33 nm. The ratio of the peak intensities is used to measure viscosity independently of solvent polarity , and the response of the lipase-bound dyes is calibrated using glycerol/water mixtures ( no particles). The two dyes are either attached to the same protein or separate proteins in order to investigate potential effects of energy transfer ( FRET) on the fluorescence properties , when using them as reporter dyes. The effective viscosity inside the pores at infinite protein dilution is one order of magnitude higher than in bulk water , and the effect of protein concentration on the measured viscosity indicates a stronger effect of protein-protein interactions in the pores than in similarly concentrated protein solutions without particles. In MCF-particles with octyl-groups covalently attached to the pore walls , a more efficient uptake of the lipase resulted in FRET between the protein-bound dyes even if the two dyes were attached to different proteins. In contrast to the unmodified particles the intensity-ratio method could therefore not be used to measure the viscosity , but the presence of FRET in itself indicates that octyl-protein interactions lead to a non-homogenous protein distribution in the pores. The dye labels also report a less polar pore environment as sensed by the proteins through a redshift in the dye emission. Both observations may help in understanding the higher efficiency of lipase immobilization in octyl-modified particles.
