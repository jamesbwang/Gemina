  Effective water quality management depends on enactment of appropriately designed monitoring programs to reveal current and forecasted conditions. Because water quality conditions are influenced by numerous factors , commonly measured attributes such as total phosphorus ( TP) can be highly temporally varying. For highly varying processes , monitoring programs should be long-term and periodic quantitative analyses are needed so that temporal trends can be distinguished from stochastic variation , which can yield insights into potential modifications to the program. Using generalized additive mixed modeling , we assessed temporal ( yearly and monthly) trends and quantified other sources of variation ( daily and subsampling) in TP concentrations from a multidecadal depth-specific monitoring program on Big Platte Lake , Michigan. Yearly TP concentrations decreased from the late 1980s to late 1990s before rebounding through the early 2000s. At depths of 2.29 to 13.72 m , TP concentrations have cycled around stationary points since the early 2000s , while at the surface and depths â‰¥ 18.29 concentrations have continued declining. Summer and fall peaks in TP concentrations were observed at most depths , with the fall peak at deeper depths occurring 1 month earlier than shallower depths. Daily sampling variation ( i.e. , variation within a given month and year) was greatest at shallowest and deepest depths. Variation in subsamples collected from depth-specific water samples constituted a small fraction of total variation. Based on model results , cost-saving measures to consider for the monitoring program include reducing subsampling of depth-specific concentrations and reducing the number of sampling depths given observed consistencies across the program period.
