  Information and communication technologies can be a valuable tool for enhancing health communication. However , not everyone is utilising the wide suite of digital opportunities. This disparity has the potential to exacerbate existing social and health inequalities , particularly among vulnerable groups such as those who are in poor health and the elderly. This review aimed to systematically identify the common barriers to , and facilitators of , digital inclusion. A comprehensive database search yielded 969 citations. Following screening , seven systematic reviews and three non-systematic reviews were identified. Collectively , the reviews found that physical access continues to be a barrier to digital inclusion. However , provision of access alone is insufficient , as digital ability and attitude were also potential barriers. Social support , direct user experience and collaborative learning/design were identified as key strategies to improve inclusion. These review findings provide guidance for health communication practitioners in designing and implementing effective programmes in the digital environment.
