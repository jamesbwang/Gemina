  Despite the lack of consensus regarding the treatment of labio-palatal clefts , each treatment protocol is the expression of an individual perspective that accumulates the experience of each multidisciplinary group , which all pursue the same goal: to achieve adequate language development with the lowest possible impact on facial growth. To achieve this , a management scheme has been developed , this exploits vomer flaps for the closure of palatal clefts and limits dissections in the palatine segments. Modifications are presented in the design and dissection of vomer flaps , so as to use the largest amount of mucosal tissue available , thus facilitating closure of the different clefts , particularly in Veau Group III clefts.
