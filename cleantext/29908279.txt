  The CONSTANS-LIKE ( COL<pathogen>) gene has an important role both in regulation flowering through photoperiodic control and response to abiotic stress. In the present study , we performed a genome-wide analysis of maize COL<pathogen> gene family and identified 19 non-redundant ZmCOL genes , which were unequally distributed on ten maize chromosomes. Analysis of compound phylogenetic tree ( maize , sorghum , rice and Arabidopsis) showed high bootstrap , as well as conserved domain and semblable gene structures among members within the same clade , revealing that COL<pathogen> genes in same clade were from the common ancestral and prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots lineages. Calculation of Ka/Ks ratio demonstrated that most duplicated ZmCOLs experienced purifying selection , which suggested limited functional divergence after duplication events. Comparing interspecies gene collinearity between three major grasses species , extensive microsynteny was detected among maize , sorghum and rice COL-containing segments. Additionally , several light-responsive and one ABA-responsive cis-elements could be detected for ZmCOL genes in group A. Therefore , qRT-PCR was performed to explore the expression patterns of ZmCOL genes in group A under light/dark conditions and ABA treatment. Our results laid the foundation for functional characterization of ZmCOL proteins and uncovering the biological roles of COL<pathogen> genes in response to stress in future.
