  To study the role of Field staining in scrape smears for intraoperative cytological ( IOC) diagnosis. Specimens were assessed for categorizing among benign and malignant lesions<symptom> , lymph node status , and adequacy of surgical cut margins as per specimen. Technique , adequacy , and quality were assessed along with comparison of cytological diagnosis with final histopathological diagnosis obtained on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. A prospective observational study was conducted over a period of 1 year from November 2016 to October 2017 in the Department of Pathology of our Institute. 50 cases were studied , and scrape smears were stained with Field stain. Results were satisfactory in terms of adequacy and attaining the objectives of the study. A diagnostic accuracy of 98 % was observed with an average turnaround time of 5 min. A single case of low-grade glioma was found to be discordant. Use of Field staining for intraoper-ative cytological assessment of surgical specimens has 98 % concordance with the final histopathological diagnosis and achieved the aim of the study. With its low costs , easy availability , short turnaround time , and simple technique , it will be helpful in IOC as an alternative to present techniques especially in financially constrained settings.
