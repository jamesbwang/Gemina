  Clozapine is more efficacious than first-generation antipsychotics for positive and negative symptoms , although it is related with serious adverse effects. Because of this profile , it could also have an impact on cognition. Therefore , we evaluated learning ability of 31 treatment-resistant individuals with SZ using clozapine uninterruptedly for 18.23 Â± 4.71 years and 26 non-treatment-resistant using other antipsychotics that never used clozapine. Long-term treatment with clozapine did not improve verbal learning ability better than other antipsychotics. Although clozapine has a unique profile for reducing clinical symptoms , it may not have an additional benefit for cognition when started later on the course of schizophrenia.
