  To investigate the mechanical properties and wear of nylon inserts and abutments in Locator-retained , implant-supported overdentures ( L-IODs). Clinical wear of inserts and abutments was qualitatively rated in a group of 16 patients with L-IODs. The inserts were also subjected to microscopic analysis , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , and thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA). Wear was identified in almost all inserts and abutments. These results were corroborated by DSC and TGA analyses , which showed significant mechanical deterioration of the inserts. Nylon inserts and Locator abutments show relevant signs of deterioration in clinical use , indicating that regular maintenance is an issue that should be addressed with the patients prior to treatment.
