  The process of grouping neuronal spikes in an extracellular recording according to their neuronal sources , is generally referred to as spike sorting. Currently , the use of spike sorting is mainly limited to an offline usage , where spikes are sorted after the data acquisition has been completed. In this paper , we propose a discriminative template matching algorithm for threshold-based spike sorting on high-density extracellular data. Such threshold-based spike sorting has a low and deterministic algorithmic delay , allowing for fast online spike sorting. At its core , threshold-based spike sorting is driven by linear filters. The proposed discriminative template matching filter design algorithm optimizes the output signal-to-peak-interference ratio in a data-driven fashion , assuming the template of the target spike is available. The latter allows the filter to suppress the spikes of interfering neurons and to resolve spike overlap. The data-driven filter design algorithm requires only templates of the target neurons of interest , which can be retrieved , e.g. through a prior clustering on an initial recording. The proposed discriminative template matching filters are validated on in vivo ground truth data and are shown to provide single-unit activity with good accuracy using a simple thresholding operation on the filter outputs. The low algorithmic complexity allows for computationally cheap and fast spike sorting. Also the proposed filters are guaranteed to be stable and have a deterministic delay. These characteristics make the proposed filter design method a valuable building block for online spike sorting , thereby enabling unit activity-based real-time and closed-loop experiments for high-density neural recordings.
