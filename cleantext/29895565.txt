  Proper gene expression involves communication between the regulatory elements and promoters of genes. Today , chromosome conformation capture ( 3C)- based methods efficiently probe chromosome folding in the nucleus and thus provide a molecular description of physical proximity through DNA looping between enhancer ( s) and their target promoter ( s). One such method , chromatin interaction analysis using paired-end-tag ( ChIA-PET) sequencing is a powerful high-throughput method for detection of genome-wide chromatin interactions. Following enrichment of the chromatin complexes with a dedicated antibody , through a process of immunoprecipitation ( IP) , DNA fragments are end-joined with specifically designed DNA-linkers through proximity ligation. The DNA-linkers contain the binding site for the type II restriction enzyme
