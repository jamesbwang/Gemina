  There is now compelling evidence that selective stimulation of AÎ´ nociceptors eliciting first pain evokes robust responses in the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1). In contrast , whether the C-fiber nociceptive input eliciting second pain has an organized projection to S1 remains an open question. Here , we recorded the electrocortical responses elicited by nociceptive-specific laser stimulation of the four limbs in 202 humans ( both males and females , using EEG) and 12 freely moving rats ( all males , using ECoG). Topographical analysis and source modeling revealed in both species , a clear gross somatotopy of the unmyelinated C-fiber input within the S1 contralateral to the stimulated side. In the human EEG , S1 activity could be isolated as an early-latency negative deflection ( C-N1 wave peaking at 710-730 ms) after hand stimulation , but not after foot stimulation because of the spatiotemporal overlap with the subsequent large-amplitude supramodal vertex waves ( C-N2/ P2). In contrast , because of the across-species difference in the representation of the body surface within S1 , S1 activity could be isolated in rat ECoG as a C-N1 after both forepaw and hindpaw stimulation. Finally , we observed a functional dissociation between the generators of the somatosensory-specific lateralized waves ( C-N1) and those of the supramodal vertex waves ( C-N2/ P2) , indicating that C-fiber unmyelinated input is processed in functionally distinct somatosensory and multimodal cortical areas. These findings demonstrated that C-fiber input conveys information about the spatial location of noxious stimulation across the body surface , a prerequisite for deploying an appropriate defensive motor repertoire.
