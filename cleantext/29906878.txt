  We present a set of phase-space portraits illustrating the extraordinary oscillatory possibilities of the dynamical systems through the so-called generalized Landau scenario. In its simplest form the scenario develops in N dimensions around a saddle-node pair of fixed points experiencing successive Hopf bifurcations up to exhausting their stable manifolds and generating N-1 different limit cycles. The oscillation modes associated with these cycles extend over a wide phase-space region by mixing ones within the others and by affecting both the transient trajectories and the periodic orbits themselves. A mathematical theory covering the mode-mixing mechanisms is lacking , and our aim is to provide an overview of their main qualitative features in order to stimulate research on it.
