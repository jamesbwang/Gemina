  Oxidative stress plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases. Therefore , the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) , a key regulator of the antioxidative response , is considered to be important as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the underlying mechanism of Nrf2-mediated neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in the PC12 cell line by 7β- ( 3-ethyl-cis-crotonoyloxy) -1 α- ( 2-methylbutyryloxy) -3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone ( ECN) , one of the sesquiterpenoids in Farfarae Flos. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with ECN had a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide ( H
