  A phytochemical study on the seeds of Cassia obtusifolia was carried out , which finally led to obtain two naphthalenes ( 1 and 2) , two naphthopyrans ( 3 and 4) and twelve anthraquinones ( 5-16). The structures of all compounds were established mainly by NMR and MS experiments as well as the necessary chemical evidence. Among them , 1 and 2 ( obtusinaphthalensides A and B) were identified to be new naphthalene glycosides.
