  Acute myeloid leukaemia is the most common form of acute leukaemia , and its incidence increases with age. The disease derives from a transformed multipotent malignant haematopoietic stem cell that acquires consequent genomic alterations. The identification of recurrent cytogenetic anomalies associated with different patterns of acute myeloid leukaemia clinical presentation has led to the incorporation of genetic markers in clinical decision-making. In addition , the observation that these anomalies may mark therapeutic responses and relapse and survival rates have been incorporated into the World Health Organisation 's recent molecular classification and stratification and the European Leukaemia Net , with the aim of creating prognostic categories that help rationalise better diagnosis , prognosis , re-evaluation of the disease and the combination of therapeutic protocols in order to increase the survival rate of these patients.
