  Carbohydrate chemistry has benefited a lot from the intrinsic reactivity of sulfoxide since it was introduced in glycosylation reactions by Kahne in 1989. Since then , extensive studies have been explored by employing sulfoxide as glycosyl donors and activation reagents in construction of glycosidic bonds. As glycosyl donors , the sulfinyl groups could locate either directly or remotely at anomeric position. This chapter focuses on the establishment and development of sulfoxides as glycosyl donors in glycosylation reactions , with an emphasis on their applications and postulated mechanisms.
