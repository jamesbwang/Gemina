  To study the pathogenesis of chromoblastomycosis using the alternative model host Galleria mellonella. We analyzed the virulence of different dematiaceous fungal strains and the host immune responses ( hemocytes density and morphological changes) to Fonsecaea<pathogen> monophora<pathogen> by the alternative infection model. Then detected the development of the pathogenic muriform cells within larvae under microscope. Increasing inocula resulted in greater larval mortality and Cladophialophora<pathogen> carrionii<pathogen> was the most virulent. Low inocula activated the humoral immune response significantly. Moreover , the conidia underwent morphological transition to muriform cells within larvae. We developed an invertebrate host model that can be used to evaluate the virulence of dematiaceous fungi<pathogen> , which may provide further insights into overcoming current limitations in studying chromoblastomycosis in vivo.
