  Five π-extended lactam-fused conjugated oligomers ( 5FO , 5FS , 4FPO , 4 FPS , and R-4FPO) were synthesized by the tandem direct arylation. The intermolecular oxidative direct arylation was applied in the second step. These conjugated oligomers had fine-tuned FMO energies predictable by the theoretical calculation and excellent thermal stabilities. 4FPO and 4 FPS bearing tetrafluoropyridine exhibited lower LUMO energy levels ( -3.20 eV and -3.39 eV , respectively) compared with others. Based on the X-ray crystallography , 4FPO was found to have a herringbone crystal packing and a considerably large electron transfer integral value ( 137 meV). 4FPO-based bottom-gate , bottom-contact FET device demonstrated an electron mobility of 5.2 × 10-3 cm2 · V-1 · s-1 as a result of an edge-on allignment on the SiO2 substrate.
