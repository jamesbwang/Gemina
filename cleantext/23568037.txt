  As the benefits , limitations , and contraindications of transoral laser microsurgery ( TLM) in glottic carcinoma treatments become better defined , pretreatment imaging has become more important to assess the case-specific suitability of TLM and to predict functional outcomes both for treatment consideration and patient counseling. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is the preferred modality to image such laryngeal tumors , even though imaging the larynx using MRI can be difficult. The first challenge is that there are no commercial radiofrequency ( RF) coils that are specifically designed for imaging the larynx , and performance in terms of coverage and signal-to-noise ratio is compromised using general-purpose RF coils. Second , motion in the neck region induced by breathing , swallowing , and vessel pulsation can induce severe image artifacts , sometimes rendering the images unusable. In this paper , we design a dedicated RF coil array , which allows high quality high-resolution imaging of the larynx. In addition , we show that introducing respiratory-triggered acquisition improves the diagnostic quality of the images by minimizing breathing and swallowing artifacts. Together , these developments enable robust , essentially artifact-free images of the full larynx with an isotropic resolution of 1 mm to be acquired within a few minutes.
