  Liquid biopsies examine tumor cells or tumor genomic content in circulating fluids. In advanced prostate cancer which metastasizes frequently to the bone , it is difficult to evaluate underlying and evolving genomic heterogeneity of skeletal metastases for effecting clinical care for which reason liquid biopsies offer an alternate approach. In this review , we will summarize the current state of a wide variety of liquid biopsy-based biomarker assays currently being investigated and developed for managing prostate cancer. We will also highlight technical and clinical challenges and opportunities for translating liquid biopsies into clinical applications.
