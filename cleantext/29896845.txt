  In South Korea , a significant amount of groundwater is used for the heating of water-curtain insulated greenhouses during the winter dry season , which had led to problems of groundwater depletion. A managed aquifer recharge ( MAR) project is currently underway with the goal of preventing such groundwater depletion in a typical cultivation area , located on an alluvial aquifer near the Nam River. In the present study , FEFLOW , a three-dimensional finite element model , was used to evaluate different strategies for MAR of the cultivation areas. A conceptual model was developed to simulate the stream-aquifer dynamics under the influence of seasonal groundwater pumping and MAR.. The optimal rates and duration of MAR were assessed by analyzing the recovery of the groundwater levels and the change in the groundwater temperature. The simulation results indicate that a MAR rate of 8000 m
