  A paradigm shift seems to emerge , not only in industrial engineering ( `` Industry 4.0 '') but also in medicine: we are on the threshold to `` Medicine 4.0 ''. For many years , molecular biology had a leading position in life sciences , but today scientists start realizing that microelectronic systems , due to an increasing miniaturization , are reaching the scale of human cells and consequently can be used for therapeutic approaches. This article shows how microelectronics can play a major role in modern medicine , through the example of customized chemotherapy. This consists in determining , before the beginning of the treatment , what kind of chemotherapy or drug combination will be most effective for a given patient , and at which dose. This of course allows the lessening of a patient burden during treatment , but also to be more efficient and , in the long run , to save money. In order to do this , we have developed the Intelligent Microplate Reader ( IMR) , which allows us to accurately test different drugs on living cells by mimicking part of their usual environment.
