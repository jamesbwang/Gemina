  Hyaluronan ( HA)- binding protein involved in HA depolymerization ( HYBID) , also called cell migration-inducing protein ( CEMIP; alias KIAA1199) , plays a key role in the degradation of HA in skin and arthritic synovial fibroblasts , but its functions in osteoarthritic ( OA) cartilage remain elusive. Here , we investigated the expression and roles of HYBID in human OA cartilage. HYBID was highly expressed by chondrocytes in the HA-depleted area of OA cartilage , and HYBID immunoreactivity was correlated with Mankin score , the histopathologic severity of OA lesions<symptom> of cartilage. Real-time quantitative PCR indicated that HYBID expression was significantly higher in OA cartilage than in control cartilage. In addition , OA chondrocytes exhibited HA-degrading activity , which was abolished by knock-down of HYBID by siRNAs. Although OA chondrocytes also expressed certain levels of hyaluronidases 1 and 2 and CD44 , knock-down of these molecules exhibited negligible effects on HA degradation. Double immunostaining of HYBID and clathrin heavy chain revealed that HYBID was localized in the clathrin-coated vesicles , and HA was endocytosed within the vesicles of OA chondrocytes. Among eight factors including cytokines and growth factors examined , only tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α stimulated OA chondrocytes to overexpress HYBID. These data are the first to demonstrate that HYBID is up-regulated in OA cartilage , and suggest that tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α-stimulated HYBID plays a role in HA degradation in OA cartilage.
