  The strength of each excitatory synapse in the central nervous system is regulated by its prior activity in a process called synaptic plasticity. The initiation of synaptic plasticity occurs when calcium ions enter the postsynaptic compartment and encounter a subcellular structure called the postsynaptic density ( PSD). The PSD is attached to the postsynaptic membrane just underneath the concentrated plaque of neurotransmitter receptors. It is comprised of a core set of 30-60 proteins , approximately 20 of which are scaffold proteins. The rest include protein kinases and phosphatases , some of which respond to calcium ion; small GTPases and their regulators; chaperones; ubiquitins; and proteases. The assembly of the PSD involves competitive binding among a variety of specific protein binding sites to form a dynamic network. A biochemical challenge for the future is to understand how the dynamic regulation of the structure , composition , and activity of the PSD mediates synaptic plasticity and how mutations in PSD proteins lead to mental and neurodegenerative diseases.
