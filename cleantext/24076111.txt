  None In this cross-sectional study , 80 nurses , auxiliary nurses , and service workers from Imam Khomeini Hospital were enrolled. MRSA , antibiotic susceptibility , and virulence determinants were evaluated. Then , the isolates were subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE) and Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec typing. Our results demonstrated that 23 % of isolates were MRSA. PFGE results demonstrated that pulsotypes A ( 3 out of 30; 10 %) and J ( 3 out of 30; 10 %) , pulsotypes E ( 2 out of 30; 6.7 %) , M ( 2 out of 30; 6.7 %) , P ( 2 out of 30; 6.7 %) , and V ( 2 out of 30; 6.7 %) were the most predominant pulsotypes , respectively. We can not give conclusive suggestions about the correlation between nasal carriage and infections , but we suggest the monitoring of all healthcare workers annually , decontamination of their noses<symptom> by using mupirocin and other antistaphylococcal agents , and also the washing of their hands at least every 2 h.
