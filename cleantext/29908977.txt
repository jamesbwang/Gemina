  To assess perceived challenges to radiology research and publication by female radiologists , as well as possible strategies for overcoming these challenges. An electronic survey was conducted of female nontrainee members of the American Association for Women Radiologists in September and October , 2017. Respondents were recruited by e-mail. Responses were assessed descriptively. The response rate was 31.8 % ( 89/280). 61.4 % of respondents were interested in conducting radiology research. 60.2 % were expected by their departments to pursue research versus 80.7 % expected to pursue educational activities. 56.8 % felt that their research success is valued by their department. 47.7 % felt that they receive appropriate credit for their research from their departments. 22.7 % felt that they receive sufficient time for research. 23.9 % felt that their department makes deliberate efforts to support women 's research efforts. 41.6 % versus 70.8 % ever had a female versus a male research mentor , respectively. Among seven provided options , the three items most commonly selected as being most helpful to enhancing research success were dedicated research time ( 40.4 %) , personal research mentors ( 23.6 %) , and earlier career training in research methodology ( 21.3 %). Additional relevant themes identified by a free-response survey item included: family/child-care issues ( n = 5) , unconscious bias at the departmental/chair level ( n = 5) , exclusion of women from research activities by male researchers ( n = 2) , and concern of being perceived as `` aggressive '' ( n = 2). Initiatives targeting the identified challenges to radiology research could help promote greater diversity and inclusion among radiologist researchers , which in turn has implications for improving the quality of such research.
