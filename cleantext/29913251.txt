  As one of nine piscine viruses recognized by the International Office of Epizootics , spring viraemia of carp virus ( SVCV) is an important pathogen bringing high mortality to cyprinids. Up to now , there is no approved therapy on SVCV , making them strong public health threat in aquaculture. In this study , the anti-SVCV activities of 12 plant crude extracts were investigated by using epithelioma papulosum cyprini ( EPC) cells. Among these plants , Psoralea corylifolia Linn. showed the highest inhibition on SVCV replication , with an inhibitory percentage of 67.98 %. Further studies demonstrated that bavachin ( BVN) , one of the major constituents of Psoralea corylifolia Linn. , was also highly effective to SVCV infection. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC
