The average exposure of antimony decreased with age , there were significant differences in antimonyexposure between the five age groups ( F = 30. 597 , P < 0. 05). There was no significant differences between the same age among male and female ( F = 0. 155 , P > 0. 05). In medium and small-sized cities , the exposure of antimony to juveniles was slightly higher than that of three type village but non-significant ( F = 0. 111 , P > 0. 05) was discovered.
