  Recently with the advancement of solid state lighting and the application thereof to Visible Light Communications ( VLC) , the concept of Visible Light Positioning ( VLP) has been targeted as a very attractive indoor positioning system ( IPS) due to its ubiquity , directionality , spatial reuse , and relatively high modulation bandwidth. IPSs , in general , have four major components: ( 1) a modulation , ( 2) a multiple access scheme , ( 3) a channel measurement , and ( 4) a positioning algorithm. A number of VLP approaches have been proposed in the literature and primarily focus on a fixed combination of these elements and moreover evaluate the quality of the contribution often by accuracy or precision alone. In this article , we provide a novel two-phase indoor positioning algorithmic framework that is able to increase robustness when subject to insufficient anchor luminaries and also incorporate any combination of the four major IPS components.
