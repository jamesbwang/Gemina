  Acalculia is defined as the inability to mentally manipulate numbers for simple calculations. It may occur in dementia , central nervous system ( CNS) neoplasm , and stroke ( Bermejo-Velasco and Castillo-Moreno , 2006). Lesions<symptom> of the left parietal cortex are the principal cause. When acalculia occurs in stroke , it is generally associated with other deficits in speech , sensation , or motor function. We report the case of a 63-year-old male with a 1 day history of isolated acalculia that was found to have a left parietal lobe infarct with several smaller infarcts in the left occipital lobe. The diagnosis of stroke should be considered in all patients experiencing acute difficulty with mathematics , reading , or writing , even in the absence of other deficits.
