  Advances in our understanding of brain mechanisms for the hypoxic ventilatory response , coordinated changes in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and the long-term consequences of chronic intermittent hypoxia as in sleep apnea , such as hypertension and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , are giving impetus to the search for therapies to `` erase '' dysfunctional memories distributed in the carotid bodies and central nervous system. We review current network models , open questions , sex differences , and implications for translational research.
