  The metabolites were detected in feces and urine of rats orally administrated alkaloids of Piper longum<pathogen> by using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer ( HPLC-FT-MS). According to the mass spectrometric data and reported literature , the structures of metabolites were identified. Several metabolites were analyzed and belonged to piperine , piperanine , piperlonguminine , Δα,β-dihydropiperlonguminine and pellitorine , respectively. The metabolites of alkaloids from P. longum<pathogen> alkaloids were produced through Ⅰ phase and Ⅱ phase metabolism reaction , and were excreted with urination and defecation. The approach provided a rapid method for characterizing the metabolites of P. longum<pathogen> alkaloids and gave the truly active structures and the action mechanism of their neuroprotective effects.
