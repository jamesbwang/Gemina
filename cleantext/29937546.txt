  Clean water is vital to sustaining our natural environment , human health , and our economy. As infrastructure continues to deteriorate and water resources become increasingly threatened , new technologies will be needed to ensure safe and sustainable water in the future. Though the US water industry accounts for approximately 1 % gross domestic product and regional `` clusters '' for water technology exist throughout the country , this emerging industry has not been captured by recent studies. As use of the term `` cluster '' becomes more prevalent , regional mapping efforts have revealed international differences in definition yet showcase this industry 's economic impact. In reality , institutional processes may inhibit altering industry coding to better describe water technology. Forgoing the benefits of national economic tracking , alternative data sets are available , which may support new ways of identifying these clusters. This work provides cluster definitions; summarizes current approaches to identifying industry activity using data , interviews , and literature; and sets a foundation for future research.
