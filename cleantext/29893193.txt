  Foam rolling and eccentric exercise interventions have been demonstrated to improve range of motion ( ROM). However , these two modalities have not been directly compared. Twenty-three academy soccer players ( age: 18 ± 1; height: 1.74 ± 0.08 m; body mass: 69.3 ± 7.5 kg) were randomly allocated to either a foam rolling ( FR) or eccentric exercise intervention designed to improve dorsiflexion ROM. Participants performed the intervention daily for a duration of four weeks. Measurements of dorsiflexion ROM , isometric plantar flexion torque and drop jump reactive strength index were taken at baseline ( pre-intervention) and at three subsequent time-points ( 30-min post , 24-hours post and 4-weeks post). A significant time x group interaction effect was observed for dorsiflexion ( P = 0.036) , but not for torque or reactive strength index. For dorsiflexion , there was a significant increase in both acute ( 30-min; P < 0.001) and chronic ( 4-week; P < 0.001) ROM for the eccentric group , whilst FR exhibited only an acute improvement ( P < 0.001). Eccentric training would appear a more efficacious modality than foam rolling for improving dorsiflexion ROM in elite academy soccer players.
