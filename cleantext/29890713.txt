  Even though essential oils ( EOs) have been used for therapeutic purposes , there is now a renewed interest in the antimicrobial properties of phytochemicals and EOs in particular. Their demonstrated low levels of induction of antimicrobial resistance make them interesting for bactericidal applications , though their complex composition makes it necessary to focus on the study of their main components to identify the most effective ones. Herein , the evaluation of the antimicrobial action of different molecules present in EOs against planktonic and biofilm-forming Gram-positive (
