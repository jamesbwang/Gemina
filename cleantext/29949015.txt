  This article evaluates the potential long-term effect of two different color indication methods for self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG) , the color record ( CR) and color display ( CD) , on metabolic parameters in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in a post-intervention period. 101 participants with type 2 diabetes who completed the Color IMPACT study were enrolled in a 2-year comparison follow-up study. Participants continued SMBG with their usual diabetes care. The study outcomes were differences in change in HbA1c levels , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , body<symptom> weight and lipid profiles between the CR and non-CR arms and the CD and non-CD arms during a 1- and 2-year period of the study. 98 participants were analyzed. Reductions in HbA1c levels , systolic BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were maintained in the CR arm by- 0.40 % ( 95 % CI:- 0.73 to- 0.06 , p = 0.020) , -1 3.2 mmHg ( 95 % CI:- 24.1 to- 2.3 , p = 0.019) ,- 11.4 mg/dl ( 95 % CI:- 18.1 to- 4.6 , p = 0.001) , respectively , in a 1-year period. However , HbA1c and BP returned to the baseline levels during an additional 1-year period. In contrast , there were no significant changes in outcome in the CD arm during the study period. Intervention promoting self-action such as the color record method in SMBG sustains a beneficial effect on metabolic parameters after the intervention. This long-term effect is helpful for people with type 2 diabetes to manage their diabetes ABCs ( HbA1c , BP , cholesterol) and to prevent diabetic complications.
