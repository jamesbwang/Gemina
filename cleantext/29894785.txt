  In this work , the hydroxyl-related differences of binding properties and inhibitory activities of dietary flavonoids , namely chrysin , baicalein and apigenin against purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP) were investigated. It was found that the hydroxylation on position C4 ' of chrysin ( → apigenin) mildly decreased the binding affinities for PNP , whereas on the position C6 of chrysin ( → baicalein) significantly increased binding affinities. Comparatively , the hydroxylation on position C4 ' and C6 greatly improved their PNP inhibitory effects. The IC
