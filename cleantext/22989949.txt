  High-frequency unfocused polymer array transducers are developed using an adhesive-free layer-by-layer assembly method. The current paper focuses on experimental and numerical methods for measuring the acoustic performance of these types of array transducers. Two different types of numerical approaches were used to simulate the transducer performance , including a finite element method ( FEM) study of the transducer response done in COMSOL 5.2 a Multiphysics , and modeling of the excited ultrasonic pressure fields using the open source software k-Wave 1.2.1. The experimental characterization also involves two methods ( narrow and broadband pulses) , which are measurements of the acoustic reflections picked up by the transducer elements. Later on , measurements were undertaken of the ultrasonic pressure fields in a water-scanning tank using a hydrophone system. Ultrasonic pressure field measurements were visualized at various distances from the transducer surface and compared with the numerical findings.
