  To examine whether an elevated serum total bilirubin level affects the decline in renal function or new-onset chronic kidney disease ( CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2). This was a longitudinal observational study in patients who presented at the University of Health Sciences Hospital in Kayseri. Five hundred twenty-nine patients with DM2 who had conserved renal function were enrolled ( estimated glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min/1 .73 m The risk of the CKD stage 3 development was highest in G1 who has the lowest serum total bilirubin levels ( G1 vs. G3; hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.02; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.21-3.36; p = 0.007). In addition , G2 had a significant risk of CKD stage 3 development ( G2 vs. G3; hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.58; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.08-2.32; p = 0.018). In the adjusted analysis , compared to G2 and G3 , G1 had the highest risk ( G1 vs. G3; hazard ratio ( HR) , 2.20; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.29-3.77; p = 0.004). Similarly , G2 had a higher risk compared to G3 ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.57; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.05-2.34; p = 0.028). Serum bilirubin may predict the progression of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and preserved kidney function.
