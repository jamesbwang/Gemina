  Sponges are sessile benthic filter-feeding animals , which harbor numerous microorganisms. The enormous diversity and abundance of sponge associated bacteria envisages sponges as hot spots of microbial diversity and dynamics. Many theories were proposed on the ecological implications and mechanism of sponge-microbial association , among these , the biosynthesis of sponge derived bioactive molecules by the symbiotic bacteria is now well-indicated. This phenomenon however , is not exhibited by all marine sponges. Based on the available reports , it has been well established that the sponge associated microbial assemblages keep on changing continuously in response to environmental pressure and/or acquisition of microbes from surrounding seawater or associated macroorganisms. In this review , we have discussed nutritional association of sponges with its symbionts , interaction of sponges with other eukaryotic organisms , dynamics of sponge microbiome and sponge-specific microbial symbionts , sponge-coral association etc..
