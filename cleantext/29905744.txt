  A setup for time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy , based on parametric three-wave mixing in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal , is characterized. Special attention is given to adjusting the phase matching condition by angle tuning of the luminescent light relative to a strong , continuous-wave laser beam within the crystal. The detection system is capable of operating at room temperature and in a wavelength range from 1.55 to 2.20 Âµm. Its sensitivity is compared to a commercial photomultiplier , and its capability of nanosecond time resolution is demonstrated.
