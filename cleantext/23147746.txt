  A common complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , anemia<symptom> can influence glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) levels. In diabetic patients , anemia<symptom> occurs earlier and with higher severity over the course of CKD stages. To elucidate the effect of hemoglobin ( Hb) on the predictive value of HbA1c , we enrolled 1558 diabetic patients with stages 3-4 CKD , categorized according to baseline Hb and HbA1c quartiles. Linear regression revealed that higher HbA1c correlated significantly with higher Hb in the Hb < 10 g/dL group ( β = 0.146 , P = 0.004). A fully-adjusted Cox regression model revealed worse clinical outcomes in patients with higher HbA1c quartiles in the Hb ≥ 10 g/dL group. Hazard ratios for end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) , all-cause mortality , and composite endpoint ( cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality) in patients with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and the highest HbA1c quartile were 1.92 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.17-3.15) , 1.76 ( 95 % CI , 1.02-3.03) , and 1.54 ( 95 % CI , 1.03-2.31) , respectively. By contrast , HbA1c was not associated with clinical outcomes in the Hb < 10 g/dL group. In conclusion , in stages 3-4 diabetic CKD , higher HbA1c is associated with a higher risk of poor clinical outcomes in patients with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL.
