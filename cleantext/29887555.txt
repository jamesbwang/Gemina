  A novel microwave-induced helium plasma optical emission spectrometry ( He-MIP-OES) combined with a thermal hydrolysis sample introduction system was newly established for the determination of fluorine ( F) compounds in slags. The MIP maintained through an Okamoto cavity was adopted , which was quite stable and provided a higher detection capability of F by helium plasma. The basic analytical performance of He-MIP-OES combined with an ultrasonic nebulizer for F analysis was also examined , and expected results could be obtained. The thermal hydrolysis behavior of CaF
