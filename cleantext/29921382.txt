  A two-year-old , female intact , cross-breed dog presented with a two-month history of nasal<symptom> discharge<symptom>. Computed tomography ( CT) demonstrated obliteration of both nasal cavities by soft tissue density , destruction of the nasal and ethmoidal turbinates , and lysis of the frontal and palatine bones and maxilla. Frontal sinuses and maxillary recesses were obscured by soft tissue/fluid density. Histopathological examination of the mass was diagnostic of transmissible venereal tumor. The dog was clinically normal 3 months after treatment initiation with vincristine sulphate and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Six months after the completion of treatment no mass-like lesion<symptom> was demonstrated in CT sections. Nasal cavities , maxillary recesses and frontal sinuses were filled with air. The reticular turbinate nasal plexus appeared atrophic with focal loss of the nasal turbinates on both sides. The ethmoidal turbinates were well-defined; however , focal loss of turbinates was also seen. Lysis of the frontal and palatine bones were still evident.
