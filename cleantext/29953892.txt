  Here , we developed a facile route to synthesize two CDs with the maximum emission locates at 326 nm and 443 nm under 230 nm excitation. The absolute photoluminescence quantum yield ( QY) is as high as 29 % and 52 % for CD-1 and CD-2 with strong blue-green fluorescence , respectively. The functionalized CDs ( CDs-NH
