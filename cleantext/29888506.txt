  The United States has a public health crisis of dental<disease> caries<disease> in children 's primary teeth. Fifty-five percent of children have dental<disease> caries<disease> by age 8. The majority of these children are nonwhite and poor. Caries<disease> could be decreased by 40 % if fluoride varnish ( FV) application started with tooth eruption. A four-month FV application QI project was implemented in a rural pediatric practice. The staff was trained by the Vermont Department of Health using the From the First Tooth protocol. Children aged 9 , 18 , 24 , and 30 months. Pre- and postproject questionnaires were completed. A caries<disease> risk tool assessed a child 's risk and access to dental care. Completed FV applications were recorded and staff interviewed weekly. FV application was offered at well child checks ( WCCs). Fifty-six percent of sample patients received FV at their WCCs. Qualitative themes included the following: reasons subjects did/did not receive FV , ease of FV application , increased oral hygiene education , visit flow , application time , older children 's FV need , and billing issues. This economical , FV application program can be readily implemented by nurse practitioners and nurses in pediatric practices where children have inadequate dental care.
