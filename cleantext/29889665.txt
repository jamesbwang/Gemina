  Research on the genetic basis of tinnitus<symptom> is still in its first steps. A group of scientists dedicated to tinnitus<symptom> genetics within European Tinnitus<symptom> Network ( TINNET) network recognize that further progress requires multicenter collaborative efforts for defining contributing genes. The purpose of the present work is to provide instructions regarding collection , processing , storage , and shipment of samples intended for genetic studies in auditory research. One part of the recommendations has a general character; another part is of particular importance for auditory healthcare practitioners such as otolaryngology physicians , audiologists , and general practitioners. We provide a set of instructions and various options for obtaining samples. We give advice regarding sample processing , storage , and shipment and define the minimal and essential clinical information that should accompany the samples collected for genetic processing. These recommendations offer a basis to standardize and optimize collaborations between geneticists and healthcare practitioners specialized in tinnitus<symptom> and hearing disorders.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
