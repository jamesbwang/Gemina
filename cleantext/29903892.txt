  Congenital hemangiomas are tumor-like vascular malformations with poorly understood pathogenesis. We report the case of a neonate with a massive congenital scalp hemangioma that required urgent neurosurgical removal on the second day of life due to concern for high-flow arteriovenous shunting. Exome sequencing identified a rare damaging de novo germline mutation in MYH9 ( c. 5308C > T , p. ( Arg1770Cys)) , encoding the MYH9 non-muscle myosin IIA. MYH9 has a probability of loss-of-function intolerance ( pLI) score > 0.99 and is highly intolerant to missense variation ( z score = 5.59). The p. ( Arg1770Cys) mutation substitutes an evolutionarily conserved amino acid in the protein 's critical myosin tail domain , and is predicted to be highly deleterious by SIFT , PolyPhen2 , MetaSVM , and CADD. MYH9 is a known regulator of cytokinesis , VEGF-regulated angiogenesis , and p53-dependent tumorigenesis. These findings reveal a novel association of germline de novo MYH9 mutation with congenital hemangioma.
