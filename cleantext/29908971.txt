  Subjects ' early life events will affect them later in life. When these events are stressful , such as child abuse in humans or repeated maternal separation in rodents , subjects can show some behavioral and brain alterations. This study used young adult female Wistar rats that were maternally raised ( AFR) , maternally separated from post-natal day ( PND) 1 to PND10 ( MS10) , or maternally separated from PND1 to PND21 ( MS21) , in order to assess the effects of maternal separation ( MS) on spatial learning and memory , as well as cognitive flexibility , using the Morris Water Maze ( MWM). We performed quantitative cytochrome oxidase ( COx) histochemistry on selected brain areas in order to identify whether maternal separation affects brain energy metabolism. We also performed c-Fos immunohistochemistry on the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) , thalamus , and hippocampus to explore whether this immediate early gene activity was altered in stressed subjects. We obtained a similar spatial learning pattern in maternally raised and maternally separated subjects on the reference memory task , but only the controls were flexible enough to solve the reversal learning successfully. Separated groups showed less c-Fos activity in the mPFC and less complex neural networks on COx.
