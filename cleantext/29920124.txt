  Scientific studies on cardiovascular disease ( CVD) burden and risk factors are predominantly based on short-term risk in Westerner populations , and such information may not be applicable to Asian populations , especially over the longer term. This review aims to estimate the long-term ( > 10 years) CVD burden , including coronary heart disease ( CHD) and stroke , as well as associated risk factors in Asian populations. PubMed , Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched , and hits screened on: Asian adults , free of CVD at baseline; cohort study design ( follow-up > 10 years). Primary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal CVD events. Pooled estimates and between-study heterogeneity were calculated using random effects models , Q and I Overall , 32 studies were eligible for inclusion ( follow-up: 11-29 years). The average long-term rate of fatal CVD is 3.68 per 1000 person-years ( 95 % CI 2.84-4.53) , the long-term cumulative risk 6.35 % ( 95 % CI 4.69 % -8.01 % , mean 20.13 years) and the cumulative fatal stroke/CHD risk ratio 1.5:1. Important risk factors for long-term fatal CVD ( RR , 95 % CI) were male gender ( 1.49 , 1.36-1.64) , age over 60/65 years ( 7.55 , 5.59-10.19) and current smoking ( 1.68 , 1.26-2.24). High non-HDL-c , and β- and γ-tocopherol serum were associated only with CHD ( HR 2.46 ( 95 % CI 1.29-4.71) and 2.47 ( 1.10-5.61) respectively) , while stage 1 and 2 hypertensions were associated only with fatal stroke ( 2.02 ( 1.19-3.44) and 2.89 ( 1.68-4.96) respectively). Over a 10 year + follow-up period Asian subjects had a higher risk of stroke than CHD. Contrary to CVD prevention in Western countries , strategies should also consider stroke instead of CHD only.
