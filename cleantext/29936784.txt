  Background: We conducted this study to contribute to resolving some controversial issues on management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: Thirty-two patients with stage III-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included in this retrospective study. All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed the survival outcome , prognostic factors for survival , and toxicity outcome. Results: The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.9 % and 82.6 %. The 2- and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 83.2 % and 79.4 %. The 2- and 5-year loco-regional recurrence-free survival rates were 83.3 % and 79.5 %. Addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy did not improve survival outcomes. The survival benefit of intensity-modulated radiotherapy over 3D conformal radiotherapy was not clear. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy significantly decreased the development of late toxicities compared with 3D conformal radiotherapy. Total RT dose was prognostic factor for overall , loco-regional recurrence-free , and distant metastasis-free survival. Temporary RT interruption was prognostic factor for overall survival. Daily RT dose was prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival. Conclusions: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in high survival rates with an acceptable level of toxicities in patients with loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To confirm the results of this study , well-designed randomized prospective trials are warranted.
