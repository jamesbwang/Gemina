  A selective aziridinium ring-opening was used to etherify an α-aryl-β-amino alcohol with stereochemical retention. This transformation was achieved in a biphasic system to address phenoxide solubility and the formation of a sulfonate ester impurity. The protecting group strategy was directed by a stability study of the activated α-aryl-β-amino alcohol in this system. Process analytical techniques were used to establish reaction understanding , and mixing on large scale was modeled in silico. The process provided a selective and efficient method of preparing the nonsteroidal , inhaled selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator AZD7594.
