  The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the current evidence in order to assess the efficacy of single puncture arthrocentesis vs standard double needle arthrocentesis in the management of temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) disorders. An electronic search of the PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane CENTRAL and Google Scholar databases was performed to identify English studies published up until October 2017. Eligible studies were selected based on inclusion criteria and included randomised controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing single puncture arthrocentesis and standard double needle arthrocentesis for the management TMJ disorders. The initial screening identified 984 records , of which only 5 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity was found in the 5 studies with each reporting different sample selection and arthrocentesis protocol. All 5 studies reported no difference in reduction in pain intensity and improvement in maximal mouth<symptom> opening between the single puncture technique and standard double needle technique. This review provides some evidence that single puncture arthrocentesis is clinically as efficacious as standard double needle arthrocentesis. There is a need of well-designed RCT with standard protocol of arthrocentesis comparing different single puncture techniques and standard double needle technique for the management of TMJ disorders.
