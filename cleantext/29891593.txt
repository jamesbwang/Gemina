  Guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes include aggressive LDL lowering , but benefits are attenuated compared to those in patients without diabetes. Consistent with this , we have reported in mice that hyperglycemia impaired atherosclerosis regression. Aldose reductase ( AR) is thought to contribute to clinical complications of diabetes by directing glucose into pathways producing inflammatory metabolites. Mice have low levels of AR , thus , raising them to human levels would be a more clinically relevant model to study changes in diabetes under atherosclerosis regression conditions.
