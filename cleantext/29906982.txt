  We consider the evolution of the 2-soliton ( breather) of the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation on a semi-infinite line with the zero boundary condition and a linear potential , which corresponds to the gravity field in the presence of a hard floor. This setting can be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates , and in a nonlinear planar waveguide in optics. In the absence of the gravity , repulsion of the breather from the floor leads to its splitting into constituent fundamental solitons , if the initial distance from the floor is smaller than a critical value; otherwise , the moving breather persists. In the presence of gravity , the breather always splits into a pair of `` co-hopping '' fundamental solitons , which may be frequency locked in the form of a quasi-breather , or unlocked , forming an incoherent pseudo-breather. Some essential results are obtained in an analytical form , in addition to the systematic numerical investigation.
