  The aim of the present study was to look at longitudinal changes in children 's self-concept , body-esteem , and eating attitudes before and 4 years after maternal RYGB surgery. Sixty-nine women and 81 appurtenant children were recruited from RYGB waiting lists at 5 hospitals in Sweden. Families were visited at home pre-surgery , 9 months , and 4 years post-maternal RYGB to measure BMI. Furthermore , all participating family members completed questionnaires. Mothers ' questionnaires measured eating behavior , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and sleep quality , and children 's questionnaires measured body-esteem , self-concept , and eating attitudes. Thirty-five/sixty-nine mothers and 43/81 children participated in all 3 measurements. Mothers reduced their BMI from pre-surgery ( 39.2) to 9 months ( 27.0) and 4 years post-surgery ( 27.4). Children 's prevalence of overweight/obesity was lower 9 months post-surgery ( 48.8 %) but at the same levels again 4 years post-surgery ( 58.1 %) , compared to pre-surgery ( 58.1 %). The same rebound pattern was seen among children 's eating attitudes , mothers ' symptoms of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , and sleep quality. We found no correlations between mothers ' BMI or eating behavior and children 's BMI or eating behavior. Children 's prevalence of overweight/obesity and eating attitudes improves soon after their mothers ' RYGB , but then return to pre-surgery levels at 4 years post-surgery , as do mothers ' sleep quality and symptoms of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , even though their weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was maintained.
