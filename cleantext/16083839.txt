  Repair of blepharoptosis from the posterior eyelid approach has usually been done utilizing a Müller 's muscle-conjuctival resection ( MMCR) or an `` open sky '' technique. We present a new technique to advance the levator muscle from the posterior-approach in a closed fashion that can be used in patients with severe involutional ptosis<symptom>. A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients with severe involutional blepharoptosis during a 6-year period treated by a single surgeon with a Closed Posterior Levator Advancement. The inclusion criteria were good levator function ( ≥ 10 mm) , graded response to phenylephrine ( change in lid height , 0-5 mm) , and no concomitant procedures. Severe involutional blepharoptosis was defined as a margin-to-reflex-distance-1 ( MRD1) of ≤ 1.5 mm. Follow-up for all patients was a minimum of 9 months. The main outcome variables were MRD1 , upper eyelid contour , intereye symmetry , and reoperation rates. Three hundred three eyes from 192 patients , with severe ptosis<symptom> were identified. The average age was 65 years , and the mean preoperative MRD1 was 0.3 mm. Postoperatively , mean MRD1 was 3.5 mm with a median improvement of 3.2 mm. The upper eyelid contour was deemed to be satisfactory by patient and surgeon in 98.3 % of eyes. Intereye symmetry was excellent in 96 % of our cohort. An overall revision rate of 1.8 % was found. We present a new technique that involves an advancement of the levator muscle in a closed posterior eyelid approach. The technique has produced satisfactory outcomes in our cohort of patients with severe ptosis<symptom> with a low revision rate.
