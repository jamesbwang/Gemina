  One of the major challenges of agriculture currently is to obtain higher crop yield. Environmental conditions , cultivar quality , and plant diseases greatly affect plant productivity. On the other hand , several endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> species have emerged as a complementary , efficient , and safe alternative to current crop management practices. The ability of Bacillus<pathogen> species to form spores , which resist adverse conditions , is an advantage of the genus for use in formulations. Endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> species provide plants with a wide range of benefits , including protection against phytopathogenic microorganisms , insects , and nematodes , eliciting resistance , and promoting plant growth , without causing damage to the environment. Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> , B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , B. amyloliquefaciens , B. velezensis , B.<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> , B.<pathogen> pumilus<pathogen> , and B.<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> are the most studied Bacillus<pathogen> species for application in agriculture , although other species within the genus have also shown great potential. Due to the increasing number of whole-genome sequenced endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> spp. strains , various bioactive compounds have been predicted. These data reveal endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> species as an underexploited source of novel molecules of biotechnological interest. In this review , we discuss how endophytic Bacillus<pathogen> species are a valuable multifunctional toolbox to be integrated with crop management practices for achieving higher crop yield.
