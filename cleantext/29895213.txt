  Surgical consent is one of the pillars of ethical conduct in Western world surgical practice. Recent studies have described the consenting processes for clinical trials in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) , but only a few have explored its practice before surgical procedures. The recent World Medical Association ( WMA) Declaration of Lisbon recommends autonomy and independent decision-making. However , informed consent is influenced by cultural background , family structure , socioeconomic status , religion and education. The authors of the paper support the WMA recommendations , but agree the process for obtaining informed consent should be reviewed and developed to integrate in a culturally appropriate manner. This commentary reports the author 's personal experience of surgical consent in Burundi and reviews the literature describing its practice and the specific challenges faced in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its aim is to encourage a debate among surgeons as to how surgical consent can be undertaken in different scenarios of LMICs.
