  Foreign body ingestion is a common event; in the adult population , most ingestions occur in patients with mental disability , psychiatric disorders , alcohol intoxication or in prisoners seeking secondary gain. Removal through flexible endoscopy is generally the first-line approach but rescue oesophagotomy may be necessary for foreign bodies impacted in the upper oesophagus. A 27-year-old man was admitted in the emergency room after intentional ingestion of a wooden spherical object with a central hole. A total body CT scan showed that the object was completely obstructing the upper oesophageal lumen but there were no signs of perforation. In the operating room , a Weerda diverticuloscope and a 5 mm 0 Â° telescope were used to visualise the foreign body under general anaesthesia. A standard endoscopic biopsy forceps was passed through the hole of the sphere and was retracted with the jaws open allowing transoral extraction without complications.
