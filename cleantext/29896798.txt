  Acute kidney injury is commonly seen after liver transplantation. The optimal perioperative target mean arterial pressure ( MAP) for renal filtration , perfusion and oxygenation in liver recipients is not known. The effects of norepinephrine-induced changes in MAP on renal blood flow ( RBF) , oxygen delivery ( RDO Ten patients with an intra- and post-operative vasopressor-dependent systemic vasodilation were studied early after liver transplantation during sedation and mechanical ventilation. To achieve target MAP levels of 60 , 75 and 90 mm Hg , the norepinephrine infusion rate was randomly and sequentially titrated. At each target MAP , data on cardiac index ( CI) , RBF and GFR were obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution ( PiCCO) , the renal vein thermodilution technique and renal extraction of chromium ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid ( At a target MAP of 75 mm Hg , CI ( 13 %) , RBF ( 18 %) , RDO In patients undergoing liver transplantation , RBF and GFR are pressure-dependent at MAP levels below 75 mm Hg. Our results suggest that MAP should probably be targeted to approximately 75 mm Hg for optimal perioperative renal filtration , perfusion and oxygenation in patients undergoing liver transplantation.
