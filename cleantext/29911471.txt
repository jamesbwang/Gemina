  Alemtuzumab is a highly effective treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS) but requires ongoing pathology monitoring for autoimmune adverse effects. The Alemtuzumab in MS Safety Systems ( AMS3) study evaluated the implementation of an automated pathology-monitoring system. To develop an efficient automated clinical decision support system ( CDSS) to electronically prompt and track pathology collection and to provide prescribers and patients with customised alerts of abnormal results for identified risks. A total of 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS treated with alemtuzumab were enrolled to test the system. Standard care laboratory monitoring was performed and compared to the performance of the CDSS. The automated CDSS , an integrated patient smartphone application and an additional pre-screening tool were all successfully developed. Compliance with pathology monitoring was 96.7 %. The automated analysis of pathology results was significantly faster than standard care neurologist review ( p < 0.001). The system correctly identified and alerted abnormalities , including one case of immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) while the treating neurologist was on leave , enabling prompt treatment of serious adverse events. During the course of the study , the CDSS was deployed throughout Australia. We successfully developed automated pathology monitoring with a CDSS , demonstrating real-world benefits of high compliance and timely alerting of important results.
