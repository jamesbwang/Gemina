  Current algorithms for automated computer interpretation of optical coherence tomography ( OCT) imaging of patients suffering from neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) mostly rely on fluid detection. However , fluid detection itself and correct interpretation of the fluid currently limits diagnostic accuracy. We therefore performed a detailed analysis of the requirements that would have to be met for fluid detection approaches. We further investigated if monitoring retinal volume would be a viable alternative to detect disease activity. Retrospective analysis and manual grading of 764 OCT volume scans of 44 patients with exudative AMD treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at a pro-re-nata ( PRN) treatment regimen for at least 24 months. Detection of subretinal fluid ( SRF) or intraretinal fluid ( IRF) alone is not sufficient for disease detection. A combination of SRF and IRF can detect disease activity with a sensitivity of 98.6 % and a specificity of 82 %. With further characterization of IRF into exudative and degenerative cysts<symptom> , specificity can be increased to 100 %. However , correct characterization is currently not achieved by published fluid detection approaches. Change of macular retinal volume ( MRV) can depict disease activity with sensitivity of 88.4 % and specificity of 89.6 %. Combination with the detection of SRF can further improve diagnostic accuracy to a specificity of 93.3 % and sensitivity of 93.9 % without relying on IRF or IRF characterization. Fluid detection without further characterization is not sufficient for AMD monitoring. Either further distinction between exudative and degenerative cysts<symptom> is necessary , or other activity markers have to be taken into account. MRV offers good potential to fill this diagnostic gap and might become an important monitoring marker.
