  Mesaconate , a branched unsaturated dicarboxylic acid , has drawn great interest because of its versatile applications. In this work , we optimized the fermentation efficiency of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> to produce mesaconate from glucose. We first drove the carbon flux to 2-ketoglutarate by overexpressing genes involved in TCA precursor pathway and anaplerotic pathways. Then , to increase the pool of phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP) , an upstream precursor for 2-ketoglutarate , the phosphotransferase system ( PTS) of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> was inactivated by deleting glucose PTS permease and the import of glucose was altered by overexpressing galactose/H
