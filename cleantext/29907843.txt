  Obesity is related to a myriad of cardiometabolic outcomes , each of which may have a specific metabolomic signature and a genetic basis. We identified plasma metabolites associating with different cardiometabolic risk factors ( adiposity , cholesterol , insulin resistance , and inflammation<symptom>) in monozygotic ( MZ) twins. Additionally , we assessed if metabolite profiling can identify subgroups differing by cardiometabolic risk factors. We quantified 111 plasma metabolites ( Acquity UPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry) , and measured blood lipids , HOMA index , CRP , and adiposity ( BMI , % bodyfat by DEXA , fat distribution by MRI) in 40 MZ twin pairs ( mean BMI 27.9 kg/m We identified 42 metabolite-phenotype associations ( FDR < 0.05) , 19 remained significant after controlling for shared factors within the twin pairs. Aspartate , propionylcarnitine , tyrosine hexanoylcarnitine , and deoxycytidine associated positively with two or more adiposity measures. HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C) associated negatively and BMI positively with the most numbers of metabolites; 12 were unique for HDL-C and 3 for BMI. Metabolites associating with HDL-C had the strongest effect size. Metabolite profiling revealed two distinct subgroups of individuals , differing by 32 metabolites ( p < 0.05) , and by total and LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C). Forty-two metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with total cholesterol and 45 metabolites predicted subgroup membership in correlation with LDL-C. Different fat depots share metabolites associating with general adiposity. BMI and HDL-C associated with the most pronounced and specific metabolomic signature. Metabolomics profiling can be used to identify distinct subgroups of individuals that differ by cholesterol measures. Most of the observed metabolite-phenotype associations are free of confounding by genetics and environmental factors shared by the co-twins.
