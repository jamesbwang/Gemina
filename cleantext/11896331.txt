  Anti-D alloimmunization can occur when platelets from RhD-positive donors are transfused to RhD-negative patients , due to red blood cell residues in the platelet concentrates. Our objective was to analyze the anti-D alloimmunization rate in a selected group of women under 55 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia<disease> over an 18-year period. We focused the analysis on RhD-negative patients who received RhD-positive platelet transfusions. From January 1998 to October 2016 , 382 women under 55 years were diagnosed with acute leukemia<disease>. A total of 56 patients were RhD-negative , and 48 ( 85.7 %) received RhD-positive platelets. The median number of platelet concentrates transfused per patient was 23 , and 48 % of all platelet transfusions were RhD-positive. The 48 RhD-negative patients received a total of 949 RhD-positive platelet concentrates. Two patients developed anti-D: a 36-year-old woman with M3 acute myeloblastic leukemia<disease> and a 52-year-old patient with a secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia<disease>. We conclude that there is a need for agreement in the transfusion guidelines on the recommendation of anti-D alloimmunization prophylaxis. We suggest a possible benefit in favor of anti-D prophylaxis in childbearing women with acute
