  Haemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of acute ischaemic stroke ( AIS). We sought to determine the predictors and clinical impact of intracranial haemorrhage ( ICH) after revascularisation therapy. We conducted a retrospective , single-centre study including 235 patients with AIS who underwent intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( IV-rtPA) therapy and/or endovascular treatment. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine the variables associated with ICH , parenchymal haematomas ( PH) , modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) scores , and mortality. ICH was detected in 57 ( 30 with PH) of 183 patients included. Mechanical thrombectomy , either alone ( OR 3.3 ( 1.42-7.63) , P = .005) or in combination with IV-rtPA ( OR 3.39 ( 1,52-7.56) , P = .003) , was associated with higher risk of ICH , while higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT scores ( OR 0.71 ( 0.55-0.91) , P = .007) were associated with lower risk. Patients with older age ( OR 1.07 ( 1.02-1.13) , P = .006) and occlusion of the terminal branch of the internal carotid artery ( OR 4.03 ( 1.35-11.99) , P = .012) had a higher risk of PH , while the use of IV-rtPA alone ( OR 0.24 ( 0.08-0.68) , P = .008) was associated with lower risk of PH. Only PH was associated with disability as measured by the mRS ( OR 3.2 ( 1.17-8.76) , P = .02) and higher mortality ( OR 5.06 ( 1.65-15.5) , P = .005). Greater understanding about the predictors of ICH , mRS scores , and mortality could enable better selection of patients and treatments.
