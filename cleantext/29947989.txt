  Although organ-preserving operations are regarded as effective strategies for duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs) , laparoscopic partial sleeve duodenectomy ( lap PSD) has not been fully evaluated. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness and technical feasibility of lap PSD. Between January 2011 and March 2016 , we reviewed 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic approach among 22 patients who underwent PSD. PSD for the infra-ampullary lesions<symptom> was defined as infra-ampullary duodenal resection including the first portion of the jejunum<symptom>. After resection , all patients underwent reconstruction via side-to-side duodenojejunostomy. The total mean operation time was 273 min ( range 160-346 min) , and estimated mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 80 ml ( range scanty-200 ml). One patient was converted to open laparotomy because of mesocolonic tumor involvement. The median postoperative hospital stay was 10.5 days ( range 4-36 days). There were no postoperative mortalities. Postoperative complications included 2 instances of delayed gastric emptying ( DGE) , 1 duodenojejunostomy stricture , and 2 intestinal obstructions. No patient was treated with adjuvant therapy. One patient experienced hepatic metastasis 28 months after surgery during a mean follow-up period of 48.6 months. Lap PSD might be an oncologically effective strategy for duodenal GIST , and the laparoscopic approach is a technically feasible and appealing surgical modality in terms of safety and perioperative results. However , DGE and anastomosis strictures are concerns for postoperative complications , which need to be further investigated.
