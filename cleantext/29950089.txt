  The development of methods to synthesize and physically manipulate extremely thin , single-crystalline inorganic semiconductor materials , so-called nanomembranes , has led to an almost explosive growth of research worldwide into uniquely enabled opportunities for their use in new `` soft '' and other unconventional form factors for high-performance electronics. The unique properties that nanomembranes afford , such as their flexibility and lightweight characteristics , allow them to be integrated into electronic and optoelectronic devices that , in turn , adopt these unique attributes. For example , nanomembrane devices are able to make conformal contact to curvilinear surfaces and manipulate strain to induce the self-assembly of various 3D nano/micro device architectures. Further , thin semiconductor materials ( e.g. , Si-nanomembranes , transition metal dichalcogenides , and phosphorene) are subject to the impacts of quantum and other size-dependent effects that in turn enable the manipulation of their bandgaps and the properties of electronic and optoelectronic devices fabricated from them. In this Perspective , nanomembrane synthesis techniques and exemplary applications of their use are examined. We specifically describe nanomembrane chemistry exploiting high-performance materials , along with precise/high-throughput techniques for their manipulation that exemplify their growing capacities to shape outcomes in technology. Prominent challenges in the chemistry of these materials are presented along with future directions that might guide the development of next generation nanomembrane-based devices.
