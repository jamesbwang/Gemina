  The age-adjusted mortality rate due to gastric cancer was reported to increase with age. This study aims to investigate the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients aged 65 years or older comparing with younger patients and focusing on its impact on survival. A total of 406 patients with nonmetastatic gastric cancer that consisted of 283 patients younger than 65 years ( range: 23-64 years) and 123 patients 65 years of age or older ( range: 65-75 years) were retrospectively evaluated. Categorical and continuous variables were summarized using the descriptive statistics and compared with Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U-tests , respectively. Cancer-specific survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years ( range: 23-75 years). There was no significant difference in gender , tumor localization in the stomach ( cardia/noncardia) , tumor histology , perineural invasion , lymphovascular invasion , histopathological characteristics of the tumor , and tumor stage between groups. No significant difference was detected in survival between groups. The median survivals were 20.8 months ( range: 17-24.6) in patients younger than 65 years and 19.5 months ( range: 14.8-24.1) in patients 65 years of age or older ( P = 0.9). We showed that adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients with gastric cancer has same effectiveness as nonelderly patients. However , further well-designated prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
