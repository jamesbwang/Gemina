  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. PD can result from a mutation of alpha-synuclein ( α-SNCA) , such as α-SNCA A53T. Using episomal vectors , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) were generated from skin fibroblasts with the α-SNCA A53T mutation. A huge bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC) harboring the normal α-SNCA gene successfully corrected the α-SNCA A53T-mutant iPSCs. Melting curve analysis for allelic composition indicated that the BAC DNA was precisely targeted to the α-SNCA A53T mutation allele , without random integration. The corrected PD-iPSCs displayed the normal karyotype and pluripotency , with the capability to differentiate to any cell type.
