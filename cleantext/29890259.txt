  The aim of this work was to investigate the correlation of permeation behavior of transdermal formulations through a novel synthetic membrane ( Strat-M ® EMD Millipore , MA) and human cadaver skin. Strat-M ® membranes<symptom> were designed with the intent to share similar structural and chemical characteristics found in the human skin however , omitting any biological behavior due to the absence of viable cells. Both human skin and the membrane display a layered structure with a very tight top layer. Additionally , the Strat-M ® membrane contains a combination of lipids in a specific ratio similar to what is found in the human stratum corneum ( SC). Formulations containing nicotine and a chemical penetration enhancer ( CPE) were used for evaluating drug penetration to understand how each enhancer impacts the permeability of nicotine as a model compound. The permeability measurements of human cadaver skin and Strat-M ® membrane were performed with Franz diffusion cell methods accompanied by HPLC analysis. A good correlation of the permeability data was obtained through human cadaver skin and Strat-M ® membrane. Thus , Strat-M ® has the potential to be used as a screening tool for evaluating topical/transdermal formulations through the human cadaver skin.
