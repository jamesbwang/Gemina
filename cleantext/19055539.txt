  Cumulative evidence indicates an association between maternal overweight and gestational diabetes with delayed breastfeeding initiation; however , the presence of both conditions simultaneously has been little explored. This study aims to investigate the interaction between maternal overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes on breastfeeding initiation. This study comprises data from the IVAPSA Birth Cohort , a prospective follow-up of mothers and their newborns. Two of the five groups from IVAPSA were evaluated , considering women with and without gestational diabetes. These women were further categorized according to their pre-pregnancy body mass index as normal weight or overweight/obese. 219 women were evaluated , 53.4 % of them had pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and 32 % had gestational diabetes. Most women were able to initiate breastfeeding within 12 hours from delivery ( 92.7 %) and only eight ( 3.7 %) women had not breastfed in the first 24 hours postpartum. Of these , seven were overweight/obese ( 77.8 %) and five had gestational diabetes ( 66.7 %) , with four of them having overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes concomitantly. Women with both adverse conditions had an adjusted relative risk of delayed breastfeeding initiation of 1.072 ( 95 % CI 1.006; 1.141) , p = 0.032. The results indicate an additive interaction between maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes on delayed breastfeeding initiation.
