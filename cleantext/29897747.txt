  The risk of accidental oil spills in the Arctic is on the rise due to increased shipping and oil exploration activities , making it essential to calibrate parameters for risk assessment of oil spills to Arctic conditions. The toxicokinetics of crude oil components were assessed by exposing one lipid-poor ( CIII) and one lipid-rich ( CV) stage of the Arctic copepod Calanus hyperboreus to crude oil WSF ( water-soluble fraction). Water concentrations and total body residues ( BR) , as well as lipid volume fractions , were measured at regular intervals during exposure and recovery. Bioconcentration factors ( BCFs) and elimination rates ( k
