  The social networks of people who inject drugs ( PWID) have long been studied to understand disease transmission dynamics and social influences on risky practices. We illustrate how PWID can be active agents promoting HIV<pathogen> , HCV , and overdose prevention. We assessed drug users ' connections and interactions with others at risk for HIV/HCV in three cities: New<pathogen> York City ( NYC) , USA ( n = 539); Pereira , Colombia ( n = 50); and St. Petersburg , Russia ( n = 49). In all three cities , the majority of participants ' network members were of a similar age as themselves , yet connections across age groups were also present. In NYC , knowing any opioid user ( s) older than 29 was associated with testing HCV-positive. In NYC and St. Petersburg , a large proportion of PWID engaged in intravention activities to support safer injection and overdose prevention; in Pereira , PWID injected , had sex , and interacted with other key groups at risk. People who use drugs can be active players in HIV/HCV and overdose risk- reduction; their networks provide them with ample opportunities to disseminate harm reduction knowledge , strategies , and norms to others at risk. Local communities could augment prevention programming by empowering drug users to be allies in the fight against HIV<pathogen> and facilitating their pre-existing health-protective actions.
