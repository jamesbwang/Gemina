  Magnetoelectric multiferroic fluids composed of BaTiO3@CoFe2O4 composite nanoparticles dispersed in a highly insulating nonpolar oleic acid/silicone oil mixture have been developed. The effects of the particle volume fraction and a magnetic field , as well as an electric field , on the ferroelectric and magnetic properties , as well as the magnetoelectric coupling effect , have been systematically studied and discussed in this paper. Magnetic characterization shows an approximation to superparamagnetism , and both the remanent magnetization ( Mr) and the coercive field ( Hc) increase with increases in the volume fraction and applied electric field. Similarly , a superparaelectric state has been observed in the multiferroic fluids , in which both the remanent polarization ( Pr) and the coercive field ( Ec) are near zero , whereas they increase with increases in the applied magnetic field and volume fraction. High converse and direct magnetoelectric coupling coefficients are estimated to be αH = 8.16 × 10-4 ( Oe cm) V-1 and αE = 1.58 × 104 V ( cm Oe) -1 , respectively. Further analysis indicates that the composite particles can be aligned under an external magnetic/electric field so that their magnetic/electric moments can be parallel to the external field , which in turn results in changes in the magnetization/polarization directions. These results imply that besides magnetoelectric fluids that consist of core/shell-structured nanoparticles , conventional multiferroic fluids based on composite particles may provide an opportunity to gain electrical control of magnetization and vice versa , which implies potential applications.
