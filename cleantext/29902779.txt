  The present study aimed to analyze the clinicopathologic features and treatment of uSTUMP in a single institution. In addition , we described the obstetric outcomes after uterine-preserving surgery for uSTUMP. A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed with uSTUMP between January 2000 and February 2018 at the Comprehensive Gynecologic Cancer Center , CHA Bundang Medical Center. We obtained data on the patients ' demographics , treatment , therapeutic results , time to recurrence , disease-free and overall survival , and subsequent obstetric outcomes. The central pathology reviews were carried out by two pathologists specializing in gynecologic oncology. A total of 19 patients diagnosed with uSTUMP were identified and included in the study. The mean age at diagnosis was 41 years ( range 28-49 years). Frozen sections were performed in 11 patients including five patients during surgery. Nine of the 19 patients ( 47.4 %) were treated by hysterectomy and 10 patients were initially treated by myomectomy. The mean follow-up period was 47 months ( range 6-209 months). Two patients ( 10.5 %; 2/19) experienced recurrence. Although not defined as recurrence in the present study criteria , one patient had a secondary diagnosis of atypical leiomyoma one year after the initial diagnosis of uSTUMP. Seven patients requested uterine-preserving treatment , five of whom wanted to become pregnant. Three of them ( 3/5; 60 %) successfully delivered live birth to full term by Cesarean section without complications such as abortion<disease> , preterm delivery or uterine rupture , and tumor recurrence. The present study describes the clinicopathologic data of uSTUMP patients. Our results suggest a uSTUMP recurrence of 10.5 % , comparable to previous reports. Although there is a possibility of malignant recurrence , fertility-preserving management is worth attempting because of relatively low affected age with careful close follow-up.
