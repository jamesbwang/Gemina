  The treatment of advanced-stage Kienb√∂ck disease ( KD) remains highly controversial. Particularly important is stage IIIC KD , which includes patients with a lunate coronal fracture. The purpose of this paper was to describe a new approach to KD in patients with Lichtman stage IIIC KD , and our results using it. The procedure combines a dorsolateral biplane closing radial osteotomy and lunate fixation. A total of 11 patients from January 2002 through December 2016 with documented KD who underwent this technique were included. The patients were assessed before surgery , then postoperatively at 1 and 10 days , 3 and 6 weeks , 3 and 6 months , and annually. Wrist range of motion , grip and pinch strength , the Quick Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand ( QuickDASH) score , a Modified Mayo Wrist Score ( MMWS) , 10-point visual analog scale , radiologic measurements , and data related to consolidation were collected. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package SPSS. Some degree of pain relief , improvements in the QuickDASH score , MMWS score , grip strength , and the degrees of flexion and extension were observed , the results being statistically significant ( P < 0.05). After surgery , the values for radial and sagittal tilt were statistically different than those measured before surgery. Carpal collapse was not evident either before or after surgery. In conclusion , combining a dorsolateral radial osteotomy and a lunate compression screw may expand the options for patients with Lichtman stage IIIC KD. Our experience indicates that it is a viable option in challenging clinical scenarios.
