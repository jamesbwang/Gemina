  To compare the dynamic insulin secretion and sensitivity test ( DISST) with the euglycaemic clamp in individuals undergoing open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) surgery prior-to and one month after surgery. Insulin sensitivity in individuals with obesity undergoing RYGB was studied with DISST and a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Eleven participants , including nine females , mean ( SD) age 51.2 ( 12.1) yrs , with a preoperative BMI of 48.7 ( 9.5) kg/m There was a strong correlation between DISST and the clamp preoperatively and DISST can be used to estimate insulin sensitivity in individuals with morbid obesity. After RYGB surgery , DISST had a weaker correlation with the clamp suggesting the fundamental physiological determinants of insulin sensitivity being measured by each method change in different ways with changes in glucose homeostasis following RYGB surgery.
