  We experimentally probed the stress relaxation of a monolayer of iron oxide nanoparticles at the water-air interface. Upon drop-casting onto a water surface , the nanoparticles self-assembled into islands of two-dimensional hexagonally close packed crystalline domains surrounded by large voids. When compressed laterally , the voids gradually disappeared as the surface pressure increased. After the compression was stopped , the surface pressure ( as measured by a Wilhelmy plate) evolved as a function of the film aging time with three distinct timescales. These aging dynamics were intrinsic to the stressed state built up during the non-equilibrium compression of the film. Utilizing x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy , we measured the characteristic relaxation time ( τ) of in-plane nanoparticle motion as a function of the aging time through both second-order and two-time autocorrelation analysis. Compressed and stretched exponential fitting of the intermediate scattering function yielded exponents ( β) indicating different relaxation mechanisms of the films under different compression stresses. For a monolayer compressed to a lower surface pressure ( between 20 mN/m and 30 mN/m) , the relaxation time ( τ) decreased continuously as a function of the aging time , as did the fitted exponent , which transitioned from being compressed ( > 1) to stretched ( < 1) , indicating that the monolayer underwent a stress release through crystalline domain reorganization. However , for a monolayer compressed to a higher surface pressure ( around 40 mN/m) , the relaxation time increased continuously and the compressed exponent varied very little from a value of 1.6 , suggesting that the system may have been highly stressed and jammed. Despite the interesting stress relaxation signatures seen in these samples , the structural ordering of the monolayer remained the same over the sample lifetime , as revealed by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction.
