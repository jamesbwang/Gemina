  Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE) is a secreted apolipoprotein with three isoforms , E2 , E3 , and E4 , that binds to lipids and facilitates their transport in the extracellular environment of the brain and the periphery. The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and studies of human brain and mouse models have revealed that the E4 significantly exacerbates the deposition of amyloid-beta ( Aβ). It has been suggested that this deposition could be attributed to the formation of soluble ApoE isoform-specific ApoE-Aβ complexes. However , previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the directionality and strength of those interactions. In this study , using a series of flow cytometry assays that maintain the physiological integrity of ApoE-Aβ complexes , we systematically assessed the association of Aβ with ApoE2 , E3 , or E4. We used ApoE secreted from HEK cells or astrocytes overexpressing ApoE fused with a GFP tag. As a source of soluble Aβ peptide , we used synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 or physiological Aβ secreted from CHO cell lines overexpressing wildtype or V717F variant amyloid precursor protein ( APP). We observed significant interactions between the different ApoE isoforms and Aβ , with E4 interacting with Aβ more strongly than the E2 and E3 isoforms. We also found subtle differences depending on the Aβ type and the ApoE-producing cell type. In conclusion , these results indicate that the strength of the ApoE-Aβ association depends on the source of Aβ or ApoE.
