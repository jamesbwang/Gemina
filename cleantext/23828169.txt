  A fundamental challenge for surface acoustic wave ( SAW) temperature sensors is the detection of small temperature changes on non-planar , often curved , surfaces. In this work , we present a new design methodology for SAW devices based on flexible substrate and bimorph material/structures , which can maximize the temperature coefficient of frequency ( TCF). We performed finite element analysis simulations and obtained theoretical TCF values for SAW sensors made of ZnO thin films ( ~ 5 μm thick) coated aluminum ( Al) foil and Al plate substrates with thicknesses varied from 1 to 1600 μm. Based on the simulation results , SAW devices with selected Al foil or plate thicknesses were fabricated. The experimentally measured TCF values were in excellent agreements with the simulation results. A normalized wavelength parameter ( e.g. , the ratio between wavelength and sample thickness , λ/h) was applied to successfully describe changes in the TCF values , and the TCF readings of the ZnO/Al SAW devices showed dramatic increases when the normalized wavelength λ/h was larger than 1. Using this design approach , we obtained the highest reported TCF value of -760 ppm/K for a SAW device made of ZnO thin film coated on Al foils ( 50 μm thick) , thereby enabling low cost temperature sensor applications to be realized on flexible substrates.
