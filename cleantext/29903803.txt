  Syngeneic , immunocompetent allograft tumor models recapitulate important aspects of the tumor microenvironment and have short tumor latency with predictable growth kinetics , making them useful for trialing novel therapeutics. We describe surgical techniques for orthotopic and heterotopic PDAC tumor implantation and characterize phenotypes based on implantation site. Mice ( n = 8 per group) were implanted with 10 All mice developed pancreatic tumors within 7 days. Orthotopic tumors grew faster and larger than heterotopic tumors. By 3 weeks , orthotopic mice began losing weight , and showed declines in body condition requiring euthanasia starting at 4 weeks. Single cell injection into the pancreas had near 100 % engraftment , but solid tumor implant engraftment was approximately 50 % and was associated with growth restriction. Orthotopic tumors were significantly more responsive to IV FOLFIRINOX compared to heterotopic tumors , with greater reductions in size and increased apoptosis. Heterotopic tumors were more desmoplastic and hypovascular. However , drug uptake into tumor tissue was equivalent regardless of tumor location or degree of fibrosis<disease> , indicating that microenvironment differences between heterotopic and orthotopic tumors influenced response to therapy. Orthotopic and heterotopic allograft locations confer unique microenvironments that influence growth kinetics , desmoplastic response , and angiogenesis. Tumor location influences chemosensitivity to FOLFIRINOX and should inform future preclinical trials.
