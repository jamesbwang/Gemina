  The aims of this study were to determine whether the administration of anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic agents affect the proliferation , viability , and expression of markers involved in the fibrotic development of the fibroblasts obtained from arthrofibrotic tissue Dexamethasone , diclofenac , and decorin , in different concentrations , were employed to treat fibroblasts from arthrofibrotic tissue ( AFib). Cell proliferation was measured by DNA quantitation , and viability was analyzed by Live/Dead staining. The levels of procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide ( PINP) and procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide ( PIIINP) were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) kits. In addition , the expressions of fibrotic markers were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). Fibroblasts isolated from healthy tissue ( Fib) served as control. Further , a rabbit model of joint contracture was used to evaluate the antifibrotic effect of the three different agents. Dexamethasone maintained the viability and promoted the proliferation of AFib. Diclofenac decreased the viability and inhibited the cell proliferation during the first week of cultivation. However , decorin inhibited AFib proliferation and downregulated the expressions of fibrotic markers. Additionally , decorin could improve the flexion contracture angle and inhibit the deposition of interstitial matrix components in the rabbit joint model. Decorin decreased the expression of myofibroblast markers in AFib , inhibited the proliferation of AFib , and prevented the initial procedure of arthrofibrosis
