  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of ischemic postconditioning , atorvastatin and both associated to prevent or minimize reperfusion injury in the lung of rats subjected to ischemia and reperfusion by abdominal aortic clamping. We used 41 Wistar norvegic rats , which were distributed into 5 groups: ischemia and reperfusion ( I/R) , ischemic postcondictioning ( IPC) , postconditioning + atorvastatin ( IPC+A) , atorvastatin ( A) and SHAM. It was performed a medium laparotomy , dissection and isolation of the infra-renal abdominal aorta; except for the SHAM group , all the others were submitted to the aortic clamping for 70 minutes ( ischemia) and posterior clamp removal ( reperfusion , 70 minutes). In the IPC and IPC+A groups , postconditioning was performed between the ischemia and reperfusion phases by four cycles of reperfusion and ischemia lasting 30 seconds each. In the IPC+A and A groups , preceding the surgical procedure , administration of 3.4 mg/day of atorvastatin was performed for seven days by gavage. After the surgical procedure , the right caudal lobe was removed from the lung for histological study , using tissue injury score ranging from grade 1 ( normal tissue) to grade 4 ( intense lesion<symptom>). The mean lung injury was 3.6 in the I/R group , 1.6 in the IPC group , 1.2 in the IPC+A group , 1.2 in the A group , and 1 in the SHAM group ( P < 0.01). Ischemic postconditioning and atorvastatin were able to minimize lung reperfusion injury , alone or in combination.
