  The 22q11 .2 deletion ( 22q11DS) is a common chromosomal microdeletion and a potent risk factor for psychotic illness. Prior studies reported widespread cortical changes in 22q11DS , but were generally underpowered to characterize neuroanatomic abnormalities associated with psychosis in 22q11DS , and/or neuroanatomic effects of variability in deletion size. To address these issues , we developed the ENIGMA ( Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis) 22q11 .2 Working Group , representing the largest analysis of brain structural alterations in 22q11DS to date. The imaging data were collected from 10 centers worldwide , including 474 subjects with 22q11DS ( age = 18.2 ± 8.6; 46.9 % female) and 315 typically developing , matched controls ( age = 18.0 ± 9.2; 45.9 % female). Compared to controls , 22q11DS individuals showed thicker cortical gray matter overall ( left/right hemispheres: Cohen 's d = 0.61/ 0.65) , but focal thickness reduction in temporal and cingulate cortex. Cortical surface area ( SA) , however , showed pervasive reductions in 22q11DS ( left/right hemispheres: d = -1.01/ -1.02). 22q11DS cases vs. controls were classified with 93.8 % accuracy based on these neuroanatomic patterns. Comparison of 22q11DS-psychosis to idiopathic schizophrenia ( ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group) revealed significant convergence of affected brain regions , particularly in fronto-temporal cortex. Finally , cortical SA was significantly greater in 22q11DS cases with smaller 1.5 Mb deletions , relative to those with typical 3 Mb deletions. We found a robust neuroanatomic signature of 22q11DS , and the first evidence that deletion size impacts brain structure. Psychotic illness in this highly penetrant deletion was associated with similar neuroanatomic abnormalities to idiopathic schizophrenia. These consistent cross-site findings highlight the homogeneity of this single genetic etiology , and support the suitability of 22q11DS as a biological model of schizophrenia.
