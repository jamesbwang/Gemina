  Microplastics and antimicrobials are widely spread environmental contaminants and more research on their toxicity is needed. The uptake and effects of the antimicrobial florfenicol , microplastics , and their mixtures on Corbicula fluminea were investigated. Bivalves were exposed for 96h to florfenicol ( 1.8 and 7.1 mg/l) , microplastics ( 0.2 and 0.7 mg/l) , or mixtures of the two substances. After 96h , all bivalves exposed to antimicrobial treatments had florfenicol in their body ( e.g. 2 ± 1μg/g). Microplastics were found in the gut , lumen of the digestive gland , connective tissue , hemolymphatic sinuses , and gills surface of animals. Florfenicol caused a significant inhibition of cholinesterase ( ChE) activity ( ~ 32 %). Animals exposed to 0.2 mg/l of microplastics showed ChE activity inhibition ( 31 %) , and no other significant alterations. Mixtures caused feeding inhibition ( 57-83 %) , significant ChE inhibition ( 44-57 %) and of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity , and increased anti-oxidant enzymes activity and lipid peroxidation levels. Overall , the results indicate that C. fluminea take up florfenicol and microplastics from the water and accumulated or at least retained it in their body for some time; both florfenicol ( low ppm range) and microplastics ( ppb range) were toxic to C. fluminea , with mixtures containing florfenicol and microplastics being more toxic. Thus , the risk of exposure and toxic effects of florfenicol to C. fluminea and other bivalves , and its predators increase in ecosystems contaminated with the antimicrobial and microplastics , as well as to humans consuming contaminated species from these ecosystems.
