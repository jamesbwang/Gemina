  The transdermal route for administration of anticholinergic drugs can provide efficacy with less systemic adverse effects. The transdermal oxybutynin patch ( OXYTDS) offers advantages over oral administration for patients treated for Overactive bladder ( OAB) syndrome<disease>. The limited evidence on the OXY-TDS patch application areas of the skin , makes difficult counseling patients who require a change to skin zones other than those recommended by the manufacturer. The preliminary experience of four patients included in this case report suggests that changing the application area for the OXY-TDS patch outside those skin areas recommended by the manufacturer , seems effective and safe in the treatment of OAB syndrome<disease> , regardless of the characteristics of the patients.
