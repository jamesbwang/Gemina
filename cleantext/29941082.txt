  Naturally evolved peptides , such as the hormone oxytocin or the anti-bacterial vancomycin , have seen decades of success as powerful therapeutics due to many of the favorable properties of peptides. Not every desired target has a naturally occurring bioactive peptide , so rational design and random in vitro evolution techniques have been developed and applied to generate peptide leads de novo. However , can these artificially created peptides be translated into successful therapeutics? Several drug development programs involving de novo-generated peptide ligands have made important progress recently , and we report here on these exciting activities.
