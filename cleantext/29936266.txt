  In the current study , we aimed to examine the function of scutellarin on human osteoblast proliferation and osteogenic function. The results indicated that scutellarin enhanced osteoblast proliferation over a seven day period. This increase in cell proliferation was associated with corresponding increases in osteoblast activity , as measured by alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) secretion , intracellular calcium ion influx , and calcium deposition. These anabolic effects were associated with C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4) mRNA levels and protein induction. Knockdown of CXCR4 reversed the scutellarin-induced increases in cell proliferation , ALP activity , and calcium deposition. Furthermore , scutellarin increased p65 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner , which resulted in the increased binding of phosphorylated p65 to the CXCR4 gene promoter region , to increase CXCR4 protein expression. p65 phosphorylation inhibition resulted in a decrease in CXCR4 protein expression. A p65 inhibitor blocked scutellarin-induced increases in osteoblast proliferation and function. Moreover , in a rat model of estrogen-deficient osteoporosis , scutellarin restored ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Taken together , both cellular and animal models support the novel findings that scutellarin increased osteoblast proliferation and function through NF-ÎºB/p65-mediated CXCR4 induction.
