  The mammalian hippocampus shows marked decline in function with aging across many species , including humans and laboratory rodent models. This decline frequently manifests in memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> that occur even in the absence of dementia pathology. In humans , a number of factors correlate with preserved hippocampal memory in aging , such as exercise , cognitive stimulation and number of social ties. While interventional studies and animal models clearly indicate that exercise and cognitive stimulation lead to hippocampal preservation , there is relatively little research on whether a decline in social ties leads to cognitive decline or vice versa. Even in animal studies of environmental enrichment in aging , the focus typically falls on physical enrichment such as a rotating cast of toys , rather than the role of social interactions. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that a greater number of social ties in aging mice would lead to improved hippocampal function. Aged , female C57/Bl6 mice were housed for 3 months in pairs or large groups ( 7 mice per cage). Group-housed mice showed greater novel object location memory and stronger preference for a spatial navigation strategy in the Barnes maze , though no difference in escape latency , compared to pair-housed mice. Group-housed mice did not differ from pair-housed mice in basal corticosterone levels or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Group-housed mice did , however , show reduced numbers of Iba1/CD68 + microglia in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that group housing led to better memory function and reduced markers of neuroinflammation in aged mice. More broadly , they support a causative link between social ties and hippocampal function , suggesting that merely having a larger social network can positively influence the aging brain. Future research should address the molecular mechanisms by which a greater number of social ties alters hippocampal function.
