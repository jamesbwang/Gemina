  LC-MS was used to detect 41 population of Lonicera japonica<pathogen> from different areas. LC-MS chemical chromatographic profile has been established. There were 23 common peaks , seventeen of which were identified according to reference standard and reference; SPSS software was applied to calculate the similarity of chemical fingerprints of 41 batches and the range was from 0.99 to 0.12. On this basis , the L. japonica<pathogen> 's metabolites consistency was classified. Combined with comprehensive analysis of genetic identity , we can provide a theoretical basis for the authenticity research of Dao-di herbs and reference information for the breeding of excellent L.
