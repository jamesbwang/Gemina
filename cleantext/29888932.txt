  The authors present an approach to the coordination of eye movements<symptom> and locomotion in naturalistic steering tasks. It is based on recent empirical research , in particular , on driver eye movements<symptom> , that poses challenges for existing accounts of how we visually steer a course. They first analyze how the ideas of feedback and feedforward processes and internal models are treated in control theoretical steering models within vision science and engineering , which share an underlying architecture but have historically developed in very separate ways. The authors then show how these traditions can be naturally ( re) integrated with each other and with contemporary neuroscience , to better understand the skill and gaze strategies involved. They then propose a conceptual model that ( a) gives a unified account to the coordination of gaze and steering control , ( b) incorporates higher-level path planning , and ( c) draws on the literature on paired forward and inverse models in predictive control. Although each of these ( a-c) has been considered before ( also in the context of driving) , integrating them into a single framework and the authors ' multiple waypoint identification hypothesis within that framework are novel. The proposed hypothesis is relevant to all forms of visually guided locomotion. ( PsycINFO Database Record
