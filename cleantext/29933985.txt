  Harmful algal blooms ( HABs) has been a serious problem in recent years , because of large quantities of cyanobacterial in eutrophic water. We studied the effects of 3,4-Dihydroxybenzalacetone ( DBL) and other four compounds ( vanillic acid , ferulic acid , 3,5-Dichlorophenol and cupric sulfate) on Microcystis aeruginosa<pathogen>. The results showed that the growth of M. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited by all tested compounds with a half maximal effect concentration ( EC
