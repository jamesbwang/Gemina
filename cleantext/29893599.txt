  The purpose of the research was to investigate the sport-specific performance effect of a brief afternoon nap on high-level Asian adolescent student-athletes that were habitually short sleepers. In the studies , participants were randomly assigned to a nap or non-nap ( reading) condition. In the first study , 12 male shooters ( 13.8 ± 1.0 yrs) performed a shooting assessment ( 20 competition shots) with heart rate variability monitored during the assessment. In the second study , 19 male track & field athletes ( 14.8 ± 1.1 yrs) performed a 20m sprint performance assessment. Subjective measures of sleepiness and alertness were obtained in both studies. The brief nap had no effect on any measure of shooting performance ( p > 0.05) and autonomic function ( p > 0.05) in shooters. However , fastest 20m sprint times increased significantly ( p < 0.05) from 3.385 ± 0.128 sec to 3.411 ± 0.143 sec , with mean 2m times trending towards significance ( p < 0.1) amongst the track & field athletes. No significant differences were observed in any other measures. The results of the research indicate varying effects of naps between sport-specific performance measures. Napping had no effect on shooting performance while a negative effect existed in 20-m sprint performance , potentially due to sleep inertia. Considering these findings , some caution is warranted when advocating naps for adolescent athletes.
