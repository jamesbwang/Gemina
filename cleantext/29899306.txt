  In the present work , the wettability of defective graphene oxide ( GO) film is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. A water droplet is deposited on the surface of a graphene oxide membrane , and the contact angle is measured by fitting the liquid ‚Åª vapor interface. Although pristine graphene has few hydrophobic properties with a contact angle of 95 & deg; , graphene oxide presents more hydrophilic properties , due to the stronger hydrogen bonds interactions at the interface. Moreover , the introduction of vacancy defects at the graphene oxide surface decreases the wettability of graphene oxide. We find that the contact angle of graphene oxide increases from 70 & deg; to 82 & deg; , with a defective concentration from 0 % to 10 %. Our results will help provide a new method for controlling the wetting properties of GO and its additional capabilities in device design for applications.
