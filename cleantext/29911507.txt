  Women from different backgrounds and cultures are at risk of domestic violence. Disclosing the abusive experience and seeking help is not straightforward and easy and might be a complicated and long-term process. Muslim women , like other groups of women , may face various barriers to disclose abusive relationships and for seeking help. Some of the barriers may be common for the majority of Muslim women in different contexts , while others might be related to women 's situations and the wider society they live. To identify these barriers and make recommendations for future studies , this article reviews related papers conducted in both Muslim-majority and non-Muslim-majority countries. A critical systematic review of the literature was conducted for identifying Muslim women 's barriers in disclosing abuse and seeking help. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The main identified barriers are discussed into under four themes: social context , family context , individual factors , and expectations of service providers. Although the researchers tried to investigate various barriers in seeking help , many of them have not focused on structural obstacles. Besides , in many Muslim-majority countries , the issue has not been explored. Therefore , the results of the current article will not apply to those countries. Recommendation for future research comprises more qualitative research compatible with the women 's cultures and backgrounds in different societies , focusing more on structural and cultural factors to explore and find women 's barriers to seek help.
