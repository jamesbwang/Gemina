  In this study , nano iron ( nano-Fe) was successfully synthesized by sodium borohydride reduction of ferric chloride solution to enhance the ultrasonic degradation of phenolsulfonphthalein ( PSP). The nano-Fe was characterized by scanning electron microscopy- energy dispersive spectroscopy ( SEM-EDX) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , attenuated total reflection- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-FTIR) , and Brunauer , Emmett and Teller ( BET) surface area determination. Experimental results demonstrated that a combined ultrasonic/nano-Fe/H
