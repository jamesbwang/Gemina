  Environmental DNA ( eDNA) metabarcoding can greatly enhance our understanding of global biodiversity and our ability to detect rare or cryptic species. However , sampling effort must be considered when interpreting results from these surveys. We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species ( NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall , we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort , richness patterns were not , suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS , with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall , we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats. However , richness estimates and species assignments require caution. Based on results of this study , we make several recommendations for port eDNA sampling design and suggest several areas for future research.
