  Patients who are malnourished or at-risk for malnutrition often benefit from the consumption of oral nutritional supplements ( ONS). ONS supply a range of micro- and macro-nutrients , and they can be used to supplement a diet or provide total nutrition. Since ONS are specially formulated products , all ONS ingredients-- including carbohydrates-- are added ingredients. This may seem to be at odds with the growing public health discourse on the need to reduce & ldquo; added sugars & rdquo; in the diet. However , carbohydrate is an essential nutrient for human health and is a critical ingredient in ONS. Helping to educate patients on the value of & ldquo; added sugars & rdquo; in ONS may be useful to improve compliance with nutritional recommendations when ONS are indicated. This perspective paper reviews the important roles of & ldquo; added sugars & rdquo; in ONS , in terms of flavor , function , and product formulation.
