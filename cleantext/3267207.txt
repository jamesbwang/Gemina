  Adrenergic stimulation of brown adipose tissue ( BAT) induces acute and long-term responses. The acute adrenergic response activates thermogenesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and enabling increased substrate oxidation. Long-term , adrenergic signaling remodels BAT , inducing adaptive transcriptional changes that expand thermogenic capacity. Here , we show that the estrogen-related receptors alpha and gamma ( ERRα , ERRγ) are collectively critical effectors of adrenergically stimulated transcriptional reprogramming of BAT.
