  With the rapid development of the wearable detector and medical devices , flexible biosensing materials have received more and more attention. In this work , a novel flexible and conductive biocompatible composite with electronic and ionic bioconductive ability was demonstrated to fabricate a new flexible bioelectrode used for electrophysiological signal detection. This composite was prepared by the in situ self-polymerization of dopamine on the nanofiber of bacterial cellulose ( BC) under the neutral pH condition. By using this method , poly ( dopamine) ( PDA) could form a uniform and continuous wrapped layer on the BC nanofiber that can prevent the aggregation of PDA caused by rapid polymerization under the conventional alkaline condition. In addition , a fabricated film with a special structure is suitable for the transportation of electrons and ions existing in it. Moreover , the flexible conductive film ( FCF) reveals an extremely tensile strength , which is 2 times higher than the pure BC in addition to a high electric conductivity , which reaches a value of 10
