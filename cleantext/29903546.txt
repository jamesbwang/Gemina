  Long-term inflammatory complications of IPAA include Crohn 's Disease ( CD) or `` CD-like '' ( CDL) condition. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( anti-TNF) with or without immunomodulator ( IM) therapy in this group of patients. Literature databases were searched from inception to October 4 , 2017. Further searches using references from papers of interest were conducted and , abstracts from major GI conferences were searched. The primary endpoint was: complete clinical response in the two arms. Out of 9 identified studies 4 were included for quantitative analysis. 48 % ( 84/175) were female and mean age was 30.7 years. There was no significant difference in complete clinical response rates , RR 0.58 ( 95 % CI 0.13-2.54 , p = 0.5) or partial clinical response rates of RR 0.98 ( 95 % CI 0.52-1.83 , p = 0.94). All patients achieved endoscopic and deep remission in the only study reporting these outcomes comparatively in the two arms. There was a trend towards higher risk of major ( RR 3.89 , ( 95 % C 0.92-16.45 p = 0.09)) , and minor adverse events ( RR 3.07 ( 95 % CI 0.7-13.52 p = 0.28)) when using anti-TNF therapy compared to anti-TNF with IM. We found no difference in outcomes with anti-TNF monotherapy compared to concurrent anti-TNF therapy with IM. Additional studies are needed to define the optimal therapy for CD after IPAA.
