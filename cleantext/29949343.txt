  Electrografting of diazonium salts containing a protected alkyne moiety was used for the first functionalization of silicon and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite model surfaces. After deprotection with tetrabutylammonium fluoride , further layers were added by the thiol-yne click chemistry. The composition of each layer was characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The same approach was then used to functionalize graphite powder electrodes , which are classically used as negative electrode in lithium-ion batteries. The effect of the coating on the formation of the solid electrolyte layer was investigated electrochemically by cyclovoltammetry and galvanostatic measurements. The modified graphite electrodes showed different reduction peaks in the first cycle , indicating reduced and altered decomposition processes of the components. Most importantly , the electrochemical investigations show a remarkable reduction of irreversible capacity loss of the battery.
