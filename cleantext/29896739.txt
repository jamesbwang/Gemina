  To detect mutation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 ( ADAR1) gene in a pedigree affected with dyschromatosis symmetrical hereditaria ( DSH). Clinical data and peripheral blood samples of the patients from the pedigree were collected. Potential mutations of the ADAR1 gene were screened among 2 patients , 2 unaffected individual from the pedigree as well as 50 unrelated healthy controls by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. A c. 3463C > T ( p.R1155W) missense mutation of the ADAR gene was identified in the 2 patients , which was absent in the 2 healthy relatives and 50 unrelated controls. The mutation has been previously identified among 5 Chinese families and was the most common mutation site. The c. 3463C > T missense mutation of the ADAR gene probably underlies the disease in this pedigree.
