  With inspiration from Oxford , UK , a youth clinic outside the hospital for young people with kidney disease was established at a Danish university hospital in Autumn 2014. Four clinics have been held annually. To qualitatively evaluate a new established youth clinic and to gain knowledge of the experiences of young people and their parents with this clinic. Three data sets were collected ( observation , interviews and focus groups). Data were analysed using Malterud 's systematic text condensation. Eight themes were identified: ( 1) A meeting place; ( 2) a mutual understanding; ( 3) the young people have established a social community between themselves; ( 4) I feel less directed by my kidney disease; ( 5) I accept my life with the disease to a larger extent; ( 6) I am the safety net; ( 7) they have their life with the disease under control and they handle it and ( 8) the youth clinic is a gift from heaven. The youth clinic had a positive impact on the young peoples ' daily life with kidney disease and has helped most of the young people to have more faith in themselves and their own abilities to handle life with kidney disease. Meeting with peers and the youth clinic being located outside the hospital were of utmost importance.
