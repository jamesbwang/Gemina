  Clinical practice of mental health services changed in 1978 after the Basaglia Law was passed , and it is now characterized by usually voluntary treatments offered by community-based services. That broadened the interventions ' focus from the single subject to their environment. Dual diagnosis is defined by WHO as `` the co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive substance use disorder and another psychiatric disorder ''. It is considered to be a `` border territory '' since entails networking between different medical services. A literature search was performed in PubMed , Web of Science , Scopus and Google Scholar. Search terms were: `` guidelines '' , `` treatment '' , `` comorbidity '' , `` substance abuse '' , `` alcohol '' , `` dual-diagnosis '' , `` psychiatric illness '' , `` outpatient '' , `` inpatient '' , `` health care service '' , `` clinical practice ''. National and regional regulations about health and addiction were screened too. Out of 598 titles , 31 studies were included in this article for their relevance on treatments and networking between services for dual diagnosis cases. There are not any guidelines for clinical practice in the literature , neither there are any shared treatment strategies on a national level. Considering the autonomy that every regional health service has , several different courses of action are possible. Here there are reported the ones available. After discussing the weak points of the treatment options , we suggest the `` Multidisciplinary Healthcare '' model to best address the difficulties represented by dual diagnosis cases.
