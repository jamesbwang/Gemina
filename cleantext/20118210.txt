  Intraflagellar transport ( IFT) is a bi-directional process by which particles are carried within the cilia or flagella. This process is essential for ciliary growth and functional maintenance. The IFT complex B ( IFTB) is linked to a kinesin motor for anterograde transport towards the ciliary tip. The IFT complex A ( IFTA) is connected to a dynein motor for retrograde transport towards the ciliary basis. This study focuses on IFT46 , an IFTB member that participates in this process. In Paramecium , a GFP-labelled IFT46 protein was found in basal bodies and in some cilia , mostly those undergoing biogenesis. RNA interference against IFT46 in Paramecium triggered severe defects in ciliary growth and architecture , including a decreased cilia number and shortened cilia length. This result differed from that obtained from the cells that were depleted of IFT80 , another IFTB protein. Moreover , IFT57-GFP fusion protein abnormally accumulated in the cortex and cytoplasm in IFT46-depleted cells compared with the control. Furthermore , transcriptomic analysis showed that IFT46 depletion induced the abnormal expression of several genes that encodeding kinesin and dynein chains. These findings together indicate that IFT46 plays important roles in trafficking IFT proteins between the cytoplasm and cilia of Paramecium.
