  Marine management developments are occurring across the United Kingdom with the major aim to ensure economic growth and security of marine resources via the provision of legislative guidelines for sustainable management of activities within the marine environment. Many of these directives also provide guidance for maintaining ecologically valuable and/or endangered species and habitats that exist alongside , and may also support , marine activities/use. Marine governance is largely guided by several key directives laid out and implemented by governing authorities of Europe , the United Kingdom and those countries comprising the United Kingdom , and in line with several international conventions. The directives set out by each authority or convention may act discretely but more often tend to overlap , which can lead to confusion<symptom> about the relevant marine conservation requirements and objectives that must be fulfilled for a given region , site or feature. Additionally , management objectives driven by the same legislation may oppose one another , adding further complexity to the matter. This article aims to provide an overview of governance that holds relevance to managing marine habitats and species , especially those deemed sensitive , ecologically valuable and/or endangered. A general overview and summary schematic tool of the marine governance , legislation and designations within each level of authority for the United Kingdom are provided. Additional consideration of the implications for legislation upon the United Kingdom leaving the EU is briefly discussed and a comparative case study of two marine habitats of high conservation value is provided to demonstrate how different sites/features may have considerably different management requirements.
