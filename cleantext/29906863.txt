  The spreading of epidemics is very much determined by the structure of the contact network , which may be impacted by the mobility dynamics of the individuals themselves. In confined scenarios where a small , closed population spends most of its time in localized environments and has easily identifiable mobility patterns-such as workplaces , university campuses , or schools-it is of critical importance to identify the factors controlling the rate of disease spread. Here , we present a discrete-time , metapopulation-based model to describe the transmission of susceptible-infected-susceptible-like diseases that take place in confined scenarios where the mobilities of the individuals are not random but , rather , follow clear recurrent travel patterns. This model allows analytical determination of the onset of epidemics , as well as the ability to discern which contact structures are most suited to prevent the infection to spread. It thereby determines whether common prevention mechanisms , as isolation , are worth implementing in such a scenario and their expected impact.
