  Cosmetic dissatisfaction , pain , and chronic discharge may present months till years after enucleation in patients operated because of retinoblastoma. If noninvasive treatment modalities are insufficient , socket reconstruction can be considered. In this study , we discuss the results of dermis-fat exchange to treat these problems. Four patients with late onset post enucleation socket problems with a request for treatment were included in this prospective study. Socket inspection was documented and pictures at baseline and at a follow-up of at least 6 months were taken. To quantify the problem ` pain ' , a VAS score at baseline and at follow up was used. For the problem ` cosmetic dissatisfaction ' standardized questionnaires were used. Two patients were included because of cosmetic dissatisfaction; one was included with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and one with chronic discharge. Reconstruction of the socket using autologous dermis-fat insertion was done in all four. In one of them , severe shrinking of the fat developed. This patient was treated with additional injectable fillers. Both of them , ultimately , had satisfactory results. Autologous fat transplantation also solved the problem of chronic discharge and pain in the two other patients. Socket reconstruction by autologous dermis-fat exchange may solve different post enucleation socket problems. However , shrinking of the transplanted fat may occur and require additional procedures.
