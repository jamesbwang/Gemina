  In this study , ( Ba0 .85 Ca0 .15) ( Ti0 .9 Zr0 .1) O3 ( BCTZ) lead-free ceramics with enhanced energy density were prepared by two-step sintering. All ceramics fall into the rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal ( R-O-T) phase boundary near room temperature , and a dense microstructure with an intermediate grain size was observed. The enhanced piezoelectric and energy harvesting properties were attained over a wide grain size range of 10-15 μm , benefiting from the construction of the R-O-T phase boundary. Most interestingly , the maximum values of d33 and d33 × g33 ( 530 pC N-1 and 9720 × 10-15 m2 N-1) can be achieved at 1500/1350 °C with a grain size of 13.7 μm. The interpretation of the underlying mechanism related to domain and defect engineering has been investigated systematically. Furthermore , a high output power of 99 μW and an energy conversion efficiency of 10 % were obtained at a simple cantilever energy harvester fabricated from a 1500/1350 °C specimen under an acceleration of 1.0 g , making the current system very promising for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications.
