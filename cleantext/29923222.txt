  Curcumin is a yellow-orange powder derived from the Curcuma longa plant. Curcumin has been used extensively in traditional medicine for centuries. This component is non-toxic and shown different therapeutic properties such as anti-inflammatory , anti-cancer , antiviral , anti-bacterial , anti-fungal , anti-parasites , and anti-oxidant. Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) is a small DNA member of the genus Orthohepadnavirus ( Hepadnaviridae family) which is a highly contagious blood-borne viral pathogen. HBV infection is a major public health problem with 2 billion people infected throughout the world and 350 million suffering from chronic HBV infection. Increasing evidence indicated that curcumin as a natural product could be employed in the treatment of HBV patients. It has been showed that curcumin exerts its therapeutic effects on HBV patients via targeting a variety of cellular and molecular pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin , Ap1 , STAT3 , MAPK , and NF-κB signaling. Here , we summarized the therapeutic effects of curcumin on patients who infected with HBV<pathogen>. Moreover , we highlighted main signaling pathways ( eg , NF-κB , AP1 , and Wnt/β-catenin signaling) which affected by curcumin in HBV infections.
