  A key factor in the study of plant-microbes interactions is the composition of plant microbiota , but little is known about the factors determining its functional and taxonomic organization. Here we investigated the possible forces driving the assemblage of bacterial endophytic and rhizospheric communities , isolated from two congeneric medicinal plants , Echinacea purpurea ( L.) Moench and Echinacea angustifolia ( DC) Heller , grown in the same soil , by analysing bacterial strains ( isolated from three different compartments , i.e. rhizospheric soil , roots and stem/leaves) for phenotypic features such as antibiotic resistance , extracellular enzymatic activity , siderophore and indole 3-acetic acid production , as well as cross-antagonistic activities. Data obtained highlighted that bacteria from different plant compartments were characterized by specific antibiotic resistance phenotypes and antibiotic production , suggesting that the bacterial communities themselves could be responsible for structuring their own communities by the production of antimicrobial molecules selecting bacterial-adaptive phenotypes for plant tissue colonization.
