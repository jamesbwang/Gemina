  Donor-derived hematologic malignancies are rare complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT). Although these are commonly either a myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , in general , they are a heterogeneous group of diseases and a unified mechanism for their development has remained elusive. Here we report next generation sequencing , including whole exome sequencing ( WES) , whole genome sequencing ( WGS) , and targeted sequencing , of a case of donor-derived MDS ( dMDS) following HCT for high-risk B-lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( B-ALL) in an adolescent. Through interrogation of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) in the WGS data , we unequivocally prove that the MDS is donor-derived. Additionally , we sequenced 15 samples from 12 time points , including the initial B-ALL diagnostic sample through several post-HCT remission samples , the dMDS , and representative germline samples from both patient and donor , to show that the MDS-related pathologic mutations , including a canonical ASXL1 ( p.Y700 *) mutation , were detectable nearly 3 years prior to the morphological detection of MDS. Furthermore , these MDS mutations were not detectable immediately following , and for greater than 1 year post-HCT. These data support the clinical utility of comprehensive sequencing following HCT to detect donor-derived malignancies , while providing insights into the clonal progression of dMDS over a 4-year period.
