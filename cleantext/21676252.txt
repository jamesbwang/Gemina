  The evolutionary relationships among the apicomplexan blood pathogens known as the malaria<disease> parasites ( order Haemosporida) , some of which infect nearly 200 million humans each year , has remained a vexing phylogenetic problem due to limitations in taxon sampling , character sampling and the extreme nucleotide base composition biases that are characteristic of this clade. Previous phylogenetic work on the malaria<disease> parasites has often lacked sufficient representation of the broad taxonomic diversity within the Haemosporida or the multi-locus sequence data needed to resolve deep evolutionary relationships , rendering our understanding of haemosporidian life-history evolution and the origin of the human malaria<disease> parasites incomplete. Here we present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the malaria<disease> parasites conducted to date , using samples from a broad diversity of vertebrate hosts that includes numerous enigmatic and poorly known haemosporidian lineages in addition to genome-wide multi-locus sequence data. We find that if base composition differences were corrected for during phylogenetic analysis , we recovered a well-supported topology indicating that the evolutionary history of the malaria<disease> parasites was characterized by a complex series of transitions in life-history strategies and host usage. Notably we find that
