  The ability to resist distraction and focus on-task-relevant information while being responsive to changes in the environment is fundamental to goal-directed behavior. Such attentional control abilities are regulated by a constant interplay between previously characterized bottom-up and top-down attentional networks. Here we ask about the neural changes within these two attentional networks that may mediate enhanced attentional control. To address this question , we contrasted action video game players ( AVGPs) and nonvideo game players ( NVGPs) in a Posner-cueing paradigm , building on studies documenting enhanced attentional control in AVGPs. Behavioral results indicated a trend for more efficient target processing in AVGPs , and better suppression in rare catch trials for which responses had to be withheld. During the cue period , AVGPs recruited the top-down network less than NVGPs , despite showing comparable validity effects , in line with a greater efficiency of that network in AVGPs. During target processing , as previously shown , recruitment of top-down areas correlated with greater processing difficulties , but only in NVGPs. AVGPs showed no such effect , but rather greater activation across the two networks. In particular , the right temporoparietal junction , middle frontal gyrus , and superior parietal cortex predicted better task performance in catch trials. A functional connectivity analysis revealed enhanced correlated activity in AVGPs compared to NVGPs between parietal and visual areas. These results point to dynamic functional reconfigurations of top-down and bottom-up attentional networks in AVGPs as attentional demands vary. Aspects of this functional reconfiguration that may act as key signatures of high attentional control are discussed.
