  The magnetic compass sense utilized by migratory birds for long-distance navigation functions only once light of a certain wavelength is present. This piece of evidence fits partially with the popular hypothesis of chemical magnetoreception in cryptochrome proteins , located in the bird retina. According to this hypothesis a magnetosensitive radical pair is produced after photoexcitation of an FAD cofactor inside cryptochrome , and as such the absorption properties of FAD are of crucial importance for cryptochrome activation. However , we reveal that absorption spectra of FAD show very little variation between six different cryptochromes , suggesting that the electronic transitions are barely affected by the chemical differences in the proteins. This conclusion hints on the presence of a secondary photoreceptor or cofactor that could be necessary to explain green-light-activated magnetoreception in birds.
