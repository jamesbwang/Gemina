  Our goal was to describe the period prevalence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) and characterize adolescent female patients diagnosed with VTE by describing their age , race , and number of comorbidities. Female adolescents with estrogen exposure were of particular interest because estrogen-containing contraceptives increase the risk of VTE. We queried the Pediatric Health Information System database for International Classification of Diseases , Ninth/Tenth Revision , Clinical Modification codes to identify female patients aged 12-18 years diagnosed with a VTE or pulmonary embolism from April 2006 to March 2016 in the United States. Patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were also analyzed. We divided our study population into two five-year groups and calculated the change in period prevalence of VTE between those groups. Primary diagnosis of VTE in the extremities , or pulmonary embolism. The period prevalence of VTE increased from 2.3 female adolescents per 10,000 hospitalized children ( group 1) to 3.3 per 10,000 ( group 2) , representing a statistically significant increase of 0.010 % ( P < .001). Caucasian and black individuals were most commonly affected. The number of girls affected increased steadily from ages 12 to 16 years and a large percentage ( 59.6 %) had four or more comorbidities. In patients ( n = 32) with estrogen exposure , more than 96 % had one or more comorbidity in addition to estrogen exposure. Pediatric health care providers should be aware that the period prevalence of VTEs in female adolescents is increasing. Those with a history of estrogen exposure rarely develop VTEs from estrogen alone and they typically have multiple comorbidities.
