  According to the Amyloid hypothesis , as the foremost scientific explanation for Alzheimer Disease ( AD) , the neuropathology of AD is related to toxic fragments of amyloid beta ( Aβ) protein. Based on this hypothesis , an attractive therapeutic approach was demonstrated to identify multifunctional peptides able to modulate Aβ pathologies as the source of AD. On this premise , a bifunctional polypeptide based on the iAβ5p lead compound , was designed to inhibit Aβ aggregation and free metal ions. Herein , the efficacy of this novel drug in Zn
