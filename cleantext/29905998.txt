  Although previous studies identify gender differences in melanoma , limited research on the phenomenon exists. In this retrospective chart review , 1,156 adults diagnosed with melanoma , between 2006-2016 , at the University of Colorado were included. Breslow depth , mitotic rate , ulceration status , and location were extracted from charts between March and August 2016. Cochran-Armitage trend tests and cumulative logistic regression were used to examine the association between gender and Breslow depth , univariately and after adjusting for potential confounders. In univariate analysis , males were significantly more likely to present with lesions<symptom> with higher Breslow depths ( p for trend = 0.005). In models adjusted for age , melanoma subtype , and location , males were marginally more likely to present with lesions<symptom> with higher Breslow depths ( cumulative OR: 1.261 , 95 % CI: 0.988-1.611 , p = 0.060). Males were also marginally more likely to present with lesions<symptom> with higher mitotic rates , after further adjustments for all other prognostic factors ( cumulative OR: 1.244 , 95 % CI: 0.979-1.580 , p = 0.074). This was a retrospective single-institution study. Differences in mitotic rates among melanomas in males versus females , even after adjustments for all other prognostic factors , suggests that biological differences may contribute to the female prognosis advantage.
