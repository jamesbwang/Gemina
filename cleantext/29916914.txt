  We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor undergoing treatment with long-acting octreotide and Lu-DOTATATE therapy. We present features of carcinoid heart disease on Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT , which revealed dilated right atrium , pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> , ascites , and congestive hepatopathy apart from the metastatic lesions<symptom> in the liver. The scan cardiac findings were confirmed by echocardiography. This highlights the significance of identifying such patients early because additional management is required for carcinoid heart disease per se and a cautious approach is needed in administering amino acid infusion during PRRT that can result in fluid overload.
