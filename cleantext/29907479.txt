  The migration of African populations to Europe poses problems of adaptation that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We assessed the cardiovascular risk of Cape Verdean university students studying in Portugal ( CV-PT) compared to Cape Verdean university students in Cape Verde ( CV-CV) and to Caucasian university students in Portugal ( PT-PT). A cross-sectional study was performed comparing three university populations , 54-62 % female , aged 19-28 years: CV-PT ( n = 104) , CV-CV ( n = 100) and PT-PT ( n = 100). Anthropometric data , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , pulse wave velocity ( PWV) , albuminuria and estimated 24-h urinary sodium excretion ( UNa The CV-PT group had higher body mass index and sodium intake ( UNa Cape Verdean university students in Portugal ( CV-PT) have higher albuminuria , BP and PWV values than PT-PT and CV-CV students , associated with less healthy lifestyles , higher cardiovascular risk and worse socioeconomic conditions. The higher cardiovascular risk in these African immigrants means that it is important to implement measures to address modifiable risk factors , to improve integration and to promote healthy lifestyles.
