  TP53 pathway defects contributed to therapy resistance and adverse clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) , which represents an unmet clinical need with few therapeutic options. Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase ( MELK) is a novel oncogene , which plays crucial roles in mitotic progression and stem cell maintenance. OTSSP167 , an orally administrated inhibitor targeting MELK , is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia<disease>. Yet , no investigation has been elucidated to date regarding the oncogenic role of MELK and effects of OTSSP167 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). Previous studies confirmed MELK inhibition abrogated cancer cell survival via p53 signaling pathway. Thus , we aimed to determine the biological function of MELK and therapeutic potential of OTSSP167 in CLL. Herein , MELK over-expression was observed in CLL cells , and correlated with higher WBC count , advanced stage , elevated LDH , increased Î²2-MG level , unmutated IGHV , positive ZAP-70 , deletion of 17p13 and inferior prognosis of CLL patients. In accordance with functional enrichment analyses in gene expression profiling , CLL cells with depletion or inhibition of MELK exhibited impaired cell proliferation , enhanced fast-onset apoptosis , induced G2/M arrest , attenuated cell chemotaxis and promoted sensitivity to fludarabine and ibrutinib. However , gain-of-function assay showed increased cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis. In addition , OTSSP167 treatment reduced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. It decreased FoxM1 phosphorylation , expression of FoxM1 , cyclin B1 and CDK1 , while up-regulating p53 and p21 expression. Taken together , MELK served as a candidate of therapeutic target in CLL. OTSSP167 exhibits potent anti-tumor activities in CLL cells , highlighting a novel molecule-based strategy for leukemic interventions.
