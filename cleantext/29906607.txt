  Stickleback fishes in the family Gasterosteidae have become model organisms in ecology and evolutionary biology. However , even in the case of the most widely studied species in this family- the three-spined stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus<pathogen>)- the worldwide phylogenetic relationships and colonization history of the different populations and lineages remain poorly resolved. Using a large collection of samples covering most parts of the species distribution range , we subjected thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms to coalescent analyses in order to reconstruct a robust worldwide phylogeny of extant G. aculeatus<pathogen> populations , as well as their ancestral geographic distributions using Statistical-Dispersal Vicariance and Bayesian Binary MCMC analyses. The results suggest that contemporary populations originated from the Pacific Ocean in the Late Pleistocene , and the Atlantic was colonized through the Arctic Ocean by a lineage that diverged from Pacific sticklebacks ca 44.6 Kya. This lineage contains two branches: one that is distributed in the Mediterranean area , from the Iberian Peninsula to the Black Sea ( ` Southern European Clade ') , and another that is comprised of populations from northern Europe and the east coast of North<pathogen> America ( ` Trans-Atlantic Clade '). Hence , the results suggest that the North American East Coast was colonized by trans-Atlantic migration. Coalescence-based divergence time estimates suggest that divergence among major clades is much more recent than previously estimated.
