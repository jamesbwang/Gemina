  Recent guidelines recommend cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) in mildly symptomatic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) but favour left bundle branch block ( LBBB) morphology in patients with moderate QRS prolongation ( 120-150 ms). We defined how many patients hospitalized with HF fulfil these criteria. A single-centre retrospective cohort study of 363 consecutive patients hospitalized with HF ( 438 admissions) was performed. Electronic imaging , electrocardiograms , and records were reviewed. Overall , 153 patients ( 42 %) had left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) ≤ 35 % , and 34 % of patients had QRS prolongation. Eighty patients ( 22 %) were potentially eligible with LVEF ≤ 35 % and QRS ≥ 120 ms or existing CRT. The majority ( 68 of 80) had a Class I or IIa recommendation according to international guidelines ( LBBB or non-LBBB QRS ≥ 150 ms or right ventricular pacing). Only a minority ( 12 of 80) had moderate QRS prolongation of non-LBBB morphology. One-quarter ( n = 22) of patients fulfilling criteria were ineligible for reasons including dementia , co-morbidities , or palliative care. A further eight patients required optimization of medical therapy. CRT was therefore immediately indicated in 50 patients. Of these , 29 were implanted or had existing CRT systems. Twenty-one of the 80 patients eligible for CRT were not identified or treated ( 6 % of the total hospitalized cohort). Twenty-two per cent of elderly real-life patients hospitalized with HF fulfil LVEF and QRS criteria for CRT , most having a Class I or IIa indication. However , a large proportion is ineligible owing to co-morbidities or requires medical optimization. Although uptake of CRT was reasonable , there remain opportunities for improvement.
