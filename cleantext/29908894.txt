  As the most common and lethal of intracranial tumors , glioma accounts for 81 % of all malignant brain tumors. Research data have identified the role of microRNAs ( miRs) as functional suppressors in the progression of Glioma. The present study aimed to , ascertain as to whether microRNA-499a ( miR-499a) influences cell proliferation and apoptosis through the MAPK signaling pathway by targeting Notch1 in glioma. Both glioma and adjacent tissues between 2012-2016 , were obtained from People 's Hospital of Zhengzhou University ( Henan Provincial People 's Hospital). The collected glioma cells were treated with miR-449a mimic , miR-449a inhibitor , siRNA-Notch1 , or SB230580 ( an inhibitor of the MAPK signaling pathway). Verification of the targeting effect of miR-449a on Notch1 was provided by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The expressions of miR-449a , Notch1 , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK) , extracellular regulated protein kinases ( ERK1/2) , B-cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2) , Bcl-2 associated X protein ( bax) , CyclinD1 , and phosphorylation of p38MAPK ( p-p38MAPK) and ERK1/2 ( p-ERK1/ 2) in tissues and cells were detected by means of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis methods. Cellular processes of proliferation , cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and BrdU assays as well as flow cytometry , respectively. Notch1 was subsequently identified to be a target gene of miR-499a. After the cells were treated with miR-449a mimic , siRNA-Notch1 or SB230580 , decreased expressions of Notch1 , Bcl-2 , CyclinD1 , ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/ 2 , cell proliferation as well as cells arrested at the S stage with elevated expressions levels of p38MAPK , p-p38MAPK , Bax , as well as increased cell apoptosis and number of cells arrested in G0/G1 stage were assessed. Taken together , based on the evidence obtained from the present study , assertions were subsequently made suggesting that MiR-499a targeted-inhibition of Notch1 may be a promising future therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment , by means of overexpressing of miR-499a resulting in the inhibition of glioma cell proliferation and promotion of cell apoptosis through suppression of the MAPK signaling pathway by decreasing Notch1.
