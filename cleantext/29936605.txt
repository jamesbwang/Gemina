  The Health Resources and Services Administration Special Projects of National Significance launched the Systems Linkage and Access to Care for Populations at High Risk of HIV<pathogen> Infection Initiative in 2011. Six state departments of health were funded to utilize a modified Learning Collaborative model to develop and/or adapt HIV<pathogen> testing , linkage to care and retention in care system-level interventions. More than 60 Learning Sessions were held over the course of the Learning Collaborative. A total of 22 unique interventions were tested with 18 interventions selected and scaled up. All interventions were created to impact services at a systems level , with standardized protocols developed to ensure fidelity. Our findings provide key lessons and present considerations for replication for use of a modified Learning Collaborative to achieve state-level systems change.
