  Deep-sea mining refers to the retrieval of marine mineral resources such as manganese nodules<symptom> , ferromanganese crusts and seafloor massive sulfide deposits , which contain a variety of metals that serve as crucial raw materials for a range of applications , from electronic devices to renewable energy technologies to construction materials. With the intent of decreasing dependence on imports , supporting the economy and potentially even overcoming the environmental problems related to conventional terrestrial mining , a number of public and private institutions have re-discovered their interest in exploring the prospects of deep-sea mining , which had been deemed economically and technically unfeasible in the early 1980 s. To date , many national and international research projects are grappling to understand the economic environmental , social and legal implications of potential commercial deep-sea mining operations: a challenging endeavor due to the complexity of direct impacts and spill-over effects. In this paper , we present a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in the aforementioned fields as well as a comparison of the impacts associated with conventional terrestrial mining. Furthermore , we identify knowledge gaps that should be urgently addressed to ensure that the world at large benefits from safe , efficient and environmentally-sound mining procedures. We conclude by highlighting the need for interdisciplinary research and international cooperation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
