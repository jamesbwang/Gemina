  This study investigated the inactivation efficiency of ZnO nanofluids against E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in sonophotocatalysis with the aeration of nitrogen , oxygen , argon and their mixtures. The results showed that inactivation efficiency was increased when aeration was combined with sonophotocatalysis. Addition of different types of gases could lead to the different inactivation efficiency. The inactivation efficiencies were shown in the following order: no aeration < nitrogen < argon < oxygen < Ar/O
