  BuyangHuanwu decoction ( BHD) is widely used as a traditional herbal medicine because of its antithrombotic effect , which is attributed to the inhibition of platelet aggregation; however , its active compounds remain unknown. In this study , we developed a method involving platelet binding , solid-phase extraction , and HPLC-MS/MS for screening BHD compounds with potential anti-platelet aggregation properties. Five compounds showing platelet binding affinity were identified as 6-hydroxykaempferol-di-O-glucoside , paeoniflorin , calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside , galloylpaeoniflorin , and formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucoside. The results of anti-platelet aggregation experiments in vitro confirmed that these compounds inhibited adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. Our results suggest that a platelet binding assay combined with solid-phase extraction and HPLC-MS/MS is an effective method for screening anti-platelet aggregation agents in traditional Chinese medicines.
