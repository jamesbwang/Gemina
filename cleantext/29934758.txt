  This article is a comprehensive review of diabetic gastroparesis , defined as delayed or disordered gastric emptying , including basic principles and current trends in management. This review includes sections on anatomy and physiology , diagnosis and differential diagnosis as well as management and current guidelines for treatment of diabetic gastroparesis. Diabetic gastroparesis ( DGp) is a component of autonomic neuropathy resulting from long-standing poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The diagnostic workup of DGp first excludes obstruction and other causes including medications that may mimic delayed/disordered gastric emptying. Targeting nutrition , hydration , symptomatic relief and glycemic control are mainstays of treatment for DGp. Additionally , optimal treatment of DGp includes good glycemic management , often involving customizing insulin delivery using basal-bolus insulin and technology , including sensor-augmented pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems. Prokinetic medications may be helpful in DGp symptoms , although only limited number of medications is currently available in the USA. Selected medication-refractory patients with DGp may benefit from gastric neuromodulation , and some from surgical interventions including pyloric therapies that can also be done endoscopically. As is true of any of the diabetic complications , prevention of DGp by early and optimal glycemic control is more cost-effective. Hansa Medcell , India.
