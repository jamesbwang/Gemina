  In schizophrenia ( SCZ) , dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC) has been linked to the deficits in executive functions and attention. It has been suggested that , instead of considering the right DLPFC as a cohesive functional entity , it can be divided into two parts ( anterior and posterior) based on its whole-brain connectivity patterns. Given these two subregions ' differential association with cognitive processes , we investigated the functional connectivity ( FC) profile of both subregions through resting-state data to determine whether they are differentially affected in SCZ. Resting-state magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans were obtained from 120 patients and 172 healthy controls ( HC) at 6 different MRI sites. The results showed differential FC patterns for the anterior and posterior parts of the right executive control-related DLPFC in SCZ with the parietal , the temporal and the cerebellar regions , along with a convergent reduction of connectivity with the striatum<pathogen> and the occipital cortex. An increased psychopathology level was linked to a higher difference in posterior vs. anterior FC for the left IFG/anterior insula , regions involved in higher-order cognitive processes. In sum , the current analysis demonstrated that even between two neighboring clusters connectivity could be differentially disrupted in SCZ. Lacking the necessary anatomical specificity , such notions may in fact be detrimental to a proper understanding of SCZ pathophysiology.
