  Mormyrid weakly electric fish produce electric organ<symptom> discharges<symptom> ( EODs) for active electrolocation and electrocommunication. These pulses are emitted with variable interdischarge intervals ( IDIs) resulting in temporal discharge patterns and interactive signaling episodes with nearby conspecifics. However , unequivocal assignment of interactive signaling to a specific behavioral context has proven to be challenging. Using an ethorobotical approach , we confronted single individuals of weakly electric
