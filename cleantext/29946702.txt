  Retinal structures may serve as a biomarker for dementia , but longitudinal studies examining this link are lacking. To investigate the association of inner retinal layer thickness with prevalent and incident dementia in a general population of Dutch adults. From September 2007 to June 2012 , participants from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study who were 45 years and older and had gradable retinal optical coherence tomography images and at baseline were free from stroke , Parkinson disease , multiple sclerosis , glaucoma , macular degeneration , retinopathy , myopia , hyperopia , and optic disc pathology were included. They were followed up until January 1 , 2015 , for the onset of dementia. Inner retinal layer thicknesses ( ie , retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL)) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GC-IPL) thicknesses measured on optical coherence tomography images. Odds ratios and hazard ratios for incident dementia per SD decrease in retinal layer thickness adjusted for age , sex , education , and cardiovascular risk factors. Of 5065 individuals eligible for optical coherence tomography scanning , 3289 ( 64.9 %) ( mean ( SD) age 68.9 ( 9.9) years , 1879 ( 57 %) women) were included in the analysis. Of these 3289 individuals , 41 ( 1.2 %) already had dementia. Thinner GC-IPL was associated with prevalent dementia ( odds ratio per SD decrease in GC-IPL , 1.37 ( 95 % CI , 0.99-1.90)). No association was found of RNFL with prevalent dementia. During 14674 person-years of follow-up ( mean ( SD) , 4.5 ( 1.6) years) , 86 individuals ( 2.6 %) developed dementia of whom 68 ( 2.1 %) had Alzheimer disease. Thinner RNFL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia ( hazard ratio per SD decrease in RNFL , 1.44 ( 95 % CI , 1.19-1.75)) , which was similar for Alzheimer disease ( hazard ratio , 1.43 ( 95 % CI , 1.15-1.78)). No association was found between GC-IPL thickness and incident dementia ( hazard ratio , 1.13 ( 95 % CI , 0.90-1.43)). Thinner RNFL is associated with an increased risk of dementia , including Alzheimer disease , suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration may serve as a preclinical biomarker for dementia.
