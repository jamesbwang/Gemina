  Pollution risk from the discharge of industrial waste or accidental spills during transportation poses a considerable threat to the security of rivers. The ability to quickly identify the pollution source is extremely important to enable emergency disposal of pollutants. This study proposes a new approach for point source identification of sudden water pollution in rivers , which aims to determine where ( source location) , when ( release time) and how much pollutant ( released mass) was introduced into the river. Based on the backward probability method ( BPM) and the linear regression model ( LR) , the proposed LR-BPM converts the ill-posed problem of source identification into an optimization model , which is solved using a Differential Evolution Algorithm ( DEA). The decoupled parameters of released mass are not dependent on prior information , which improves the identification efficiency. A hypothetical case study with a different number of pollution sources was conducted to test the proposed approach , and the largest relative errors for identified location , release time , and released mass in all tests were not greater than 10 %. Uncertainty in the LR-BPM is mainly due to a problem with model equifinality , but averaging the results of repeated tests greatly reduces errors. Furthermore , increasing the gauging sections further improves identification results. A real-world case study examines the applicability of the LR-BPM in practice , where it is demonstrated to be more accurate and time-saving than two existing approaches , Bayesian-MCMC and basic DEA.
