  Which patients with fractures , if any , have a lower mortality with prophylactic inferior vena cava filters has yet to be established. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if patients with low-risk fractures might benefit from a prophylactic inferior vena cava filter. Administrative data was analyzed from the National ( Nationwide) Inpatient Sample using ICD-9-CM codes. Included patients were aged 18 years or older with a primary diagnosis of non-complex fracture of the pelvis , or fracture of the femuralone , or fracture of the tibia and/or fibula. From 2003-2012 , 1,479,039 patients were hospitalized with low-risk fracture. The vast majority of patients with fracture , 1,461,378 of 1,479,039 ( 98.8 %) did not receive an inferior vena cava filter. Among those who did not receive a filter , 1,446,489 of 1,461,378 ( 99.0 %) did not develop deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism without a filter occurred in 7207 of 1,461,378 ( 0.5 %) and deep venous thrombosis occurred in 7682 of 1,461,378 ( 0.5 %). Total in-hospital all-cause mortality in those who did not receive a filter was 15,683 of 1,461,378 ( 1.1 %). An inferior vena cava filter was inserted in 17,661 of 1,479,039 ( 1.2 %) of patients with fractures. Most of those who received an inferior vena cava filter , 12,025 of 17,661 ( 68.1 %) did not develop pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. Total in-hospital all-cause mortality in all patients with an inferior vena cava filter was 516 of 17,661 ( 2.9 %). The evidence is
