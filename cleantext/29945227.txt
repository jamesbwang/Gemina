  Human skin fibroblasts present technical advantages for the study of mitochondrial-induced toxicity , because those cells can be isolated from patients by lowly invasive methods and present specific cumulative cellular damage and mutations of particular conditions. Several drugs lead to organ toxicity , with some of these drugs having been already withdrawn from the market. Frequently , drug-induced toxicity is attributed to mitochondrial liabilities. One of the approaches to identify drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity is using glucose-free/galactose/glutamine/ pyruvate-containing cell culture media that force cells to be more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. However , the effects of this modified culture medium itself on the mitochondrial phenotype of human skin fibroblasts have not been explored in detail. Our objective was to assess the mitochondrial biology of human skin fibroblasts under standard or modified culture conditions so that system can be validated and used in a more reliable way to disclose mitochondrial liabilities of drug candidates or intrinsic metabolic differences in fibroblasts. Our results showed that forcing mitochondrial remodeling in human skin fibroblasts increased oxygen consumption rate , ATP levels , and mitochondria-related transcripts and proteins. Moreover , the metabolic remodeling increased cytotoxicity of mitochondrial poisons. In general , no alterations in gene expression related with differentiation status were observed in human skin fibroblasts , with exception of increased paxilin gene expression. Not only the current work highlights the importance of using human skin primary cells to study drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity , it also reinforces the use of this tool to detect specific mitochondrial defects in skin fibroblasts from patients.
