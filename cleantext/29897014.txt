  Mitral regurgitation is the most common valvular disease and significant ( moderate/severe) mitral regurgitation is found in 2.3 % of the population older than 65 years. New transcatheter minimally invasive technologies are being developed to address mitral valve disease in patients deemed too high a risk for conventional open-heart surgery. There are several features of the mitral valve ( saddle-shaped noncalcified annulus with irregular leaflet geometry) that make a transcatheter approach to repair or replacing the valve more challenging compared with the aortic valve. Several devices are under investigation for transcatheter mitral valve replacement , and also for mitral valve repair targeting the mitral valve leaflets , chordae tendinae , and mitral annulus. The MitraClip device is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved device to treat mitral regurgitation by targeting the mitral leaflets. There are eight minimally invasive devices being studied in humans that target the mitral annulus , and at least two devices being studied in animal models. There are 5 devices in clinical trials for minimally invasive approaches targeting the chordae tendinae. More than 10 different transcatheter mitral valves are in various stages of development and clinical trials. These transcatheter mitral valves can be delivered either through a transseptal , transapical , transaortic , or left atriotomy approach. It seems likely that transcatheter treatment approaches to mitral valve disease will become more common , at least in the sick and elderly patient population.
