  We examined the frequency specificity of amplitude envelope patterns in 4 frequency bands , which universally appeared through factor analyses applied to power fluctuations of critical-band filtered speech sounds in 8 different languages/dialects ( Ueda and Nakajima ( 2017). Sci. Rep. , 7 ( 42468)). A series of 3 perceptual experiments with noise-vocoded speech of Japanese sentences was conducted. Nearly perfect ( 92-94 %) mora recognition was achieved , without any extensive training , in a control condition in which 4-band noise-vocoded speech was employed ( Experiments 1-3). Blending amplitude envelope patterns of the frequency bands , which resulted in reducing the number of amplitude envelope patterns while keeping the average spectral levels unchanged , revealed a clear deteriorating effect on intelligibility ( Experiment 1). Exchanging amplitude envelope patterns brought generally detrimental effects on intelligibility , especially when involving the 2 lowest bands ( â‰² 1850 Hz; Experiment 2). Exchanging spectral levels averaged in time had a small but significant deteriorating effect on intelligibility in a few conditions ( Experiment 3). Frequency specificity in low-frequency-band envelope patterns thus turned out to be conspicuous in speech perception.
