  Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled more efficient acquisition of massive amount of multi-omics data. However , interpretation of the underlying relationships across multi-omics networks has not been fully succeeded , partly due to the lack of effective methods in visualization. To aid interpretation of the results from such multi-omics data , we here present Grimon ( Graphical interface to visualize multi-omics networks) , an R package that visualizes high-dimensional multi-layered data sets in three-dimensional parallel coordinates. Grimon enables users to intuitively and interactively explore their analyzed data , helping their understanding of multiple inter-layer connections embedded in high-dimensional complex data. Grimon is freely available at https://github.com/mkanai/grimon as an R package with example omics data sets. Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.
