  The protein VCP/p97 ( also named CDC48 and TER94) belongs to a type II subfamily of the AAA+ATP ases and controls cellular proteostasis by acting upstream of proteasomes in the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway. The function of VCP/p97 in the baculovirus infection cycle in insect cells remains unknown. Here , we identified VCP/p97 in the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9) cells and analyzed the replication of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus , AcMNPV , in Sf9 cells in which the VCP/p97 function was inhibited. The specific allosteric inhibitor of the VCP/p97 ATPase activity , NMS-873 , did not deplete VCP/p97 in infected cells but caused a dose-dependent inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and efficiently suppressed expression of viral proteins and production of budded virions. NMS-873 caused accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in a manner similar to the inhibitor of proteasome activity , Bortezomib. This suggests the essential function of VCP/p97 in the baculovirus infection cycle might be associated , at least in part , with the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
