  Flow cytometry ( FC) and Nageotte hemocytometry represent the most widely accepted methods for counting residual white blood cells ( rWBCs) in leucocyte-reduced ( LR) blood components. Our aim was to study the agreement between the two methods , under real working blood bank conditions. 94 freshly produced LR red blood cell ( RBC) units were tested for rWBC concentrations by FC and Nageotte. To assess the precision of each method , we calculated the intra-assay coefficients of variation ( CV) , and followed the Bland-Altman methodology to study the agreement between the two methods. CV was 18.5 % and 26.2 % for the Nageotte and the FC , respectively. However , the agreement between the duplicate observations , using the binary cut-off threshold of 1 × 10 The absence of agreement between Nageotte and FC method , with the differences within d ± 2 sd being of high clinical importance , suggests that the two methods can not be used for clinical purposes interchangeably. The Nageotte seems unsuitable for quality control even with a pass-fail criterion , under real working blood bank conditions.
