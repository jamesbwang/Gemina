  Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) degrade extracellular matrix and are implicated in tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) pathogenesis and cavitation. In particular , MMP-7 is induced by hypoxia and highly expressed around pulmonary cavities of Mycobacterium<disease> tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. In this study , we evaluated whether administration of cipemastat , an orally available potent inhibitor of MMP-7 , could reduce pulmonary cavitation in M. tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We demonstrate that compared to untreated controls , cipemastat treatment paradoxically increases the frequency of cavitation ( 32 % versus 7 %; P = 0.029) , immunopathology and mortality. Further studies are needed to understand the role of MMP inhibitors as adjunctive treatments for pulmonary TB.
