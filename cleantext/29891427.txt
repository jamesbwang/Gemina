  Septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the wrist is a serious condition , yet little is known about its long-term outcome. A retrospective analysis of 22 patients treated for bacterial septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the wrist was conducted with subsequent follow-up of 18 patients with a median period of 44 months to assess functional results via DASH-Score and clinical examination. Arthrotomy was used to treat all patients; in 19 patients , multiple operations were needed to cure the infection. Follow-up revealed a mean DASH-score of 34 ( SD 22) and a significant correlation with needed surgical radicality and number of needed operations. The range of motion of the wrist and grip strength of the affected side was 49 % ( SD 20 %) and 70 % ( SD 28 %) of the contralateral side , respectively. In conclusion , septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the wrist leads to long-term functional restrictions with a strong correlation with the stage of the disease. Hence , early diagnosis and treatment are paramount.
