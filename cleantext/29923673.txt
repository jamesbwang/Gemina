  The 2.1-billion-year-old ( Ga) Francevillian series in Gabon hosts some of the oldest reported macroscopic fossils of various sizes and shapes , stimulating new debates on the origin , evolution and organization of early complex life. Here , we document ten representative types of exceptionally well-preserved mat-related structures , comprising `` elephant-skin '' textures , putative macro-tufted microbial mats , domal buildups , flat pyritized structures , discoidal microbial colonies , horizontal mat growth patterns , wrinkle structures , `` kinneyia '' structures , linear patterns and nodule-like structures. A combination of petrographic analyses , scanning electron microscopy , Raman spectroscopy and organic elemental analyses of carbon-rich laminae and microtexture , indicate a biological origin for these structures. The observed microtextures encompass oriented grains , floating silt-sized quartz grains , concentrated heavy minerals , randomly oriented clays , wavy-crinkly laminae and pyritized structures. Based on comparisons with modern analogues , as well as an average Î´
