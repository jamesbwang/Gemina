  An interface research method based on total internal reflection induced evanescent wave ( TIR-EW) is developed to monitor the adsorption behavior of azo dye at the silica-water interface. The monitoring system is constructed by employing silica optical fiber ( SOF) as both charged substrate for dye adsorption and light transmission waveguide for evanescent wave production. According to the change of evanescent wave intensity and followed by Beer 's law , the methylene blue ( MB) adsorption behavior can be real-time monitored at the silica-water interface. Langmuir adsorption model and pseudo-first-order model are applied to obtain the related thermodynamic and kinetic data. The adsorption equilibrium constant ( K
