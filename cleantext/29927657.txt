  To examine whether subsidized housing , specifically public housing and rental assistance , is associated with asthma in the Boston , Massachusetts , adult population. We analyzed a pooled cross-sectional sample of 9554 adults taking part in 3 Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys from 2010 to 2015. We estimated odds ratios for current asthma in association with housing status ( public housing development ( PHD) resident , rental assistance ( RA) renter , non-RA renter , nonrenter nonowner , homeowner as reference) in logistic regression analyses adjusting for year , age , sex , race/ethnicity , education , and income. The odds of current asthma were 2.02 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.35 , 3.03) and 2.34 ( 95 % CI = 1.60 , 3.44) times higher among PHD residents and RA renters , respectively , than among homeowners. We observed smoking-related effect modification ( interaction P = .04); elevated associations for PHD residents and RA renters remained statistically significant ( P < .05) only among ever smokers. Associations for PHD residents and RA renters remained consistent in magnitude in comparison with non-RA renters who were eligible for subsidized housing according to income. Public housing and rental assistance were strongly associated with asthma in this large cross-sectional sample of adult Boston residents.
