  Fumarase ( EC 4.2.1.2) is encoded in sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) by two genes ( FUM1 and FUM2) expressing correspondingly the mitochondrial and the cytosolic form. Both forms have been purified from sunflower cotyledons and characterized. Three quarters of fumarase activity is located in the mitochondrial and one quarter in the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic form has lower pH optimum than the mitochondrial form , it possesses higher affinity to malate , activated by Mn
