  Type 2 diabetes , coronary artery disease and hypertension are associated with anthropometric and biomarker traits , including waist-to-hip-ratio , body mass index and altered glucose and insulin levels. Clinical trials , for example of weight-loss interventions , show these factors are causal , but lifelong impact of subtle changes in body mass index and body fat distribution are less clear. The use of human genetics can quantify the causal effects of long-term exposure to subtle changes of modifiable risk factors. Mendelian randomisation ( MR) uses human genetic variants associated with the risk factor to quantify the relationship between risk factor and disease outcome. The last two years have seen an increase in the number of MR studies investigating the relationship between anthropometric traits and metabolic diseases. This review provides an overview of these recent MR studies in relation to type 2 diabetes , coronary artery disease and hypertension. MR provides evidence for causal associations of waist-to-hip-ratio , body mass index and altered glucose levels with type 2 diabetes , coronary artery disease and hypertension.
