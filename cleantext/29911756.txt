  About half of all patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> are diagnosed with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF). Until now , studies have failed to show that medical treatment improves the prognosis of patients with HFpEF. To evaluate changes in exercise capacity of patients with HFpEF compared to those with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) following an exercise training program. Patient data was retrieved from a multi-center registry of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> who participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Patients underwent exercise testing and an echocardiogram prior to entering the program and were retested6 months later. Of 216 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients enrolled in the program , 170 were diagnosed with HFrEF and 46 ( 21 %) with HFpEF. Patients with HFpEF had lower baseline exercise capacity compared to those with HFrEF. Participating in a 6 month exercise program resulted in significant and similar improvement in exercise performance of both HFpEF and HFrEF patients: an absolute metabolic equivalent ( MET) change ( 1.45 METs in HFrEF patients vs. 1.1 in the HFpEF group , P = 0.3). An exercise training program resulted in similar improvement of exercise capacity in both HFpEF and HFrEF patients. An individualized , yet similarly structured , cardiac rehabilitation program may serve both heart<symptom> failure<symptom> groups , providing safety and efficacy.
