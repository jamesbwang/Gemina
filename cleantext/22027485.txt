  This study examines the ways in which the public discusses and debates the scientific issue of vaccinations in the online social media environment of Facebook. We apply a mixed-methods approach , where a qualitative analysis is combined with a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of the debate on polio<disease> vaccinations in a Facebook group dedicated to parental and professional dialogue. The qualitative analysis suggested that dialogue became more political than scientific overall , yet the quantitative analysis showed that the discussants did not abandon the scientific nature of the issue at hand.
