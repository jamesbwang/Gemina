  To explore the role of cognitive reappraisal in the relationship between left-behind middle school student 's negative academic emotions and psychological well-being. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 434 left-behind middle school student aged 11-18 years old from January to February in 2016. In thisstudy , psychological well-being questionnaire , negative academic emotion questionnaire , emotion regulation questionnaire and background information questionnaire were used in team test. The psychological well being , negative academic emotion , emotion regulation and background variables were analyzed and compared by t-test , correlation analysis and regression analysis. The result of t-test showed , there was a significant difference that the psychological well-being of boys of the left-behind middle school student was lower than that of girls ' ( 111. 89 ± 24. 339 vs. 117. 97 ± 24. 292 , P < 0. 05 , d = -0. 251). The significant difference existed that both anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> of boys were higher than that of girls ' ( anxiety<symptom>: 19. 66 ± 4. 958 vs. 17. 99 ± 5. 242 , P < 0. 01 , d = 0. 327; depression<symptom> 13. 72 ± 3. 647 vs. 14. 96 ± 3. 736 , P < 0. 01 , d = 0. 270). The correlation analysis suggested that there was significant positive correlations between leftbehind middle school student ' psychological well-being and cognitive reappraisal ( r = 0. 246 , P < 0. 01) , the notable negative correlation was found between psychological wellbeing and negative academic emotions ( r = -0. 242 , P < 0. 01). Cognitive reappraisal had a significant negative correlation with negative academic emotions , but the correlation coefficient was lower than 0. 20. Regression analysis showed that , after controlling for age and other background variables , there was significant negative correlation between negative academic emotion and psychological well-being ( β = -0. 54 , t = -3. 03 , P = 0. 003) , and cognitive reappraisal had a significant moderating effect on the relationship of negative academic emotions and psychological well-being ( β = 0. 62 , t = 2. 10 , P < 0. 05). The simple slope test showed that there was a significant negative correlations between the negative academic emotions of low score group of cognitive reappraisal ( mean standard deviation in-1 or less) and psychological well-being ( simple slope = -0. 368 , t = -5. 04 , P < 0. 001) , but there was no significant correlations between the negative academic emotions of high score group of cognitive reappraisal and psychological wellbeing ( simple slope = -0. 149 , t = -1. 71 , P = 0. 089). The improvement of cognitive reappraisal of left-behind middle school student can reduce the negative correlation between negative academic emotions and psychological well-being.
