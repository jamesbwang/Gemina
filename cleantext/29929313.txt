  Long-term sea surface temperature ( SST) warming trends are far from being homogeneous , especially when coastal and ocean locations are compared. Using data from NOAA 's AVHRR OISST , we have analyzed sea surface temperature trends over the period 1982-2015 at around 3500 worldwide coastal points and their oceanic counterparts with a spatial resolution of 0.25 arc-degrees. Significant warming was observed at most locations although with important differences between oceanic and coastal points. This is especially patent for upwelling regions , where 92 % of the coastal locations showed lower warming trends than at neighboring ocean locations. This result strongly suggests that upwelling has the potential to buffer the effects of global warming nearshore , with wide oceanographic , climatic , and biogeographic implications.
