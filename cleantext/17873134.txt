  The Human<pathogen> Immunodeficiency<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infects cells<pathogen> in the Central<pathogen> Nervous<pathogen> System<pathogen> ( CNS<pathogen>) , where the access<pathogen> of antiretrovirals<pathogen> and antibodies<pathogen> that can kill the virus<pathogen> may be challenging. As a result<pathogen> of the early HIV<pathogen> entry<pathogen> in the brain<pathogen> , infected individuals<pathogen> develop inflammation<pathogen> and neurological deficits<pathogen> at various levels<pathogen> , which are aggravated by drugs<pathogen> of abuse<pathogen>. In the non-human primate model<pathogen> of HIV<pathogen> , we have previously shown that drugs<pathogen> of abuse<pathogen> such as Methamphetamine<pathogen> ( Meth) increase<pathogen> brain<pathogen> viral load<pathogen> in correlation<pathogen> with a higher number<pathogen> of CCR5-expressing myeloid cells<pathogen>. CCR5<pathogen> is a chemokine<pathogen> receptor<pathogen> that may be involved in increasing inflammation<pathogen> , but also , it is a co-receptor<pathogen> for viral entry<pathogen> into target<pathogen> cells<pathogen>. CCR5-expressing myeloid cells<pathogen> are the main targets<pathogen> of HIV<pathogen> in the CNS<pathogen>. Thus , the identification<pathogen> of factors<pathogen> and mechanisms<pathogen> that impact the expression<pathogen> of CCR5<pathogen> in the brain<pathogen> is critical , as changes<pathogen> in CCR5<pathogen> levels<pathogen> may affect the infection<pathogen> in the brain<pathogen>. Using a well-characterized in<pathogen> vitro<pathogen> system<pathogen> , with the THP1<pathogen> human macrophage<pathogen> cell<pathogen> line<pathogen> , we have investigated the hypothesis<pathogen> that the expression<pathogen> of CCR5<pathogen> is acutely affected by Meth<pathogen> , and examined pathways<pathogen> by which this effect<pathogen> could happen. We found that Meth<pathogen> plays a direct role<pathogen> by regulating the abundance<pathogen> and nuclear translocation<pathogen> of transcription<pathogen> factors<pathogen> with binding sites<pathogen> in the CCR5<pathogen> promoter<pathogen>. However , we found that the main factor<pathogen> that modifies the CCR5<pathogen> gene<pathogen> promoter<pathogen> at the epigenetic level<pathogen> towards transcription<pathogen> is Dopamine<pathogen> ( DA<pathogen>) , a neurotransmitter<pathogen> that is produced primarily in brain<pathogen> regions<pathogen> that are rich in dopaminergic neurons<pathogen>. In THP1<pathogen> cells<pathogen> , the effect<pathogen> of DA<pathogen> on innate immune CCR5<pathogen> transcription<pathogen> was mediated by DA<pathogen> receptors<pathogen> ( DRDs<pathogen>) , mainly DRD4<pathogen>. We also identified a role<pathogen> for DRD1<pathogen> in suppressing CCR5<pathogen> expression<pathogen> in this myeloid cell<pathogen> system<pathogen> , with potential implications<pathogen> for therapy<pathogen>. The effect<pathogen> of DA<pathogen> on innate immune CCR5<pathogen> expression<pathogen> was also detectable on the cell<pathogen> surface<pathogen> during acute time-points<pathogen> , using low doses<pathogen>. In addition<pathogen> , HIV<pathogen> Tat<pathogen> acted by enhancing the surface<pathogen> expression<pathogen> of CCR5<pathogen> , in spite<pathogen> of its poor effect<pathogen> on transcription<pathogen>. Overall , our data<pathogen> suggests that the exposure<pathogen> of myeloid cells<pathogen> to Meth in the context<pathogen> of presence<pathogen> of HIV<pathogen> peptides<pathogen> such as Tat<pathogen> , may affect the number<pathogen> of HIV<pathogen> targets<pathogen> by modulating CCR5<pathogen> expression<pathogen> , through a combination<pathogen> of DA-dependent and-independent mechanisms<pathogen>. Other drugs<pathogen> that increase DA<pathogen> may affect similar mechanisms<pathogen>. The implications<pathogen> of these epigenetic and translational mechanisms<pathogen> in enhancing HIV<pathogen> infection<pathogen> in the brain<pathogen> and elsewhere are demonstrated.
