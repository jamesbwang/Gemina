  In its course , diabetes impairs microvascular function through endothelial dysfunction. As the response of myocardial perfusion to sympathetic stimulation through cold is modulated by endothelium-related factors , an incipient endothelial dysfunction might be observed noninvasively by investigation of myocardial perfusion with a cold pressor test ( CPT). This approach has been used in clinical MRI previously. To assess endothelial function of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes by MR CPT. Prospective cohort study. Twenty type 1 diabetics and 20 healthy volunteers. 3T , dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion ( steady-state free precession). Absolute quantitative myocardial perfusion values at rest and under CPT. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine normal distribution of the results. T-test for independent samples. Patients ' mean myocardial perfusion was 0.68 cc/g/min at rest and 0.80 cc/g/min during CPT , respective values of 0.81 cc/g/min and 1.36 cc/g/min were found in healthy volunteers. Perfusion values differed significantly for CPT ( P < 0.01) but not for resting conditions ( P = 0.06). This study demonstrated that endothelial function might be impaired in type 1 diabetes patients. This fosters the thesis that endothelial function may serve as an early biomarker for coronary artery disease in patients with type 1 diabetes while these patients are still clinically asymptomatic. 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3.
