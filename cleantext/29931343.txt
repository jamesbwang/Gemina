  Prior studies suggest dental<disease> caries<disease> traits in children and adolescents are partially heritable , but there has been no large-scale consortium genome-wide association study ( GWAS) to date. We therefore performed GWAS for caries<disease> in participants aged 2.5-18.0 years from 9 contributing centres. Phenotype definitions were created for the presence or absence of treated or untreated caries<disease> , stratified by primary and permanent dentition. All studies tested for association between caries<disease> and genotype dosage and results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Analysis included up to 19,003 individuals ( 7,530 affected) for primary teeth and 13,353 individuals ( 5,875 affected) for permanent teeth. Evidence for association with caries<disease> status was observed at rs1594318-C for primary teeth ( intronic within ALLC , Odds Ratio ( OR) 0.85 , Effect Allele Frequency ( EAF) 0.60 , p 4.13e-8) and rs7738851-A ( intronic within NEDD9 , OR 1.28 , EAF 0.85 , p 1.63e-8) for permanent teeth. Consortium-wide estimated heritability of caries<disease> was low ( h2 of 1 % ( 95 % CI: 0 %: 7 %) and 6 % ( 95 % CI 0 %: 13 %) for primary and permanent dentitions , respectively) compared to corresponding within-study estimates ( h2 of 28 % , ( 95 % CI: 9 %: 48 %) and 17 % ( 95 % CI: 2 %: 31 %)) or previously published estimates. This study was designed to identify common genetic variants with modest effects which are consistent across different populations. We found few single variants associated with caries<disease> status under these assumptions. Phenotypic heterogeneity between cohorts and limited statistical power will have contributed; these findings could also reflect complexity not captured by our study design , such as genetic effects which are conditional on environmental exposure.
