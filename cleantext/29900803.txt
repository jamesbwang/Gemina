  John Hughlings Jackson , the 19th-century British neurologist , first described what are today called Jacksonian seizures<symptom>. He is generally associated with somatotopy , the idea that neighboring brain regions control neighboring body parts , as later represented pictorially in Wilder Penfield 's `` homunculus , '' or little man in the brain. Jackson 's own views , however , were quite different , though this is seldom appreciated. In an 1870 article , Jackson advanced the hypotheses that each region of the cerebrum controls movements of multiple body parts , but to different degrees , and that the `` march '' of movements that typically occurs during Jacksonian seizures<symptom> is caused by the downstream connections of the overactive neurons at the seizure<symptom> focus , rather than a somatotopic organization of the cerebrum. Jackson 's hypotheses , which were based almost entirely on his careful observations of movements during seizures<symptom> , are well within the range of current hypotheses about how the frontal lobe is organized to control movements and thus deserve renewed attention.
