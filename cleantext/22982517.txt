  Bacterial microcompartments ( BMCs) are proteinaceous organelles widespread among bacterial phyla and provide a means for compartmentalizing specific metabolic pathways. They sequester catalytic enzymes from the cytoplasm , using an icosahedral proteinaceous shell with selective permeability to metabolic molecules and substrates , to enhance metabolic efficiency. Carboxysomes were the first BMCs discovered and their unprecedented capacity of CO
