  Traditional methods to discover optimal reaction conditions for small molecule synthesis is a time-consuming effort that requires large quantities of material and a significant expenditure of labor. High-throughput techniques are a potentially transformative approach for reaction condition screening , however , rapid validation of the reaction hotspots under continuous flow conditions remains necessary to build confidence in high throughput screening hits. Continuous flow technology offers the opportunity to upscale the screening hotspots and optimize their output of the target compounds due to the exceptional heat and mass transfer ability of flow reactions that are conducted in a smaller and safer reaction volume. We report a robotic high throughput technique to execute reactions in multi-well plates that were coupled with fast mass spectrometric analysis using an autosampler to accelerate the reaction screening process. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions were screened in this system and a heat map was generated to identify the best reaction conditions for downstream scale-up under continuous flow. Here , high throughput experimentation reactions in 96-well plates were performed for 1 h at 50 째C , 100 째C , 150 째C , and 200 째C before diluting them into 384-well plates for mass analysis. With the aid of high throughput tools , 648 unique experiments were conducted in duplicate. The cross-coupling reactions were evaluated as a function of stoichiometry , temperature , concentration , order of addition , and substrate type. The hotspots from high throughput experimentation were examined using a microfluidic Chemtrix system that confirmed the positive reaction leads as true positives. Negative outcomes identified by these experiments were found to be true negatives by microfluidic reaction evaluation. Quantitation of product yields was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( HPLC/MS-MS).
