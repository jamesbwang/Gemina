  To describe 2 cases of gastric dilatation-volvulus ( GDV) in cats. To describe 2 unique clinical settings in which the disease occurs in cats , and to highlight the differences between GDV in cats and dogs. Two neutered female Persian cats were presented for evaluation of respiratory distress. Initial physical examination revealed tachypnea , dyspnea<symptom> , and a markedly distended and painful abdomen in both cats. Radiographs revealed a gas-dilated stomach and gastrointestinal ( GI) tract in both cats but were only diagnostic for GDV in 1 case. Gastric dilatation-volvulus was confirmed during exploratory laparotomy and gastropexy was performed in each case. Both cats were successfully discharged from the hospital. Gastric dilatation-volvulus in cats is a rare event and appears to occur in 2 clinical settings: in combination with traumatic diaphragmatic hernia ( as previously reported) and without a history of trauma or diaphragmatic hernia , as in the 2 cases reported here. Clinicians should consider GDV in the list of differentials for cats with respiratory distress and abdominal distension , even if classic radiographic findings are not present.
