  Reliable and valid assessment of burn wound<disease> depth or healing potential is essential to treatment decision-making , to provide a prognosis , and to compare studies evaluating different treatment modalities. The aim of this review was to critically appraise , compare and summarize the quality of relevant measurement properties of techniques that aim to assess burn wound<disease> depth or healing potential. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed , EMBASE and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of included articles using an adapted version of the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments ( COSMIN) checklist. A synthesis of evidence was performed to rate the measurement properties for each technique and to draw an overall conclusion on quality of the techniques. Thirty-six articles were included , evaluating various techniques , classified as ( 1) laser Doppler techniques; ( 2) thermography or thermal imaging; ( 3) other measurement techniques. Strong evidence was found for adequate construct validity of laser Doppler imaging ( LDI). Moderate evidence was found for adequate construct validity of thermography , videomicroscopy , and spatial frequency domain imaging ( SFDI). Only two studies reported on the measurement property reliability. Furthermore , considerable variation was observed among comparator instruments. Considering the evidence available , it appears that LDI is currently the most favorable technique; thereby assessing burn wound<disease> healing potential. Additional research is needed into thermography , videomicroscopy , and SFDI to evaluate their full potential. Future studies should focus on reliability and measurement error , and provide a precise description of which construct is aimed to measure.
