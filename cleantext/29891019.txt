  Advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma has a dismal prognosis. The optimal treatment for these patients remains under debate. This systematic review aimed to compare survival following surgical and non-surgical treatments. A systematic review was conducted of randomised studies , with a descriptive analysis of retrospective observational studies. Two randomised trials and 11 observational studies were included in the review. A meta-analysis of randomised trials reported a hazard ratio of 0.89 for overall survival in favour of surgical treatment ( p = 0.44). Neither treatment was favoured in terms of overall survival. Observational studies did not report a survival advantage with either treatment. The five-year larynx preservation rates for non-surgically treated patients were between 38 and 58 percent. Chemoradiotherapy offers similar survivorship compared to surgery in advanced disease , while also making larynx preservation feasible. It can be used as a treatment in all patients as an alternative to surgery.
