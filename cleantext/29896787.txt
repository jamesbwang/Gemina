  To evaluate the fracture resistance after the thermal and mechanical fatigue<symptom> of feldspathic , lithium disilicate , and resin-modified CAD/CAM monolithic crowns cemented onto a universal post abutment. A right second mandibular molar was designed in CAD/CAM software , and 30 crowns were machined using three different materials ( n = 10): feldspathic ceramic , finished only with a glaze cycle ( G1); lithium disilicate , sintered and finished with a glaze cycle ( G2); and resin , modified by nanoceramic and finished with rubber ( G3). All crowns were cemented under a constant 50 N load , the excess cement was removed , and the crowns were light-cured for 30 seconds. After being immersed in deionized water for 7 days , the crowns were submitted to thermal cycling , which consisted of varying the temperature from 2 to 50 °C for 350,000 cycles , and mechanical cycling in a fatigue<symptom> simulator , where a 250 N load was applied for 1,000,000 cycles at 2 Hz. The resistance of each crown was verified in a compression-to-failure test at 1 mm/min in a universal test machine. The groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test and Weibull statistics. The resin-modified group was the least resistant group ( 1755 ± 124 N) , followed by the feldspathic ( 2147 ± 412 N) and lithium disilicate groups ( 2804 ± 303 N). The Weibull statistics demonstrated that lithium disilicate is the most reliable material and has the lowest fracture probability. It was possible to conclude that all of the tested CAD/CAM materials can be used as monolithic , implant-supported molar crowns.
