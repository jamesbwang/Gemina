  This paper describes a novel model to providing interprofessional education ( IPE) and interprofessional collaboration ( IPC) within a simulated healthcare environment , in the higher education setting. The RIPE Model ( Reflective Interprofessional Education Model) was developed for the purpose of enhancing IPE and IPC , clinical judgement , and decision-making between health professional students ( pharmacy and nursing students) at the patient 's simulated hospital bedside. A foundation ` unfolding ' case utilizing the RIPE model was piloted with first year Master of pharmacy students and postgraduate nursing students at an Australian university and included a pharmacy practitioner acting as a resident medical officer ( RMO) for the purpose of the teaching module. The RIPE model rotated students through 10 stations ( including 2 reflection stations) to unpack an unfolding case. The development of the RIPE model , processes , and future directions are included in this article. The RIPE Model provides the flexibility to adapt and tailor different cases and scenarios to include other health professional students to enhance educational outcomes , with the feedback of the learning to potentially improve future patient outcomes. Furthermore , the model has the potential to be tailored and utilized for the purpose of upskilling practicing pharmacists for Continuing Professional Development ( CPD) and changing scopes of practice.
