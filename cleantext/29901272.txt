  The RNA chaperone , Hfq , is known to play extensive roles in bacterial growth and development. More recently , it has been shown to be required for virulence in many human and animal bacterial pathogens. Despite these studies little is known about the role Hfq plays in phytopathogenic bacteria. In this study , we show Hfq is required for full virulence of the crucifer black rot pathogen Xanthomonas<pathogen> campestris pv. campestris<pathogen> ( Xcc). We demonstrate that an Xcc hfq deletion strain is highly attenuated for virulence in Chinese radish and shows a severe defect in the production of virulence factors including extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharide. Furthermore , the Xcc strain lacking Hfq had significantly reduced cell motility and stress tolerance. These findings suggest that Hfq is a key regulator of important aspects of virulence and adaptation of Xcc. Taken together , our findings are suggestive of a regulatory network placing Hfq at the center of virulence gene expression control in Xcc. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
