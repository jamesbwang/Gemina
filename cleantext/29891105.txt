  To evaluate the clinical significance of mammographically occult additional tumors identified more than 2 cm away from the primary breast cancer on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). An Institutional Review Board approved review of consecutive preoperative breast MRIs performed from 1/1/08 to 12/31/14 , yielded 667 patients with breast cancer. These patients underwent further assessment to identify biopsy proven mammographically occult breast tumors located more than 2 cm away from the edge of the primary tumor. Additional MRI characteristics of the primary and secondary tumors and pathology were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ( v. 24). Of 667 patients with breast cancer , 129 patients had 150 additional ipsilateral mammographically occult tumors that were more than 2 cm away from the edge of the primary tumor. One hundred twelve of 129 ( 86.8 %) patients had one additional tumor and 17/129 ( 13.2 %) had two or more additional tumors. In 71/129 ( 55.0 %) , additional tumors were located in a different quadrant<symptom> and in 58/129 ( 45.0 %) additional tumors were in the same quadrant<symptom> but ≥ 2 cm away. Overall , primary tumor size was significantly larger ( mean 1.87 ± 1.25 cm) than the additional tumors ( mean 0.79 ± 0.61 cm , p < 0.001). However , in 20/129 ( 15.5 %) the additional tumor was larger and in 26/129 ( 20.2 %) the additional tumor was ≥ 1 cm. The primary tumor was significantly more likely to be invasive ( 81.4 % , 105/129) compared to additional tumors ( 70 % , 105/150 , p = 0.03). In 9/129 ( 7.0 %) patients , additional tumors yielded unsuspected invasive cancer orhigher tumor grade. The additional tumor was more likely to be nonmass lesion<symptom> type ( 37.3 % vs 24 % p = 0.02) and focus lesion<symptom> type ( 10 % vs 0.08 % , p < 0.001) compared to primary tumor. Mammographically occult additional tumors identified more than 2 cm away from the primary breast tumor on MRI are unlikely to be surgically treated if undiagnosed and may be clinically significant.
