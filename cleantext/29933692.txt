  We report a dual-responsive self-assembled monolayer ( SAM) on a well-defined rough gold substrate for dynamic capture and release of live cells. By incorporating 5 '- triphosphate ( ATP) aptamer into a SAM , we can accurately isolate specific cell types and subsequently release captured cells at either population or desired-group ( or even single-cell) levels. On one hand , the whole SAMs can be disassembled through addition of ATP solution , leading to the entire release of the captured cells from the supported substrate. On the other hand , desired cells can be selectively released using near-infrared light irradiation , with relatively high spatial and temporal precision. The proposed dual-responsive cell capture-and-release system is biologically friendly and is reusable with another round of modification , showing great usefulness in cancer diagnosis and molecular analysis.
