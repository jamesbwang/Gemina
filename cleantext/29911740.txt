  Fatty acid binding proteins ( FABPs) are 15-kDa proteins responsible for the transport of fatty acids both intracellularly and extracellularly. Consisting of 12 different isoforms , some of the proteins have been found to be released in the serum and to be correlated with various diseases including cancer. Differential expression of these proteins has been reported to result in cancer pathogenesis by modulating various cancer signaling pathways; hence , in this review , we present the recent studies that have investigated the roles of different kinds of FABPs in different types of cancer and any possible underlying mechanisms to better understand the role of FABPs in cancer progression.
