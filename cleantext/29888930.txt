  Interleukin ( IL) -6 is the main proinflammatory cytokine in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> ( SJIA). To determine if serial changes in serum IL-6 levels can predict outcomes of SJIA patients. This was a retrospective cohort study. Medical records of patients aged 2-19 years with active SJIA between January 2012 and February 2014 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics were recorded at enrollment. Serum IL-6 levels were measured at enrollment and at 2-4 weeks , 6-8 weeks , 3 months , and 6 months thereafter. Treatment response and clinical remission were assessed after 2 years of follow-up. Of the 35 patients with active SJIA , 16 were in remission at the end of the study. IL-6 levels in the remission group returned to normal within 6 months , whereas they remained persistently high in the non-remission group. At the 3-month follow-up , patients were assigned to groups A and B based on reductions in serum IL-6 levels of > 50 % and â‰¤ 50 % , respectively. At the end of the study , more patients in group A ( 72.2 %) than in group B ( 17.6 %) achieved clinical remission ( p < 0.05). After multivariate analysis , a > 50 % reduction in serum IL-6 levels at the 3-month follow-up visit was a predictor of clinical remission at 2 years ( odds ratio 22.74 , 95 % confidence intervals 2.16-239.85 , p < 0.01). An early reduction in serum IL-6 levels is significantly associated with clinical remission at 2 years in SJIA patients. Monitoring of serial changes in serum IL-6 levels is beneficial for predicting clinical remission.
