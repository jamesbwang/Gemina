  The purpose of this study was to examine the determinants of benefits and barriers and their relationship with physical activity ( PA) among predominantly Latino middle school students. Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 4,773 seventh-grade students recruited from a large , urban school district in Los Angeles. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to assess determinants of benefits and barriers as well as their association with self-reported PA.. Differences in benefits and barriers were observed by gender , ethnicity , and body size. Barriers were negatively correlated with all three PA outcomes while benefits were positively associated with exercising at least 60 min daily. A deeper understanding of benefits and barriers can facilitate the development of interventions and collaborative efforts among physical education teachers , school nurses , and administrators to implement comprehensive approaches that encourage students ' participation in PA inside and outside of the classroom.
