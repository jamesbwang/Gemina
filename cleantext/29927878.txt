  To determine whether the association between hyperoxia and increased risk-adjusted mortality in adult intensive care patients is also observed in a pediatric intensive care population. Single-center retrospective analysis of admissions to ICU over a 5-year period commencing January 1 , 2012 , examining the relationship between PaO2 measured within the first hour of admission and risk-adjusted mortality. Standardized mortality rates were calculated using the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 , and patients were grouped into 50 mm Hg ( 6.67 kPa) PaO2 bands to assess the relationship between initial PaO2 and risk-adjusted mortality. Tertiary PICU with 17 beds and 1,100 annual admissions located in metropolitan Sydney , Australia. A total of 1,447 patients 0-18 years old with PaO2 recorded at admission to the ICU. None. There were 5,176 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period and 1,447 ( 28 %) with PaO2 recorded at admission. A U-shaped relationship between raw mortality and admission PaO2 was observed , with lowest mortality ( 2.3 % and 2.6 % , respectively) observed in the 101-150 ( 13.5-20.0 kPa) and 151-200 mm Hg ( 20.1-26.7 kPa) bands and the highest mortality observed in patients with PaO2 less than 50 mm Hg ( 6.67 kPa) with mortality of 5.3 % , or greater than 350 mm Hg ( 46.7 kPa) with mortality of 18.2 %. Hyperoxia at admission was associated with an increase in risk-adjusted mortality , with polynomial regression indicating a strong correlation between PaO2 band and risk-adjusted outcome ( r = 0.845). When included in a multivariate model that included the Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 variables , the odds ratio for hyperoxia ( defined as PaO2 > 250 mm Hg ( 33.3 kPa)) predicting death was 2.66 ( p = 0.047). In this single-center study , hyperoxia at admission to the PICU was highly correlated with increased risk-adjusted mortality. Further investigation of these observations in a large multicenter cohort is warranted.
