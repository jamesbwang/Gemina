  Long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) plays a very important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors , and is a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 ( PVT1) and the prognostic significance in patients with colorectal cancer. The expression of PVT1 was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) in cancerous and adjacent tissues of 210 colorectal cancer patients. The disease-free survival and overall survival of colorectal cancer patients were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis , and univariate and multivariate analysis were performed by Cox proportional-hazards model. Our results revealed that PVT1 expression in cancer tissues of colorectal cancer was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues ( P < 0.001). High PVT1 expression was increased by 51.4 % ( 108/210) , which was significantly correlated with the tumor differentiation , the depth of invasion , the stage of tumor , node , metastasis ( TNM) , and lymphatic metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high PVT1 expression resulted in a shorter disease-free survival ( Log-rank test P < 0.001) and overall survival ( Log-rank test P < 0.001) compared with the low PVT1 expression group in colorectal cancer patients , whether at TNM I/II stage or at TNM III/IV stage. A multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that high PVT1 expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Our results suggest that high PVT1 expression might be a potential biomarker for assessing tumor recurrence and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.
