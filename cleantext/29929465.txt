  Historically , OCD has been considered to be associated with a relatively low risk of suicide. Recent studies , on the contrary , revealed a significant association between OCD and suicide attempts and ideation. A huge variation in prevalence rates , however , is reported. To estimate prevalence rates of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in individuals with OCD , and to identify predictors of suicide risk among subjects with OCD. We systematically reviewed the literature on suicide risk ( ideation and/or attempts) and OCD. We included studies with appropriate definition of OCD , cross-sectional or prospective design , separating clinical samples from epidemiological studies , that employed a quantitative measure of suicidality and/or reported an outcome measure of the association between suicidality and OCD or examined factors associated with suicidality. In clinical samples , the mean rate of lifetime suicide attempts is 14.2 % ( 31 studies: range 6- 51.7 %). Suicidal ideation is referred by 26.3-73.5 % of individuals ( 17 studies , mean 44.1 %); current suicidal ideation rate ranges between 6.4 and 75 % ( 13 studies , mean 25.9). Epidemiological studies found that OCD increases significantly the odds of having a lifetime suicidal ideation as compared to the general population ( OR: 1.9-10.3) and a history of lifetime suicide attempts ( OR: 1.6- 9.9). Predictors of greater suicide risk are severity of OCD , the symptom dimension of unacceptable thoughts , comorbid Axis I disorders , severity of comorbid depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms , past history of suicidality and some emotion-cognitive factors such as alexithymia and hopelessness. Overall , suicidality appears a relevant phenomenon in OCD.
