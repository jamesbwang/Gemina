  We report a case of a 59-year-old woman with peritoneal malignant mesothelioma and no previous exposure to asbestos with a diagnosis of bilateral ovarian serous borderline tumour with peritoneal implants one year before. We discuss the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings to explain possible and potential interactions between the two diseases. To our knowledge , the association of both serous borderline ovarian tumour and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma has never been described before in the same woman and in such a tight temporal connection. This finding raises numerous issues about the origin of the two tumours and further biomolecular studies are needed to fully understand the carcinogenetic process. From a clinical point of view , this case report can be useful to gynaecologists because it leads to recommend a careful examination of the peritoneal cavity during a surgical resection of borderline serous tumour. Moreover , it may suggest performing a close follow-up associated with a careful surveillance of the patient , especially in the case of micropapillary pattern , to oncologists. A complete clinical approach could help to detect sooner possible relapses or other metachronous malignancies.
