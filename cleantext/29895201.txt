  Although the p53 transcription factor has a well-established role in tumor suppression , little is known about how the non-coding targets of p53 mediate its tumor suppression function. Analysis of ncRNAs regulated by p53 revealed Neat1 as a direct p53 target gene. Neat1 has physiological roles in the development and differentiation of the mammary gland and corpus luteum , but its roles in cancer have been conflicting. To unequivocally understand Neat1 function in cancer , we used Neat1 null mice. Interestingly , we found that Neat1 deficiency promotes transformation both in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer. Specifically , Neat1 loss in the pancreas results in the enhanced development of preneoplastic lesions<symptom> associated with dampened expression of differentiation genes. While the exact mechanisms underlying tumor suppression are unknown , there are several described mechanisms that may be responsible for Neat1-mediated tumor suppression. Collectively , these findings suggest that Neat1 enforces differentiation to suppress pancreatic cancer.
