  The world is aging rapidly through `` demographic transition. '' The aging leads to CI Refers as Cognitive Impairment ( CI)- a risk factor for dementia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the elderly aged ≥ 50 years. The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction among the elderly and to identify the associated sociodemographic variables. This was a community-based cross-sectional study in rural and urban field areas of a medical college. Participants aged ≥ 50 years were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and screened for cognitive dysfunction using Gujarati version of Mini-Mental Status Examination. A score of 23 out of 30 was taken as the cutoff. Written informed consent was obtained from participants. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done using SPSS version 17 and Epi Info version 6 to identify significant variables. Of 560 participants , 140 ( 25 %) had CI. Rural ( 27.6 %) and female ( 29.8 %) prevalence was higher than urban ( 18.5 %) and male ( 19.1 %) prevalence. On multivariate analysis , age ≥ 60 years ( odds ratio ( OR): 2.98) and illiteracy ( OR: 39.8) had significant positive association with outcome; being employed ( OR: 0.18) , living with spouse ( OR: 0.07) , and living with spouse and children ( OR: 0.08) had significant negative association with outcome. CI- a precursor of dementia- has serious clinical and public health consequences. Awareness generation and capacity building of primary health-care workers and family caregivers are core control strategies.
