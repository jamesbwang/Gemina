  Topological properties of matters have attracted tremendous interest in the past years due to the scientific and technological importance. It is of great interest to discover the analogs of topological phases in molecular architectures , if the key constituents of the phases are properly mimicked. Using scanning tunneling microscopy , we demonstrate that quasi-1D molecular chains assembled from conformation-switchable dibenzo ( g , p) chrysene molecules show hidden antiparallel order analogous to the hidden antiferromagnetic order in the Haldane phase , a known topological phase of quantum spin-1 chains. This is realized by mimicking the spin degree of freedom with the intramolecular helicene chiral switches and by emulating the interspin antiferromagnetic coupling with intermolecular homochiral coupling. The discovery of the molecular analog of topological matters may inspire the search of molecular architectures with nontrivial topological properties.
