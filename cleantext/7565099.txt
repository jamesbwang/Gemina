  Adenovirus<pathogen> infections in humans are common and sometimes lethal. Adenovirus-derived vectors are also commonly chosen for gene therapy in human clinical trials. We have shown in previous work that homologous recombination between adenoviral genomes of human<pathogen> adenovirus<pathogen> species D ( HAdV-D) , the largest and fastest growing HAdV species , is responsible for the rapid evolution of this species. Because adenovirus<pathogen> infection initiates in mucosal epithelia , particularly at the gastrointestinal , respiratory , genitourinary , and ocular surfaces , we sought to determine a possible role for mucosal microbiota in adenovirus<pathogen> genome diversity. By analysis of known recombination hot spots across 38 human<pathogen> adenovirus<pathogen> genomes in species D ( HAdV-D) , we identified nucleotide sequence motifs similar to bacterial Chi sequences , which facilitate homologous recombination in the presence of bacterial Rec enzymes. These motifs , referred to here as Chi
