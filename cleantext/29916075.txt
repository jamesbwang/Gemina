  The availability of more specific dyes for a subset of endomembrane compartments , combined with the development of genetically encoded probes and advanced microscopy technologies , makes live cell imaging an approach that goes beyond the microscopically observation of cell structure. Here we describe the latest improved techniques to investigate protein-protein interaction , protein topology , and protein dynamics.Furthermore , we depict new technical approaches to identify mutants for chloroplast morphology and distribution through the tracking of chlorophyll fluorescence , as well as mutants for chloroplast movement.
