  Chemotherapy is currently one of the promising therapeutic methods for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , but the emergence of multidrug resistance ( MDR) is the greatest obstacle to efficient drug delivery for successful chemotherapy. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery holds great promise to promote intracellular drug delivery to reverse MDR. In this work , we used our previously synthesized ursolic acid ( UA) derivative , FZU-03,010 ( F3) , to prepare nanodrugs of F3 with different architectures and study the role of the structure on the physiochemical properties and the biological effects against A549 and its PTX-resistant A549/PTX lung cancer cells. Using different preparation methods , amphiphilic F3 could self-assemble into different structures such as nanoaggregates ( F3-NA) , vesicles ( F3-VC) , or nanoparticles ( F3-NP) with different physiochemical properties. The self-assembled nanodrugs could be utilized for the entrapment of fluorophores and showed different cellular uptake efficiencies. The cytotoxicity results demonstrated that compared with UA , F3-NA and F3-NP could suppress A549 and A549/PTX cells viability more potently at lower concentration. In addition , F3-NA and F3-NP could induce G1 cell cycle arrest , cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activation more efficiently than that of UA. Furthermore , F3-NA and F3-NP could effectively inhibit PI3K/Akt pathway and decrease the expression of Bcl-2 and the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors p-ERK1/ 2 and Cyclin D1 in both A549 and A549/PTX cells. In conclusion , our results suggest that the UA derivative F3 is more potent in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation , and F3-NA and F3-NP have the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for resistant NSCLC cells.
