  This study aimed to evaluate and compare the retention and stability of rigid telescopic and milled bar attachments for implant-supported maxillary overdentures. An acrylic resin model of the edentulous maxilla without alveolar undercuts was fabricated , and four implants were inserted in the canine and second premolar areas of the model. Two experimental overdentures were constructed and connected to the model with either rigid telescopic ( RTA) or milled bar ( MBA) attachments. Resistance of overdentures to axial and nonaxial ( anterior , posterior , and lateral) dislodging forces was measured to represent retention and stability , respectively. Measurements were made at the beginning of the study ( initial retention) and after 540 cycles of denture insertion and removal ( retention after wear simulation). After wear simulation , MBAs recorded significantly higher retention ( P < .001) and stability against anterior dislodging ( P < .001) than RTAs. RTAs recorded significantly higher stability against posterior ( P = .022) and lateral ( P < .001) dislodging than MBAs. Initial stability of RTA against anterior ( P < .001) and posterior ( P < .001) dislodging was significantly higher than stability after wear simulation. Retention of RTAs ( P = .020) and stability of MBAs against posterior ( P = .038) and lateral ( P = .020) dislodging after wear simulation were significantly higher than initial values. MBA was associated with increased retention of maxillary implant overdentures compared with RTA , while RTA was associated with increased stability compared with MBA.
