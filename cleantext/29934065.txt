  Renal artery ( RA) stenosis has been implicated in the pathophysiological mechanism for resistant hypertension. Despite the increasingly diagnosed frequency of hemodynamically significant lesions<symptom> , the value of RA revascularization remains controversial. Our group had previously demonstrated significant blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) reduction in a retrospective cohort of appropriately selected patients undergoing RA stenting up to 18-months of follow-up. We herein present long-term clinical outcomes data 5-years post revascularization on 26 subjects who continued follow-up at our institution. Retrospective analysis was performed on subjects who underwent RA stenting at our institution for hemodynamically significant ( ≥ 70 %) RA stenosis and systolic hypertension on ≥ 3 antihypertensive agents. Clinical outcome data for systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) , creatinine level and number of antihypertensive drugs was assessed prior to and then later at 6-12 months and 3-5 years post RA stenting. Mean age was 69 ± 9 years; 27 % ( 7/26) were male. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction was sustained at long-term follow-up ( 135/70 ± 18/11 mmHg) compared to initial reduction noted at 6-months ( 136/69 ± 16/8 mmHg; p ≤ 0.01 for both) and from baseline ( 162/80 ± 24/18 mmHg; p ≤ 0.001 for both). The number of antihypertensive agents also decreased from 4.1 ± 1.0 to 2.7 ± 2.1 ( p = 0.002) at 6-months and was sustained at long-term follow-up , 3.4 ± 1.2 ( p = 0.03) with no difference in renal function between short- and long-term follow-up compared to baseline. This study shows sustained benefit of RA stenting in BP reduction in an appropriately selected cohort with significant stenosis ≥ 70 % and uncontrolled hypertension on multiple medications on long-term follow-up.
