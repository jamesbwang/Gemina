  To evaluate factors associated with incident self-reported vaginal dryness and the consequences of this symptom across the menopausal transition in a multiracial/ethnic cohort of community-dwelling women. We analyzed questionnaire and biomarker data from baseline and 13 approximately annual visits over 17 years ( 1996-2013) from 2,435 participants in the Study of Women 's Health Across the Nation , a prospective cohort study. We used discrete-time Cox proportional-hazards regression to identify predictors of incident vaginal dryness and to evaluate vaginal dryness as a predictor of pain during intercourse and changes in sexual intercourse frequency. The prevalence of vaginal dryness increased from 19.4 % among all women at baseline ( ages 42-53 years) to 34.0 % at the 13th visit ( ages 57-69 years). Advancing menopausal stage , surgical menopause , anxiety<symptom> , and being married were positively associated with developing vaginal dryness , regardless of partnered sexual activity. For women not using hormone therapy , higher concurrent levels of endogenous estradiol were inversely associated ( multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.94 per 0.5 standard deviation increase , 95 % confidence interval: 0.91-0.98). Concurrent testosterone levels , concurrent dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels , and longitudinal change in any reproductive hormone were not associated with developing vaginal dryness. Both vaginal dryness and lubricant use were associated with subsequent reporting of pain during intercourse , but not with a decline in intercourse frequency. In these longitudinal analyses , our data support many clinical observations about the relationship between vaginal dryness , menopause , and pain during intercourse , and suggest that reporting of vaginal dryness is not related to androgen level or sexual intercourse frequency.
