  Understanding magnetic interparticle interactions within a single hydrodynamic volume of polydispersed magnetic nanoparticles and the resulting nonlinear magnetization properties is critical for their implementation in magnetic theranostics. However , in general , the field-dependent static and dynamic magnetization measurements may only highlight polydispersity effects including magnetic moment and size distributions. Therefore , as a complement to such typical analysis of hysteretic magnetization curves , we spectroscopically examined the complex magnetization harmonics of magnetic nanoclusters either dispersed in a liquid medium or immobilized by a hydrocolloid polymer , later to emphasize the harmonic characteristics for different core sizes. In the case of superparamagnetic nanoclusters with a 4-nm primary size , particularly , we correlated the negative quadrature components of the third-harmonic susceptibility with an insignificant cluster rotation induced by the oscillatory field. Moreover , the field-dependent in-phase components appear to be frequency-independent , suggesting a weak damping effect on the moment dynamics. The characteristic of the N&eacute;el time constant further supports this argument by showing a smaller dependence on the applied dc bias field , in comparison to that of larger cores. These findings show that the complex harmonic components of the magnetization are important attributes to the interacting cores of a magnetic nanocluster.
