  We investigated the status of glycemic control in elderly patients with cognitive impairment relative to the glycemic targets recommended for elderly patients by the Japan Diabetes Society ( JDS) / Japan Geriatrics Society ( JGS) Joint Committee. Our results indicated that use of drugs associated with severe hypoglycemia led to excessively lower HbA1c in many patients in categories II and III.
