  Understanding features that determine transglycosylation ( TG) activity in glycoside hydrolases is important because it would allow the construction of enzymes that can catalyze controlled synthesis of oligosaccharides. To increase TG activity in two family 18 chitinases , chitinase D from Serratia<pathogen> proteamaculans<pathogen> ( SpChiD) and chitinase A from Serratia<pathogen> marcescens<pathogen> ( SmChiA) , we have mutated residues important for stabilizing the reaction intermediate and substrate binding in both donor and acceptor sites. To help mutant design , the crystal structure of the inactive SpChiD-E153Q mutant in complex with chitobiose was determined. We identified three mutations with a beneficial effect on TG activity: Y28A ( affecting the -1 subsite and the intermediate) , Y222A ( affecting the intermediate) , and Y226W ( affecting the +2 subsite). Furthermore , exchange of D151 , the middle residue in the catalytically important DXDXE motif , to asparagine reduced hydrolytic activity â‰¤ 99 % with a concomitant increase in apparent TG activity. The combination of mutations yielded even higher degrees of TG activity. Reactions with the best mutant , SpChiD-D151N/ Y226W/Y222A , led to rapid accumulation of high levels of TG products that remained stable over time. Importantly , the introduction of analogous mutations at the same positions in SmChiA ( Y163A equal to Y28A and Y390F similar to Y222A) had similar effects on TG efficiency. Thus , the combination of the decreasing hydrolytic power , subsite affinity , and stability of intermediate states provides a powerful , general strategy for creating hypertransglycosylating mutants of retaining glycoside hydrolases.
