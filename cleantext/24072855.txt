  Multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease with different characteristics , and genetic aberrations play important roles in this heterogeneity. Studies have shown that these genetic aberrations are crucial in prognostication and response assessment; recent efforts have focused on their possible therapeutic implications. Despite many emerging studies being published , the best way to incorporate these results into clinical practice remains unclear. In this review paper we describe the different genomic techniques available , including the latest advancements , and discuss the potential clinical application of genomics in multiple myeloma.
