  The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) in association with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels , anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> and neuropathy. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving a total of 124 T2DM patients. Musculoskeletal pain was determined by self-reporting of painful body sites. Pain intensity was assessed using a scale of 0-10. Anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale. Neuropathy was assessed using the PainDETECT questionnaire. The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Fasting blood sugar ( FBS) was determined using the hexokinase method and glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) level was determined using turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay. The neck , lower back and head were reported as the most common painful sites ( affected in 60.5 , 60.5 and 56.5 % of patients , respectively). Pain in the lower extremities , including the knees , lower legs and feet , was more common compared with pain in the upper extremities. The pain measurements of number of painful sites and pain intensity did not differ significantly among patients with sufficient ( > 30 ng/ml) , insufficient ( 20-30 ng/ml) and deficient ( < 20 ng/ml) vitamin D levels ( P > 0.05). The pain measurements were identified to have no correlation with age , body mass index , FBS , HbA1c level , 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration , anxiety<symptom> or depression<symptom> ( P > 0.05). However , the pain measurements were correlated with duration of T2DM and neuropathy score ( P < 0.05). Further regression analysis demonstrated that the pain measurements were significantly associated with the neuropathy score ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , musculoskeletal pain in patients with T2DM was not associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration , but was associated with neuropathy score. This may encourage further investigations to assess the etiology of musculoskeletal pain in T2DM , and whether vitamin D supplementation and management of neuropathy would be of value as pain relief treatment.
