  A versatile platform for the development of new ultrasound contrast agents is demonstrated through a one-pot synthesis and fluorination of submicron polydopamine ( PDA-F) nanoparticles. The fluorophilicity of these particles allows loading with perfluoropentane ( PFP) droplets that display strong and persistent ultrasound contrast in aqueous suspension and ex vivo tissue samples. Contrast under continuous imaging by color Doppler persists for 1 h in 135 nm PDA-F samples , even at maximum clinical imaging power ( MI = 1.9). Additionally , use of a Cadence Contrast Pulse Sequence ( CPS) results in a non-linear response suitable for imaging at 0.5 mg mL-1. Despite the PFP volatility and the lack of a hollow core , PDA-F particles display minimal signal loss after storage for over a week. The ability to tune size , metal-chelation , and add covalently-bound organic functionality offers myriad possibilities for extending this work to multimodal imaging , targeted delivery , and therapeutic functionality.
