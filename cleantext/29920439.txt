  Enlightened by the emerging cell-ion detection based on ion-selective-electrode ( ISE) , an aptamer capturing and ISE transducing ( AC&IT) strategy is proposed on the porous graphene oxide ( PGO) decorated ISE ( PGO-ISE) , its performances in both cell and ion detections are examined by use of AS1411 targeted A549 cell detection and iodide-ISE as proof-of-concept. Firstly , GO flakes , exfoliated from graphite by modified Hummers method , are cross-linked by thiourea mediated hydrothermal process , to 3-dimension networked PGO which is identified by scanning-electron-microscope , UV-visible absorbance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; its enhancing effect for cell capturing is evaluated by microscopy. Then , PGO-ISE is constructed by drop-coating PGO film on the surface of ISE and followed by covalently anchoring AS1411. Electrochemistry measurements for different state ISE ( blank , PGO coated , AS1411 anchored and A549 captured) are performed by our home-made ISE-measuring system. It is demonstrated that the best cell-sensitivity in buffer is- 25.21 mV/log
