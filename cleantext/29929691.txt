  Unstable chest wall injuries can result from multiple rib fractures or a flail chest , and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Traditionally such injuries have been treated non-operatively , with mechanical ventilation when required , and pain management. Surgical treatment of these fractures is technically possible , and studies suggest improved outcomes , such as lower time on mechanical ventilation and length of time in the intensive care unit , compared to non-operative treatment. However , there are many challenges and controversies regarding indications for surgical fixation , patient selection , outcomes , and fixation strategy. Further research in this area is warranted to better answer these questions.
