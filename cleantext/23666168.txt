  Cystic biliary atresia ( CBA) is a relatively uncommon but clinically significant variant of biliary atresia. The presence of a cyst<symptom> in the hepatic hilum on imaging in an infant with cholestasis supports the diagnosis of CBA , but can also be seen in patients with a choledochal cyst-the main differential diagnosis in patients with CBA. The reported case outlines the clinical presentation and imaging findings in a patient with surgically confirmed and treated CBA and emphasizes the importance of distinguishing CBA from choledochal cyst<symptom> at diagnostic imaging given the disparate timing and type of surgical treatment necessary for successful management of these distinct entities.
