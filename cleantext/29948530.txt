  Accessing an autism diagnosis is a key milestone , both for an individual and their family. Using a qualitative methodology , the current study examined the views and experiences of ten autistic adults , ten parents of children on the autism spectrum , and ten professionals involved in autism diagnosis , all based in the United Kingdom ( UK). Interviewing these 30 respondents about the diagnostic process and subsequent support options , the goal was to identify aspects of the diagnostic process that are working well , and areas in which improvements are needed. Using thematic analysis , three key themes were identified: the process of understanding and accepting autism; multiple barriers to satisfaction with the diagnostic process; and inadequate post-diagnostic support provision.
