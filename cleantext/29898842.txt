  On May 20 , 2016 , US professional organizations in cardiology published joint treatment guidelines recommending the use of angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor ( ARNI) for eligible patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF). Using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry , we evaluated the early impact of this update on temporal trends in ARNI prescription. We analyzed patients with HFrEF who were eligible for ARNI prescription ( EF â‰¤ 40 % , no contraindications) and hospitalized from February 20 , 2016 , through August 19 , 2016-allowing for 13weeks before and after guideline publication. We quantified trends in ARNI use associated with guidelines publication with an interrupted time-series design using logistic regression and accounting for correlations within hospitals using general estimating equation methods. Of 7,200 eligible patient hospitalizations , 51.9 % were discharged in the period directly preceding publication of the guidelines , and 48.1 % were discharged after. Odds ratios of ARNI prescription at discharge were significantly higher in the postguideline period compared with the preguideline period in adjusted models ( adjusted odds ratio 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.06-1.57 , P = .01). However , there was no significant interaction between observed and expected ARNI use after guideline publication ( P The model suggested a small increase in ARNI use in HF patients being discharged from the hospital immediately after guideline release. However , the publication of national guidelines recommending ARNI use seemed to have little influence on the adoption of this evidence-based medication in the first 3 to 6 months.
