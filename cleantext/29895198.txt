  Although the use of sorafenib appears to increase the survival rate of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) patients , there is also a proportion of patients who exhibit a poor primary response to sorafenib treatment. Therefore , it is critical to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sorafenib resistance and find representative biomarkers for sorafenib treatment in RCC patients. Herein , we identified that a long noncoding RNA GAS5 was downregulated in sorafenib nonresponsive RCCs. GAS5 overexpression conferred sorafenib sensitive to nonresponsive RCC cells , whereas knockdown of GAS5 promoted responsive RCC cells resistant to sorafenib treatment in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically , GAS5 functioned as competing endogenous RNA to repress miR-21 , which controlled its down-stream target SOX5. We proposed that GAS5 was responsible for sorafenib resistance in RCC cells and GAS5 exerted its function through the miR-21/ SOX5 axis. Our findings suggested that GAS5 downregulation may be a new marker of poor<symptom> response<symptom> to sorafenib and GAS5 could be a potential therapeutic target for sorafenib treatment in RCC.
