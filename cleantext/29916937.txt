  Initially established in 1967 , the American Orthopaedic Association ( AOA) North American Traveling Fellowship was designed to promote leadership development , network creation , and knowledge exchange among emerging leaders in orthopaedic surgery , and it remains one of the AOA 's flagship tours. In 2017 , the fellows visited 10 academic medical centers on the West Coast of Canada and the United States , participating in leadership , academic , clinical , and team-building activities. On the tour , we formed countless new friendships and collaborations , including exceptionally strong ones with each other. Because the 5 fellows came from diverse social , ethnic , religious , political , educational , and clinical backgrounds , the group discussions were lively and engaging. We all agree that the friendships that were made , the experiences that were encountered , and the lessons that were learned during the tour are priceless and will never be forgotten.
