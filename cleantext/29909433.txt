  Fentanyl sublingual spray may be a viable alternative to intravenous ( IV) opioids for the treatment of acute<symptom> pain<symptom>. As patients with acute<symptom> pain<symptom> may include those who have limited prior exposure to opioids , this phase 1 , open-label , randomized , multiple ascending-dose study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , safety , and tolerability of multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-naïve participants. This article primarily reports the pharmacokinetics results. Study drugs were administered in four dosing cohorts: every 0.5 , 1 , 2 , or 4 h for a maximum of three doses per cohort. Eight fasted individuals per cohort were randomized to either fentanyl sublingual spray ( 100 , 200 , or 400 µg) or fentanyl citrate IV 50 µg ( 6:2 ratio). Blood samples were collected pre-dose through 24 h post first dose. A total of 98 healthy adults were enrolled and 96 completed the study. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased with increasing doses of fentanyl sublingual spray administered every 0.5-4 h. With multiple doses , systemic exposure increased relative to the first dose; shorter dosing intervals resulted in higher concentrations. Analysis of dose proportionality suggested that systemic exposure increased in a linear but slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation between the first and last doses of fentanyl sublingual spray was more pronounced with shorter dosing intervals. Dose-dependent fentanyl pharmacokinetics following multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray were well characterized in an opioid-naïve population. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02641340.
