  Tumor metabolism has been the object of several studies in the past , leading to the pivotal observation of a consistent shift toward aerobic glycolysis ( so-called Warburg effect). More recently , several additional investigations proved that tumor metabolism is profoundly affected during tumorigenesis , including glucose , lipid and amino-acid metabolism. It is noticeable that metabolic reprogramming can represent a suitable therapeutic target in many cancer types. Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) was the first virus linked with cancer in humans when Burkitt lymphoma ( BL) was described. Besides other well-known effects , it was recently demonstrated that EBV can induce significant modification in cell metabolism , which may lead or contribute to neoplastic transformation of human cells. Similarly , virus-induced tumorigenesis is characterized by relevant metabolic abnormalities directly induced by the oncoviruses. In this article , the authors critically review the most recent literature concerning EBV-induced metabolism alterations in lymphomas.
