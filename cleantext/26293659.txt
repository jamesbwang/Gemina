  Human trafficking is a serious violation of human rights , with numerous consequences for health and wellbeing. Recent law and policy reforms mean that clinicians now hold a crucial role in national strategies. 2015 research , however , indicates a serious shortfall in knowledge and confidence among healthcare professionals in the UK , leading potentially to failures in safeguarding and appropriate referral. Medical education is a central point for trafficking training. We ascertain the extent of such training in UK Medical Schools , and current curricular design. We sent Freedom of Information requests to the 34 public UK medical schools , which included a preliminary question on education provision , supplemented with follow-up questions exploring the nature , delivery and format of any education , as well as future curriculum development. There was a response rate of 97 %. A majority ( 72 %) of the schools did not provide trafficking education. 13 % of these did , however , offer opportunities outside the formal curriculum. 70 % had no plans to implement any education opportunities. Among the 28 % of schools providing teaching , 56 % integrated this within the core curriculum. 56 % only delivered this within a single year of the degree. 67 % provided some form of teaching in-person , while 78 % used a combination of methods. Medical education on trafficking in the UK is variable and often absent. To produce future clinicians who are competent and capable , there is a need for expanded education on trafficking and research into optimal curriculum design. The UK 's new Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner should work with medical schools to develop an educational strategy urgently to fulfil the UK Government 's plans and commitments. Both in the UK and around the world , human trafficking education presents a critical opportunity to address human rights and safeguarding to a generation of new doctors.
