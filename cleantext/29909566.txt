  Synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted 1-alkylpyrrolo ( 2,3-b) quinoxalines was accomplished through the reaction of 3-chloroquinoxalin-2-amines with internal alkynes in the presence of Pd ( OAc) ( Formula: see text) , NaOAc , and KOtBu in DMSO. This method afforded desired pyrrolo ( 2,3-b) quinoxalines in 65-92 % reaction yields. The minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration determinations against Micrococcus<pathogen> luteus<pathogen> and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> revealed that some of the synthesized compounds showed the same values compared to tetracycline. These compounds could be used in the future research for the development of new antibiotics.
