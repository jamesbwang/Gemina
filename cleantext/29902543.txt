  To identify contextual factors that affect self-management of diabetes with comorbidities , and to evaluate in what way these factors affect self-management effectiveness. A systematic review of literature considered English language articles published within Medline , PsycINFO , Pubmed , CINAHL Plus , and Scopus databases that focussed on individuals ' experiences of type 2 diabetes from primary intervention or observational studies. A realist evaluation approach was used to analyse themes identified within the literature. Context-mechanism-outcome theories were constructed to identify underlying contextual factors and to construct a model illustrating diabetes self-management effectiveness. Of 1519 articles identified , 30 met inclusion criteria. Adherence was found to be the common mechanism that ( within given contexts) determined self-management effectiveness. Limited financial resources were identified as the key context. Our model makes explicit a structural weaknesses<symptom> of diabetes self-management. Coping with diabetes in the context of people 's lives requires attention to issues that are often outside the remit of the person with diabetes , the health care team , and the health system within which self-management is located. Realist evaluations illuminate programme mechanisms and fine-tune context. They aid initial understandings of how an intervention or programme is thought to work , in order to influence and ( re) design ( new) programmes.
