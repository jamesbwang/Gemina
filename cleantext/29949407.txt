  High dietary sodium intake has been linked to alterations in neurally mediated cardiovascular function , but the effects of high sodium on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity ( cBRS) in healthy adults are unknown. To determine whether high dietary sodium alters cBRS and heart rate variability ( HRV) , and whether acute intravenous ( IV) sodium loading similarly alters cBRS and HRV. High dietary sodium ( 300 mmol/day , 7 days) was compared to low sodium ( 20 mmol/day , 7 days; randomized) in 14 participants ( age: 38 ± 4 yrs , BMI: 23 ± 1 kg/m Serum sodium ( 137.4 ± 0.7 vs. 139.9 ± 0.5 mEq/L , P < 0.05) , plasma osmolality ( 285 ± 1 vs. 289 ± 1 mOsm/kg H These data suggest that alterations in dietary sodium intake alter cBRS and HRV , but acute IV sodium loading does not alter these indices of autonomic cardiovascular regulation.
