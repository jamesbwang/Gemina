  Effective and efficient assessments of the site conditions are required for the sustainable management of landfills. In this study we propose an evaluation method to determine the degree of environmental contamination by the contest of heavy metals ( HM) concentrations in soil and plants ( Tanacetum vulgare L. , Carduus L. , Plantago major L.). We compared HM concentrations in the soil , leaves , stem and roots of those native plants. Content of HM in samples was at the same level in all localities , except content of Zn. These values confirm that the area is not naturally burdened by increased HM content in the soil , and also that the deposited municipal waste or the material used for reclamation and composting does not contain risk elements. The content of selected HM was monitored in plants naturally occurring in the area of interest. We can state that the content of individual HM was in the plant biomass at the same level. The measured values confirmed that the largest number of HM was in roots , then in stem and the least in leaves. In addition , specific indexes were determined: BAC , TF , CF , PLI and I
