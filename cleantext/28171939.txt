  There is significant disparity in the prevalence of cervical cancer globally , with low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) shouldering a disproportionate share of disease incidence and an even greater proportion of morbidity and mortality. Available resources for diagnosis , treatment and palliation of cervical cancer are inversely related to per capita income. While prevention and screening remain public health priorities , given the large number of women affected by cervical cancer , expanding treatment capacity should be included in any evidence-based intervention plan. Uganda , a country with a high incidence of cervical cancer , serves as a representative case study in terms of the challenges of diagnosis and access to treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. Providers and patients in Uganda are challenged by late presentation to care , limited training opportunities , cost-prohibitive diagnostic studies , insufficient access to gold-standard treatment , and under-utilized palliative care services. This review highlights the ways in which Uganda 's experience is typical of the continent at large , as well as areas where Uganda is unique. We describe the ways in which a small but dedicated group of gynecologists carefully use limited evidence and available resources creatively to provide the best possible care for their patients. We show that improvisation , albeit evidence-based , is central to the nature and success of oncology care in Africa ( Livingston , 2012). We argue that a `` recalibrated global response '' ( Farmer et al. , 2010) , particularly stressing the expansion of radiotherapy capabilities , could dramatically improve cancer care and outcomes for women in Uganda as well as in LMICs globally.
