  Antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines are one of the most promising strategies for rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) treatment. They act by inducing potent immune tolerance instead of generalized immunosuppression. Recently , we developed a novel antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 coding for chicken type II collagen ( CCII) and confirmed its potent therapeutic efficacy in an established rat model of collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA). Here we report the prophylactic vaccination efficacy of a single 300 μg/kg dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 against CIA incidence , severity , and onset. CCOL2A1 transcripts were detected in the blood of CIA rats 14-42 days after intramuscular injection by 300 μg/kg pcDNA-CCOL2A1. The expression of CCOL2A1 transcripts increased quickly on day 21 , peaked at day 28 , and then gradually decreased thereafter. Importantly , a single prophylactic vaccination of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 14 days before CIA establishment significantly reduced CIA incidence and severity , deferred its onset , and was as efficacious as the current gold standard drug , methotrexate. The marked effects on CIA incidence and severity closely corresponded to the expression of CCOL2A1. Furthermore , prophylactic vaccination with pcDNA-CCOL2A1 markedly decreased serum content of anti-type II collagen ( CII) immunoglobulin G ( IgG) antibodies , induced Th1-to-Th2 and Tc1-to-Tc2 shifts , and decreased the percentages of CD4
