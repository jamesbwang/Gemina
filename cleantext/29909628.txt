  The structural order of biopolymers , such as proteins , at interfaces defines the physical and chemical interactions of biological systems with their surroundings and is hence a critical parameter in a range of biological problems. Known spectroscopic methods for routine rapid monitoring of structural order in biolayers are generally only applied to model single-component systems that possess a spectral fingerprint which is highly sensitive to orientation. This spectroscopic behavior is not a generic property and may require the addition of a label. Importantly , such techniques can not readily be applied to real multicomponent biolayers , have ill-defined or unknown compositions , and have complex spectroscopic signatures with many overlapping bands. Here , we demonstrate the sensitivity of plasmonic fields with enhanced chirality , a property referred to as superchirality , to global orientational order within both simple model and `` real '' complex protein layers. The sensitivity to structural order is derived from the capability of superchiral fields to detect the anisotropic nature of electric dipole-magnetic dipole response of the layer; this is validated by numerical simulations. As a model study , the evolution of orientational order with increasing surface density in layers of the antibody immunoglobulin G was monitored. As an exemplar of greater complexity , superchiral fields are demonstrated , without knowledge of exact composition , to be able to monitor how qualitative changes in composition alter the structural order of protein layers formed from blood serum , thereby establishing the efficacy of the phenomenon as a tool for studying complex biological interfaces.
