  Genome-wide screens , proteomics , and candidate-based approaches have identified numerous genes associated with neuronal regeneration following central nervous system ( CNS) injury. Despite significant progress , functional recovery remains a challenge , even in model systems. Neuronal function depends on segregation of axonal versus dendritic domains. A key to functional recovery may lie in recapitulating the developmental signals that instruct axon specification and growth in adult neurons post-injury. Theoretically , binary activator-inhibitor elements operating as a Turing-like system within neurons can specify axonal versus dendritic domains and promote axon growth. We review here various molecules implicated in axon specification that function as signaling pairs driving neuronal polarization and axon growth.
