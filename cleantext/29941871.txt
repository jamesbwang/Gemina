  Comparison of sequencing data from a tumor sample with data from a matched germline control is a key step for accurate detection of somatic mutations. Detection sensitivity for somatic variants is greatly reduced when the matched normal sample is contaminated with tumor cells. To overcome this limitation , we developed deTiN , a method that estimates the tumor-in-normal ( TiN) contamination level and , in cases affected by contamination , improves sensitivity by reclassifying initially discarded variants as somatic.
