  Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance includes all renal disorders caused by a monoclonal immunoglobulin secreted by a non-malignant B-cell clone. Patients with MGRS do not , by definition , meet criteria for multiple myeloma , with haematological disorders generally considered to be monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Nevertheless , the renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> can be serious and require specific treatment. Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders , including the recently discovered C3 glomerulopathy. Development of C3 glomerulopathy in the context of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance after kidney transplantation is uncommon and very few cases have been published to date. We report on three cases of C3 glomerulopathy in the context of de novo monoclonal gammopathy after kidney transplantation.
