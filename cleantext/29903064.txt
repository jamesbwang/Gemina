  Correct classification diagnosis of diabetes is critical for timely and appropriate treatment , which partially depends on the multiple islet autoantibodies measurement and combined analysis. This study reports plasmon-enhanced fluorescence protein microchip method , a fast , high-throughput , and high sensitive method , to measure circulating islet autoantibodies. This method can achieve islet autoantibodies combined analysis within a few hours by using a few microliters of serum. Combined islet autoantibodies analysis improved discriminatory ability , especially the diagnostic sensitivity. Furthermore , by applying this method , we found 4 out of 6 diabetes atypical patients who were clinically highly suspected of having autoimmune diabetes but had a negative result of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody and insulinoma-associated protein 2 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were positive at least 1 out of 4 islet autoantibodies , largely reducing the rate of missed diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes and further validating its clinical value. This study shows the great clinical potentials of plasmon-enhanced fluorescence protein microchips.
