  The non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia<symptom> ( agPPA) is a heterogeneous diagnosis wherein some individuals have apraxia of speech ( AOS). When agPPA includes AOS , a tauopathy is the likely underlying pathology. Recently , ( 18F) AV-1451 was developed for the in-vivo assessment of tau. In this study , we compared patterns of tau tracer uptake in patients with agPPA with and without AOS. Nine patients with agPPA ( four without AOS) underwent tau positron emission tomography imaging with ( 18F) AV-1451. Uptake of ( 18F) AV-1451 was assessed as cortical to cerebellar crus ratio ( standard uptake value ratio) in cortical regions of interest measured using the MCALT atlas and compared voxel-wise in SPM12. Each patient was age- and sex-matched to three controls. The agPPA without AOS showed uptake in the left frontal and temporal lobes , whereas agPPA with AOS showed uptake in the bilateral supplementary motor areas , frontal lobes , precuneus and precentral gyrus relative to controls. The left precentral gyrus had uptake in agPPA with AOS relative to those without AOS. This cross-sectional study suggests that ( 18F) AV-1451 uptake in the precentral gyrus is implicated in AOS in agPPA.
