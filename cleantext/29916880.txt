  Create and validate diverticulitis surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> prediction scale. Surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> cause significant morbidity after colorectal surgery. An infection prediction scale could target infection prevention bundles to high-risk patients. Prospectively collected National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and electronic medical record data obtained on diverticulitis colectomy patients across a Healthcare Network-wide Colorectal Surgery Collaborative ( 5 hospitals). Patients with and without surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> were compared. Predictive variables were identified using logistic regression model; model estimates obtained through 1000 bootstrap replications for scale validation. A total of 1737 colectomies were performed ( 2010-2016): mean age 59.9 years ( SD 12.7) , 56.4 % female; 93.4 % Caucasian; smokers 16.3 % , diabetics 7.7 % , steroid use 6.0 %. Two hundred thirty-one ( 13.3 %) were presented to operating room emergently and 138 ( 7.9 %) with abscess<disease> at time of disease admission. Two hundred ninety-six patients underwent Hartman procedures , and 113 ( 6.5 %) received diverted primary anastomosis. Average length of stay was 6.9 days ( standard deviation 7.01) , 30-day mortality was 1.5 % , anastomotic leak rate was 3.1 %. Twenty-one percent of patients ( n = 366) developed a surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> Several predictors for infection were identified: obesity ( body mass index > 30) , advanced age ( > 70 years) , diabetes mellitus , preoperative abscess<disease> , open surgery , emergent operations , and prolonged operations ( > 3 h). Creation of protected anastomosis in emergent settings was associated with increased infection rates. Presence of more than 5 risk factors was associated with infection rates of 45.8 % ( c = 0.69). Patients with diverticulitis have high surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> rates due to nonmodifiable risk factors. Our Prediction and Enaction of Prevention Treatments Trigger scale can risk stratify patients for targeting surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> prevention bundles and outcomes risk adjustments.
