  Amyloid self-assembly is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , but so far , no anti-amyloid compound has reached the clinic. Macrocyclic peptides belong to the most attractive drug candidates. Herein we present macrocyclic peptides ( MCIPs) designed using minimal IAPP-derived recognition elements as a novel class of nanomolar amyloid inhibitors of both Aβ40 ( 42) and IAPP or Aβ40 ( 42) alone and show that chirality controls inhibitor selectivity. Sequence optimization led to the discovery of an Aβ40 ( 42)- selective MCIP exhibiting high proteolytic stability in human plasma and human blood-brain barrier ( BBB) crossing ability in a cell model , two highly desirable properties for anti-amyloid AD drugs. Owing to their favorable properties , MCIPs should serve as leads for macrocyclic peptide-based anti-amyloid drugs and scaffolds for the design of small-molecule peptidomimetics for targeting amyloidogenesis in AD or in both AD and T2D.
