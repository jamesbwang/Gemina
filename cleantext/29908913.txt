  The sorting nexin ( SNX) family proteins play an essential role in vesicular transport , cell signaling , and membrane remodeling. The SNX members SNX1/2 and SNX5/6 form dimers , and mediate endosome-to-trans Golgi network ( TGN) transport through coordinating cargo selection and membrane remodeling. It is well-known how a SNX-BAR protein forms a homodimer; however , it is less clear how a heterodimer is formed. Here a detailed expression and purification protocol of the SNX1/SNX6 complex , from both worm and human , is described. Keys to the successful protein production include co-expression of both genes , and inclusion of glycerol in the protein buffer. Solution studies suggest that SNX1 and SNX6 form a 1:1 heterodimer. The production of a large amount , high quality of the SNX1/SNX6 complex provides a basis for future biochemical and structural studies of the complex , and in vitro reconstitution of SNX1/SNX6-mediated transport.
