  Technological advances in engineering and cell biology stimulate novel approaches for medical treatment , in particular cell-based therapy. The first cell-based gene therapy against cancer was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Progress in cancer diagnosis includes a blood test detecting five cancer types. Numerous stem cell phase I/II clinical trials showing safety and efficacy will soon pursue qualifying criteria for advanced therapy medicinal products ( ATMP) , aspiring to join the first stem-cell therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency. Cell based therapy requires extensive preclinical characterisation of biomarkers indicating mechanisms of action crucial to the desired therapeutic effect. Quantitative analyses monitoring critical functions for the manufacture of optimal cell and tissue-based clinical products include successful potency assays for implementation. The challenge to achieve high quality measurement is increasingly met by progress in biosensor design. We adopt a cell therapy perspective to highlight recent examples of graphene-enhanced biointerfaces for measurement of biomarkers relevant to cancer treatment , diagnosis and tissue regeneration. Graphene based biosensor design problems can thwart their use for health care transformative point of care testing and real-time applications. We discuss concerns to be addressed and emerging solutions for establishing clinical grade biosensors to accelerate human cell therapy.
