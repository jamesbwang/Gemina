  Cutaneous melanoma derives from the tumoral transformation of melanocytes. These pigmented cells produce melanin prior transmitting it to the surrounding keratinocytes of the skin , hair and mane. The main function of melanin is to protect cells and their DNA from damage caused by ultraviolet light. Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer whose incidence has increased steadily in recent decades. Advances in basic research have resulted in a better understanding of the molecular and cellular events responsible for the initiation and progression of melanomas. In this review , we present an overview of the knowledge gained in recent years and show how recent advances lead to new targeted and more efficient therapeutic approaches.
