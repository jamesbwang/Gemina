  Impaired cognition and activities of daily living ( ADL) are core symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , but their relationship is unclear. To explore relationships between cognitive domains and functional ability during 5-year follow-up in persons with AD. We analyzed ALSOVA study data from 236 individuals with very mild or mild AD at baseline. The CERAD Neuropsychological Battery ( CERAD-NB) was used as a cognitive measure and Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study ADL ( ADCS-ADL) as a functional measure , analyzing the IADL and BADL sub-scores separately. Annual regression models and linear mixed-effect models ( LMMs) covering a 5-year follow-up period were used. Annually , the CERAD-NB total and especially Verbal Fluency , Clock Drawing , and Constructional Praxis were associated with the total ADCS-ADL and IADL scores increasingly yet modestly , and to a lesser extent the BADL score. In the LMMs , the same measures and MMSE were associated with ADL. Measures of executive function and visuoconstructive skills appear to be associated with caregiver-interview based ADL measure during the progression of AD.
