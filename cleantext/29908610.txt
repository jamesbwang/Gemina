  Feather keratin is a biomass generated in excess from various livestock industries. With appropriate processing , it holds potential as a green source for degradable biopolymer that could potentially replace current fossil fuel based materials. Several processing methods have been developed , but the use of ultrasonication has not been explored. In this study , we focus on ( i) comparing and optimizing the dissolution process of turkey feather keratin through sonication and conventional processes , and ( ii) generating a biodegradable polymer material , as a value added product , from the dissolved keratin that could be used in packaging and other applications. Sonication of feather keratin in pure ionic liquids ( ILs) and a mixture containing ILs and different co-solvents was conducted under different applied acoustic power levels. It was found that ultrasonic irradiation significantly improved the rate of dissolution of feather keratin as compared to the conventional method , from about 2 h to less than 20 min. The amount of ILs needed was also reduced by introducing a suitable co-solvent. The keratin was then regenerated , analyzed and characterized using various methods. This material holds the potential to be reused in various appliances.
