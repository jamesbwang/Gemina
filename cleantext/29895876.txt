  Observational study based on the 2012 community survey of the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study ( SwiSCI). To investigate work and wellbeing-related consequences of different return-to-work ( RTW) pathways after SCI. Community-based. Using a subsample of 243 SwiSCI participants , we determined whether a respondent had returned to the pre-injury employer , started with a new employer or had not returned to gainful employment post-SCI. For each pathway , descriptive statistics were provided and work and wellbeing-related consequences were examined with regression analyses. One hundred eleven ( 45.7 %) participants had returned to their pre-injury employer , 80 ( 32.9 %) had changed employers and 52 ( 21.4 %) had never returned to paid work post-SCI. Although returning to the pre-injury employer was associated with a shorter RTW time and a higher current weekly work time compared with starting work with a new employer , no significant differences were found with regard to current employment status and post-SCI work duration. Concerning wellbeing-related outcomes ( i.e. , income , quality of life and life satisfaction) , the two pathways did not differ. Although lasting RTW had beneficial wellbeing outcomes , the specific pathway initially taken ( i.e. , pre-injury vs. new employer) appeared less crucial. Although the two pathways seem equally viable , longitudinal data are required to corroborate the present findings , and future research needs to clarify the role of the client triage system and of vocational rehabilitation practices with regard to person-job match and its impact on job satisfaction and job performance.
