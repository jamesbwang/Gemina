  Skin trait variation impacts quality-of-life , especially for females from the viewpoint of beauty. To investigate genetic variation related to these traits , we conducted a GWAS of various skin phenotypes in 11,311 Japanese women and identified associations for age-spots , freckles , double eyelids , straight/curly hair , eyebrow thickness , hairiness , and sweating. In silico annotation with RoadMap Epigenomics epigenetic state maps and colocalization analysis of GWAS and GTEx Project eQTL signals provided information about tissue specificity , candidate causal variants , and functional target genes. Novel signals for skin-spot traits neighboured AKAP1/MSI2 ( rs17833789; P = 2.2 Ã— 10
