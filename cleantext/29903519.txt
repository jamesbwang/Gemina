  To assess clinical outcomes of patients with concomitant severe aortic stenosis ( AS) and coronary artery disease ( CAD) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) and percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) or surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG). Data were extracted from the multicenter OBSERVANT study. For the purposes of the present analysis , we included only patients with established stable CAD meeting any of the following inclusion criteria: 1) TAVI patients with CAD undergoing staged PCI or TAVI and PCI in the same session; 2) SAVR patients undergoing combined SAVR and CABG in the same session. After propensity-score matching , a total of 472 patients ( 236 per group) were identified. Among TAVI patients , PCI was performed prior to the procedure in 217 patients ( 92.0 %) , whereas concomitant TAVI and PCI were performed in 19 patients ( 8.0 %). At 3-year , there was no difference in survival between the two groups ( KM estimate of freedom from death for SAVR and TAVI patients of 0.742 and 0.650 , respectively; log-rank p-value of 0.105). The rate of MACCE was comparable between the two groups ( KM estimate of freedom from MACCE for SAVR and TAVI patients of 0.683 and 0.582 , respectively; log-rank p-value of 0.115). In patients with associated severe AS and CAD , percutaneous treatment ( TAVR and staged or concomitant PCI) was comparable to surgical treatment ( SAVR and concomitant CABG) with respect to the early and mid-term risk of death from any cause , myocardial infarction , stroke and unplanned revascularization.
