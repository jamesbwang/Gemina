  Human enteroids present a novel tool to study human intestinal ion transport physiology and pathophysiology. The present study describes the contributions of Cl Human duodenal enteroids derived from 4 donors were grown as monolayers and differentiated by a protocol that includes the removal of Wnt3A , R-spondin1 , and SB202190 for 5 days. The messenger RNA level and protein expression of selected ion transporters and carbonic anhydrase isoforms were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting , respectively. Undifferentiated and differentiated enteroid monolayers were mounted in the Ussing chamber/voltage-current clamp apparatus , using solutions that contained as well as lacked Cl Differentiation resulted in a significant reduction in the messenger RNA level and protein expression of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator , ( CFTR) Na Human enteroids recapitulate anion secretion physiology of small intestinal epithelium. Enteroid differentiation is associated with significant alterations in the expression of several ion transporters and carbonic anhydrase isoforms , leading to a reduced but preserved anion secretory phenotype owing to markedly reduced Cl
