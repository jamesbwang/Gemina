  A novel silica stationary phase was designed and prepared through thiol-ene click chemistry by functionalizing imidazolium based ionic liquid embedded C18 and an aryl sulfonate group for the mixed-mode liquid chromatography. The developed stationary phase was characterized by elemental analysis ( EA) , Fourier transform infrared spectrometry ( FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA). The chromatographic performances of the prepared column were investigated by reversed phase chromatography using alkylbenzenes and positional isomers , hydrophilic interaction chromatography using nucleosides , nucleic bases and flavonoids , and ion exchange chromatography using acidic and basic analytes. The stationary phase showed faster separation and better performance for these compounds compared to the conventional alkyl stationary phase , especially for the separation of positional isomers. The investigations about water percentage and pH of the mobile phase for retentions<symptom> provided information that the stationary phase offered multiple interactions with samples including hydrophobic , hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions. Moreover , improved separation efficiency of Qinghuozhimai tablet and vitamin B
