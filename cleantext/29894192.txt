  Supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs) have been used extensively as an effective model of biological membranes<symptom> , in the context of in vitro biophysics research , and the membranes<symptom> of liposomes , in the context of the development of nanoscale drug delivery devices. Despite numerous surface-sensitive techniques having been applied to their study , the comprehensive optical characterization of SLBs using surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) has not been conducted. In this study , Fresnel multilayer analysis is utilized to effectively calculate layer parameters ( thickness and refractive indices) with the aid of dual-wavelength and dispersion coefficient analysis , in which the linear change in the refractive index as a function of wavelength is assumed. Using complementary information from impedance-based quartz crystal microbalance experiments , biophysical properties , for example , area-per-lipid-molecule and the quantity of lipid-associated water molecules , are calculated for different lipid types and mixtures , one of which is representative of a raft-forming lipid mixture. It is proposed that the hydration layer beneath the bilayer is , in fact , an integral part of the measured optical signal. Also , the traditional Jung model analysis and the ratio of SPR responses are investigated in terms of assessing the structure of the lipid layer that is formed.
