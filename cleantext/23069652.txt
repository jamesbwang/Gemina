  Head lice , Pediculus<pathogen> humanus<pathogen> capitis<pathogen> , are obligate blood-sucking parasites. Phylogenetically , they occur in five divergent mitochondrial clades ( A , D , B , C and E) , each having a particular geographical distribution. Recent studies have revealed that head lice , as is the case of body lice , can act as a vector for louse-borne diseases. Here , we aimed to study the genetic diversity of head lice collected from Niger 's refugees ( migrant population) arriving in Algeria , northern Africa , and to look for louse-borne pathogens. Comparative head lice samples collected from indigenous population of schoolchildren ( non-immigrant) were also analyzed to frame the study. In this study , 37 head lice samples were collected from 31 Nigerien refugees , as well as 45 head lice from 27 schoolchildren. The collection was established in three localities of eastern Algiers , north Algeria. Quantitative real-time PCR screening of pathogens bacteria and the genetic characterisation of the head lice satut were performed. Through amplification and sequencing of the cytb gene , results showed that all head lice of Nigerien refugees 37/82 ( 45.12 %) belonged to clade E with the presence of four new haplotypes , while , of the 45 head lice of schoolchildren , 34/82 lice ( 41.46 %) belonged to clade A and 11/82 ( 13.41 %) belonged to clade B. Our study is the first to report the existence of clade E haplogroup in Nigerien head lice. DNA of Coxiella<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> was detected in 3/37 ( 8.10 %) of the head lice collected from 3 of the 31 ( 9.67 %) migrant population. We also revealed the presence of Acinetobacter<pathogen> DNA in 20/37 ( 54.05 %) of head lice collected from 25/31 ( 80.64 %) of the Nigerien refugees , and in 25/45 ( 55.55 %) head lice collected from 15/27 ( 55.55 %) schoolchildren. All positive Nigerien-head lice for Acinetobacter<pathogen> spp. were identified as A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , while positive schoolchildren-head lice were identified as A.<pathogen> johnsonii<pathogen> 15/25 ( 60 %) , A. variabilis<pathogen> 8/25 ( 32 %) and A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> 2/25 ( 8 %). Based on these findings from head lice collected on migrant and non-migrant population , our results show , for the first time , that head lice from Niger belong to haplogroup E , and confirm that the clade E had a west African distribution. We also detected , for the first time , the presence of C.<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> in these Nigerien head lice. Nevertheless , further studies are needed to determine whether the head lice can transmit these pathogenic bacteria from one person to another.
