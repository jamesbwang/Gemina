  Vanadium ( v)- catalyzed aerobic oxidation in aqueous solution shows high selectivity in the field of C-C bond cleavage of carbohydrates for chemicals with less carbon atoms. However , the pathway of C-C bond cleavage from carbohydrates and the conversion mechanism are unclear. In this work , we studied the pathway and the mechanism of d-glucose oxidation to formic acid ( FA) in NaVO3-H2SO4 aqueous solution using isotope-labeled glucoses as substrates. d-Glucose is first transformed to FA and d-arabinose via C1-C2 bond cleavage. d-Arabinose undergoes similar C1-C2 bond cleavage to form FA and the corresponding d-erythrose , which can be further degraded by C1-C2 bond cleavage. Dimerization and aldol condensation between carbohydrates can also proceed to make the reaction a much more complicated mixture. However , the fundamental reaction , C1-C2 bond cleavage , can drive all the intermediates to form the common product FA. Based on the detected intermediates , isotope-labelling experiments , the kinetic isotope effect study and kinetic analysis , this mechanism is proposed. d-Glucose first reacts with a vanadium ( v) species to form a five-membered-ring complex. Then , electron transfer occurs and the C1-C2 bond weakens , followed by C1-C2 bond cleavage ( with no C-H bond cleavage) , to generate the H3COO˙- vanadium ( iv) complex<pathogen> and d-arabinose. FA is generated from H3COO˙ that is oxidized by another vanadium ( v) species. The reduced vanadium species is oxidized by O2 to regenerate to its oxidation state. This finding will provide a deeper insight into the process of C-C bond cleavage of carbohydrates for chemical synthesis and provide guidance for screening and synthesizing new highly-efficient catalyst systems for FA production.
