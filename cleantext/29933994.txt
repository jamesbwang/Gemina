  Biological control with microbial antagonists is considered an alternative approach for controlling plant diseases. Trichoderma<pathogen> species are one of the potential fungal biocontrol agents in suppression of soil-borne pathogens. However , the mechanism and characterization of Trichoderma<pathogen> spp. in inhibiting different phytopathogenic fungi<pathogen> are largely unknown. In this study , we investigated the antagonistic potential of the endophytic fungus Trichoderma<pathogen> longibrachiatum<pathogen> T6 as a biocontrol agent against different phytopathogenic fungi<pathogen> and the associated antagonistic mechanism with bioactive substances. We found that the fermentation and crude extract of T.<pathogen> longibrachiatum<pathogen> T6 had a broad spectrum and potent activity inhibiting the growth of eleven phytopathogens evaluated , and of which , the inhibitory rate against Valsa mali reached 95 % at 5 days after incubation. Ten fractions and six sub-fractions of bioactive substances were obtained on silica gel G chromatography and Sephadex LH-20 columns. One of the sub-fractions ( coded sub-Fr.4 f) exhibited highest inhibition against the pathogen V. mail , with the inhibitory rate of 80.64 % at Day 5 of the treatment. Four key chemical inhibitors were identified: ( i) 1 , 2-Benzenedicarboxylicacid , bis ( 2-methylpropyl) ester ( DIBP) ( C
