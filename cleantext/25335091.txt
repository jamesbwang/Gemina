  This study aimed to determine the publication rate of oral and poster abstracts presented at the 2010 and 2011 Society of Gynecologic Oncology ( SGO) conferences as well as the journals that most commonly published these studies , their 5-year impact factor , the time to publication , and the reasons for nonpublication. Abstracts presented at the 2010-2011 SGO conferences were included in this study. We searched Google , Google Scholar , and PubMed to locate published reports of these abstracts. If an abstract 's full-text manuscript could not be located , an author of the conference abstract was contacted via email to inquire whether the research was published. If the research was unpublished , the authors were asked to provide the reason for nonpublication. The time to publication , journal , and journal impact factor were noted for abstracts that reached full-text publication. A total of 725 abstracts were identified , of which 386 ( 53 %) reached publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Oral presentations were published at a higher rate than poster presentations. Most ( 70 %) reached publication within 2 years of abstract presentation. Abstracts were published in 89 journals , but most ( 39 %) were published in Gynecologic Oncology. The mean time to publication was 15.7 months , with a mean 5-year impact factor of 4.956. A 53 % publication rate indicates that the SGO conference selection process favors research likely to be published and , thus , presumably of high quality. The overall publication rate is higher than that reported for many other biomedical conferences.
