  Control of cellular metabolism is critical for efficient cell function , although little is known about the interplay between cell subset-specific metabolites in situ , especially in the tumor setting. Here , we determined how a macrophage-specific ( Mϕ-specific) metabolite , itaconic acid , can regulate tumor progression in the peritoneum. We show that peritoneal tumors ( B16 melanoma or ID8 ovarian carcinoma) elicited a fatty acid oxidation-mediated increase in oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) and glycolysis in peritoneal tissue-resident macrophages ( pResMϕ). Unbiased metabolomics identified itaconic acid , the product of immune-responsive gene 1-mediated ( Irg1-mediated) catabolism of mitochondrial cis-aconitate , among the most highly upregulated metabolites in pResMϕ of tumor-bearing mice. Administration of lentivirally encoded Irg1 shRNA significantly reduced peritoneal tumors. This resulted in reductions in OXPHOS and OXPHOS-driven production of ROS in pResMϕ and ROS-mediated MAPK activation in tumor cells. Our findings demonstrate that tumors profoundly alter pResMϕ metabolism , leading to the production of itaconic acid , which potentiates tumor growth. Monocytes isolated from ovarian carcinoma patients ' ascites fluid expressed significantly elevated levels of IRG1. Therefore , IRG1 in pResMϕ represents a potential therapeutic target for peritoneal tumors.
