  ABSTRACTIntroduction: There is still a need for short , practical , and daily-appropriate scales to distinguish between normal cognitive aging , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) , or dementia for patients with memory complaints. This study aimed to determine validity and reliability of AD8 ( Dementia Screening Interview) to detect both MCI and dementia in Turkish geriatric outpatients. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed in 334 patients , who attended with their informants to the geriatric outpatient clinic for memory complaints. In addition to the AD8 , they were screened using Clinical Dementia Rating scale ( CDR) and Mini-Mental State Examination. The diagnosis of dementia and MCI was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- fifth edition ( DSM-5) criteria. The mean age of the patients was 74.5 ± 8.5. Of them , 156 were considered as non-cognitive impairment , 60 as MCI , and 118 as dementia. Cronbach 's α value of the AD8 was 0.928. The total AD8 scores were found to be negatively correlated with the MMSE scores ( r = -0.801) , and positively correlated with CDR score ( r = 0.879) ( p < 0.001 , for each). The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve was 0.979 for cognitive impairment , and 0.999 for dementia. We found that AD8 can show dementia and MCI when the cut-off values are ≥ 5 and 3-4 , respectively , with a sensitivity of 100 % and 81.67 % and specificity of 96.3 % and 93.59 %. AD8 is one of the fast , simple , and sensitive screening methods for detecting both minor and major cognitive impairments. With regard to these features , it can be used in older adults attending the primary care settings with memory complaints.
