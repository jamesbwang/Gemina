  Perfluorooctane sulfonamide ( FOSA) is an important perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) precursor used for commercial applications. In order to investigate the transformation and responses of selected antioxidant and degradation enzymes of FOSA in the plants , in vivo exposure of soybean ( Glycine max L. Merrill) and pumpkin ( Cucurbita maxima L.) were conducted in the solution-plant microcosms. FOSA was readily taken up by soybean and pumpkin roots and translocated to shoots , and metabolized to PFOS , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS) and perfluorobutane sulfonate ( PFBS). Although morphological and biomass effects were not visible , significant changes in oxidative stress response were observed except for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS). Superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and peroxidase ( POD) activities were significantly increased by 19.2-30.8 % and 19.2-20.7 % in soybean ( 8-12 d) respectively , and increased by 39.2-92.8 % and 21.1-37.6 % in pumpkin ( 3-12 d) respectively , suggesting an activation of the antioxidant defense system in the plants exposed to FOSA. Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST) activities were decreased in soybean ( 2-12 d) with 9.0-36.1 % inhibition and increased in pumpkin ( 3-12 d) with 22.5-47.3 % activation respectively; cytochrome P450 ( CYP450) activities were increased markedly in soybean and pumpkin with 13.2-53.6 % and 26.7-50.2 % activation respectively , giving indirect evidences on the involvement of CYP450 and GST in degradation of FOSA in plants.
