  The present study included a total of 111 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary computed tomography ( CT) angiography , using a first-generation dual-source CT with automatic tube potential selection and tube current modulation. Body<symptom> weight ( BW) and body mass index ( BMI) were recorded prior to CT examinations. Image noise and attenuation of the proximal ascending aorta ( AA) and descending aorta ( DA) at the middle level of the left ventricle were measured. Correlations between BW , BMI and objective image quality were evaluated using linear regression. In addition , two subgroups based on BMI ( BMI â‰¤ 25 and > 25 kg/m
