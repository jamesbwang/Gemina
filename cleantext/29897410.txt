  Regulation of proteolysis plays a critical role in a myriad of important cellular processes. The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this , we have developed iProt-Sub , a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly , iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor , PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases ( 4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes , including local amino acid sequence profile , secondary structure , solvent accessibility and native disorder , which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites , and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.
