  We investigated whether the change in the neutrophil lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR) from the first to the last repeat prostate biopsy ( ﾎ年LR) could be the diagnostic tool or not for prostate cancer ( PCa) detection. We retrospectively evaluated medical records of men who had undergone repeat prostate biopsy. The investigated parameters were white blood cell , neutrophil , lymphocyte<symptom> counts , NLR at the last prostate biopsy , ﾎ年LR , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) , PSA density ( PSAD) , and PSA velocity. Exclusion criteria were the presence of cancers other than prostate origin , medication , and diseases which induce the change of NLR. A total of 301 men who had undergone repeat prostate biopsy were selected for this study. After applying exclusion criteria , 223 patients were included. Of these patients , 94 were diagnosed with PCa ( Group I) and 129 with no malignancy ( Group II). Only a single patient had metastasis. On evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of all study parameters , ﾎ年LR was the most accurate marker , followed by PSAD and then NLR measured at the last biopsy. ﾎ年LR was the most accurate marker to improve the total predictive value in repeat prostate biopsy for diagnosing PCa.
