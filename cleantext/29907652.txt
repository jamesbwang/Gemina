  Many patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> continue cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) after continuous flow left ventricular assist device ( CF-LVAD) implant. We report the first multicenter study to assess the impact of CRT on clinical outcomes in CF-LVAD patients. Analysis was performed on 488 patients ( 58 ± 13 years , 81 % male) with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD) ( n = 223) or CRT-D ( n = 265) who underwent CF-LVAD implantation at 5 centers from 2007 to 2015. Effects of CRT on mortality , hospitalizations , and ventricular arrhythmia incidence were compared against CF-LVAD patients with an ICD alone. Baseline differences were noted between the 2 groups in age ( 60 ± 12 versus 55 ± 14 , In this large , multicenter CF-LVAD cohort , continued CRT was not associated with improved survival , hospitalizations , incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and ICD therapies , and was related to a significantly higher number of pulse generator changes.
