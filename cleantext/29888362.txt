  In this communication , we investigate optically activated delayed fluorescence ( OADF) from DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters ( DNA-AgNCs) at the single molecule level , and we probe the heterogeneity in the primary fluorescence ( PF) intensity , NIR induced secondary fluorescence ( SF) intensity and SF/PF ratio. Our experiments reveal a heterogeneous distribution in the SF/PF ratio , indicating that engineering of DNA-AgNCs towards a high SF/PF ratio and high OADF signal for background-free imaging might be possible.
