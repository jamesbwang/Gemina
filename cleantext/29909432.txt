  Sildenafil was the first selective drug available on the market as oral therapy for erectile dysfunction ( ED). A novel sildenafil orodispersible film ( ODF) for ED treatment , containing sildenafil citrate , has recently been marketed. Study objective was to investigate sildenafil bioavailability of the novel ODF formulation after sublingual and supralingual administration. In this randomised , two-way cross-over study , 12 healthy male volunteers received a single 50 mg sildenafil dose by the sublingual and supralingual administration routes. Plasma sildenafil was determined up to 12 h post-dose. Peak concentration ( C Sublingual and supralingual administration can be claimed equivalent regarding the extent of sildenafil exposure since AUC In healthy men , sublingual and supralingual administration of sildenafil ODF resulted in a remarkably similar pharmacokinetic profile and confirmed the safety of both study treatments. The recently marketed sildenafil ODF , administered by both investigated routes , can provide a valuable alternative to the marketed solid oral forms ( tablets) in ED treatment.
