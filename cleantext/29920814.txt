  The present work is a brief overview of the effect of psychostimulant drug mephedrone hydrochloride ( 4MMC) on a transport protein , bovine serum albumin ( BSA). The binding effect of 4MMC on BSA has been investigated by using UV-visible , steady-state fluorescence , time-resolved fluorescence , fluorescence resonance energy transfer , Fourier transform infrared , circular dichroism , and molecular docking method. 4-Methylmephedrone quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA by static quenching mechanism , which was further confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence. The absorption spectrum of BSA in the presence of various concentrations of 4MMC reveals the change in the absorption bands of BSA-4MMC complex. The binding constant between 4MMC and BSA was calculated to be of the order of 10
