  This retrospective study investigated the effect of smoking cessation intervention ( SCI) among university students in China.Around 192 eligible smokers among university students were included , and were assigned to an intervention group ( n = 100) , and a control group ( n = 92). All included subjects in both groups were recommended to increase fruits and vegetables consumptions. Additionally , participants in the intervention group also underwent SCI therapy for a total of 4 weeks. The outcome measurements consisted of a number of students quit smoking , daily cigarettes , quit attempts , mean days of smoking in the past 30 days , and also stage of change.After 4-week treatment , SCI neither can decrease the number of students quit smoking ( P = .21) , daily cigarettes ( P = .21) , quit attempts ( P = .07) , and mean days of smoking in past 30 days ( P = .77) , nor can enhance the stage of change ( precontemplation , P = .18; contemplation , P = .59; preparation , P = .46). The results of this study showed that after 4-week therapy , SCI may be ineffective for smokers among university students in Chinese.
