  BACKGROUND Noninvasive assessment of the fractional flow reserve ( FFR) in patients with coronary artery disease plays an important role in determining the need for revascularization. It is particularly relevant for patients with a borderline stenoses and painless myocardial ischemia. Our article describes the first clinical experience in the Russian Federation of using an automated method of noninvasive assessment of the fractional flow reserve ( FFRct) with a one-dimensional ( 1-D) mathematical model in a patient with painless myocardial ischemia. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old male patient who underwent stent implantation in the left circumflex coronary artery ( LCX) due to an acute non-ST-elevation posterior myocardial infarction had borderline stenoses of the left anterior descending artery ( LAD). After stent implantation , there were no relapse angina symptoms on drug treatment , and according to our examination guideline for patients with borderline stenoses , a treadmill test was performed. The test was positive; therefore , FFR assessment was recommended , with coronary multi-slice CT being performed. The following results were obtained: FFRct LAD- 0.57; FFRct LCX- 0.88. An invasive assessment of FFR was also performed as a reference standard and revealed: FFR LAD- 0.6; FFR LCX- 0.88 , and simultaneously a LAD percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) was performed. Three months later , the patient underwent a stress test , which revealed no evidence of induced ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Our method of noninvasive assessment of FFR has shown encouraging results , but we believe that larger-scale studies are needed to establish it as common clinical practice.
