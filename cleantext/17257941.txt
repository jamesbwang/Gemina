  Thoracoabdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> ( TAAA) present special challenges for repair due to their extent , their distinctive pathology , and the fact that they typically cross the ostia of one or more visceral branch vessels. Historically , the established treatment for TAAA was open surgical repair , with the first procedure reported in 1955. Endovascular repair of TAAA with fenestrated and/ or branched endografts , has been studied since the beginning of the current century as a means of mechanical aneurysm<disease> exclusion. More recently , flow modulator stents have been employed with the aim at reducing shear stress on aortic aneurysmal wall. In this review we present technical and main results of these techniques , based on literature review and personal experience.
