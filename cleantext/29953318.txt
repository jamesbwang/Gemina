  The major limitations of growth curve mixture models for HIV/AIDS data are the usual assumptions of normality and monophasic curves within latent classes. This article addresses these limitations by using non-normal skewed distributions and multiphasic patterns for outcomes of prospective studies. For such outcomes , new skew-t ( ST) distributions are proposed for modeling heterogeneous growth trajectories , which exhibit not abrupt but gradual multiphasic changes from a declining trend to an increasing trend over time. We assess these clinically important features of longitudinal HIV/AIDS data using the bent-cable framework within a context of a joint modeling of time-to-event process and response process. A real dataset from an AIDS clinical study is used to illustrate the proposed methods.
