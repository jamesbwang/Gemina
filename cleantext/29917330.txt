  Developing methylotrophic bacteria into cell factories that meet the chemical demand of the future could be both economical and environmentally friendly. Methane is not only an abundant , low-cost resource but also a potent greenhouse gas , the capture of which could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rational strain design workflows rely on the availability of carefully combined knowledge often in the form of genome-scale metabolic models to construct high-producer organisms. In this review , the authors present the most recent genome-scale metabolic models in aerobic methylotrophy and their applications. Further , the authors present models for the study of anaerobic methanotrophy through reverse methanogenesis and suggest organisms that may be of interest for expanding one-carbon industrial biotechnology. Metabolic models of methylotrophs are scarce , yet they are important first steps toward rational strain-design in these organisms.
