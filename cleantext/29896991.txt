  Schwannomas are tumours that arise from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve sheath and rarely occur in the retroperitoneum. We report a 45-year-old woman who presented with a 2-year history of continuous progressive right-sided lower back and dull flank pain radiating into her posterolateral thigh. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a homogenous soft-tissue tumour with thick capsular lining , which lay in the right retroperitoneum. The tumour was removed at surgery. A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of benign encapsulated cellular schwannoma. Complete tumour excision should be regarded as the treatment of choice for benign retroperitoneal schwannomas. Successful treatment of these tumours requires thorough preoperative planning and a multidisciplinary approach.
