  Many disease-causing mutations impair protein stability. Here , we explore a thermodynamic strategy to correct the disease-causing F508del mutation in the human cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( hCFTR). F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 ( hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly , we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 Â°C. Furthermore , nucleotides that increase open-channel probability , which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1 , thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore , stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR. These results indicate that high-affinity binding of a small molecule to a remote site can correct a disease-causing mutation. We propose that the strategies described here should be applicable to identifying small molecules to help manage other human<disease> diseases<disease> caused by mutations that destabilize native protein conformation.
