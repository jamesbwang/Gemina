  Laser Doppler flowmetry ( LDF) is a noninvasive method for blood flow ( BF) measurement , which makes it preferable for measuring microcirculatory alterations of the spinal cord. In this article , our goal was to use both Laser Doppler imaging and monitoring to analyze the change of BF after spinal cord injury. Both the laser Doppler image scanner and the probe/monitor were being employed to obtain each readout. The data of LDPI provided a local distribution of BF , which gave an overview of perfusion around the injury site and made it accessible for comparative analysis of BF among different locations. By intensely measuring the probing area over a period of time , a combined probe was used to simultaneously measure the BF and oxygen saturation of the spinal cord , showing overall spinal cord perfusion and oxygen supply. LDF itself has a few limitations , such as relative flux , sensitivity to movement , and biological zero signal. However , the technology has been applied in clinical and experimental study due to its simple setup and rapid measurement of BF.
