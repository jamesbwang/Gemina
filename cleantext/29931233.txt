  Chemical shifts ( CS) are an important source of structural information of macromolecules such as RNA. In addition to the scarce availability of CS for RNA , the observed values are prone to errors due to a wrong re-calibration or miss assignments. Different groups have dedicated their efforts to correct CS systematic errors on RNA. Despite this , there are not automated and freely available algorithms for correct assignments of RNA 13C CS before their deposition to the BMRB or re-reference already deposited CS with systematic errors. Based on an existent method we have implemented an open source python module to correct 13C CS ( from here on 13Cexp) systematic errors of RNAs and then return the results in 3 formats including the nmrstar one.
