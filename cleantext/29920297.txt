  This longitudinal pilot study examined whether baseline resting frontal electroencephalographic ( EEG) asymmetry correlates with depressive symptoms during the most impaired two-week period in the following year. Current-source-density ( CSD) transformed resting frontal EEG asymmetry , severity of depression<symptom> symptoms ( Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory- II) , and stress ( indexed by negative life events; NLE) were recorded in never-depressed young adults with no current DSM-IV diagnosis ( 38 women , 16 men) at baseline. One year later , depression<symptom> symptoms and NLEs experienced during the interim were assessed. Individuals who reported greater interim NLEs also endorsed interim higher depression<symptom> symptoms , a pattern that replicated when first accounting for baseline stress and depression<symptom> For women , higher depression<symptom> reported at follow-up was linked to lower left than right frontal EEG activity at baseline , a pattern that replicated when first accounting for depressive symptoms at baseline. Despite the modest sample size of the present analysis , findings are consistent with prior reports of sex differences in patterns of brain laterality and support the idea that CSD-referenced EEG asymmetry may be a risk marker for future depression<symptom> in previously healthy young women.
