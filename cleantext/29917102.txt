  The objective of this study was to evaluate a combination of best management practices strategy for steer calves grazing tall fescue pastures with a range of toxicity. The experiment was conducted over two grazing seasons ( fall 2015 for 91 days and spring 2016 for 84 days). Steers ( n = 80 within season , BW = 197.0 ± 15.43 kg ( fall) and 116.9 ± 4.88 ( spring)) were stocked at 2.45 and 4.1 calves/hectare in fall and spring , respectively , to 16 pastures with varying levels of toxicity based on interim ergovaline ( EV) concentration within season. Pastures were assigned to either mineral ( MIN , n = 8) only management ( MGMT) or a cumulative MGMT ( CM , n = 8). The CM treatment included an implant containing 40 mg trenbolone acetate , 8 mg estradiol , and 29 mg tylosin tartrate ( Component TE-G with Tylan , Elanco Animal Health , Greenfield , IN) , 150 mg/calf daily monensin ( Elanco Animal Health) , and 1 % body<symptom> weight ( BW) of a 50:50 corn gluten feed: soybean hull supplement ( as-is basis). Data were analyzed within season using pasture as the experimental unit. For fall and spring , the EV concentration was 1,476 ± 883.2 ppb and 1,173 ± 620.6 ppb , respectively , and ranged from 90 ppb to 2,180 ppb. During the fall , forage allowance did not differ ( P = 0.76) between CM and MIN. In the spring , however , forage allowance only differed for the month of June ( P ≤ 0.05 , 2.55 versus 3.22 ± 0.177 kg DM/kg BW , for MIN and CM , respectively). In the fall , average daily gain ( ADG) responded to the simple effects of EV ( P = 0.01) and MGMT ( P < 0.001) , and ADG for MIN steers was explained by ADG = 0.41- 0.000064 × EV; whereas , ADG for CM was explained by ADG = 1.05- 0.000064 × EV. In the spring , there was an EV × MGMT interaction ( P = 0.03) for ADG. For MIN , ADG = 0.80- 0.000278 × EV; whereas for CM , ADG = 0.94 + 0.000001835 × EV. In spring , the ADG response to CM relative to MIN increased as EV increased. The CM strategy resulted in lower blood urea nitrogen than MIN in fall and spring ( P < 0.01) , but prolactin and serum Cu were not affected by MGMT in either season. In conclusion , performance was improved within the fescue belt by implementing feeding strategies using implants , ionophores and supplementation , but a detailed economic analysis is warranted. Further research is needed to evaluate CM programs under varied stocking rates and in combination with dilution of endophyte-infected fescue pastures with non-toxic grasses or legumes.
