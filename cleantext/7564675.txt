  The chemokine ( C-C motif) ligand 2 ( CCL2) with its cognate receptor chemokine ( C-C motif) receptor 2 ( CCR2) plays important roles in tumor invasion and metastasis. However , the mechanisms and mediators for autocrine CCL2 and CCL2-CCR2 axis remain elusive in breast cancer. Here we examined the levels of CCL2 in 4 breast cancer cell lines along with 57 human breast cancer specimens and found them significantly increased with presence of 17β-estradiol ( E2) in estrogen receptor ( ER)- positive breast cancer cells , while anti-estrogen treatment weakened this enhancement. CCL2 expression positively correlated with Twist staining and aggressiveness of breast cancer. Estrogen exposure facilitated the proliferation , invasion and metastasis of hormone-dependent breast cancer and promoted angiogenesis via the increased secretion of CCL2 in vitro and in vivo , which could be suppressed by disruption of CCL2-CCR2 axis with CCR2 antagonist RS102895. Knockdown of Twist in MCF-7 cells significantly inhibited E2-induced CCL2 production , indicating an essential role of Twist in CCL2 regulation under estrogenic condition. Our data show the hormonal regulation on CCL2-CCR2 axis is associated with enhanced Twist expression via activation of ERα and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling. Thus , CCL2-CCR2 axis may represent as a novel therapeutic target eagerly needed for hormone-dependent breast cancer.
