  In 2009 , Lawrence Kutner , a character on television 's House , M.D. , unexpectedly committed suicide. A Facebook memorial group was created shortly thereafter in memory of the fictional character. A thematic analysis of fan postings on Kutner 's Facebook memorial page revealed evidence of people experiencing parasocial grief as they displayed emotional expressions of grief , reminisced , and advocated for Kutner. Through thematic analysis , we discovered that elements of parasocial relationships , particularly parasocial breakups , were apparent as the members posted evidence of their grief over the loss of a television character. Moreover , this parasocial grief is likely to be disenfranchised , as the death of a television character is typically not recognized by others as a legitimate loss. This study also highlighted the role of social media as an outlet for grief as well as revealed confusion<symptom> between fiction and reality resulting from social media.
