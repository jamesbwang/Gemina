  Disturbances in sleep and circadian rhythms are common among residents of long-term care facilities. In this systematic review , we aim to identify and evaluate the literature documenting the outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among long-term care residents. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guided searches of five databases ( MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL , Scopus , and Cochrane Library) for articles reporting results of experimental or quasi-experimental studies conducted in long-term care settings ( nursing homes , assisted-living facilities , or group homes) in which nighttime sleep was subjectively or objectively measured as a primary outcome. We categorized each intervention by its intended use and how it was administered. Of the 54 included studies evaluating the effects of 25 different non-pharmacological interventions , more than half employed a randomized controlled trial design ( n = 30); the others used a pre-post design with ( n = 11) or without ( n = 13) a comparison group. The majority of randomized controlled trials were at low risk for most types of bias , and most other studies met the standard quality criteria. The interventions were categorized as environmental interventions ( n = 14) , complementary health practices ( n = 12) , social/physical stimulation ( n = 11) , clinical care practices ( n = 3) , or mind-body practices ( n = 3). Although there was no clear pattern of positive findings , three interventions had the most promising results: increased daytime light exposure , nighttime use of melatonin , and acupressure. Non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to improve sleep for residents of long-term care facilities. Further research is needed to better standardize such interventions and provide clear implementation guidelines using cost-effective practices.
