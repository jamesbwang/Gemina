  Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Thrombolysis by tissue plasminogen activator is the only pharmacological treatment approved for clinical practice , but has a narrow therapeutic window and poor efficacy when the cell death cascade is activated. Numerous drugs that are thought to protect neurons against injury have previously failed in human trials despite showing efficacy in experimental models of stroke. Herein , we reviewed the main pre-clinical results of the neuroprotective effects of JM-20 , a new hybrid molecule , against brain ischemia. JM-20 appears to protect the brain from ischemic damage by interfering with several elements of the ischemic cascade: antiexcitotoxic , anticalcic , antioxidant , antiapoptotic , and anti-inflammatory. Its ability to protect not only neurons but also glial cells together with its ability to target and preserve mitochondrial function makes JM-20 a promising molecule that may be able to shield the whole neurovascular unit. The multimodal and multi-cell action of JM-20 may explain the high degree of protection observed in a rat model of brain ischemia , as assayed through histological ( hematoxylin-eosin , and luxol fast blue staining) , neurochemical ( glutamate and aspartate levels in cerebrospinal fluid) , mitochondrial functionality and behavioural ( neurological scale) analysis at doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg. Furthermore , the wide therapeutic window of JM-20 of 8 h also suggests that this molecule could be of potential interest in situations where brain perfusion is compromised.
