  Eu,Sm,Mn-doped CaS ( ESM-CaS) nanoparticles demonstrate a remarkable upconversion luminescence ( UCL) efficiency with a quantum yield of nearly 60 % , enabling many new applications and devices. We describe an ESM-CaS nanoparticle-based paper test strip for one-shot quantitative measurement of sulfite concentration using a smartphone-based reader. The integrated UCL-based sulfite detection system features high sensitivity and facile operation without the need for separation and pretreatment. Moreover , the design principles are general in nature and so can be tailored for the detection and quantification of a variety of other analytes.
