  The role of the choroid plexus ( CP) in iron ( Fe) homeostasis has been suggested as the main mechanism of Fe uptake and storage in the mammalian central nervous system. Thus , the CP of the lateral and fourth ventricles was studied in guinea pigs with light and electron microscopy using methods including Perls ' Prussian blue and Gomori acid phosphatase staining , immunoreactivity for ferritin and transferrin , as well as energy dispersive spectrometry microanalysis. The present study reveals the presence of endogenous Fe in CP epithelial cells. Under light microscopy , Prussian blue staining revealed dark blue precipitates ( i.e. , Fe
