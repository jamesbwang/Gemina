  We report the crystal structures of the human ( dihydro) lipoamide dehydrogenase ( hLADH , hE3) and its disease-causing homodimer interface mutant D444V-hE3 at 2.27 and 1.84 Ã… resolution , respectively. The wild type structure is a unique uncomplexed , unliganded hE3 structure with the true canonical sequence. Based on the structural information a novel molecular pathomechanism is proposed for the impaired catalytic activity and enhanced capacity for reactive oxygen species generation of the pathogenic mutant. The mechanistic model involves a previously much ignored solvent accessible channel leading to the active site that might be perturbed also by other disease-causing homodimer interface substitutions of this enzyme.
