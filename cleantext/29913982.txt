  Objective Health care providers , especially registered nurses ( RNs) , are a professional group with a high risk of musculoskeletal pain ( MSP). This longitudinal study contributes to the literature by describing the prevalence and change in MSP , work-related factors , personal factors , self-reported pain , disability and sick leave ( > 7 days) among RNs working in a Swedish hospital over a 3-year period. Further , results concerning prediction of pain , disability and sick leave from baseline to a 3-year follow-up are reported. Method In 2003 , a convenience sample of 278 RNs ( 97.5 % women , mean age 43 years) completed a questionnaire. In 2006 , 244 RNs ( 88 % of the original sample) were located , and 200 ( 82 %) of these completed a second questionnaire. Results Logistic regression analyses revealed that pain , disability and sick leave at baseline best predicted pain , disability , and sick leave at follow-up. The personal factors self-rated health and sleep quality during the last week predicted pain at follow-up , while age , self-rated health , and considering yourself as optimist or pessimist predicted disability at follow-up , however weakly. None of the work-related factors contributed significantly to the regression solution. Conclusions The results support earlier studies showing that a history of pain and disability is predictive of future pain and disability. Attention to individual factors such as personal values may be needed in further research.
