  Cytosine DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic silencing mechanism that defends against biotic stresses such as geminivirus infection. As a countermeasure , geminiviruses encode proteins that inhibit methylation and transcriptional gene silencing ( TGS). Previous studies showed that V2 protein of
