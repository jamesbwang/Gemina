  Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema has been a known side effect of intravenous dosing but has not been reported with oral therapy. Herein we describe two patients receiving treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate who presented with acral erythema.

This complication related to methotrexate , though rare , should be anticipated in patients on multiple medications who develop mucocutaneous toxicities.
