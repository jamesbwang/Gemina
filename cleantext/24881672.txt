  The androgen receptor ( AR) is a key target for the development of drugs targeting hormone-dependent prostate cancer , but has also an important role in endocrine disruption. Reliable prediction of the binding of ligands towards the AR is therefore of great relevance. Molecular docking is a powerful computational method for exploring small-ligand binding to proteins. It can be applied for virtual screening experiments but also for predicting molecular initiating events in toxicology. However , in case of AR , there is no antagonist-bound crystal structure yet available. Our study demonstrates that molecular docking approaches are not able to satisfactorily screen for AR antagonists because of this reason. Therefore , we applied Molecular Dynamics simulations to generate antagonist AR structures and showed that this leads to a vast improvement for the docking of AR antagonists. We benchmarked the ability of these antagonist AR structures discriminate between AR antagonists and decoys using an ensemble docking approach and obtained promising results with good enrichment. However , distinguishing AR antagonists from agonists with high confidence is not possible with the current approach alone.
