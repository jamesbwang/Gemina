  Se is an important bioelement essential for a healthy immune system. Dietary Se influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. However , the effects of Se deficiency in chicken spleen are still unknown; thus , we designed an experiment to study the role of Se in chicken spleen. A total of 180 one-day-old sea blue white laying hens were randomly allocated into two groups ( a control group and a Se-deficient group). The control group was fed a diet supplemented with sodium selenite with a final Se content of 0.15 mg/kg , and the Se-deficient group was fed a Se-deficient diet with a Se content of 0.033 mg/kg. Twenty selenoproteins and ten cytokines were investigated in detail. The expression levels of selenoproteins in spleen were determined via real-time qPCR at 15 , 35 , and 55 days , and cytokine levels were determined using ELISA at 15 , 35 , and 55 days. Protein-protein interaction predictions and principal component analysis were performed. We found that the selenoprotein mRNA levels were significantly lower ( P < 0.05) in the Se-deficient group compared with the control group. The expression levels of IL-2 , IL-1β , IL-6 , IFN-α , and IL-17 were significantly lower ( P < 0.05) , and the levels of IL-8 , IL-10 , IFN-γ , IFN-β , and TNF-α were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in the Se-deficient group. These selenoproteins were positively correlated with component 1 and component 2 of the PCA , but the relationship between cytokines and principal components in spleens was very complex. The investigation showed that Se deficiency caused a reduction in selenoprotein gene expression and further affected certain cytokines levels. Our results provide some compensatory data about selenoproteins and cytokines in spleens of Se-deficient chickens and provide clues for further research on the relationship between selenoproteins and cytokines.
