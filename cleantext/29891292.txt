  The advances in the field of biomaterials have led to several studies on alternative biocompatible devices and to their development focusing on their properties , benefits , limitations , and utilization of alternative resources. Due to their advantages like biocompatibility , biodegradability , and low cost , polysaccharides have been widely used in the development of hydrogels. Among the polysaccharides studied on hydrogels preparation , chitosan ( pure or combined with natural/synthetic polymers) have been widely investigated for use in biomedical field. In view of potential applications of chitosan-based hydrogels , this review focuses on the most recent progress made with respect to preparation , properties , and their salient accomplishments for drug delivery and tissue engineering.
