  A terpyridine based compound L1 was designed and synthesized as an `` off-on '' chemosensor for the detection of Zn2 +. Chemosensor L1 showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity toward Zn2 + by exhibiting a large fluorescence enhancement ( ∼ 51-fold) at 370 nm whereas other competitive metal ions did not show any noticeable change in the emission spectra of chemosensor L1. The chemosensor ( L1) was shown to detect Zn2 + ions down to 9.76 μM at pH 7.4. However , chemosensor L1 binds Zn2 + in a 1: 2 ratio ( receptor: metal) with an association constant of 1.85 × 104 ( R2 = 0.993) and this 1: 2 stoichiometric fashion is established on the basis of a Job plot and mass spectroscopy. DFT/TD-DFT calculations were carried out to understand the binding nature , coordination features and electronic properties of L1 and the L1-2Zn2 + complex. In addition , this `` turn-on '' fluorescence probe was effectively used to image intracellular Zn2 + ions in cultured MDA-MB-468 cells.
