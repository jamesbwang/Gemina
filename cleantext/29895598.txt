  Survival outcome after MitraClip treatment , compared with surgical or conservative treatment , is not well defined. We examined survival after MitraClip treatment in a large multicenter real-life setting. We retrospectively formed matched high-risk surgically and conservatively treated control cohorts to compare to a high-risk MitraClip cohort. One thousand thirty-six patients were included in 4 Dutch centers , of which 568 were treated with the MitraClip. The observed survival at 5-year follow-up in our MitraClip cohort was low ( 39.8 %) but was comparable to our conservative cohort ( 40.5 %). Observed 5-year survival for our surgical cohort was 76.3 %. However , there were significant differences between the baseline characteristics of the 3 studied cohorts , with the MitraClip cohort having the highest comorbidity burden. After adjusting for baseline differences by using Cox regression , the MitraClip and surgical cohorts showed similar survival ratios ( hazard ratio , 0.92; 95 % confidence interval , 0.67-1.26; This matched analysis suggests a lower mortality hazard for MitraClip intervention in a high-risk population with symptomatic mitral regurgitation when compared with conservative management alone.
