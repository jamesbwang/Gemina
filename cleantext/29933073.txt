  Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplant ( alloSCT) in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS). Injectable azacitidine can improve post-transplant outcomes but presents challenges with exposure and compliance. Oral CC-486 allows extended dosing to prolong azacitidine activity. We investigated use of CC-486 maintenance therapy after alloSCT. Adults with MDS or AML in morphologic complete remission at CC-486 initiation ( 42 to 84days after alloSCT) were included. Patients received 1 of 4 CC-486 dosing schedules per 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. Endpoints included safety , pharmacokinetics , graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) incidence , relapse/progression rate , and survival. Of 30 patients , 7 received CC-486 once daily for 7 days a cycle ( 200 mg , n = 3; 300 mg , n = 4) and 23 for 14 days a cycle ( 150 mg , n = 4; 200 mg , n = 19 ( expansion cohort)). Grades 3 to 4 adverse events were infrequent and occurred with similar frequency across regimens. Standard concomitant medications did not alter CC-486 pharmacokinetic parameters. Three patients ( 10 %) experienced grade III acute GVHD and 9 experienced chronic GVHD. Of 28 assessable patients , 6 ( 21 %) relapsed or had progressive disease: 3 of 7 patients ( 43 %) received 7-day dosing and 3 of 23 ( 13 %) received 14-day dosing. Transplant-related mortality was 3 %. At 19 months of follow-up , median overall survival was not reached. Estimated 1-year survival was 86 % and 81 % in the 7-day and 14-day dosing cohorts , respectively. CC-486 maintenance was generally well tolerated , with low rates of relapse , disease progression , and GVHD. CC-486 maintenance may permit epigenetic manipulation of the alloreactive response postallograft. Findings require confirmation in randomized trials. ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01835587.).
