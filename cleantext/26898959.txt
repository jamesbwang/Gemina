  To define which biologic , electrophysical and other modalities are used in horses for injury or performance issues , a questionnaire regarding 38 modalities was distributed to eight veterinary groups. A total of 305 complete or partial responses were obtained from over 10 geographic regions; 75.4 % from private equine practice or regional private equine referral hospitals , 14.1 % from university teaching hospitals or satellite clinics , 8.2 % from private mixed animal practice , and 2.3 % from veterinary rehabilitation centers. The majority of respondents were located in the USA ( 60 %) , Europe ( 25.6 %) , and Canada ( 5.6 %). Respondents reported working with athletic horses primarily in the disciplines of hunter-jumper ( 26.9 %) , dressage ( 16.0 %) , and pleasure riding ( 14.7 %) , followed by Western riding , track racing , and eventing. Warmbloods ( 39.7 %) were the predominant breed presenting to respondents , followed by Thoroughbreds ( 20.3 %) and Quarter Horses ( 17.3 %) ahead of other breeds. All 38 modalities were used by respondents. The 10 most prominently utilized were controlled hand walking ( 97.3 %) , therapeutic shoeing ( 96.1 %) , ice ( 95.2 %) , compression bandaging ( 89.5 %) , platelet rich plasma ( PRP; 86.5 %) , therapeutic exercises ( 84.3 %) , interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein therapy ( IRAP; 81.4 %) , stretching ( 83.3 %) , and cold water hydrotherapy ( 82.9 %). Heat ( 77.6 %) , massage ( 69.0 %) , and acupuncture ( 68.3 %) were also commonly utilized. The least prominently used modalities were hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( 9.4 %) , cytowave ( 8.3 %) , and radiofrequency ( 6.4 %). Injectable modalities ( IRAP , PRP , mesotherapy , stem cells) were almost solely administered by veterinarians; other modalities were variably applied by veterinarians , technicians , veterinary assistants , farriers , physical therapists , trainers , and other entities. A total of 33 % of respondents reported working collaboratively with physical therapists on equine patients. Findings indicate that a broad range of invasive and non-invasive modalities are used in equine patients to address a variety of rehabilitation and performance needs , and that personnel with varying levels of expertise are involved in their administration. This suggests that further investigation to better define the delivery , efficacy and any negative effects of many of these modalities is important.
