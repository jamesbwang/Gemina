  Saliva is a non-invasive , easily accessible tissue , which is regularly collected in large epidemiological studies to examine genetic questions. Recently , it is becoming more common to use saliva to assess DNA methylation. However , DNA extracted from saliva is a mixture of both bacterial and human DNA derived from epithelial and immune cells in the mouth<symptom>. Thus , there are unique challenges to using salivary DNA in methylation studies that can influence data quality. This study assesses: ( 1) quantification of human DNA after extraction; ( 2) delineation of human and bacterial DNA; ( 3) bisulfite conversion ( BSC); ( 4) quantification of BSC DNA; ( 5) PCR amplification of BSC DNA from saliva and; ( 6) quantitation of DNA methylation with a targeted assay. The framework proposed will allow saliva samples to be more widely used in targeted epigenetic studies.
