  For cancers of the distal gastroesophageal junction or the proximal stomach , proximal gastrectomy can be performed. It is associated with several perioperative benefits compared with total gastrectomy. The use of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy ( LPG) has become an increasingly popular approach for select tumors. We describe our method of LPG , including the preoperative work-up , illustrated depictions of the key steps of the surgery , and our postoperative pathway. A total of 6 patients underwent LPG between July , 2013 to June , 2017. Five patients had early-stage adenocarcinoma , and 1 patient had a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The median age of the cohort was 70 , and each patient had significant comorbidities. Conversion to open was required for 1 patient. All patients had negative final margins and an adequate lymph node dissection ( median number of nodes examined was 15 , range 12-22). The median postoperative length of stay was 7 days ( range 4-7). Two patients developed anastomotic strictures requiring intervention , and 1 patient experienced significant reflux. At a median follow-up of 11 months , there was 1 recurrence. Three patients were alive without evidence of disease , and 2 patients died from other causes. For carefully selected patients , LPG is a safe and reasonable alternative to total gastrectomy , which is associated with similar oncologic outcomes and low morbidity.
