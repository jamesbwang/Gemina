  To use surgical treatment of isolated ankle fractures as a model to compare time-driven activity-based costing ( TDABC) and our institution 's traditional cost accounting ( TCA) method to measure true cost expenditure around a specific episode of care. Level I trauma center ankle fractures treated between 2012 and 2016 were identified through a registry. Inclusion criteria were age greater than 18 years and same-day ankle fracture operation. Exclusion criteria were pilon fractures , vascular injuries , soft-tissue coverage , and external fixation. Time for each phase of care was determined through repeated observations. The TCA method at our institution uses all hospital costs and allocates them to surgeries using a relative value method. A total of 35 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria , 18 were men and 17 were women. Age at time of surgery was 47 ± 15 years. Time from injury to surgery was 10 ± 4 days. Operative time was 86 ± 30 minutes , Post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU) time was 87 ± 27 minutes , and secondary recovery time was 100 ± 56 minutes. Average cost was significantly lower for the TDABC method ( $ 2792 ± 734) than the TCA method ( $ 5782 ± 1348) ( P < 0.001). There was no difference between methods for implant cost ( $ 882 ± 507 for Traditional Accounting ( TA) and $ 957 ± 651 for TDABC , P = 0.593). TCA produced a significantly greater cost ( P < 0.01) in every other category. As orthopaedics transitions to alternative payment models , accurate costing will become critical to maintaining a successful practice. TDABC may provide a better estimate of the cost of the resources necessary to treat a patient.
