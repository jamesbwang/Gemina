  Home deliveries increase the risk of maternal and child mortality. To increase institutional deliveries , South Asian countries have introduced various forms of Conditional Cash Transfer ( CCT) schemes that offer women cash if they come to deliver at a health facility. In 2005 , Nepal introduced its Safe Delivery Incentive Programme ( SDIP)- a cash incentive program nationwide to boost the rate of institutional delivery and care from health professionals at childbirth. This study asks the following research questions: How informed were Nepalese women about the cash incentive program? Does knowledge about the cash incentive program correlate with institutional delivery? Data to answer these questions come from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey ( NDHS). This is a nationally representative data collected from 12,674 women between 15 and 49 years of age , of which 4,036 had given births in the past five years. Multiple logistic regression was employed to predict if knowledge about the cash incentive program increased the odds of institutional delivery controlling for sociodemographic and geographic factors. Approximately 90 % of the women knew about the SDIP. About 42 % of the women who knew about the SDIP and 13 % of the women who did not know about the SDIP had their most recent delivery at a health institution. The odds of institutional delivery increased nearly three-fold ( OR = 2.70; CI: 1.59-4.59) among women who knew about the SDIP compared to women who did not know about the SDIP. Other factors that predicted institutional delivery included education , wealth , urban status , first birth , the number of antenatal care visits , and exposure to news media. This study shows that there is a correlation between women 's knowledge about the SDIP and increased institutional delivery. Nepal 's health and social work professionals should inform all women of reproductive age about the program so that they can make more informed delivery decisions.
