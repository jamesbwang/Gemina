  Truffles are symbiotic hypogeous edible fungi<pathogen> ( form of mushroom) that form filamentous mycelia in their initial phase of the growth cycle as well as a symbiotic association with host plant roots. In the present study , Tuber maculatum<pathogen> mycelia were isolated and tested for extracellular amylase production at different pH on solid agar medium. Furthermore , the mycelium was subjected to submerged fermentation for amylase production under different culture conditions such as variable carbon sources and their concentrations , initial medium pH , and incubation time. The optimized conditions after the experiments included soluble starch ( 0.5 % w/v) , initial medium pH of 7.0 , and incubation time of 7 days , at room temperature ( 22 ± 2 °C) under static conditions which resulted in 1.41 U/mL of amylase. The amylase thus obtained was further characterized for its biocatalytic properties and found to have an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and a temperature of 50 °C. The enzyme showed good thermostability at 50 °C by retaining 98 % of the maximal activity after 100 min of incubation. The amylase activity was marginally enhanced in presence of Cu
