  Sodium carbonate-soluble pectin fraction forms a self-organized network on mica and may have the potential ability to bind zinc ions. The aim of this research was to characterize the interaction of zinc ions with this fraction extracted from apples using rheological measurements and FT-IR study. The addition of zinc ions ( 10 and 20 mM of ZnSO
