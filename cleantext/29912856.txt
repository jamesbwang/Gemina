  The objective of this study is to explore the effect of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum stress in acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) and the molecular mechanism. Acute pancreatitis<disease> was induced in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats by the retrograde injection of 5 % taurocholate into the biliopancreatic duct and in vitro by treating AR42J cells with cerulein ( 10 nmol/L) plus lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) ( 10 mg/L). The rats and cells were treated with melatonin ( 50 mg/kg in rats and 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mmol/L in AR42J cells) 30 minutes before AP was induced. After 9 hours , the cells and rat pancreas tissue were collected for Western blot , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , histological examination , immunohistochemistry , and immunofluorescence analysis. Inositol-requiring 1α ( IRE1α)- mediated Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK)/ nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) pathway were activated early in AR42J cells and rat AP models. Melatonin significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Western blot and immunohistochemical results all indicated that melatonin regulated apoptosis-related protein expression. In addition , melatonin treatment resulted in significantly reduced pancreatic tissue injury , as revealed by histological changes and pathological scores. Furthermore , melatonin treatment significantly reduced the activation of IRE1α-mediated JNK/NF-κB pathway-related proteins. These findings suggest that melatonin protects AR42J cells and Sprague-Dawley rats against AP-associated injury , probably through downregulation of IRE1α-mediated JNK/NF-κB pathways.
