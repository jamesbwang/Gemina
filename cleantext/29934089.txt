  Antibiograms are important clinical tools to report and track antibiotic susceptibility and help guide empiric antimicrobial therapy. Antibiograms support compliance with antimicrobial stewardship ( AMS) requirements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and are in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Core Elements of AMS for nursing homes/long-term care facilities ( LTCFs). Unlike most acute-care settings , LTCFs are challenged in creating antibiograms because of the low number of bacterial isolates collected annually. Determining the best methodology for creating clinically useful antibiograms for LTCFs needs to be explored. Possible approaches include ( 1) extending the isolate data beyond 1 year , ( 2) combining isolate data from the same geographic region , ( 3) using a nearby acute-care facility 's antibiogram as a proxy , or ( 4) collapsing isolate data. This article discusses the benefits and limitations of each approach.
