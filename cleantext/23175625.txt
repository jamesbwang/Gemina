  Neurological expertise in palliative care may be required not only for patients with primary neurological disorders but also for patients with non-neurological diseases suffering from burdensome neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neurological diagnoses and symptoms in palliative care patients , as well as the related burden and impact on everyday life. We analyzed retrospectively the medical records of 255 consecutive patients from a tertiary medical center , at the time point of referral to an inpatient palliative care consultation service. In addition , 100 patients prospectively answered a questionnaire which included the assessment of neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , as well as numeric rating scales for quality of life , symptom-specific burden , and restrictions in everyday life. Forty-one patients ( 16 %) suffered from a primary neurological disease. Most decisions regarding the termination of life-sustaining measures concerned this group ( 20/22 , 91 %). Neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( excluding pain) were documented in 122 patients ( 48 %) with an underlying non-neurological disease. In the questionnaire study , 98/100 patients reported at least one neurological or neuropsychiatric symptom , most frequently sleeping problems ( Neurological diseases and symptoms are frequent among palliative care patients and are often associated with a high symptom burden , which may severely affect the patients ' lives. It is thus of paramount importance to implement neurological expertise in palliative care.
