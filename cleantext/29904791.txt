  Oculomotor behaviors integrate sensory and prior information to overcome sensory-motor delays and noise. After much debate about this process , reliability-based integration has recently been proposed and several models of smooth pursuit now include recurrent Bayesian integration or Kalman filtering. However , there is a lack of behavioral evidence in humans supporting these theoretical predictions. Here , we independently manipulated the reliability of visual and prior information in a smooth pursuit task. Our results show that both smooth pursuit eye velocity and catch-up saccade amplitude were modulated by visual and prior information reliability. We interpret these findings as the continuous reliability-based integration of a short-term memory of target motion with visual information , which support modeling work. Furthermore , we suggest that saccadic and pursuit systems share this short-term memory. We propose that this short-term memory of target motion is quickly built and continuously updated , and constitutes a general building block present in all sensorimotor systems.
