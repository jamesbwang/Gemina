  The purpose of this descriptive study was to co-create oral histories of Midwestern farm widows. Rural widows constitute a vulnerable population due to issues of bereavement and depression<symptom> compounded by emotional and geographical isolation. A farm widow is often forced to maintain viability of the farm for the family 's livelihood. Oral history interviews with nine Midwest farm widows were conducted and analyzed. Three overarching themes emerged: competence , industriousness , and inner strength. Women shared stories of overcoming insurmountable obstacles. This study contributes to the literature on grief and expanding inner strength among rural widows. Further research could inform theory related to inner strength following a challenging life event.
