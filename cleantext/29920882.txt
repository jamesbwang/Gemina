  Peer group camping experiences have a positive influence on adolescents with chronic illnesses , but the data in solid organ transplant recipients are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of adolescent transplant attendees of an educational camp. A weekend camp , `` I own it '' was organized which provided educational training regarding career and health choices , money matters , and managing medications following which a knowledge assessment was performed. The ACLSA questionnaire was also administered. To test the adolescents ' medication knowledge , they were asked to provide written documentation of their medications , which was compared with their medical records. In the ACLSA questionnaire , 32 % reported deficiency in work/study , 46 % in housing/money management , and 3 % in the remaining categories. A significant improvement in knowledge was noted in areas of career choices , money matters , and managing medications , but not in healthy choices. In the medication recall , 75 % did not know their medication list , and 92 % could not recall dosages or frequencies. In conclusion , adolescents showed quantitative improvements in certain areas while identifying deficiencies in others , areas which were targeted in future initiatives. Prospective longitudinal studies addressing the impact of camps on post-transplant outcomes should be conducted to better alter the course post-transplant.
