  In growing elderly populations , there is a heavy burden of comorbidity and a high rate of geriatric syndromes<pathogen> ( GS) including chronic<pathogen> pain.<pathogen> To assess the prevalence of chronic<pathogen> pain<pathogen> among individuals aged â‰¥ 65 years in the Southern District of Israel and to evaluate associations between chronic<pathogen> pain<pathogen> and other GS. A telephone interview was conducted on a sample of older adults who live in the community. The interview included the Brief Pain Inventory and a questionnaire on common geriatric problems. Of 419 elderly individuals who agreed to be interviewed 232 ( 55.2 %) suffered from chronic<pathogen> pain.<pathogen> Of those who reported chronic<pathogen> pain<pathogen> , 136 participants ( 68.6 %) noted that they had very severe or unbearable pain. There were statistically significant associations between the pain itself and decline in patient 's functional status , increased falls , reduced mood , and cognitive decline. The results of this study show that chronic<pathogen> pain<pathogen> is very common in older adults and that it is associated with other GS. There is a need to increase awareness of chronic<pathogen> pain<pathogen> in older adults and to emphasize the important role that it plays in their care.
