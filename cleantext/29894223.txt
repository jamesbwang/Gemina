  Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ ( PLCIS) is an aggressive subtype of lobular carcinoma in situ treated similarly to ductal carcinoma in situ. The purpose of this study was to determine the imaging findings , upgrade rate of PLCIS at core needle biopsy ( CNB) , and the treatment and outcomes of these patients. This retrospective single-institution study included women with PLCIS at CNB or excisional biopsy without concomitant DCIS or invasive carcinoma between January 1 , 1999 , and July 20 , 2016. Imaging findings , detection mode , treatment , and outcomes were reviewed. Retrospective review of the images was performed. Upgrade rate to ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma at lumpectomy was calculated. Twenty-one patients had a finding of PLCIS at CNB ( n = 16) or excisional biopsy ( n = 5). Four of 15 ( 27 %; 95 % CI , 4-49 %) cases of PLCIS at CNB were upgraded to DCIS ( two cases) or invasive lobular cancer ( two cases) at lumpectomy ( one patient declined excision). No unique mammographic features were predictive of need to upgrade or extent of disease. Among the patients with pure PLCIS ( not upgraded) , 13 of 16 ( 81 %) presented with fine pleomorphic calcifications on screening mammograms , 1 of 16 ( 6 %) with distortion and calcifications , 1 of 16 ( 6 %) with a mass , and 1 of 16 ( 6 %) with nonmass enhancement at MRI. The median imaging size was 11 mm ( mean , 14 mm; range , 3-47 mm). Twelve of 16 ( 75 %) patients were treated with lumpectomy and 4 of 16 ( 25 %) with mastectomy. Eight of 16 ( 50 %) patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy , and 2 of 16 ( 17 %) received radiation. There were no local recurrences. PLCIS most commonly presented as fine pleomorphic calcifications on mammograms and had a high upgrade rate after CNB. CNB diagnosis of PLCIS requires surgical excision.
