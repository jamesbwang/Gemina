  Regorafenib , a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis , growth , and proliferation , prolongs survival as monotherapy in patients with refractory colorectal cancer. This international , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial assessed the efficacy of regorafenib with folinic acid , fluorouracil , and irinotecan ( FOLFIRI) as a second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed on first-line oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and Ireland. Patients , stratified by prior bevacizumab use , were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib or placebo. The treatment consisted of FOLFIRI on days 1 and 2 and days 15 and 16 with 160 mg of regorafenib or placebo on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 of every 28-day cycle. Crossover was not allowed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS). Under the assumption of a 75 % event rate , 180 patients were required for 135 events to achieve 90 % power to detect a hazard ratio ( HR) of 0.65 with a 1-sided α value of .1. One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized ( 120 to regorafenib-FOLFIRI and 61 to placebo-FOLFIRI) with a median age of 62 years. Among these , 117 ( 65 %) received prior bevacizumab or aflibercept. PFS was longer with regorafenib-FOLFIRI than placebo-FOLFIRI ( median , 6.1 vs 5.3 months; HR , 0.73; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.53-1.01; log-rank P = .056). The median overall survival was not longer ( HR , 1.01; 95 % CI , 0.71-1.44). The response rate was higher with regorafenib-FOLFIRI ( 34 %; 95 % CI , 25 % -44 %) than placebo-FOLFIRI ( 21 %; 95 % CI , 11 % -33 %; P = .07). Grade 3/4 adverse events with a > 5 % absolute increase from regorafenib included diarrhea<disease> , neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , hypophosphatemia , and hypertension. The addition of regorafenib to FOLFIRI as second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer only modestly prolonged PFS over FOLFIRI alone. Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.
