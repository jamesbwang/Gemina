  Many people feel emotional when hungry-or `` hangry ''- yet little research explores the psychological mechanisms underlying such states. Guided by psychological constructionist and affect misattribution theories , we propose that hunger alone is insufficient for feeling hangry. Rather , we hypothesize that people experience hunger as emotional when they conceptualize their affective state as negative , high arousal emotions specifically in a negative context. Studies 1 and 2 use a cognitive measure ( the affect misattribution procedure; Payne , Hall , Cameron , & Bishara , 2010) to demonstrate that hunger shifts affective perceptions in negative but not neutral or positive contexts. Study 3 uses a laboratory-based experiment to demonstrate that hunger causes individuals to experience negative emotions and to negatively judge a researcher , but only when participants are not aware that they are conceptualizing their affective state as emotions. Implications for emotion theory , health , and embodied contributions to perception are discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
