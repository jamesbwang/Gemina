  The success of gene and cell therapy in clinic during the past two decades as well as our expanding ability to manipulate these biomaterials are leading to new therapeutic options for a wide range of inherited and acquired diseases. Combining conventional therapies with this emerging field is a promising strategy to treat those previously-thought untreatable diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) has evolved for thousands of years in China and still plays an important role in human health. As part of the active ingredients of TCM , proteins and peptides have attracted long-term enthusiasm of researchers. More recently , they have been utilized in gene and cell therapy , resulting in promising novel strategies to treat both cancer and non-cancer diseases. This manuscript presents a critical review on this field , accompanied with perspectives on the challenges and new directions for future research in this emerging frontier.
