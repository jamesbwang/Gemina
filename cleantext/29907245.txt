  Menopause is an important transition of reproductive stage in a woman 's life. It is associated with diabetes , but the role of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) , a menopause-related hormone , in the risk of diabetes is largely unknown. We evaluated the relationship between serum FSH and diabetes in 1274 participants from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study aged â‰¥ 55 at baseline. We also searched relevant databases for studies on serum FSH and incident diabetes and conducted a meta-analysis using fixed-effect modeling. Cases of incident diabetes ( N = 60) were ascertained during a median follow-up of 10.7 years. Serum FSH was significantly associated with reduced risk of diabetes in both a crude model ( hazard ratio ( HR) per SD increase: 0.66; 95 % CI: 0.48-0.89; P = 0.007) and a full model with adjustment for age , sex , body mass index , factors related to risk of diabetes , and reproductive health ( HR per SD increase: 0.70; 95 % CI: 0.51-0.97; P = 0.030); a similar result was observed when FSH was analysed in quintiles. In a fixed-effect meta-analysis of two studies , including the current study , serum FSH > 50 IU/L was associated with reduced risk of diabetes ( HR = 0.56; 95 % CI: 0.36-0.85; P = 0.006; I
