  Rats emit 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations ( USVs) in association with pain , fear , or distress. Whereas the capacity to produce USVs is innate , reactivity to them appears to require experience. Specifically , 22 kHz USVs fail to elicit freezing behavior in na√Øve laboratory rats. However , these `` alarm calls '' do elicit freezing in rats that previously experienced foot shocks<disease>. These findings led to the hypothesis that acquired reactivity is based on `` autoconditioning ''- learning in which self-generated 22 kHz USVs serve as Pavlovian cues that become associated with foot shocks<disease>. The current study tested the autoconditioning hypothesis by devocalizing rats through a unilateral transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve ( Experimental group). Subsequently , animals in both the Experimental and sham-operated Control groups received five unsignaled foot shocks<disease>. One or two days later , both groups were tested for USV-elicited freezing in a novel context. Recurrent laryngeal nerve transection failed to prevent or even diminish USV-elicited freezing. In fact , both groups showed large and comparable increases in freezing to USV presentations. A subset of Control animals failed to vocalize during conditioning , while some Experimental animals did vocalize during conditioning. Animals were therefore re-grouped and reanalyzed based on whether they vocalized during conditioning. Again , both groups showed large and comparable increases in USV-elicited freezing. These results disconfirm the essential tenet or prediction of the autoconditioning hypothesis. Alternative mechanisms for acquired reactivity to 22 kHz USVs are therefore considered.
