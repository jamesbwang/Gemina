  The tumor microenvironment ( TME) is a key factor regulating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The effects of biochemical factors such as stromal cells , immune cells , and cytokines have been previously investigated. Owing to restrictions by the natural barrier between physical and biochemical disciplines , the role of physical factors in tumorigenesis is unclear. However , with the emergence of interdisciplinary mechanobiology and continuous advancements therein in the past 30 years , studies on the effect of physical properties such as hardness or shear stress on tumorigenesis and tumor progression are constantly renewing our understanding of mechanotransduction mechanisms. Shear stress , induced by liquid flow , is known to actively participate in proliferation , apoptosis , invasion , and metastasis of tumor cells. The present review discusses the progress and achievements in studies on tumor fluid microenvironment in recent years , especially fluid shear stress , on tumor metastasis , and presents directions for future study.
