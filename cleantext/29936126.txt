  Cannabidiol ( CBD) is a potent substance extracted from Cannabis sativa. As it has been suggested that marijuana can affect the reproductive system , we decided to assess the effects of chronic CBD exposure on the male reproductive system in an animal model. 21-day old male Swiss mice received CBD for 34 consecutive days at doses ( p.o.) of either 15 or 30 mg/kg , and a control group received sunflower oil. Body<symptom> weight gain and circulating progesterone concentration did not significantly change in CBD-treated animals. In the sexual behavior analysis , the CBD 15 group presented a delay in performing the first mount and intromission , and a reduced number of mounts and ejaculations. The CBD 30 group showed a 30 % reduction in fertility rate and a 23 % reduction in the number of litters. Our results indicate that chronic CBD exposure promotes functional impairment of the reproductive system of male Swiss mice.
