  Most tumors employ multiple strategies to attenuate T cell-mediated immune response. In particular , immune suppression surrounding the tumor is achieved by interfering with antigen-presenting cells and effector T cells. Controlling both the tumor and the tumor microenvironment ( TME) is critical for cancer treatment. Checkpoint blockade therapy can overcome tumor-induced immune suppression , but more than half of the patients fail to respond to this treatment; therefore , more effective cancer immunotherapies are needed. Generation of an antitumor immune response is a multi-step process of immune activation against the tumor that requires effector T cells to recognize and exert toxic effects against tumor cells , for which two strategies are employed-inhibition of various types of immune suppressor cells , such as myeloid cells and regulatory T cells; and establishment of antitumor immune surveillance including , activation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells. It was recently shown that anti-cancer drugs not only directly kill tumor cells , but also influence the immune response to cancer by promoting immunogenic cell death , enhancing antigen presentation , or depleting immunosuppressive cells. Herein , we reviewed the mechanisms by which tumors exert immune suppression as well as their regulation. We then discuss how the complex reciprocal interactions between immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory cells influence immune cell dynamics in the TME. Finally , we highlight the new therapies that can reverse immune suppression in the TME and promote antitumor immunity.
