  Orexins are neuropeptides synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus that influence arousal , feeding , reward pathways , and the response to stress. However , the role of orexins in repeated stress is not fully characterized. Here , we examined how orexins and their receptors contribute to the coping response during repeated social defeat and subsequent anxiety-like and memory-related behaviors. Specifically , we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs ( DREADDs) to stimulate orexins prior to each of five consecutive days of social defeat stress in adult male rats. Additionally , we determined the role of the orexin 2 receptor in these behaviors by using a selective orexin 2 receptor antagonist ( MK-1064) administered prior to each social defeat. Following the 5 day social defeat conditioning period , rats were evaluated in social interaction and novel object recognition paradigms to assess anxiety-like behavior and recognition memory , respectively. Activation of orexin neurons by DREADDs prior to each social defeat decreased the average latency to become defeated across 5 days , indicative of a passive coping strategy that we have previously linked to a stress vulnerable phenotype. Moreover , stimulation of orexin signaling during defeat conditioning decreased subsequent social interaction and performance in the novel object recognition test indicating increased subsequent anxiety-like behavior and reduced recognition memory. Blocking the orexin 2 receptor during repeated defeat did not alter these effects. Together , our results suggest that orexin neuron activation produces a passive coping phenotype during social defeat leading to subsequent anxiety-like behaviors and memory deficits.
