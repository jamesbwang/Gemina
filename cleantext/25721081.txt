  Heat shock<symptom> proteins ( HSPs) are important factors in the response of cancer cells to thermo- and chemotherapy. Transient hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion ( HIPEC) therapy results in the upregulation of HSP expression , which may compromise the efficacy of additional anticancer treatments. The aim of the present study was to monitor the kinetics of HSP expression in tumor cells and patients with gastric cancer following HIPEC. Thus ,
