  The goal of this review is to provide the reader with an updated summary of the cutaneous manifestations of systemic sarcoidosis , with a particular emphasis on the predilection of sarcoidosis for scars , tattoos , and other areas of traumatized skin. While the mechanism underlying the propensity for traumatized skin<symptom> to develop sarcoidosis lesions<symptom> remains unclear , several theories have been proposed including the idea that cutaneous sarcoidosis represents an exuberant , antigen-driven foreign-body response , as well as the theory that traumatized skin represents an immunocompromised district with altered local immune trafficking and neural signaling. In this review , we present two cases in which the development of cutaneous lesions<symptom> in scars and tattoos was integral to the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis. We then review the various cutaneous manifestations of systemic sarcoidosis , the clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis of scar and tattoo sarcoidosis , the proposed mechanism by which traumatized skin is prone to developing sarcoidosis lesions<symptom> , and current treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis.
