  Music induced hearing loss ( MIHL) is linked to chronic , extended exposure , and progress at a rate proportionate to exposure conditions. The aim was to document hearing deterioration; awareness of ear protection devices ( EPDs); presence of tinnitus<symptom> , measurement of temporary threshold shift. Thirty-four musicians filled a questionnaire regarding: years of experience , instrument/splayed , hours of music exposure per week with/without amplification , through earphones and speakers , use of EPDs and tinnitus<symptom>. Hearing screening in five subjects was done before and after one hour and ten minutes of practice session. Among the participants , 8.8 % reported hearing deterioration subjectively and 38.2 % reported unilateral intermittent tinnitus<symptom> , 79.4 % lacked awareness about EPDs and 21.6 % were aware but never used them. Mean for temporary threshold shift at 500 Hz and 1 KHz was 5dB HL and 10dBHL at 2 KHz. Musicians are at risk for hearing problems , but the awareness on auditory damage is limited , hence conservative measures must be taken for their well being.
