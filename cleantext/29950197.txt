  To explore the HER22 expression in children with ETV6/RUNX1 ( E/R)- positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) and to investigate the relationship between the HER2 expression and clinical features. Thirty-seven newly diagnosed E/R-positive ALL children and 6 controls ( 4 cases of ITP and 2 healthy children) were selected in Institute of hematology and blood disease hospital. The 37 patients were divided into standard risk ( SR) , intermediate risk ( IR) , high risk ( HR) groups according to risk stratification; and they were divided into relapse and non-relapse groups according to follow-up result. The CD10 Among the 37 cases , 51.35 % ( n = 19) were boys and 48.65 % ( n = 18) were girls and their median age was 4.72 ( 1.72-11.99) years old. Among the 6 controls , 50 % ( n = 3) were boys and 50 % ( n = 3) were girls and the median age was 5.24 ( 1.53-13.17) years old. The expression level of HER2 in E/R-positive ALL patients were lower than that in controls ( P < 0.05). Although the difference of HER2 expression level between the 2 groups failed to achieve statistical significance , the expression level of HER2 in relapse patients were significantly lower than that in non-relapse patients , and the HER2 expression in HR group patients were lower than that in SR and IR groups. In addition , there was no significant correlation between the expression level of HER2 and the sex , age , initial white blood cell count , blast cell percentage and the level of LDH ( P > 0.05). The expression level of HER2 in E/R
