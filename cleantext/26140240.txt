  Soft tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS) is a rare solid malignant cancer , and there are few effective treatment options for advanced disease. Cancer immunotherapy is a promising new strategy for STS treatment. IL-33 is a candidate cytokine for immunotherapy that can activate T lymphocytes and modulate antitumor immunity in some cancers. However , the expression and biological role of IL-33 in STS are poorly understood. In this study , we found that the expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 was decreased in STS using real-time PCR assays. By analyzing sarcoma<disease> data from The Cancer Genome Atlas , we found that higher transcriptional levels of IL-33 and ST2 were associated with a favorable outcome. There were positive correlations between the expression levels of ST2 and CD3E , CD4 , CD8A , CD45RO , FOXP3 , CD11B , CD33 , and IFN-γ. Strong positive correlations between the expression of IFN-γ and CD3E and CD8A were also observed. Moreover , the expression levels of both IL-33 and ST2 were positively correlated with those of CD3E , CD8A , and chemokines that recruit CD8
