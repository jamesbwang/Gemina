  Primary tumours establish metastases by interfering with distinct organs. In pre-metastatic organs , a tumour-friendly microenvironment supports metastatic cells and is prepared by many factors including tissue resident cells , bone marrow-derived cells and abundant fibrinogen depositions. However , other components are unclear. Here , we show that a third organ , originally regarded as a bystander , plays an important role in metastasis by directly affecting the pre-metastatic soil. In our model system , the liver participated in lung metastasis as a leucocyte supplier. These liver-derived leucocytes displayed liver-like characteristics and , thus , were designated hepato-entrained leucocytes ( HepELs). HepELs had high expression levels of coagulation factor X ( FX) and vitronectin ( Vtn) and relocated to fibrinogen-rich hyperpermeable regions in pre-metastatic lungs; the cells then switched their expression from Vtn to thrombospondin , both of which were fibrinogen-binding proteins. Cell surface marker analysis revealed that HepELs contained B220
