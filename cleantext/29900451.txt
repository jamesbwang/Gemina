  Coherent Raman scattering spectroscopy and microscopy are useful methods for studying the chemical and biological structures of molecules with Raman-active modes. In particular , coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering ( CARS) microscopy , which is a label-free method capable of imaging structures by displaying the vibrational contrast of the molecules , has been widely used. However , the lack of a technique for switching-off the CARS signal has prevented the development of the super-resolution Raman imaging method. Here , we demonstrate that a selective suppression of the CARS signal is possible by using a three-beam double stimulated Raman scattering ( SRS) scheme; the three beams are the pump , Stokes , and depletion lights in order of frequency. Both pump-Stokes and pump-depletion beam pairs can generate SRS processes by tuning their beat frequencies to match two different vibrational modes , then two CARS signals induced by pump-Stokes-pump and pump-depletion-pump interactions can be generated , where the two CARS signals are coupled with each other because they both involve interactions with the common pump beam. Herein , we show that as the intensity of the depletion beam is increased , one can selectively suppress the pump-Stokes-pump CARS signal because the pump-depletion SRS depletes the pump photons. A detailed theoretical description of the coupled differential equations for the three incident fields and the generated CARS signal fields is presented. Taking benzene as a molecular system , we obtained a maximum CARS suppression efficiency of about 97 % with our experimental scheme , where the ring breathing mode of the benzene is associated with pump-Stokes-pump CARS , while the C-H stretching mode is associated with the competing pump-depletion SRS process. We anticipate that this selective switching-off scheme will be of use in developing super-resolution label-free CARS microscopy.
