  Diuretic response is a strong predictor of outcome for admitted patients of acute decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ADHF). However , little is known about the effects of early diuretic response to carperitide. We retrospectively analyzed records of 85 patients hospitalized for ADHF who received carperitide as initial treatment and < 40 mg furosemide during the early period. The eligible patients were divided into good diuretic responder ( GR) group and poor diuretic responder ( PR) group on the basis of median urinary volume. The PR group demonstrated older age , lower body mass index ( BMI) , lower estimated glomerular filtration rate , and higher blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) level , left ventricular ejection fraction , and β-blockers prescribed at baseline than the GR group. The incidence of worsening renal function ( WRF) was significantly higher in the PR group than in the GR group. There was no correlation between early intravenous furosemide dose and urinary volume ( Spearman correlation , ρ = 0.111 , p = 0.312). Multivariate analysis showed that the statistically significant independent factors associated with poor diuretic response to carperitide were BMI ( Odds ratio ( OR) = 0.82 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.68-0.94 , p = 0.004) and BUN ( OR = 1.07 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.15 , p = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a lower event-free rate in the PR group than in the GR group ( log-rank , p = 0.007). BMI and BUN levels on admission were significant determinants of early poor diuretic response to carperitide. Early poor diuretic response to carperitide was associated with future poor outcomes.
