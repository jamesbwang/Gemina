  Prolactin ( PRL) , growth hormone ( GH) , and insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) are in hormone-response pathways involved in energy metabolism during thermoregulation processes in cattle. Objective herein was to study the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) within genes of the PRL and GH/IGF -1 pathways with fertility traits such as services per conception ( SPC) and days open ( DO) in Holstein cattle lactating under a hot-humid climate. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index ( THI) which revealed that the cows were exposed to heat stress conditions from June to November of 2012 in southern Sonora , Mexico. Individual blood samples from all cows were collected , spotted on FTA cards , and used to genotype a 179 tag SNP panel within 44 genes from the PRL and GH/IGF -1 pathways. The associative analyses among SNP genotypes and fertility traits were performed using mixed-effect models. Allele substitution effects were calculated using a regression model that included the genotype term as covariate. Single-SNP association analyses indicated that eight SNP within the genes IGF-1 , IGF-1R , IGFBP5 , PAPPA1 , PMCH , PRLR , SOCS5 , and SSTR2 were associated with SPC ( P < 0.05) , whereas four SNP in the genes GHR , PAPPA2 , PRLR , and SOCS4 were associated with DO ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , SNP within genes of the PRL and GH/IGF -1 pathways resulted as predictors of reproductive phenotypes in heat-stressed Holstein cows , and these SNP are proposed as candidates for a marker-assisted selection program intended to improve fertility of dairy cattle raised in warm climates.
