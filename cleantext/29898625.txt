  An important aspect of bipolar disorder ( BD) research is the identification of biomarkers pertaining to the somatic health state. The branched-chain essential amino acids ( BCAAs) , viz valine , leucine and isoleucine , have been proposed as biomarkers of an individual 's health state , given their influence on protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis inhibition. BCAA levels of 141 euthymic/subsyndromal individuals with BD and 141 matched healthy controls ( HC) were analysed by high-pressure lipid chromatography and correlated with clinical psychiatric , anthropometric and metabolic parameters. BD and HC did not differ in valine and isoleucine , whereas leucine was significantly lower in BD. Furthermore , correlations were found between BCAAs and anthropometric and glucose metabolism data. All BCAAs correlated with lipid metabolism parameters in females. There were no associations between BCAAs and long-term clinical parameters of BD. A negative correlation was found between valine and Hamilton Depression-Scale , and Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory II , in male individuals Conclusions: Our results indicate the utility of BCAAs as biomarkers for the current state of health , also in BD. As BD individuals have a high risk for overweight/obesity , in association with comorbid medical conditions ( e.g. cardiovascular diseases or insulin resistance) , health state markers are urgently required. However , no illness-specific associations were found in this euthymic/subsyndromal BD group.
