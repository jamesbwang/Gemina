  Osteosynthesis plate designs with high levels of anatomical compliance have been demonstrated to have numerous clinical benefits. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a systematic numeric approach for anatomic plate design on the example of the distal medial tibia. The advantage of using numeric approaches for plate design is to gain objective and complete anatomical input as opposed to cadaveric investigations with limited sample sizes. A recent development in this area is a proprietary technology called SOMA which is based on a large database of 3D bone models generated from thin-slice computer tomographic scans plus associated software tools. In this paper , one of these associated software tools is described which automatically assesses the anatomic fit of osteosynthesis plates based on a large database of bone models. As an example , this tool was applied to assess the mean plate to bone distance of distal medial tibia plates , when fitted onto 444 Caucasian and 310 Asian 3D bone models respectively. The analyses revealed differences in the anatomical compliance of plates from different generations and manufacturers. The anatomical compliance of SOMA designed plates was statistically significantly better compared to all other plates in all groups `` Short '' , `` Intermediate '' and `` Long '' and for both ethnicities `` Caucasian '' and `` Asian '' ( P < 0.001). The study has shown that using an underlying database with accompanying computational tools such as SOMA can be a powerful and efficient approach towards the development and advancement of osteosynthesis plates in trauma surgery , ultimately resulting in plates with high levels of anatomical compliance and potential clinical benefits.
