  Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) is a valuable technique to assess and modulate human brain function in normal and pathological conditions. This critical review surveys the contributions of TMS to the diagnosis , insight into pathophysiology and treatment of genetically confirmed hereditary ataxias<symptom> , a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders that can affect motor cortex and the corticospinal tract. Most studies were conducted on small sample sizes and focused on diagnostic approaches. The available data demonstrate early involvement of the corticospinal tract and motor cortex circuitry , and support the possible efficacy of cerebellar repetitive TMS ( rTMS) as therapeutic approach. Further TMS-based studies are warranted , to establish biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring , explore the involvement of the cerebello-dentato-thalamo-cortical projection , study the effects of rTMS-induced plasticity , and utilize rTMS for treatment.
