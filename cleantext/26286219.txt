  Reconstruction of floor of the mouth<symptom> and ventral surface of the tongue defects can be challenging because inadequate correction can lead to mobility restriction of the tongue and resultant impairment of speech and swallowing. Ideal flap should be pliable , provide adequate bulk , be easy to harvest , and cosmetically acceptable. Commonly used ipsilateral facial artery-based myomucosal flaps may not be ideal if facial vessels need resection. We share our experience in a case of simultaneous primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of right submandibular and sublingual glands , with a postsurgical defect involving floor of the mouth<symptom> and ventral surface of the tongue , reconstructed with islanded facial artery myomucosal flap raised from left buccal mucosa and tunneled into the right floor of the mouth<symptom> defect medial to mandible. The case is being reported to share the method of reconstruction as well as for the rare presentation of simultaneous primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of multiple major salivary glands.
