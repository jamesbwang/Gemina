  Proliferating cells known as neoblasts include pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs) that sustain tissue homeostasis and regeneration of lost body parts in planarians. However , the lack of markers to prospectively identify and isolate these adult PSCs has significantly hampered their characterization. We used single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq) and single-cell transplantation to address this long-standing issue. Large-scale scRNA-seq of sorted neoblasts unveiled a novel subtype of neoblast ( Nb2) characterized by high levels of PIWI-1 mRNA and protein and marked by a conserved cell-surface protein-coding gene , tetraspanin 1 ( tspan-1). tspan-1-positive cells survived sub-lethal irradiation , underwent clonal expansion to repopulate whole animals , and when purified with an anti-TSPAN-1 antibody , rescued the viability of lethally irradiated animals after single-cell transplantation. The first prospective isolation of an adult PSC bridges a conceptual dichotomy between functionally and molecularly defined neoblasts , shedding light on mechanisms governing in vivo pluripotency and a source of regeneration in animals.
