  An aortopulmonary artery fistula<disease> combined with aortic and pulmonary artery dissection is extremely rare , and very few cases have been reported to date. Herein , we present a 38-year-old man with huge ascending aortic , arch and thoraco-abdominal aneurysms<disease> with chronic aortic dissection , pulmonary artery dissection and aortopulmonary fistula<disease>. Surgery was performed to replace the ascending aorta and the entire arch combined with a conventional elephant trunk implantation to correct the pulmonary artery dissection and repair the aortopulmonary fistula<disease> under selective cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The patient recovered uneventfully. A second-stage operation will be needed to replace the thoraco-abdominal aorta.
