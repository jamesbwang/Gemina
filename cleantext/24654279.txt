  Natural gas is a robust and environmentally friendlier alternative to oil resources for energy and chemicals production. However , gas is distributed globally within shales and hydrates , which are generally remote and difficult reserves to produce. The accessibility , transportation , and distribution , therefore , bring major capital costs. With today 's low and foreseen low price of natural gas , conversion of natural gas to higher value-added chemicals is highly sought by industry. Dry reforming of methane ( DRM) is a technology pathway to convert two critical greenhouse gas components , CH
