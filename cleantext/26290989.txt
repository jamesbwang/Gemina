  X-ray induced sample damage can impede electronic and structural investigations of radiation-sensitive samples studied with X-rays. Here we quantify dose-dependent sample damage to the prototypical MnIII ( acac) 3 complex in solution and at room temperature for the soft X-ray range , using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn L-edge. We observe the appearance of a reduced MnII species as the X-ray dose is increased. We find a half-damage dose of 1.6 MGy and quantify a spectroscopically tolerable dose on the order of 0.3 MGy ( 1 Gy = 1 J kg-1) , where 90 % of MnIII ( acac) 3 are intact. Our dose-limit is around one order of magnitude lower than the Henderson limit ( half-damage dose of 20 MGy) which is commonly employed for protein crystallography with hard X-rays. It is comparable , however , to the dose-limits obtained for collecting un-damaged Mn K-edge spectra of the photosystem II protein , using hard X-rays. The dose-dependent reduction of MnIII observed here for solution samples occurs at a dose limit that is two to four orders of magnitude smaller than the dose limits previously reported for soft X-ray spectroscopy of iron samples in the solid phase. We compare our measured to calculated spectra from ab initio restricted active space ( RAS) theory and discuss possible mechanisms for the observed dose-dependent damage of MnIII ( acac) 3 in solution. On the basis of our results , we assess the influence of sample damage in other experimental studies with soft X-rays from storage-ring synchrotron radiation sources and X-ray free-electron lasers.
