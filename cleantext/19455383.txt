  Mirror image artifact in ultrasound is not an unusual phenomenon. However , it is rarely seen in thyroid ultrasound because of the natural convexity of the tracheal surface. We report a mirror artifact during thyroid ultrasound in a patient with an excessively collapsible trachea. Minor pressure with the transducer made the trachea surface flat or concave , and then a cyst<symptom> in the thyroid was mirrored across the trachea , which mimicked an intratracheal cyst<symptom>. This case illustrates how an unusual collapsible trachea can generate an image that simulates an intratracheal lesion<symptom> during thyroid ultrasound.
