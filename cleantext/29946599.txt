  Nanoparticles ( NPs) grafted with polymer chains prepared via a grafting-from strategy are studied through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations combined with our stochastic reaction model. A system involving multiple individual NPs , with grafting-from processes for all the NPs induced simultaneously , is simulated , so that chain growth competition on the same NP , as well as between neighbouring NPs , are both naturally considered. Our results imply that there should be an optimized range of NP sizes , as compared to monomer size , in which initiator sites are most easily induced. Besides , when the initiator density is high , a shielding effect from the sparse long chains on the most short chains or initiators evidently yields an extremely unbiased distribution of chains. We also adopt a representative polymer-tethered NP prepared via a grafting-from strategy to study the potential of mean force between NPs , so that the dispersion and stabilization abilities of such polymer-grafted NPs in a polymer matrix can be generally predicted during the preparation of polymer nanocomposite materials. Our study helps to elucidate the cause of chain dispersity during the grafting-from process and could act as a guide for better design and to improve the performance of polymer nanocomposites.
