  Management of traumatic splenic injury may be operative or non-operative ( including embolization and conservative management). Traditionally , haemodynamic instability has been an indication for operative intervention. We aimed to report our experience of managing traumatic splenic injury at a regional major trauma centre in the UK over a 4-year period , with a particular focus on the non-operative management ( NOM) of haemodynamically unstable patients. All patients with splenic injuries admitted to North Bristol NHS Trust from April 2012 to March 2016 were included. Patients were classified for analyses by injury severity ( low or high grade) , haemodynamic instability ( defined as a reverse shock<symptom> index < 1) and management category ( operative or non-operative). 106 patients were included. Overall 85.8 % of patients received NOM: 79.2 % conservative and 6.6 % interventional radiology. Two patients ( 2.4 %) managed conservatively required further intervention. Haemodynamically stable and unstable patients were equally likely to receive NOM ( 89.7 and 81.3 % respectively , p = 1). All unstable patients with low-grade injuries were managed conservatively and only one ( 2.7 %) required further intervention. Two unstable patients with high-grade injuries ( 28.6 %) underwent NOM successfully. These data support the safe application of non-operative management to haemodynamically unstable patients with traumatic splenic injury , particularly in those with low-grade injuries. Additional prospective work is required to define the subgroup of patients for whom this is appropriate and to determine the long-term outcomes of NOM.
