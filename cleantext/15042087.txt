  Understanding how patterns and travelling waves form in chemical and biological reaction-diffusion models is an area which has been widely researched , yet is still experiencing fast development. Surprisingly enough , we still do not have a clear understanding about all possible types of dynamical regimes in classical reaction-diffusion models , such as Lotka-Volterra competition models with spatial dependence. In this study , we demonstrate some new types of wave propagation and pattern formation in a classical three species cyclic competition model with spatial diffusion , which have been so far missed in the literature. These new patterns are characterized by a high regularity in space , but are different from patterns previously known to exist in reaction-diffusion models , and may have important applications in improving our understanding of biological pattern formation and invasion theory. Finding these new patterns is made technically possible by using an automatic adaptive finite element method driven by a novel
