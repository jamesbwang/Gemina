  A previous community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in a semi-urban community revealed that 44 % of people aged 18 + years manifest dysglycaemia , which appears to echo the national trend. There is lack of studies examining the role of anthropometric indices in people with dysglycaemia. We explored the screening ability of anthropometric indices , body mass index ( BMI) , waist circumference ( WC) , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR) , and waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) to detect dysglycaemia in the adult Omani population based on a community-based survey conducted in 2005. The potential of anthropometric indices to detect the presence of glycaemic disorder could aid in detection , prevention and health education. A total of 480 male and 795 female subjects aged 18 + years were included in this study. The prevalence of dysglycaemia was analysed using the American Diabetic Association criteria. Logistic regression approach and Receiver- Operating Characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was performed. The analysis revealed that mean values of age , BMI , WC , WHR and WHtR increased significantly from normoglycemic to pre-diabetic and further to diabetic in both sexes ( P < 0.0001). Dysglycemia showed an increasing prevalence with age. WHtR showed the highest sensitivity for detecting dysglycemia in all age groups compared to other anthropometric indices with sensitivity rate of 94.4 % in â‰¥ 45 years , 88.6 % in ( 25- 44) years and 45.6 % in age group < 25 years. Among the anthropometric indices we investigated , WHtR was the best predictor of dysglycaemia among Omani adults aged > 25 years.
