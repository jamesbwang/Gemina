  To evaluate whether a liposomal bupivacaine incisional block decreases postoperative pain and represents an opioid-minimizing strategy after scheduled cesarean delivery. In a single-blind , randomized controlled trial among opioid-naive women undergoing cesarean delivery , liposomal bupivacaine or placebo was infiltrated into the fascia and skin at the surgical site , before fascial closure. Using an 11-point numeric rating scale , the primary outcome was pain score with movement at 48 hours postoperatively. A sample size of 40 women per group was needed to detect a 1.5-point reduction in pain score in the intervention group. Pain scores and opioid consumption , in oral morphine milligram equivalents , at 48 hours postoperatively were summarized as medians ( interquartile range) and compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Between March and September 2017 , 249 women were screened , 103 women enrolled , and 80 women were randomized. One woman in the liposomal bupivacaine group was excluded after randomization as a result of a vertical skin incision , leaving 39 patients in the liposomal bupivacaine group and 40 in the placebo group. Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. The median ( interquartile range) pain score with movement at 48 hours postoperatively was 4 ( 2-5) in the liposomal bupivacaine group and 3.5 ( 2-5.5) in the placebo group ( P = .72). The median ( interquartile range) opioid use was 37.5 ( 7.5-60) morphine milligram equivalents in the liposomal bupivacaine group and 37.5 ( 15-75) morphine milligram equivalents in the placebo group during the first 48 hours postoperatively ( P = .44). Compared with placebo , a liposomal bupivacaine incisional block at the time of cesarean delivery resulted in similar postoperative pain scores in the first 48 hours postoperatively.
