  Peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases ( GTase) of family 51 are essential enzymes for the synthesis of the glycan chains of the bacterial cell wall. They are considered potential antibacterial target , but discovery of inhibitors was hampered so far by the lack of efficient and affordable screening assay. Here we used Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> MtgA to introduce a single tryptophan reporter residue in selected positions flanking the substrates binding cavity of the protein. We selected a mutant ( Y181W) that shows strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of moenomycin A and two lipid II analogs inhibitors. The assay provides a simple method to study GTase-ligand interactions and can be used as primary high throughput screening of GTase inhibitors without the need for lipid II substrate or reporter ligands.
