  Background and aim Chronic musculoskeletal pain , e.g. whiplash associated disorders ( WAD) , fibromyalgia and myalgia<symptom> , causes significant burden on both the individual and on society as a whole. In a previous study , the authors concluded that there is a likely connection between chronic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> ( BPPV)/ canalithiasis and headache<symptom> , neck<symptom> pain<symptom> , generalized pain , fatigue<symptom> , cognitive dysfunctions as well as tinnitus<symptom>. The balance<symptom> dysfunction in BPPV/canalithiasis is dynamic and not static. This leads to a perpetual postural mismatch. The vicious cycle of a disturbed equilibrium control system may be the driving force behind the vicious cycle of pain. The aim of this study is to investigate if otolith-repositioning manoeuvres in patients with chronic BPPV/canalithiasis can be beneficial. Methods During a period of about two years a prospective observational study on patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain referred for physiotherapy was performed. Those with a Dizziness<symptom> Handicap Inventory ( DHI) inquiry score above 20 underwent further investigations to diagnose chronic BPPV/canalithiasis. Diagnostic criteria: ( A) The diagnosis of BPPV/canalithiasis was confirmed with the following: ( 1) specific history of vertigo<symptom> or dizziness<symptom> provoked by acceleration/deceleration , AND ( 2) nystagmus<symptom> and symptoms during at least one of the test positions; ( B) the disorder had persisted for at least one year. Specific otolith repositioning manoeuvre for each semi-circular canal ( SCC) was performed. Symptom questionnaire ( `` yes '' or `` no '' answers during a personal interview) and a follow-up questionnaire were used. Results The responders of the follow-up questionnaire constituted the study group. Thirty-nine patients responded ( i.e. 87 %) ( 31 females , 8 males) with a median age of 44 years ( 17-65). The median duration of the disease was5 years. Seventy-nine percent had ahistory ofhead or neck trauma. The DHI median score was 48 points ( score > 60 indicates a risk of fall). The video-oculography confirmed BPPV/canalithiasis in more than one semi-circular canal in all patients. In the present study the frequency of affected anterior semi-circular canal ( SSC) was at a minimum of 26 % and could be as high as 65 %. Ninety-five percent suffered from headache<symptom> , 92 % from neck<symptom> pain<symptom> , 54 % had generalized pain , and 56 % had temporo-mandibular joint region pain. Fatigue<symptom> ( 97 %) , aggravation by physical exertion ( 87 %) , decreased ability to concentrate ( 85 %) aswellas visual disturbances ( 85 %) were the most frequently reported symptoms , and 49 % suffered from tinnitus<symptom>. The median number of otolith repositioning manoeuvres done was six ( 2-29). Median time span between finishing otolith repositioning manoeuvres and answering the questionnaire was 7 months. Effects of treatment and conclusion The present study has shown that repositioning of otoliths in the SCCs in nearly all patients with chronic BPPV/canalithiasis ameliorated pain and other symptoms. The correlation between vertigo/dizziness and the majority of symptoms was significant. Therefore , there is strong evidence to suggest that there is a connection between chronic BPPV/canalithiasis and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> as well as the above-mentioned symptoms. Implications Patients with unexplained pain conditions should be evaluated withthe Dizziness<symptom> Handicap Inventory-questionnaire , which can identify treatable balance<symptom> disorders.
