  Diabetic nephropathy is one of the manifestations of systemic microangiopathy in diabetes. Hesperetin , a natural flavanone glycoside compound in citrus fruits , has been demonstrated to exert hypoglycemic effects and protect kidney in experimental diabetic animals. The current study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the hypoglycemic effects of hesperetin in high-fat/streptozocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic nephropathy. The results showed that mice in whom hesperetin was administered for 4 weeks attenuated the increased fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance ability that was observed in high-fat/STZ mice. In addition , we found that hesperetin ameliorated the abnormalities of biochemical parameters in serum , liver , and kidney of mice with diabetic nephropathy. Hesperetin also rescued the irregular distortions in glomerular basement membrane and expanded mesangial regions. Moreover , hesperetin repaired the function of podocyte by increasing renal nephrin expression and decreasing renal alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. Furthermore , hesperetin inhibited the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) and its downstream effectors integrin-linked kinase ( ILK) and Akt. In conclusion , our study implies that hesperetin produced protective effects in diabetic nephropathy possibly by suppressing TGF-β1-ILK-Akt signaling.
