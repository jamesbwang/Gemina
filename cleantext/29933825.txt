  The burden of alcohol and drug use disorders ( substance use disorders ( SUDs)) has intensified efforts to expand access to cost-effective psychosocial interventions and pharmacotherapies. This article provides an overview of technology-based interventions ( eg , computer-based and Web-based interventions , text messaging , interactive voice recognition , smartphone apps , and emerging technologies) that are extending the reach of effective addiction treatments both in substance use treatment and primary care settings. It discusses the efficacy of existing technology-based interventions for SUDs , prospects for emerging technologies , and special considerations when integrating technologies in primary care ( eg , privacy and regulatory protocols) to enhance the management of SUDs.
