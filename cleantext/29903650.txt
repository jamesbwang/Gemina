  While low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> significantly impacts on an individual 's well-being , our understanding of the role of well-being in the natural history of low back pain is limited. This cohort study aimed to investigate the association between psychological and general well-being and the development and progression of low back pain and disability in community-based women over a 2-year period. 506 women recruited from a research database were invited to participate. Overall psychological and general well-being and its subdomains were assessed at baseline using the Psychological General Well-Being Index ( PGWB). The intensity of and degree of disability arising from low back pain were examined using the Chronic<symptom> Pain<symptom> Grade Questionnaire at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Participants were categorized as having no , developing , resolving , or persistent high-intensity pain and disability. 444 participants ( 87.8 %) completed the study. Women with persistent high-intensity pain had lower PGWB scores at baseline than those with no high-intensity pain at follow-up , after adjusting for confounders ( M ( SE) = 69.9 ( 2.55) vs 80.1 ( 2.63) , p < 0.005). Furthermore , women with persistent high disability scores had lower well-being scores than those without persistent high disability scores ( M ( SE) = 69.1 ( 3.49) vs. 81.2 ( 0.802) , p = 0.001). Moreover , lower scores in the well-being subdomains of general health and vitality were associated with persistent high pain intensity and disability ( all p < 0.007). In summary , lower levels of general health and vitality were associated with persistent high-intensity low back pain and disability , suggesting that improving these aspects of well-being has the potential to reduce high levels of chronic low back pain and disability in community-based women.
