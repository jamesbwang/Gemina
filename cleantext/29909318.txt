  The growing interest in assuring phytomedicines efficacy and moreover the increase in requirements for its safety drive the development of analytical methods for its quality control assurance. Herein , we present a nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) fingerprinting approach of artichoke leaf material from different origins and in its commercial preparations. Under optimized conditions , we were able to simultaneously identify 23 metabolites including sugars , amino and organic acids , sesquiterpene lactones , flavones , cinnamates , inulin , fatty acids and nitrogenous bases. Principal component analysis ( PCA) was used to reveal for differences among artichoke specimens. PCA score plot derived from the aromatic region ( 5-10 ppm) provided better classification model than that of full scan ( 0-10 ppm) , and revealing for enrichment of wild Egyptian and Tanzanian artichoke in sesquiterpene viz. aguerin B versus O-caffeoylquinic acid and luteolin abundance in cultivated leaf. PCA analysis of 3 commercial artichoke preparations showed discrimination of a silymarin-containing capsule suggesting that NMR can distinguish liver-aid herbal preparations based on its different chemical composition.
