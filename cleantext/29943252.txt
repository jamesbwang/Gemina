  This study investigated the growth , physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> , and the transcript levels of NHX1 gene of Iris halophila in response to low NaCl concentration ( 50 mM) and high NaCl concentration ( 150 mM). Our results showed that both 50 and 150 mM NaCl had no obvious negative effects on plant growth; what is more , low NaCl concentration ( 50 mM) increased root length , root fresh weight , and the ratio of root length to leaf length compared with the control group. The malondialdehyde ( MDA) contents in leaves and roots of I. halophila had no obvious difference as compared with control. Proline levels of I. halophila exhibited basically an enhancement under salt stress conditions. Particularly at 4 days , the proline contents in leaves reached 1.85 to 2.31-fold higher and the contents in roots reached 1.27 to 1.62-fold higher than that of control at 50 and 150 mM NaCl , respectively. The contents of the soluble sugar in leaves and roots of I. halophila under 150 mM NaCl at 7 days were 32.4 and 98.7 % higher than that of control , respectively. The increase rate of K
