  The aim of this meta-analysis of studies of workers in the health and social care sector was to examine the relationship between interprofessional work and employee outcomes of job stress , autonomy , burnout , engagement , job satisfaction , turnover intention , and perceived service quality , and to examine the influence of different moderators on those relationships. A systematic literature search of the PsycInfo , Embase , Medline , and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases was conducted to identify relevant articles. A total of 45 articles with results for 53 independent samples was included in the meta-analysis. A random effects model was used to estimate the mean effect sizes ( correlations). Most employees were nurses working in hospitals. Interprofessional work was weakly negatively associated with job stress , burnout , and turnover intention ( range mean r = -.13 to -.22); and was moderately positively associated with autonomy , engagement , job satisfaction , and perceived service quality ( range mean r = .33 to .46). When feasible , interprofessional work was categorized as teamwork ( most intensive) , collaboration , or cooperation. Teamwork , the most intense of three forms of interprofessional work , promoted lower burnout and turnover intention. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that interprofessional work is linked to better well-being for employees in health and social care.
