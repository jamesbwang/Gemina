  We studied ( i) a set of three Co: Au continuous films , grown by sputtering co-deposition ( ∼ 80 nm thick) with concentration ratios of 2: 1 , 1: 1 and 1: 0 ( i.e. , a pure Co film was also included) , and ( ii) a corresponding set of antidot arrays , produced by nanosphere lithography with the same hexagonal pattern ( nominal lattice periodicity ∼ 520 nm). The samples were investigated by atomic and magnetic force microscopy and SQUID magnetometry. A twofold aim was fulfilled: to gain information on the magnetism of the CoAu compound ( saturation magnetization , effective in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy , exchange stiffness constant and magnetostrictive behavior) and to compare the magnetic behavior of the continuous and patterned samples. The continuous films exhibited a variety of hysteretic behaviours and magnetic configurations , ruled by the interplay between different magnetic anisotropy terms ( magnetocrystalline , magnetoelastic and shape). The Co1Au1 film was anisotropic in the plane , whereas Co2Au1 and Co were isotropic and had an out-of-plane magnetization component; stripe domains were observed in Co2Au1 , resulting in a transcritical hysteresis loop. A key role in determining these properties was ascribed to the magnetoelastic anisotropy term. Unlike the continuous films , the antidot arrays showed a similar hysteretic behavior and important similarities in the spin configuration were pointed out , despite the different compositions. We argue , also based on micromagnetic simulations , that this occurred because the nanopatterning enabled a local modification of the shape anisotropy , thus smoothing out the differences observed in the continuous films.
