  To describe the relationship between a short interpregnancy interval and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the population undergoing assisted reproductive technology. This is a retrospective analysis using data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System. The cohort includes patients with a history of live birth from assisted reproductive technology who returned for a fresh , autologous in vitro fertilization ( IVF) cycle from 2004 to 2013. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the interval from live birth to cycle start. Logistic regression models of preterm delivery ( less than 37 weeks of gestation) and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( less than 2,500 g) on interpregnancy interval were fit with adjustment for age , body mass index , and history of preterm delivery. Predicted probabilities were generated from the logistic model. Of 51,997 fresh IVF cycles after an index live birth , 17,536 resulted in a repeat live birth with 11,271 singleton live births from autologous IVF. An interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months occurred in 40.9 % of cycles. Compared with a reference interpregnancy interval of 12 to less than 18 months , the adjusted odds ratio for singleton preterm delivery was 1.66 ( 95 % CI 1.05-2.65) for an interpregnancy interval less than 6 months and 1.34 ( 95 % CI 1.06-1.69) for 6 to less than 12 months. An interpregnancy interval 6 to less than 12 months was associated with a 3.0 % increase in preterm delivery ( 13.6 ± 1.1 % vs 10.6 ± 0.7 % , P = .030) and a 2.7 % increase in low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( 8.0 ± 0.9 % vs 5.3 ± 0.5 % , P = .025) compared with an interpregnancy interval of 12 to less than 18 months. In this nationally representative population , an interval from delivery to treatment start of less than 12 months is associated with increased rates of preterm delivery and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight in singleton live births from assisted reproductive technology. The data support delaying the start of IVF treatment 12 months from a live birth , but do not suggest a benefit from a longer interval as has been recommended for naturally conceiving couples.
