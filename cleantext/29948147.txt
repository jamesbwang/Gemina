  To evaluate associations between pathologic factors and erythroblast transformation-specific ( ETS)- related gene ( ERG) expression in prostate cancer patients. Using next-generation sequencing , we identified target genes and regulatory networks. ERG expression in 60 radical prostatectomies was compared with pathological findings by association rule mining with the Apriori algorithm. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing were performed on three formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ERG-positive and negative prostate cancer samples. A network diagram identifying dominant altered genes was constructed using Cytoscape open-source bioinformatics platform and GeneMania plugin. Pathologic conditions positive for perineural invasion , apical margins , and Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 were significantly more likely to be ERG-positive than other pathologic conditions ( p = 0.0008) , suggesting an association between ERG positivity , perineural invasion , apical margins , and Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 ( Firth 's logistic regression: OR 42.565 , 95 % CI 1.670-1084.847 , p = 0.0232). Results of whole-exome and RNA sequencing identified 97 somatic mutations containing common mutated genes. Regulatory network analysis identified NOTCH1 , MEF2C , STAT3 , LCK , CACNA2D3 , PCSK7 , MEF2A , PDZD2 , TAB1 , and ASGR1 as pivotal genes. NOTCH1 appears to function as a hub , because it had the highest node degree and betweenness. NOTCH1 staining was found 8 of 60 specimens ( 13 %) , with a significant association between ERG and NOTCH1 positivity ( p = 0.001). Evaluating the association between ERG expression and pathologic factors , and identifying the regulatory network and pivotal hub may help to understand the clinical significance of ERG-positive prostate cancer.
