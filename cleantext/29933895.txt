  Freestanding emergency departments ( FSED) are equipped to care for most emergencies , but do not have all the resources that hospital-based emergency departments ( ED) offer. As the number of FSEDs grows rapidly , emergency medical services ( EMS) must routinely determine whether a FSED is an appropriate destination. Inappropriate triage may delay definitive care , potentially increasing morbidity , mortality , and resource utilization. We sought to evaluate paramedics ' ability in determining whether a FSED is the most appropriate destination. We conducted a retrospective study of two county EMS agencies and two FSEDs over a 25-month period in Alachua and Levy County , Florida , USA. Both EMS agencies allow paramedic discretion in determining transport destination. To determine whether paramedics can correctly identify patients that can be cared for fully at a FSED , our primary outcome was the percentage of patients transported to FSEDs by EMS that were discharged without additional hospital-based resources. We identified 1247 EMS patients that had a selected destination of FSED. We excluded patients that did not arrive at their selected FSED destination , left before FSED disposition , or were transferred from the FSED to unaffiliated hospitals. A total of 1184 patients were included for analysis , and 885 ( 74.7 %) did not require additional hospital resources. Comparing the two EMS agencies yielded similar results. In this study , involving two EMS agencies over a 25-month period , we found that 3 out of 4 patients deemed appropriate for transport to a FSED by a paramedic did not require additional hospital-based services.
