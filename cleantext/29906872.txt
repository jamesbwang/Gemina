  Based on the Langevin equation of Brownian motion , we present a simple model that emulates a typical mode in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , providing a demonstration of several key properties. The model equation is consistent with von Kármán decay law and Kolmogorov 's symmetries. We primarily focus on the behavior of inertial range modes , although we also attempt to include some properties of the large-scale modes. Dissipation scales are not considered. Results from the model are compared with results from published direct numerical simulations.
