  Abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> ( AAA) have most probably an inflammatory origin , whereby the elastica is the layer actually involved. In the past , collagen weackness was supposed to be the shared cause of both , AAA and incisional hernias. Since the development of new techniques of closure of the abdominal wall over the last decade , collagen deficency seems to play only a secondary etiologic role. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the incidence of incisional hernia following laparotomy due to AAA differs from that of colorectal interventions. This was a retrospective control matched cohort study. After screening of 403 patients with colorectal interventions and 96 patients with AAA , 27 and 72 patients , respectively were included. The match criteria for inclusion of patients with colorectal interventions were: age , benign underlying disease and median xiphopubic laparotomy. The primary endpoint was the incidence of an incisional hernia. The secondary endpoints were the risk profile , length of stay in the intensive care unit and postoperative complications. Data analysis was carried in the consecutive collective from 2006 to 2008. In the group with AAA the mean follow-up was 34.5 ± 18.1 months and in the group with colorectal interventions 35.7 ± 21.4 months. The incidence of incisional hernias showed no significant differences between the two groups. In the AAA group 10 patients ( 13.8 %) developed an incisional hernia in contrast to 7 patients in the colorectal intervention group ( 25.9 %). In our collective patients with AAA did not show an increased incidence of incisional hernia in comparison to patients with colorectal interventions with comparable size of the laparotomy access and age. The quality of closure of the abdominal wall seems to be an important factor for the prevention of incisional hernia.
