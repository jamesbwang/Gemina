  Cancer and ageing can be regarded as two different manifestations of the same underlying process-accumulation of cellular damage-and therefore both are closely linked. Nowadays , the ageing of populations worldwide is leading to an unprecedented increase in cancer cases and fatalities , and therefore the understanding of links between cancer and ageing is more important than ever. Spalax is considered an excellent model for ageing and , additionally , for cancer research , due to not show clear age-related phenotypic changes and not develop spontaneous tumours , despite its relatively long lifespan ( âˆ¼ 20 years in captivity). Thereby , the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent knowledge on Spalax , with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms associated with their longevity and cancer resistance.
