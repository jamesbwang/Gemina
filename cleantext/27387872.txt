  Recently , great technical progress has been achieved in the field of plant phenotyping. High-throughput platforms and the development of improved algorithms for rosette image segmentation make it possible to extract shape and size parameters for genetic , physiological , and environmental studies on a large scale. The development of low-cost phenotyping platforms and freeware resources make it possible to widely expand phenotypic analysis tools for Arabidopsis. However , objective descriptors of shape parameters that could be used independently of the platform and segmentation software used are still lacking , and shape descriptions still rely on ad hoc or even contradictory descriptors , which could make comparisons difficult and perhaps inaccurate. Modern geometric morphometrics is a family of methods in quantitative biology proposed to be the main source of data and analytical tools in the emerging field of phenomics studies. Based on the location of landmarks ( corresponding points) over imaged specimens and by combining geometry , multivariate analysis , and powerful statistical techniques , these tools offer the possibility to reproducibly and accurately account for shape variations among groups and measure them in shape distance units. Here , a particular scheme of landmark placement on Arabidopsis rosette images is proposed to study shape variation in viral<disease> infection<disease> processes. Shape differences between controls and infected plants are quantified throughout the infectious process and visualized. Quantitative comparisons between two unrelated ssRNA + viruses are shown , and reproducibility issues are assessed. Combined with the newest automated platforms and plant segmentation procedures , geometric morphometric tools could boost phenotypic features extraction and processing in an objective , reproducible manner.
