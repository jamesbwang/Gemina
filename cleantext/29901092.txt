  Despite significant progress in the treatment of gastric cancer ( GC) , the prognosis remains poor and the mortality is high. Targeted drugs have been incorporated into routine treatment to improve treatment efficacy. However , the therapy response is still below 50 %. Therefore , there is a need to identify predictive factors for patient response to a specific drug in order to improve the efficacy of drug therapy. The present article reviewed the predictive factors for target therapy in GC , including epidermal growth factor receptor , human epidermal receptor 2 , vascular endothelial growth factor family , molecules in the mesenchymalâ€‘epithelial transition pathway and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Additionally , the present review described the interactions between these molecules and signaling pathways.
