  Sequence-level searches on large collections of RNA sequencing experiments , such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( SRA) , would enable one to ask many questions about the expression or variation of a given transcript in a population. Existing approaches , such as the sequence Bloom tree , suffer from fundamental limitations of the Bloom filter , resulting in slow build and query times , less-than-optimal space usage , and potentially large numbers of false-positives. This paper introduces Mantis , a space-efficient system that uses new data structures to index thousands of raw-read experiments and facilitates large-scale sequence searches. In our evaluation , index construction with Mantis is 6 × faster and yields a 20 % smaller index than the state-of-the-art split sequence Bloom tree ( SSBT). For queries , Mantis is 6-108 × faster than SSBT and has no false-positives or- negatives. For example , Mantis was able to search for all 200,400 known human transcripts in an index of 2,652 RNA sequencing experiments in 82 min; SSBT took close to 4 days.
