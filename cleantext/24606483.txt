  Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men. There are various estimates of prostate cancer incidence from different geographical areas in Iran. In addition , no systematic reviews are available regarding the incidence rate of prostate cancer in Iran. Therefore , the present systematic review aimed to address this epidemiological gap. This systematic review was performed based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in July 2017. In doing so , the researchers searched Medline/PubMed , Scopus , Embase , ScienceDirect , and Google Scholar for international articles and four Iranian databases ( Scientific Information Database , MagIran , IranMedex , and IranDoc) for Persian articles. A total of 274 titles were retrieved in the initial search of the databases. Further refinement and screening of the retrieved studies produced a total of 21 studies. Based on the random-effect model , the age-standardized rate of prostate cancer was 9.11 and 95 % confidence interval was 8.19-10.04. Besides , the results of Cochran 's test indicated the heterogeneity of the studies ( Q = 1457.8 , df = 46.0 , I The incidence of prostate cancer was lower in Iran than in the other parts of the world. Yet , establishing cancer registries covering a broader perspective of the population and conducting further studies are required to map out the exact incidence rate and trend of prostate cancer in Iran.
