  To determine the effect of capture and restraint on hematologic , plasma biochemical , and venous blood gas values in Dalmatian pelicans ( Pelecanus crispus) , blood samples were collected and temperature and heart rate were recorded in 13 pelicans ( 5 males and 8 females) immediately after capture from a large field exhibit. Repeat sampling was performed after transport , a mean of 74 minutes after initial evaluation. When compared with values at initial sampling to the time of capture , significant increases were documented in the heterophil: lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( H: L) , carbon dioxide ( CO
