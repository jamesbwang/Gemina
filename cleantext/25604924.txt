  To identify and compare emollient formularies across all clinical commissioning groups ( CCGs) and local health boards ( LHBs) in England and Wales. Formularies were retrieved via CCG/LHB websites or Google search ( October 2016-February 2017). Data on structure and content were extracted , and descriptive analyses were undertaken. 209 English CCGs and 7 Welsh LHBs. Number and structure of formularies; number , type and name of emollients and bath additive recommendedandnot recommended; and any rationale given. 102formularies were identified , which named 109 emollients and 24 bath additives. Most were structured in an ` order of preference ' ( 63 %) and/or formulation ( 51 %) format. Creams and ointments were the most commonly recommended types of emollients , and three ointments were the most commonly recommended specific emollients ( 71 % -79 % of formularies). However , there was poor consensus over which emollient should be used first line and 4 out of 10 of the most recommended lotions and creams contained antimicrobials or urea. Patient preference ( 60 %) and/or cost ( 58 %) were the most common reasons given for the recommendations. Of the 82 % of formularies that recommend the use of bath additives , 75 % did not give any reasons for their recommendation. Emollient formularies in England and Wales vary widely in their structure , recommendations and rationale. The reasons for such inconsistencies are unclear , risk confusion<symptom> and make for inequitable regional variation. There is poor justification for multiple different , conflicting formularies.
