  This study aims to analyze the distribution and clinicopathological characteristics of anti-aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid ( tRNA) synthetase ( ARS) antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> patients. We retrospectively studied the anti-ARS antibody levels in 228 RA patients ' ( 44 males , 184 females; mean age 62.9 Â± 14.0 years; range 23 to 88 years) sera from their medical charts. We determined the association with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody levels , interstitial lung disease ( ILD) , rheumatoid factor , and methotrexate or biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatments. Anti-ARS antibodies were detected in 14 RA patients ( 6.1 %). ILD complications were significantly higher among anti-ARS antibody-positive patients ( 57.1 % vs 22.4 % , p < 0.05). Levels of anti-threonyl-tRNA-synthetase ( anti-PL-7) and anti-alanyl-tRNA-synthetase ( anti-PL-12) , two anti-ARS antibodies , were higher in RA patients with concurrent ILD ( both p < 0.05). Myositis and ILD worsening were not observed in three anti-ARS antibody- positive patients despite biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug administration. There was no difference in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and rheumatoid factor specificities between patients with or without ARS antibodies. Anti-ARS antibodies were detected in RA patients , with higher prevalence in patients with concurrent ILD. RA patients , specifically those with ILD complications , should be tested for anti-ARS antibodies.
