  Dechlorane Plus ( DP) is a chlorinated flame retardant manufactured only in Niagara Falls , New<pathogen> York and in Huai'an , China. To determine if the environmental levels of this compound were changing significantly , we measured the long-term temporal trends of its concentrations near the Great Lakes between 2005 and 2015 using air ( vapor + particle phase) samples ( N = 1047) and precipitation samples ( N = 449). We used a multiple linear regression model of DP concentrations to isolate the variabilities due to sampling date and population near the sampling site. The results show that the total DP concentrations in precipitation varied seasonally , maximizing on January 18 , but the concentrations in the vapor + particle phase did not show seasonal variations. Vapor + particle phase DP levels were relatively high in Cleveland , and precipitation DP levels were relatively high at Point Petre. DP 's concentrations in neither phase were changing as a function of sampling date , indicating that the input of this compound into the environment is continuing , presumably because its use and production are not regulated. Based on the ratio of the anti conformer relative to the total of the two conformer concentrations , we suggest that the syn conformer is somewhat more environmentally stable than the anti conformer.
