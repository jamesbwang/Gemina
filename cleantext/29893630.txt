  Studies surrounding the sexual abuse of children by school personnel in Canadian contexts are infrequent and often limited in their scope. The present study addresses this drawback with a contribution of data gathered from disciplinary decisions of educator misconduct , media reports , and published case law concerning child/student sexual abuse cases ( between 1997 and 2017) that involved any individual employed ( or formerly employed) in a Canadian K-12 school. The study revealed a number of interesting points about the larger student victim and offender demographic patterns and characteristics across Canada. The study found 750 cases involving a minimum of 1,272 students and 714 offenders , 87 % of which were male. Moreover , 86 % of all offenders were certified teachers , and offenders employed grooming as the main tactic in 70 % of the cases. Of the child/student victims , 75 % were female , 55 % were sexually abused on school property , and more than two-thirds of all victims were in high school at the time the offense was committed. The study also found that excluding Ontario and B.C. , the media was the sole source of information for 50-86 % of all cases depending on the province/territory. Finally , almost three-quarters of offenders from the study were charged with at least one criminal offense , and of the cases that proceeded to trial , 70 % resulted in findings of guilt.
