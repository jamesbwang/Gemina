  Simulation is a technique that creates a situation or environment to allow persons to experience a representation of a real event for the purpose of practice , learning , evaluation , testing , or to gain understanding of systems or human actions. We will first provide an introduction to simulation in healthcare and describe the two types of simulation-based research ( SBR) in the pediatric population. We will then provide an overview of the use of SBR to improve health outcomes for infants in health care settings and to improve parent-child interactions using the infant simulator. Finally , we will discuss previous and future research using simulation to reduce morbidity and mortality from abusive head trauma , the most common cause of traumatic death in infancy.
