  Magnetic skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric helimagnets with D _ ( n) symmetry are Bloch-type magnetization swirls with a helicity angle of ± 90 °. At the surface of helimagnetic thin films below a critical thickness , a twisted skyrmion state with an arbitrary helicity angle has been proposed; however , its direct experimental observation has remained elusive. Here , we show that circularly polarized resonant elastic x-ray scattering is able to unambiguously measure the helicity angle of surface skyrmions , providing direct experimental evidence that a twisted skyrmion surface state also exists in bulk systems. The exact surface helicity angles of twisted skyrmions for both left- and right-handed chiral bulk Cu _ ( 2) OSeO _ ( 3) , in the single as well as in the multidomain skyrmion lattice state , are determined , revealing their detailed internal structure. Our findings suggest that a skyrmion surface reconstruction is a universal phenomenon , stemming from the breaking of translational symmetry at the interface.
