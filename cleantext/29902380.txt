  Oil sand operations in Alberta , Canada will eventually include returning treated process-affected waters to the environment. Organic constituents in oil sand process-affected water ( OSPW) represent complex mixtures of nonionic and ionic ( e.g. , naphthenic acids) compounds , and compositions can vary spatially and temporally , which has impeded development of water quality benchmarks. To address this challenge , it was hypothesized that solid phase microextraction fibers coated with polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) could be used as a biomimetic extraction ( BE) to measure bioavailable organics in OSPW. Organic constituents of OSPW were assumed to contribute additively to toxicity , and partitioning to PDMS was assumed to be predictive of accumulation in target lipids , which were the presumed site of action. This method was tested using toxicity data for individual model compounds , defined mixtures , and organic mixtures extracted from OSPW. Toxicity was correlated with BE data , which supports the use of this method in hazard assessments of acute lethality to aquatic organisms. A species sensitivity distribution ( SSD) , based on target lipid model and BE values , was similar to SSDs based on residues in tissues for both nonionic and ionic organics. BE was shown to be an analytical tool that accounts for bioaccumulation of organic compound mixtures from which toxicity can be predicted , with the potential to aid in the development of water quality guidelines.
