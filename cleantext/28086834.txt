  In recent years , the concept of liquid biopsy diagnostics in detection and progress monitoring of malignant diseases gained significant awareness. We here report on a semi-quantitative real-time cytokeratin 20 RT-PCR-based assay , for detecting circulating tumor cells within a fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in colorectal cancer patients. In total , 381 patients were included. Prior to surgical tumor resection , a peripheral blood sample was drawn. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation and a cytokeratin 20 qRT-PCR assay was performed. Quantitative PCR data was assessed regarding histopathological characteristics and patients ' clinical outcome. A cut-off value was determined at â‰¥ 2.77 ( EU). Stratifying patients by this cut-off , it represents a statistically highly significant prognostic marker for both the overall and disease-free survival in the entire cohort UICC I-IV ( both p < 0.001) and in early tumor stages UICC I+II ( overall survival p = 0.003 and disease-free survival p = 0.005). In multivariate analysis , the cut-off value stands for an independent predictor of significantly worse overall and disease-free survival ( p = 0.035 and p = 0.047 , respectively). We successfully established a highly sensitive real-time qRT-PCR assay by which we are able to identify colorectal cancer patients at risk for an unfavorable prognosis in UICC I and II stages.
