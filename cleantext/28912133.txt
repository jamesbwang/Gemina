  Mutational signatures have been proved as a valuable pattern in somatic genomics , mainly regarding cancer , with a potential application as a biomarker in clinical practice. Up to now , several bioinformatic packages to address this topic have been developed in different languages/platforms. MutationalPatterns has arisen as the most efficient tool for the comparison with the signatures currently reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC) database. However , the analysis of mutational signatures is nowadays restricted to a small community of bioinformatic experts. In this work we present Mutational Signatures in Cancer ( MuSiCa) , a new web tool based on MutationalPatterns and built using the Shiny framework in R language. By means of a simple interface suited to non-specialized researchers , it provides a comprehensive analysis of the somatic mutational status of the supplied cancer samples. It permits characterizing the profile and burden of mutations , as well as quantifying COSMIC-reported mutational signatures. It also allows classifying samples according to the above signature contributions. MuSiCa is a helpful web application to characterize mutational signatures in cancer samples.
