  Carnosinase 1 ( CN1) has been postulated to be a susceptibility factor for developing diabetic nephropathy ( DN). Although its major substrate , carnosine , is beneficial in rodent models of DN , translation of these findings to humans has been hampered by high CN1 activity in human serum resulting in rapid degradation of carnosine. To overcome this hurdle , we screened a protease-directed small-molecule library for inhibitors of human recombinant CN1. We identified SAN9812 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of CN1 activity with a K
