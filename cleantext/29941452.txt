  CRISPR/Cas9 is now widely used in biomedical research and has great potential for clinical applications. However , the safety and efficacy of this gene-editing technique are significant issues. Recent reports on mouse models and human cells have raised concerns that off-target mutations could hamper applying the CRISPR technology in patients. The high similarities of nonhuman primates to humans in genome content and organization , genetic diversity , physiology , and cognitive abilities have made these animals ideal experimental models for understanding human<disease> diseases<disease> and developing therapeutics. Off-target mutations of CRISPR/Cas9 have been analyzed in previous studies of nonhuman primates , but no report has investigated genome-wide off-target effects in living monkeys. Here , we used rhesus monkeys in which a genetic disorder mimicking Duchenne muscular dystrophy had previously been produced with CRISPR/Cas9. Using whole-genome sequencing to comprehensively assess on- and off-target mutations in these animals , we found that CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing is active on the expected genomic sites without producing off-target modifications in other functional regions of the genome. These findings suggest that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique could be relatively safe and effective in modeling genetic disease in nonhuman primates and in future therapeutic research of
