  Perovskite-based solar cells have been developed intensively in recent years because of their attractive applications in next-generation photovoltaics with low cost and high efficiency. However , the fabrication processes need to be further improved to meet the requirements in actual industrial production with reliable process and scalable fabrication. Here , coordinated thermal/solvent engineering-enhanced rapid crystallization strategy is reported to realize the fast and robust preparation of perovskite films. The modified solution-based coating method enables the precursor solutions to rapidly form highly crystalline perovskite films with large crystal domains through effectively controlled growth dynamics , including the nucleation and lateral growth processes. Benefitted from specific crystallization mechanisms , high-quality perovskite films with efficient photovoltaic performance in corresponding devices were readily produced either using the blade-coating or even the painting method: an average power conversion efficiency ( PCE) of 16.32 % was obtained when using the blade-coating method and up to 16.01 % average PCE was realized by the direct painting process. Most importantly , this one-step painting method is demonstrated to be fairly reliable with high repeatability , showing a promising future for the scalable and rapid production of perovskite film with controllable film uniformity and thickness.
