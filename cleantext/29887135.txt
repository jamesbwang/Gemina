  Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy ( VPSPr) , originally identified in 2008 , was further characterized and renamed in 2010. Thirty-seven cases of VPSPr have been reported to date , consistent with estimated prevalence of 0.7-1.7 % of all sporadic prion diseases. The lack of gene mutations establishes VPSPr as a sporadic form of human prion diseases , along with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( sCJD) and sporadic fatal insomnia. Like sCJD , VPSPr affects patients harboring any of the three genotypes , MM , MV , and VV at the prion protein ( PrP) gene polymorphic codon 129 , with VPSPr VV accounting for 65 % of all VPSPr cases. Distinguishing clinical features include a median 2-year duration and presentation with psychiatric signs , speech/language impairment , or cognitive decline. Neuropathology comprises moderate spongiform degeneration , PrP amyloid miniplaques , and a target-like or plaque-like PrP deposition. The abnormal PrP associated with VPSPr typically forms an electrophoretic profile of five to seven bands ( according to the antibody) presenting variable protease resistance depending on the 129 genotype. The familial prion disease associated with the V180I PrP gene mutation which harbors an abnormal PrP with similar electrophoretic profile might serve as a model for VPSPr. Transmission to animals has definitively established VPSPr as a prion disease. Because of its recent identification , rarity , and the elusiveness of its abnormal PrP , VPSPr remains largely understudied.
