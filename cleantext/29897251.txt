  The differences of volatile components in male ( MFB) and female flower buds ( FFB) of Populus × tomentosa were analysed and compared by HS-SPME with GC-MS for the first time. A total of 34 compounds were identified. Two clusters were clearly divided into male and female by hierarchical clustering analysis. Both the male and female flower buds showed methyl salicylate ( 22.83 and 24.09 % , respectively) and 2-hydroxy-benzaldehyde ( 10.05 and 12.41 % , respectively) as the main volatile constituents. The content of 2-cyclohexen-1-one , benzyl benzoate , and methyl benzoate in FFB was remarkably higher than in MFB. In contrast , the content of ethyl benzoate in MFB was greater than that in FFB. The phenomena showed the characteristic differences between MFB and FFB of P. × tomentosa , which enriched the basic studies on dioecious plant.
