  The impact of the Internet on education has been recognized for decades , and as technology advances , the ways in which students can access Internet content is ever increasing. Most students have some kind of portable smart device with which they access Internet content without the locational constraints of a desktop computer. This mobility has prompted abundant literature suggesting ways that Quick Response Codes ( QR codes) , a kind of two dimensional barcode , could be used to advance student learning. However , very few studies have tested the usefulness of QR codes in undergraduate science classes. We report on our development of a campus `` scavenger hunt '' activity using QR codes. We found that this activity develops application skills of the concepts of native and invasive species and enjoyment of coverage of content relative to traditional lecture in a nonmajors Environmental Science class at a four-year teaching institution.
