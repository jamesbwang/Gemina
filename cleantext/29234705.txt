  While fluoride ( F) is an essential anion to keep the human body healthy , high F intake could lead to serious health problems. The monitoring of F in drinking water as the main route of F intake , is a key factor in preventing its negative health consequences. Here , we present the F levels in drinking water distribution networks of Khorasan Razavi province in Iran which collected during 2016-2017. The non-cancer human risk attributed to F in municipal and rural regions , also , estimated by calculating the chronic daily intake ( CDI) and hazard quotient ( HQ) for adults and children. Samples taken from drinking water distribution network in 112 different locations across the Khorasan Razavi and the F concentration determined using standard SPADNS Method. Having a minimum of 0.09 and 0.16 and a maximum of 1.7 and 1.1 mg L
