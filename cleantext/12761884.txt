  Ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) injury is usually associated with a high risk of cardiomyocyte death in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P) and transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β are thought to be involved in the protection of cardiomyocyte and heart function following IR-induced injury. However , the possible association of S1P and S1P receptor 1 ( S1PR1) with the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway as the potential protective mechanism has remained to be investigated. In the present study , an
