  Total synthesis of the revised structure of ( Â±)- nidemone has been accomplished from 6-bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde ( 5) in either six or eight synthetic steps in 6 % and 10 % overall yield , respectively , without using any protecting group. The revised structure of nidemone was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Sonogashira coupling , regioselective hydrogenation , and an intramolecular Stetter reaction were the key steps in the synthesis.
