  The economic liberalization which was started 25 years back in India has led to a rising gross domestic product and per capita income and a decline in poverty. There has been an improvement in various health status indicators in the Indian population. As oral health is an integral part of general health , a retrospective study was designed to assess the effect of economic liberalization on dental<disease> caries<disease> experience in Indian children. A systematic literature search was conducted to find studies done on dental<disease> caries<disease> prevalence in children in India from the year 1992-2016. Mesh and free text terms `` child , '' `` dental<disease> caries<disease> , '' and `` India '' were searched in databases- PubMed and PubMed Central. A total of 1468 titles were screened , out of which 191 articles were shortlisted for further inspection. Finally , 69 studies were found suitable for final analysis. The pooled caries<disease> prevalence was between 50.84 % and 62.41 % at 5-year interval. There was a decline in caries<disease> prevalence in 2-5 and 11-15 years of age group. The overall weighed mean of 2.4 , 2.7 , and 1.9 was observed in three different age groups. Significant caries<disease> index ( SiC) of more than 3 was observed in all the age groups. The present review suggests that more than half of Indian children have been affected by dental<disease> caries<disease> High SIC index score suggests a skewed distribution of caries<disease> among Indian children. This data may aid in planning further exploratory research and oral health care services for children by the stakeholders.
