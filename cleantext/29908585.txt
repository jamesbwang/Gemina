  Actinic keratosis ( AK) is a very common skin disease caused by chronic sun exposure. AKs have historically been characterized as being `` precancerous '' or `` premalignant. '' It is true that these lesions<symptom> do not possess metastatic potential , because they are confined to the epidermis , but it is not accurate to deem them `` premalignant. '' AK qualifies as a malignant neoplasm , because it also fulfills criteria for malignancy in classic pathology , namely , the capability , or potential , to kill by either destruction of tissue locally or by metastasis widely. In this context , AK is considered now by many a carcinoma in situ and can persist or progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma ( iSCC) , which rarely metastasizes. Through this controversy , which speaks to an issue we have been debating for at least a century , we should like to start a constructive debate to reach a unanimous conclusion considering the various theories and points of view in the literature.
