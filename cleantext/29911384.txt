  Glycosylation of nonfunctionalized 6-chloro-7-deazapurine with commercially available 1- O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri- O-benzoyl-Î²-d-ribofuranose ( 45 %) followed by amination and deprotection gave tubercidin in only two steps. Similar conditions applied for the synthesis of 7-deazaguanosine employing pivaloylated 2-amino-6-chloro-7-deazapurine gave 18 % glycosylation yield. The less bulky isobutyryl or acetyl protected amino group directed the glycosylation toward the exocyclic amino substituent. 7-Halogenated intermediates were glycosylated followed by dehalogenation to overcome the low glycosylation yield in the synthesis of 7-deazaguanosine.
