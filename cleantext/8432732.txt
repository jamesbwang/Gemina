  Excessive physical impacts to the head have direct implications on the structural integrity at the axonal level. Increasing evidence suggests that tau , an intrinsically disordered protein that stabilizes axonal microtubules , plays a critical role in the physical biology of axonal injury. However , the precise mechanisms of axonal damage remain incompletely understood. Here we propose a biophysical model of the axon to correlate the dynamic behavior of individual tau proteins under external physical forces to the evolution of axonal damage. To propagate damage across the scales , we adopt a consistent three-step strategy: First , we characterize the axonal response to external stretches and stretch rates for varying tau crosslink bond strengths using a discrete axonal damage model. Then , for each combination of stretch rates and bond strengths , we average the axonal force-stretch response of
