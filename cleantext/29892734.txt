  A new sulfonylcalix ( 4) arene-based dinuclear terbium molecular container ( 1) was conveniently synthesized and utilized as a fluorescence probe for the detection of a well-known biomarker 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-OHP) , which is used for the evaluation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs). The sulfonylcalix ( 4) arene ligand could not only serve as an efficient antenna ligand to promote the ligand-to-metal energy transfer but also provide a suitable cavity to accommodate 1-OHP. Promising fluorescence quenching effects were well established during the titration of the compound 1 with 1-OHP , and these effects were due to the enhancement in the host-guest intermolecular charge transfer and the decrease in the ligand-to-metal energy transfer after the formation of the stable host-guest complex. The fluorescence sensing mechanism was clearly understood through the titration experiments , and the data could be fit with the Benesi-Hildebrand and Stern-Volmer models. The TbIII-TBSC-based luminescent sensor exhibited quick response , high sensitivity , and specific selectivity to 1-OHP , even in the presence of other constituents in urine , thus providing a new sensing platform for the clinical diagnosis of human exposure to PAHs.
