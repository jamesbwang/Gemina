  Acrylates and methacrylates are acrylic resin monomers that are known to induce skin sensitization as a result of their presence in different materials , such as nail cosmetics , dental materials , printing inks , and adhesives. Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> resulting from the use of modern wound<disease> dressings containing them has only rarely been reported. To describe 2 patients who developed allergic contact dermatitis<disease> caused by acrylic-based modern medical dressings and/or adhesives. The medical charts of patients observed since 1990 were retrospectively reviewed for ( meth) acrylate allergy resulting from contact with such materials , and their demographic characteristics and patch test results were analysed. Two patients were observed in 2014 and 2016 who had presented with positive patch test reactions to several acrylic-based dressings and/or adhesive materials , and to several ( meth) acrylates , that is , hydroxyethyl acrylate , hydroxyethyl methacrylate , ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate , bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate/epoxy-acrylate , urethane diacrylate , and/or penta-erythritol acrylate. Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> needs to be considered in patients with eczematous reactions or delayed healing following the use of acrylic-based modern dressings or adhesives. However , identification of the culprit allergen is hampered by poor cooperation from the producers , so adequate labelling of medical devices is an urgent necessity.
