  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Verinurad ( RDEA3170) is a high-affinity , selective URAT1 transporter inhibitor in development for treating gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This Phase I , single-dose study investigated the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and safety of verinurad in adults with renal impairment and controls with normal renal function. Males aged 18-85 years were enrolled with serum urate ( sUA) 4.5-10 mg/dl and creatinine clearance 60- < 90 , 30- < 60 , 15- < 30 , or â‰¥ 90 ml/min ( mild , moderate , severe renal impairment and controls , respectively; n = 7/8). Verinurad 15 mg was administered orally under fasted conditions. Serial plasma/serum and urine samplings were 30 min pre-dose to 72 h post-dose. Compared to controls , verinurad maximum observed plasma concentration increased by 53 , 73 , and 128 % and area under the concentration-time curve increased by 24 , 148 , and 130 % , in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , respectively; renal clearance decreased by 5 , 42 , and 79 %. Exposures of major verinurad metabolites also increased with increasing renal impairment. Verinurad decreased sUA in all groups , with greater maximal changes in control and mild renal impairment than moderate and severe impairment groups (- 38.3 ,- 36.9 ,- 20.5 ,- 12.6 % , respectively). There were no adverse event-related withdrawals<symptom> or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values. Exposures of verinurad and metabolites increased with decreasing renal function. Consistent with the renal-dependent mechanism of action of verinurad , increasing severity of renal impairment was associated with decreased sUA lowering. Verinurad safety assessments were similar regardless of renal impairment. Continued investigation of verinurad is warranted in patients with gout and renal impairment. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02219516.
