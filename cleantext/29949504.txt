  Brain-computer interface ( BCI) applications such as keyboard control and vehicular navigation present significant assistive merit for disabled individuals. However , there are limitations associated with BCI paradigms which restrict a wider adoption of BCI technology. For example , rapid serial visual presentation ( RSVP) paradigms can induce seizures<symptom> in photosensitive epileptic subjects. This paper evaluates the novel mirrored-word reading paradigm ( MWRP) for BCI implementation using an offline experimental study. The offline study obtained an average single-trial classification accuracy of 74.10 %. The results also demonstrate that the use of multiple trials for classification can increase the accuracy as is common with BCIs. The developed MWRP-based BCI also utilized a low presentation frequency which averts the possibility of paradigm induced photosensitivity. However , there are multiple avenues for future work. The MWRP can be implemented in the online format for real-time device control. For example , a vehicular application platform can be used where the word orientation represents directions for travel. The MWRP can also be investigated across a wider range of stimulus presentation parameters such as timing , color and stimulus size. Such studies can be used to suggest further improvements to the paradigm which can enhance its applicability for online device control.
