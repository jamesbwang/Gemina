  Renal oncocytomas are benign tumors characterized by a marked accumulation of mitochondria. We report a combined exome , transcriptome , and metabolome analysis of these tumors. Joint analysis of the nuclear and mitochondrial ( mtDNA) genomes reveals loss-of-function mtDNA mutations occurring at high variant allele fractions , consistent with positive selection , in genes encoding complex I as the most frequent genetic events. A subset of these tumors also exhibits chromosome 1 loss and/or cyclin D1 overexpression , suggesting they follow complex I loss. Transcriptome data revealed that many pathways previously reported to be altered in renal oncocytoma were simply differentially expressed in the tumor 's cell of origin , the distal nephron , compared with other nephron segments. Using a heuristic approach to account for cell-of-origin bias we uncovered strong expression alterations in the gamma-glutamyl cycle , including glutathione synthesis ( increased
