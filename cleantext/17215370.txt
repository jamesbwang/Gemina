  The cellular mechanisms responsible for aging are poorly understood. Aging is considered as a degenerative process induced by the accumulation of cellular lesions<symptom> leading progressively to organ dysfunction and death. The free radical theory of aging has long been considered the most relevant to explain the mechanisms of aging. As the mitochondrion is an important source of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , this organelle is regarded as a key intracellular player in this process and a large amount of data supports the role of mitochondrial ROS production during aging. Thus , mitochondrial ROS , oxidative damage , aging , and aging-dependent diseases are strongly connected. However , other features of mitochondrial physiology and dysfunction have been recently implicated in the development of the aging process. Here , we examine the potential role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP) in normal aging and in aging-associated diseases.
