  During the period from 1 January 2007 to 1 January 2017 , 138 dentists with a foreign dental degree ( obtained outside the European Economic Area or Switzerland) who wanted to practice dentistry in the Netherlands have undertaken the assessment procedure to obtain a certificate of professional competence. The procedure comprises a Dutch language proficiency and communications test , followed by tests of competence specific to the dental profession. For 68 dentists ( 49 %) , no deficiencies in knowledge or skills were identified. They could register in the BIG-register ( for healthcare professionals) for the supervisory period. For 49 ( 36 %) , the deficiencies could be eliminated with specific training. In the case of 21 dentists ( 15 %) , training was not possible. The number of dentists from this group who were enrolled in the BIG-register in 2017 was determined. On the reference date , 100 dentists ( 73 %) were enrolled. Of the 49 dentists who were permitted to participate in a specific educational programme , 48 had started such a programme: 38 had completed it by 2017 , 9 are still actively involved , and 1 stopped the programme. If they complete the programme , the number of dentists who have been enrolled in the BIG-register after ( successfully) finishing the assessment procedure could rise to 115 ( 83 %).
