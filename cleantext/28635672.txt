  Pipes are one of the key elements in the construction of ships , which usually contain between 15,000 and 40,000 of them. This huge number , as well as the variety of processes that may be performed on a pipe , require rigorous identification , quality assessment and traceability. Traditionally , such tasks have been carried out by using manual procedures and following documentation on paper , which slows down the production processes and reduces the output of a pipe workshop. This article presents a system that allows for identifying and tracking the pipes of a ship through their construction cycle. For such a purpose , a fog computing architecture is proposed to extend cloud computing to the edge of the shipyard network. The system has been developed jointly by Navantia , one of the largest shipbuilders in the world , and the University of A Coru & ntilde; a ( Spain) , through a project that makes use of some of the latest Industry 4.0 technologies. Specifically , a Cyber-Physical System ( CPS) is described , which uses active Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID) tags to track pipes and detect relevant events. Furthermore , the CPS has been integrated and tested in conjunction with Siemens & rsquo; Manufacturing Execution System ( MES) ( Simatic IT). The experiments performed on the CPS show that , in the selected real-world scenarios , fog gateways respond faster than the tested cloud server , being such gateways are also able to process successfully more samples under high-load situations. In addition , under regular loads , fog gateways react between five and 481 times faster than the alternative cloud approach.
