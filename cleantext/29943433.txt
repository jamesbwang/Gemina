  Iron-based nanoparticles ( FeNPs) have unique and attractive properties such as superparamagnetism , biocompatibility , and catalytic activity. Although the synthesis of precious metal NPs from a metal in liquid and/or metal salt solution by a pulsed laser has been investigated , comparably little effort has been devoted to examine the production of FeNPs. Here we report the synthesis of carbon-shell free spherical NPs of iron oxide ( magnetite) from ferrocene hexane solution by femtosecond near infrared laser pulses. Nanosecond UV laser pulses are used to compare the evolution of the particle size distribution as a function of laser irradiation time. The size of NPs remains constant even for extended exposure to femtosecond laser pulses , whereas it grows with exposure to nanosecond laser pulses. The primary particles are generated by photochemical reactions regardless of pulse duration; however , the fragmentation of NPs by successive femtosecond laser pulses regulates the particle size.
