  To determine the positive expiratory pressures ( PEP) and oscillation frequencies generated in the therapist-made-bubble-PEP device using tubing with different internal diameters ( IDs). Bench-top experimental study. Therapist-made-bubble-PEP device with a 10 cm column height of water , tubing length of 30 cm with distal end of the tubing resting 3 cm from base of container. Tubing with 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , and 10 mm IDs were tested with flows of 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 L/min. A pressure transducer measured the pressures and oscillation frequencies. Data were captured with PhysioDAQxs © software and analyzed with Breathalyser © software. Therapist-made-bubble-PEP device with: ( 1) 2 mm ID tubing with 5 and 10 L/min flows produced mean ( SD) PEP of 20.1 ( 0.2) and 41.8 ( 0.5) cmH Therapist-made-bubble-PEP device with tubing of 10 mm ID generated the most stable PEP in relation to water height ( 10 cm) irrespective of flow compared to tubing with ID of 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 mm. The oscillation frequencies generated at all flows and tubing IDs were between 13 and 19 Hz.
