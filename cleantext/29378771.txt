  Coffee is associated with decreased breast cancer risk , but the impact of body mass index ( BMI) in combination with coffee consumption on prognosis is unclear. The suppressive effect of coffee constituents on the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 ( IGF1R) levels in breast cancer cells may play a role. The aim was to investigate the prognostic impact of coffee consumption and possible associations with tumor-specific IGF1R protein expression and BMI in a population-based cohort in Sweden , comprising 1,014 primary breast cancer patients without pretreatment enrolled 2002-2012 and followed for up to 13 years. Patients with higher coffee consumption had lower tumor IGF1R levels (
