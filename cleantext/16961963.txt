  Two dilemmas arise in inferring shape information from shading. First , depending on the rendering physics , images can change significantly with ( even) small changes in lighting or viewpoint , while the percept frequently does not. Second , brightness variations can be induced by material effects-such as pigmentation-as well as by shading effects. Improperly interpreted , material effects would confound shading effects. We show how these dilemmas are coupled by reviewing recent developments in shape inference together with a role for colour in separating material from shading effects. Aspects of both are represented in a common geometric ( flow) framework , and novel displays of hue/shape interaction demonstrate a global effect with interactions limited to localized regions. Not all parts of an image are perceptually equal; shape percepts appear to be constructed from image anchor regions.
