  Depression<symptom> is relatively common among patients with epilepsy , but often with predominant atypical symptoms. Some antiepileptic drugs show positive psychotropic effects , but these are not always sufficient to stabilize mood in epilepsy patients. Antidepressants are recommended to treat atypical depression<symptom> but are not always effective and present a certain risk of seizure<symptom> provocation. Thus , new treatment options are welcome. Here , we describe three cases of refractory epilepsy with atypical depression<symptom> in which olanzapine , contrary to its earlier reported proconvulsant effect , showed excellent antidepressant action and resulted in seizure<symptom> control. Possible mechanisms of this action are discussed.
