  Autophagy is essential for appressorium-mediated plant infection by Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen> , the causal agent of rice blast disease and a major threat to global food security. The regulatory mechanism of pathogenicity-associated autophagy , however , remains largely unknown. Here , we report the identification and functional characterization of a plausible ortholog of yeast SNT2 in M. oryzae<pathogen> , which we term MoSNT2. Deletion mutants of MoSNT2 are compromised in autophagy homeostasis and display severe defects in autophagy-dependent fungal cell death and pathogenicity. These mutants are also impaired in infection structure development , conidiation , oxidative stress tolerance and cell wall integrity. MoSnt2 recognizes histone H3 acetylation through its PHD1 domain and thereby recruits the histone deacetylase complex , resulting in deacetylation of H3. MoSnt2 binds to promoters of autophagy genes MoATG6 , 15 , 16 , and 22 to regulate their expression. In addition , MoTor controls MoSNT2 expression to regulate MoTor signaling which leads to autophagy and rice infection. Our study provides evidence of a direct link between MoSnt2 and MoTor signaling and defines a novel epigenetic mechanism by which MoSNT2 regulates infection-associated autophagy and plant infection by the rice blast fungus.
