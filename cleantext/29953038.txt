  Acute cerebral injuries , such as cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic events , have been repeatedly correlated with sudden electrocardiogram ( ECG) changes , such as cardiac arrhythmias , QT prolongation , and T-wave inversion ( the `` cerebral T-wave ''). Injuries to the insular cortex have been reported in the literature to result in such changes , possibly due to increased sympathetic tone<symptom> to the cardiac system. A 65-year-old gentleman presented with an acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarction , and was found to have ECG abnormalities and left ventricular dysfunction , which improved after the acute phase of the stroke. Acute ischemic infarcts , particularly to the right insular cortex , can result in ECG abnormalities , such as QT prolongation and T-wave inversion , as well as acute systolic heart<symptom> failure<symptom>; all of which may be reversible after the acute phase of the stroke.
