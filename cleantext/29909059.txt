  Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs ( miRNAs , miRs) play diverse roles in the regulation of biological processes , including osteoblastic differentiation. In this study , we found that miR-383 is a critical regulator of osteoblastic differentiation. We showed that miR-383 was downregulated during osteoblastic differentiation of rat bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs). Overexpression of miR-383 suppressed osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs by downregulating alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , matrix mineralization , and mRNA and protein levels of RUNX2 and OCN , whereas a knockdown of miR-383 promoted osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. The results of in vivo analysis indicated that inhibition of miR-383 expression enhanced the efficacy of new bone formation in a rat calvarial defect model. Mechanistic experiments revealed that special AT-rich-sequence-binding protein 2 ( Satb2) was a direct and functional target of miR-383. Knockdown of Satb2 had inhibitory effects resembling those of miR-383 on the osteoblast differentiation of rat BMSCs. In addition , the positive effect of miR-383 suppression on osteoblastic differentiation was apparently abrogated by Satb2 silencing. Collectively , these results indicate that miR-383 plays an inhibitory role in osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs and may act by targeting Satb2.
