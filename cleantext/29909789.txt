  The World Health Organization ( WHO) International Classification of Disease ( ICD-11) is expected to include a new diagnosis for prolonged grief disorder ( ICD-11PGD). This study examines the validity and clinical utility of the ICD-11PGD guideline by testing its performance in a well-characterized clinical sample and contrasting it with a very different criteria set with the same name ( PGDPLOS). We examined data from 261 treatment-seeking participants in the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH)- sponsored multicenter clinical trial to determine the rates of diagnosis using the ICD-11PGD guideline and compared these with diagnosis using PGDPLOS criteria. The ICD-11PGD guideline identified 95.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 93.3-98.2 %) of a treatment-responsive cohort of patients with distressing and impairing grief. PGDPLOS criteria identified only 59.0 % ( 95 % CI 53.0-65.0 %) and were more likely to omit those who lost someone other than a spouse , were currently married , bereaved by violent means , or not diagnosed with co-occurring depression<symptom> Those not diagnosed by PGDPLOS criteria showed the same rate of treatment response as those who were diagnosed. The ICD-11PGD diagnostic guideline showed good performance characteristics in this sample , while PGDPLOS criteria did not. Limitations of the research sample used to derive PGDPLOS criteria may partly explain their poor performance in a more diverse clinical sample. Clinicians and researchers need to be aware of the important difference between these two identically named diagnostic methods.
