  Colposcopes are expensive , heavy , and need specialized technical service , which may outreach the capacity of low-resource settings. Our aim was to assess the performance of smartphone-based digital images for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse ( CIN2 +). Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>)- positive women recruited through a cervical cancer screening campaign had VIA/VILI assessment ( visual inspection after application of acetic acid/lugol 's iodine). Cervical digital images were captured with a smartphone camera , randomly coded with no prior selection and distributed on an online database ( Google Forms) for evaluation. Healthcare providers were invited to evaluate the images and identify CIN2 +. The gold standard was the histopathological diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CIN2 + was assessed for each reader and reported with the 95 percent confidence interval ( Clopper-Pearson method). One hundred twenty-five consecutive HPV-positive women were included , with 19 CIN2 + ( 15.2 percent). Forty-five gynecologists completed the assessment , one-third were considered as experts ( > 50 colposcopies) and two-thirds as novices ( < 50 colposcopies). The sensitivity and specificity for CIN 2 + detection was 71.3 percent ( 67.0-75.7 percent) and 62.4 percent ( 57.5-67.4 percent) , respectively. The performance of novices and experts was similar. The readers assessed 73.1 percent of images as acceptable for diagnostic. Smartphone-based digital images , with its high portability , have a great potential for the diagnosis of CIN2 + in low-resource context.
