  Leukocyte classification and cytometry have wide applications in medical domain , previous researches usually exploit machine learning techniques to classify leukocytes automatically. However , constrained by the past development of machine learning techniques , for example , extracting distinctive features from raw microscopic images are difficult , the widely used SVM classifier only has relative few parameters to tune , these methods can not efficiently handle fine-grained classification cases when the white blood cells have up to 40 categories. Based on deep learning theory , a systematic study is conducted on finer leukocyte classification in this paper. A deep residual neural network based leukocyte classifier is constructed at first , which can imitate the domain expert 's cell recognition process , and extract salient features robustly and automatically. Then the deep neural network classifier 's topology is adjusted according to the prior knowledge of white blood cell test. After that the microscopic image dataset with almost one hundred thousand labeled leukocytes belonging to 40 categories is built , and combined training strategies are adopted to make the designed classifier has good generalization ability. The proposed deep residual neural network based classifier was tested on microscopic image dataset with 40 leukocyte categories. It achieves top-1 accuracy of 77.80 % , top-5 accuracy of 98.75 % during the training procedure. The average accuracy on the test set is nearly 76.84 %. This paper presents a fine-grained leukocyte classification method for microscopic images , based on deep residual learning theory and medical domain knowledge. Experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Extended experiments support that the fine-grained leukocyte classifier could be used in real medical applications , assist doctors in diagnosing diseases , reduce human power significantly.
