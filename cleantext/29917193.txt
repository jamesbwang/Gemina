  To examine the potential mechanisms implicating miR-200c and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in oral squamous carcinoma ( OSC). 32 pairs of OSC tissue samples and matched para-carcinoma normal tissue from patients undergoing routine surgery in the Xuzhou Stomatological Hospital from 2014-2016. HOC313 cells were cultured and transfected with miR-200c mimics and scrambled mimics. Cell migration , invasion assays , Luciferase reporter assay , and Western blot assay were conducted. miR-200c was downregulated in OSC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues ( n = 32). miR-200c knockdown in the human oral cancer cell line HOC313 significantly suppressed cell invasion and migration , indicating the ability to inhibit tumor progression. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-200c directly bound to the 3 '- untranslated regions ( 3 '- UTR) of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox ( ZEB1) directly. Moreover , miR-200c significantly inhibited HOC313 cell EMT via negatively regulating ZEB1 protein expression. MiR-200c plays a pivotal role in controlling OSC metastasis via inhibiting EMT , which provides potential therapeutic targets for OSC.
