  This study aimed to investigate the possible effects and underlying mechanisms of Kangzhi syrup on ovalbumin- ( OVA-) induced cough<symptom> variant asthma ( CVA) in guinea pigs. All 48 guinea pigs were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: normal , OVA model with or without Kangzhi syrup ( OVA and OVA + KZ) , and OVA with Dexamethasone ( OVA + DM). After sensitizing the guinea pigs , a cough<symptom> challenge was performed by the inhalation of capsaicin. The antitussive effect , inflammatory cells , cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) and lung tissue , and morphological changes were examined. Compared with model group , Kangzhi syrup effectively exerted an antitussive effect ( The results demonstrated that Kangzhi syrup exerted a considerable antitussive effect in CVA animal model , which depended on its marked impact on the anti-anaphylactic inflammation<symptom>. Additionally , it could ameliorate the airway remodeling by inhibiting NF-
