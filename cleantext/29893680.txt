  This study was conducted to explore the impact of renal dysfunction on short-term and mid-term outcomes in elderly patients. Patients over 65 years of age receiving surgical ventricular restoration ( SVR) were included in the study. They were stratified through estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) , with a cutoff point of 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2. Risk-adjusted analysis , including propensity score matching , was carried out to compare short-term and mid-term outcomes between the two groups of patients. From January 1999 to December 2015 , a total of 280 elderly patients underwent SVR. Of the patients , 79 had eGFR lower than 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 and were considered to have renal dysfunction. Mortality was higher in the renal dysfunction group than the normal renal function group , with marginal significance ( adjusted P value = .06). The need for mechanical supports ( adjusted P value = .04) was higher in the renal dysfunction group. Hemofiltration ( adjusted P value < .01) and requirements for transfusion ( adjusted P value = .03) were significantly higher in the renal dysfunction group than in the group with normal renal function. The presence of renal dysfunction was associated with higher risk of major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular events ( MACCE) than normal renal function ( HR = 2.34 , 95 % CI = 1.34- 4.08 , P = .003). Compared to patients with normal renal function , elderly SVR patients with renal<symptom> failure<symptom> have a higher incidence of short-term mechanical support , mid-term mortality , and MACCE events.
