  Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder caused by a heterozygous germline mutation in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Because of the existence of highly homologous pseudogenes , the large size of the gene , and the heterogeneity of mutation types and positions , the detection of variations in NF1 is more difficult than that for an ordinary gene. In this study , we collected samples from 23 patients among 46 study participants from 12 unrelated Chinese families with NF1. We used a combination of Sanger sequencing , targeted next-generation sequencing , and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to identify potential mutations of different types. Seven recurrent mutations and four novel mutations were identified with the aforementioned methods , which were subsequently confirmed by either restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or Sanger sequencing. Truncating mutations accounted for 73 % ( 8/11) of all mutations identified. We also exhaustively investigated the clinical manifestations of NF1 in patients via acquired pathography , photographs and follow-up. However , no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been found to date. In conclusion , the novel mutations identified broaden the spectrum of NF1 mutations in Chinese; however , obvious correlations between genotype and phenotype were not observed in this study.
