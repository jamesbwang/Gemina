  The objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of the superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1) polymorphisms on erythrocyte SOD1 activity and the mortality of patients with septic shock<symptom>. We prospectively evaluated 175 patients aged over 18 years with septic shock<symptom> upon ICU admission. However , 38 patients were excluded. Thus , 137 patients were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were taken within the first 24 h of the patient 's admission to determine erythrocyte SOD1 activity and nine SOD1 gene polymorphisms. The mean patient age was 63 Â± 16 years , 58 % were men , and ICU mortality rate was 66 %. The patients who died were older and more severely ill , with higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE II) and Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment ( SOFA) scores , as well as higher lactate , urea , and protein carbonyl levels. In the logistic regression model , erythrocyte SOD1 activity was associated with ICU mortality. This relationship was also maintained in the highest tertile of SOD1 activity ( odds ratio ( OR): 0.02; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.00-0.78; p = 0.037). Only SNP rs2070424 of the SOD1 gene influenced erythrocyte SOD1 activity. For patients with the AA allele , the activity of SOD1 was lower in relation to G-carriers ( A/G + G/G genotype) ( p = 0.019). None of the nine SOD1 SNPs were associated with ICU mortality. In conclusion , the SNP rs2070424 of the SOD1 gene interferes with erythrocyte SOD1 activity , and higher activity of SOD1 was associated with decreased mortality in patients with septic
