  Profiling of miR-200b expression and its targets ( transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β2 and ZEB2) in the surgical rabbit congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( DH) model before and after tracheal occlusion ( TO). Thirty-eight timed-pregnant rabbits had left DH creation on gestational day ( GD) 23. On GD28 , 17 randomly selected fetuses had TO. We harvested fetuses at GD23 , GD28 , or GD30. We calculated lung-to-body weight ratios , processed lungs for miR-200b in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction , and evaluated effects on downstream targets TGF-β2 or ZEB2. We obtained 16 DH fetuses ( n = 7 GD28 and n = 9 GD30) , 13 TO fetuses ( GD30) , and 38 control fetuses ( n = 15 GD23 , n = 11 GD28 , and n = 12 GD30). Diaphragmatic hernia lungs were hypoplastic , and TO resulted in control lung-to-body weight ratio levels. Term miR-200b-3p levels were significantly upregulated in the hypoplastic compared with control ipsilateral lung ( 1.906 ± 0.90 vs 0.7429 ± 0.44) ( P < .01). Fetal TO ipsilateral lungs displayed a variable miR-200b response on in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction , with levels similar to control and congenital DH lungs. The TGF-β2 was unchanged in hypoplastic and TO lungs , and ZEB2 tended to be reduced in TO compared with DH lungs ( 1.79 ( 0.4-2.9) vs 0.73 ( 0.5-1.4)). Hypoplastic fetal rabbit lungs display upregulation of miR-200b expression although downstream targets are not different from controls. Following TO , fetal rabbit lungs display a variable miR-200b response.
