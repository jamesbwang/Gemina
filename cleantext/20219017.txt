  Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) are isolated from a plethora of tissue sources for cell therapy purposes. In 2006 , the International Society for Cellular Therapy ( ISCT) published minimal guidelines to define MSC identity. Nevertheless , many independent studies demonstrated that cells meeting the ISCT criteria possessed heterogeneous phenotypes and functionalities , heavily influenced by culture conditions. In this study , human MSC derived from many adult ( bone<disease> marrow and adipose tissue) or fetal ( cord blood , Wharton 's jelly , umbilical cord perivascular compartment and amniotic fluid) tissues were investigated. Their immunophenotype was analyzed to define consistent source-specific markers by extensive flow cytometry analysis and real-time qRT-PCR. CD271
