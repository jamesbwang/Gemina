  Disordered eating pathology ( DEP) and body dissatisfaction are well-documented risk factors for eating disorders and have become more prevalent among adolescent males. The sample consisted of 256 Israeli boys , in grades 8-12. Participants completed questionnaires measuring , Sense of Coherence ( SOC) , Body Shape ( BSQ) , Eating attitudes ( EAT-26) , and the Eating Disorder Inventory ( EDI-2). Findings revealed low levels of DEP among adolescent boys. Younger adolescents ( grade 8-9) had higher levels of clinically relevant DEP than older adolescents ( grade 10-12). SOC was negatively associated with DEP and a significant interaction for age and SOC emerged with younger age being associated with both lower levels of SOC and higher DEP. These results demonstrate a low overall prevalence rate of DEP among adolescent boys and is consistent with the developmental literature relating to SOC and mental health and in contrast with a similar population of girls documented in Israel and the US.
