  The embryologic development of the cerebellum extends over a long time period , thus making it vulnerable to a broad spectrum of malformations and disruptions. Knowledge of the main steps of fetal posterior fossa development; the normal imaging patterns at different stages of embryogenesis; the large spectrum of cerebellar malformations; and their clinical presentations enables diagnosis and precise counseling of parents. Sonography is the most important imaging method for the screening of cerebellar malformations since it is noninvasive , widely available , and safe for both mother and child. The ultrasonographic approach for the evaluation of the fetal posterior fossa is based on the classic transabdominal visualization of axial planes with addition when indicated of a more comprehensive , multiplanar transvaginal or transfundal approach , including coronal and sagittal imaging planes. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) has become an adjunct to prenatal ultrasound since the 1980s. Good-quality images have been obtained thanks to the implementation of fast and ultrafast MRI sequences. Fetal MRI has higher-contrast resolution than prenatal sonography and may contribute to the differentiation of normal from abnormal tissue. Both prenatal neurosonography and fetal MRI enable accurate prenatal diagnosis of most posterior fossa anomalies.
