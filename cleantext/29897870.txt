  As the image sharing websites like Flickr become more and more popular , extensive scholars concentrate on tag-based image retrieval. It is one of the important ways to find images contributed by social users. In this research field , tag information and diverse visual features have been investigated. However , most existing methods use these visual features separately or sequentially. In this paper , we propose a global and local visual features fusion approach to learn the relevance of images by hypergraph approach. A hypergraph is constructed first by utilizing global , local visual features , and tag information. Then , we propose a pseudo-relevance feedback mechanism to obtain the pseudo-positive images. Finally , with the hypergraph and pseudo relevance feedback , we adopt the hypergraph learning algorithm to calculate the relevance score of each image to the query. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
