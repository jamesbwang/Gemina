  Conformational dynamics underlie enzyme function , yet are generally inaccessible via traditional structural approaches. FRET has the potential to measure conformational dynamics in vitro and in intact cells , but technical barriers have thus far limited its accuracy , particularly in membrane proteins. Here , we combine amber codon suppression to introduce a donor fluorescent noncanonical amino acid with a new , biocompatible approach for labeling proteins with acceptor transition metals in a method called ACCuRET ( Anap Cyclen-Cu
