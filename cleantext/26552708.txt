  Having demonstrated that apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I) mimetic peptides ameliorate cancer in mouse models , we sought to determine the mechanism for the anti-tumorigenic function of these peptides. CT-26 cells ( colon cancer cells that implant and grow into tumors in the lungs) were injected into wild-type BALB/c mice. The day after injection , mice were either continued on chow or switched to chow containing 0.06 % of a concentrate of transgenic tomatoes expressing the apoA-I mimetic peptide 6F ( Tg6F). After four weeks , the number of lung tumors was significantly lower in Tg6F-fed mice. Gene expression array analyses of jejunum<symptom> and lung identified Notch pathway genes significantly upregulated , whereas osteopontin ( Spp1) was significantly downregulated by Tg6F in both jejunum<symptom> and lung. In jejunum<symptom> , Tg6F increased protein levels for Notch1 , Notch2 , Dll1 , and Dll4. In lung , Tg6F increased protein levels for Notch1 and Dll4 and decreased Spp1. Tg6F reduced oxidized phospholipid levels ( E06 immunoreactivity) and reduced 25-hydroxycholesterol ( 25-OHC) levels , which are known to inhibit Notch1 and induce Spp1 , respectively. Notch pathway promotes anti-tumorigenic patrolling monocytes , while Spp1 facilitates pro-tumorigenic myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) formation. Tg6F-fed mice had higher numbers of patrolling monocytes in jejunum<symptom> and in lung ( p < 0.02) , and lower plasma levels of Spp1 with reduced numbers of MDSCs in jejunum<symptom> and in lung ( p < 0.03). We conclude that Tg6F alters levels of specific oxidized lipids and 25-OHC to modulate Notch pathways and Spp1 , which alter small intestine immune cells , leading to similar changes in lung that reduce tumor burden.
