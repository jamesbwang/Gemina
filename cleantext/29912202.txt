  Trans-differentiation of one somatic cell type into another has enormous potential to model and treat human<disease> diseases<disease>. Previous studies have shown that mouse embryonic , dermal , and cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into functional induced-cardiomyocyte-like cells ( iCMs) through overexpression of cardiogenic transcription factors including GATA4 , Hand2 , Mef2c , and Tbx5 both in vitro and in vivo. However , these previous studies have shown relatively low efficiency. In order to restore heart function following injury , mechanisms governing cardiac reprogramming must be elucidated to increase efficiency and maturation of iCMs. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of pro-fibrotic signaling dramatically increases reprogramming efficiency. Here , we detail methods to achieve a reprogramming efficiency of up to 60 %. Furthermore , we describe several methods including flow cytometry , immunofluorescent imaging , and calcium imaging to quantify reprogramming efficiency and maturation of reprogrammed fibroblasts. Using the protocol detailed here , mechanistic studies can be undertaken to determine positive and negative regulators of cardiac reprogramming. These studies may identify signaling pathways that can be targeted to promote reprogramming efficiency and maturation , which could lead to novel cell therapies to treat human heart disease.
