  Management options for locally recurrent sarcoma<disease> of the pelvis in patients previously treated with external beam radiation and surgery are limited. Pelvic exenteration is often the only viable but unattractive option. We present a patient with recurrent myxoid round cell liposarcoma of the ischiorectal fossa treated in 2013 with preoperative radiation ( 50 Gy in 25 fractions) and subsequent wide local resection. Four years later , a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan demonstrated a 1 x 1 cm T2 hypointense soft tissue pre-sacral nodule<disease> consistent with local recurrence ( LR). The patient declined posterior pelvic exenteration and was treated with 12 Gy using high dose rate brachytherapy ( BT) under MRI-guidance followed by a further external beam radiation to a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions.
