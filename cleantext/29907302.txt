  Increasing crop yield requires the coordination of multiple metabolic pathways spanning photosynthetic carbon fixation , central carbon metabolism , and finally targeted carbon deposition to end product. In this study , we used a transcriptome-based gene regulatory association network to search for transcription factor genes that could play a role in increasing carbon flow through pathways associated with these processes to increase biomass yield in switchgrass. Two novel switchgrass transcription factors , PvBMY1 ( BioMass Yield 1 , belonging to the APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor family of transcription factors) and PvBMY3 ( BioMass Yield 3 , a member of the Nuclear-Factor Y family of transcription factors) , with predicted roles in the regulation of photosynthesis and related metabolism were identified. These genes were overexpressed in switchgrass to determine their impact on biomass yield. A significant increase in both aboveground and root biomass was observed in transgenic greenhouse grown plants compared to wild-type control plants with the best line producing 160 % more aboveground biomass than controls. Transgenic lines with elevated electron transport rate of photosystems I and II as well as increased levels of starch and soluble sugars were identified.
