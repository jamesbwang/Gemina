  The activation status of neutrophils can cycle from basal through primed to fully activated ( `` green-amber-red '') , and at least in vitro , primed cells can spontaneously revert to a near basal phenotype. This broad range of neutrophil responsiveness confers extensive functional flexibility , allowing neutrophils to respond rapidly and appropriately to varied and evolving threats throughout the body. Primed and activated cells display dramatically enhanced bactericidal capacity ( including augmented respiratory burst activity , degranulation and longevity) , but this enhancement also confers the capacity for significant unintended tissue injury. Neutrophil priming and its consequences have been associated with adverse outcomes in a range of disease states , hence understanding the signalling processes that regulate the transition between basal and primed states ( and back again) may offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in pathological settings. A wide array of host- and pathogen-derived molecules is able to modulate the functional status of these versatile cells. Reflecting this extensive repertoire of potential mediators , priming can be established by a range of signalling pathways ( including mitogen-activated protein kinases , phosphoinositide 3-kinases , phospholipase D and calcium transients) and intracellular processes ( including endocytosis , vesicle trafficking and the engagement of adhesion molecules). The signalling pathways engaged , and the exact cellular phenotype that results , vary according to the priming agent ( s) to which the neutrophil is exposed and the precise environmental context. Herein we describe the signals that establish priming ( in particular for enhanced respiratory burst , degranulation and prolonged lifespan) and describe the recently recognised process of de-priming , correlating in vitro observations with in vivo significance.
