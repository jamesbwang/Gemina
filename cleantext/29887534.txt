  The present study determined the effects of pre-existing cognitive impairment ( PreCI) on the rehabilitation outcomes in patients with cerebral infarction. From June 2013 to August 2015 , we classified 52 patients with unilateral cerebral hemispheric infarction into the PreCI and non-PreCI group based on three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection ( 3D-SSP) cerebral blood flow ( CBF) decrease images and the past history of dementia. Furthermore we investigated the related clinical factors and functional independence measure ( FIM). 1. Multivariate analysis revealed that the most important factors that affect total FIM at discharge were age , National institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE) ( R <sup> 2 </sup> = 0.756). 2. The mean CBF values ( P < 0.05) were significantly associated with lesion<symptom> volume , ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.05) , the NIHSS score ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.01) , the MMSE score ( P < 0.001 , P < 0.005) , and total FIM ( P < 0.005 , P < 0.05) at discharge. 3. Both cognitive and motor FIM at discharge were significantly lower in the PreCI group ( P < 0.005 , P < 0.005). 4. The MMSE score of ZSAM abnormal group was significantly lower in the case of NIHSS score < 10 of lesion<symptom> and non lesion<symptom> sides. PreCI , age , and neurological severity , affected the outcomes of stroke rehabilitation Therefore , the diagnosis of PreCI is considered important for effective stroke rehabilitation.
