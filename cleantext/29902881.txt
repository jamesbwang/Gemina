  A new fatty acid methyl ester ( 1) was isolated from an EtOH extract of Fissistigma oldhamii. It structures was elucidated by a combination of HR-ESI-MS , 1D NMR , 2D NMR , UV , and IR spectroscopic data. The inhibitory effect of compound 1 on the proliferation of primary synovial cells was evaluated. As a result , it showed inhibitory effect on the proliferation of synoviocytes , with IC ₅₀ value of 38.6 μmol · L ⁻¹.
