  Infant feeding guidelines are important public health strategies to promote optimal growth , development and chronic<disease> disease<disease> prevention , but their effectiveness is contingent upon families ' ability to adhere to them. Little is known of adherence to guidelines among nutritionally vulnerable infants , specifically those born very-low-birth-weight ( < 1500 grams). This study investigated whether post-discharge feeding practices for very-low-birth-weight infants align with current recommendations and explored parental and infant baseline socio-demographics related to these practices. Prospectively collected data from families of 300 very-low-birth-weight infants participating in a randomized clinical trial ( ISRCTN35317141) were used. Baseline demographics were obtained at enrollment and post-discharge feeding practices via monthly telephone questionnaires to 6 months corrected age ( CA). At discharge , 4 months and 6 months CA , 72 % , 39 % and 29 % of infants received any amount of mother 's milk , respectively; exclusive breastfeeding rates were 49 % , 20 % and 6 % , respectively. Among infants receiving mother 's milk , rates of vitamin D supplementation were â‰¥ 83 %. Recommendations for introducing solids between 4-6 months CA were followed by 71 % of the cohort and for iron supplementation by 58 %. Overall , 12 % of infants adhered to all aforementioned recommendations. Mothers with university degrees were more likely to provide mother 's milk while mothers of Middle Eastern/South Asian ethnicity were less likely to provide mother 's milk. Low rates of partial and exclusive breastfeeding of very-low-birth-weight infants to 6 months corrected age were reported. Overall adherence to iron supplementation was low. Strategies to provide increased support for mothers identified as at-risk should be developed.
