  Paraspinal tumors with benign histology in the absence of trauma rarely arise in children. Treatment of such benign tumors , in contrast to malignancies , generally consists of surgical resection of the lesion<symptom> with confirmation of histology via pathologic evaluation. We present a pediatric case of an atraumatic paraspinal mass with a histologic diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst<symptom> , and USP6 gene rearrangement supporting the histologic diagnosis. The patient underwent gross total resection of the paraspinal lesion<symptom> with no additional intervention. We highlight the differential diagnosis of paraspinal tumors in children and key features that led to the diagnosis in this patient.
