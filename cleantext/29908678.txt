  Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) in children is increasing. Yet , little is known about optimal nutritional practices in these children. We aim to describe the nutritional adequacy , factors associated with enteral nutrition , and the association between nutritional adequacy and mortality in children supported on ECMO. We conducted a retrospective review of all children ( 1 month-18 years) requiring ECMO between 2010 and 2016. Data on enteral and parenteral energy and protein intake in the first 7 days of ECMO were collected. Adequacy of nutrition intake was defined as total intake vs. total requirements , expressed as a percentage. 51 patients were included , of which 43 ( 84.3 %) were supported on veno-arterial ECMO. Median ECMO duration was 8.6 days ( interquartile range ( IQR) 6.1-16.2). Overall energy and protein adequacy across the first 7 days of ECMO were 48.3 % ( IQR 28.0-67.4) and 44.8 % ( IQR 26.9-67.0) respectively. Parenteral nutrition provided majority of calories ( median 88.0 % ( IQR 62.9-100)) and protein ( median 91.0 % ( IQR 62.3-100)) intake. Enteral nutrition ( EN) was initiated in 33 ( 64.7 %) patients. Time to EN initiation , vasoactive-inotropic score just before ECMO initiation , veno-arterial ECMO mode and continuous renal replacement therapy in the first week of ECMO were factors associated with EN energy adequacy. Hospital mortality rate was 55 % ( 28/51). Compared to survivors , non-survivors had lower adequacy of EN energy intake ( 0.5 % ( IQR 0-4.4) vs. 11.8 % ( IQR 0-24.5) , p = 0.034). After correcting for ECMO duration , need for continuous renal replacement therapy and number of vasoactive drugs required on ECMO , greater EN energy adequacy remained associated with lower risk of mortality ( adjusted odds ratio 0.93 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.86-0.99) , p = 0.048). Nutritional adequacy , especially that of EN , remains low in children supported on ECMO. EN energy adequacy was found to be associated with lower mortality. Further studies on nutritional adequacy in pediatric ECMO , as well as strategies to optimize EN in these children , are warranted.
