  The evolving conceptualization of the management of surgical pain was a major contributor to the supply of narcotics that led to the opioid crisis. We designed and implemented a breast surgery-specific Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS) protocol using opioid-sparing techniques to eliminate narcotic prescription at discharge without sacrificing perioperative pain control. A pilot observational study included patients with and without cancer undergoing lumpectomy. The convenience sample consisted of an ERAS group and a control usual care ( UC) group who underwent surgery during the same time period. Discharge narcotic prescriptions were compared after converting to oral morphine milligram equivalents ( MME 's). Postoperative day one and week one pain scores were also compared between the two groups. Ninety ERAS and 67 UC patients were enrolled. Most lumpectomies were wire-localized , and half of the patients in each group had breast cancer. There were more obese patients in the ERAS group. UC lumpectomy patients were discharged with a median of 54.5 MMEs ( range 0-120) , while the ERAS lumpectomy patients were discharged with none ( p < 0.001). Postoperative pain scores were not significantly different between groups , and there were few complications. A breast surgery-specific ERAS protocol employing opioid-sparing techniques successfully eliminated postoperative narcotic prescription without sacrificing perioperative pain control or increasing postoperative complications. By promoting the adoption of similar protocols , surgeons can continue to improve patient outcomes while decreasing the quantity of narcotics available for diversion within our patients ' communities.
