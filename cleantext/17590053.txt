  TiO ₂ micro-/ nano-structures with different morphologies have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The effects of the solvents on the morphology and structure of the obtained products have been studied. The objective of the present paper is to compare the photocatalytic properties of the obtained TiO ₂ products. During the synthesis process , the tetrabutyl titanate and titanium ( IV) fluoride were used as the titanium source. The obtained micro-/ nano-structures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy , X-ray diffraction analysis , and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B solution under simulated solar irradiation. It is found that the morphologies and structures of TiO ₂ have a great influence on its photocatalytic activity. Compared with other samples , TiO ₂ flower clusters assembled with nanorods exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Rhodamine B.
