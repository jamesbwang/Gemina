  Targets for ground-based gravitational wave interferometers include continuous , quasiperiodic sources of gravitational radiation , such as isolated , spinning neutron stars. In this work , we perform evolution simulations of uniformly rotating , triaxially deformed stars , the compressible analogs in general relativity of incompressible , Newtonian Jacobi ellipsoids. We investigate their stability and gravitational wave emission. We employ five models , both normal and supramassive , and track their evolution with different grid setups and resolutions , as well as with two different evolution codes. We find that all models are dynamically stable and produce a strain that is approximately one-tenth the average value of a merging binary system. We track their secular evolution and find that all our stars evolve toward axisymmetry , maintaining their uniform rotation , rotational kinetic energy , and angular momentum profiles while losing their triaxiality.
