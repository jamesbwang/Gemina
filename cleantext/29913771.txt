  Background and aim The present study reports on chronic non-cancer patients who were referred to a private pain clinic , according to a waiting time guarantee and treated within one month from referral. Based on evaluation by members of the multidisciplinary staff at our pain clinic a pain management program could be offered individually or as group therapy. Methods Health related quality of life , psychometric tests , use of pain medication; socio-economic status and number of consultations in general practice were recorded at referral to the clinic and by postal questionnaires at follow-up 21 months later. The primary treatment outcome ( treatment success) was defined as an improvement of at least 40 points in the physical component and/or the mental component of SF-36 from baseline to follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were changes in Beck 's Anxiety<symptom> Inventory and Beck 's Depression<symptom> Inventory , use of analgesics , work status and transfer income and number of consultations at the GP 's office due to the chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> condition. Results A total of 306 patients were included: 141 were treated individually and 165 were treated in groups. At follow-up , data were obtained from 189 patients ( 62 %). Comparing baseline to follow-up data , 62 % of group treated patients were treated successfully , compared with 41 % of individually treated patients. Anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were significantly improved in group treated patients but not in those treated individually. significantly more patients had work income ( and less patients transfer income) among group treated , compared with individually treated. At follow-up use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was increased whereas use of tranquilizers and strong opioids was decreased in all patients. Number of consultations at their GPs due to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> was significantly reduced in all patients. Conclusions Multidisciplinary treatment in a private pain clinic seems to have a long-term effect in relation to biological , psychological and social aspects of the chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> condition. Treatments based on group therapy may offer better results than individual treatment courses. Implications The effect of group therapy should be explored further.
