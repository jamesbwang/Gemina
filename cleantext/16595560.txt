  In the present study , the influence of the co-contamination with various chemical forms of antimony ( Sb) with arsenite ( As ( III)) on soil microbial communities was investigated. The oxidation of As ( III) to As ( V) was monitored in soil columns amended with As ( III) and three different chemical forms of Sb: antimony potassium tartrate ( Sb ( III)- tar) , antimony ( III) oxide ( Sb
