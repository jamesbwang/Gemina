  We aimed to investigate whether the cardioprotection of sevoflurane against ischemia/reperfusion ( IR) injury is via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS). The rat in vivo model of myocardial IR injury was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending ( LAD) coronary artery. Sevoflurane significantly ameliorated the reduced cardiac function , increased infarct size and elevated troponin I level and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) activity in plasma induced by IR injury. Sevoflurane suppressed the I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis. The increased protein levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein after myocardial I/R were significantly reduced by sevoflurane. The protein levels of phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( PERK) , phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 ( eIF2Î±) and activating transcription factor 4 ( ATF4) were significantly increased in rats with I/R and attenuated by sevoflurane treatment. The phosphorylation of Akt was further activated by sevoflurane. The cardioprotection of sevoflurane could be blocked by wortmannin , a PI3K/Akt inhibitor. Our results suggest that the cardioprotection of sevoflurane against IR injury might be mediated by suppressing PERK/eIF2a/ATF4/ CHOP signaling via activating the Akt pathway , which helps in understanding the novel mechanism of the cardioprotection of sevoflurane.
