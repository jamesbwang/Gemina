  Abscisic acid ( ABA) regulates the physiological and biochemical mechanisms required to tolerate drought stress , which is considered as an important abiotic stress. It has been postulated that ABA might be involved in regulation of plant phenolic compounds biosynthesis , especially anthocyanins that accumulate in plants subjected to drought stress; however , the evidence for this postulate remains elusive. Therefore , we studied whether ABA is involved in phenolic compounds accumulation , especially anthocyanin biosynthesis , using drought stressed Aristotelia chilensis plants , an endemic berry in Chile. Our approach was to use fluridone , an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor , and then subsequent ABA applications to young and fully-expanded leaves of drought stressed A. chilensis plants during 24 , 48 and 72 h of the experiment. Plants were harvested and leaves were collected separately to determine the biochemical status. We observed that fluridone treatments significantly decreased ABA concentrations and total anthocyanin ( TA) concentrations in stressed plants , including both young and fully-expanded leaves. TA concentrations following fluridone treatment were reduced around 5-fold , reaching control plant levels. ABA application restored ABA levels as well as TA concentrations in stressed plant at the 48 h of the experiment. We also observed that TA concentrations followed the same pattern as ABA concentrations in the ABA treated plants. qRT-PCR revealed that AcUFGT gene expression decreased in fully-expanded leaves of stressed plants treated with fluridone , while a subsequent ABA application increased AcUFGT expression. Taken together , our results suggest that ABA is involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis under drought stress. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
