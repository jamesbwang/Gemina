  This work investigated the impact of high intensity ultrasound ( HIUS) pretreatment on the functional properties and structural characteristics of micellar casein concentrate ( MCC). Microfiltered casein protein retentates were treated with HIUS for 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 5 min prior to spray drying. The results showed that conductivity , solubility , emulsifying , gelling increased significantly as the ultrasonic time prolonged , but the change of pH value were insignificant. In addition , the structural characteristics of MCC for all samples were studied. There was an increase in surface hydrophobicity ( Ho) and a reduction in particle size compared with the control ( without HIUS pretreatment). The secondary structure of HIUS pretreated MCC samples changed significantly with an increase in β-sheets and random coils and a reduction in α-helix and β-turn. It can be speculated that HIUS pretreatment facilitate the change of functional properties of MCC and these changes would promote its application in food industry.
