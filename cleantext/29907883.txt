  B cell development in bone<disease> marrow is a precisely regulated complex process. Through successive stages of differentiation , which are regulated by a multitude of signaling pathways and an array of lineage-specific transcription factors , the common lymphoid progenitors ultimately give rise to mature B cells. Similar to early thymocyte development in the thymus , early B cell development in bone<disease> marrow is critically dependent on IL-7 signaling. During this IL-7-dependent stage of differentiation , several transcription factors , such as E2A , EBF1 , and Pax5 , among others , play indispensable roles in B lineage specification and maintenance. Although recent studies have implicated several other transcription factors in B cell development , the role of NFATc1 in early B cell developmental stages is not known. Here , using multiple gene-manipulated mouse models and applying various experimental methods , we show that NFATc1 activity is vital for early B cell differentiation. Lack of NFATc1 activity in pro-B cells suppresses EBF1 expression , impairs immunoglobulin gene rearrangement , and thereby preBCR formation , resulting in defective B cell development. Overall , deficiency in NFATc1 activity arrested the pro-B cell transition to the pre-B cell stage , leading to severe B cell lymphopenia. Our findings suggest that , along with other transcription factors , NFATc1 is a critical component of the signaling mechanism that facilitates early B cell differentiation.
