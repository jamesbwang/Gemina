  Although cancer disparities among American Indian ( AI) women are alarming , research on spiritual coping among this population is virtually nonexistent. This is particularly problematic , given the importance of medical practitioners ' discussing the topic with cancer patients , along with the centrality of spirituality to many AI patients. The purpose of this article was to explore AI women cancer survivors ' spiritual coping with their experiences. Using a community-based participatory research approach , this qualitative descriptive study included a sample of 43 AI women cancer survivors ( n = 14 breast cancer , n = 14 cervical cancer , and n = 15 colon and other types of cancer). Qualitative content analysis revealed that most participants ( 76 percent , n = 32) cited prayer as an important part of their cancer recovery and coping strategies. Many participants expressed how prayer and spirituality connected them to family , to faith communities , and to others. In addition to prayer , over a third ( 36 percent , n = 15) of participants emphasized faith as a recovery and coping strategy. Results indicate that most women drew great comfort , strength , hope , and relief from their spiritual and faith traditions , indicating that religious and spiritual practices may be an important protective factor against the strain of the cancer experience.
