  Firefighters are at increased risk for both problematic alcohol use and suicidality. Research has found that problematic alcohol use is related to suicidality among this population; however , limited data exist regarding what might account for this association. The present two-study investigation ( 1) examined the association between suicidality and problematic alcohol use among two large samples of firefighters and ( 2) tested whether interpersonal theory of suicide constructs-perceived burdensomeness ( PB) and thwarted belongingness ( TB)- serve as indirect indicators of this relationship. Participants in Study 1 were 944 U.S. firefighters ( 12.5 % female); participants in Study 2 were 241 U.S. women firefighters. Participants completed the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire , Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test , and the Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale ( Study 1) or the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-Short Form ( Study 2). Bias-corrected bootstrap indirect effects path analyses were utilized. In Study 1 , more problematic alcohol use was significantly associated with more severe career suicidal ideation via PB but not TB. In Study 2 , problematic alcohol use was associated with career suicidal ideation via both PB and TB. PB seems to account for the relationship between problematic alcohol use and career suicidal ideation among male and female firefighters. Limitations include use of a cross-sectional design , use of retrospective measures of suicidal ideation , and our findings derived from subsamples of two existing datasets. Findings suggest that PB and TB may explain the relationship between problematic alcohol use and suicidal ideation , but that this effect is discrepant based on gender.
