  Vascular antiphospholipid syndrome<disease> ( VAPS) and obstetric ( OAPS) are different entities because some patients only develop thrombosis ( without recurrent pregnancy losses) and vice versa. Only two articles have reported that low 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 , VD3) levels were not correlated with the presence of conventional antiphospholipid antibodies ( aPL Abs: anticardiolipin ( aCL) , anti-beta2glycoprotein I ( aβ2gpI) , and lupus anticoagulant ( LA)) , but no article analyzed the association of VD3 and anti-annexin A5 ( aanxA5) Abs. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between VD3 , multiple positivity of conventional aPL and aanxA5 Abs levels only in female OAPS vs. VAPS. Our study included 62 consecutive female PAPS patients. Concentrations of Abs were measured by ELISA , while VD3 levels were determined by immunochemiluminescence. Only 10/62 ( 16.13 %) had sufficient ( ≥ 30 ng/ml) VD3 levels , while 48/62 ( 77.42 %) and 4/62 ( 6.45 %) had insufficiency and VD3 deficiency , respectively. Statistically significant VD3 deficiency was noticed in VAPS ( vs. OAPS , P = 0.013). A negative correlation between VD3 levels and the age of patients was noticed ( r =- 0.493 , P = 0.032) only in VAPS subgroup. Multiple positivity of aPL and aanxA5 Abs was not associated with VD3 deficiency. Newly emerging aPL Abs , such as aanxA5 Abs , or their combinations with classical aPL Abs are not associated with VD3 deficiency in neither OAPS nor VAPS patients. Due to its immunomodulatory roles in B-Ly homeostasis , supplementation with VD3 should be considered in APS , at least in subgroup with severe form of the disease , i.e. , VAPS.
