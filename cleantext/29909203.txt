  Activation of spinal cord microglia is crucial for the development of bone cancer pain ( BCP). The essential signal between neuronal excitability and microglial activation is not fully understood. In the present study , carcinoma implantation into tibia was used to induce BCP and RNAi-lentivirus was injected into spinal cord to knock down C1 , C2 or C3 of complement cascade. We showed that C1 , C2 and C3 co-localized in the same neurons and increased in cancer-bearing rats along with microglial activation. Knocked down of C1 , C2 or C3 inhibited microglial activation and prevented the development of cancer-induced bone pain. Intrathecal administration of either minocycline ( an inhibitor of microglial activity) to inhibit the activation of microglia or compstatin ( a C3-targeted complement inhibitor) to block the complement cascade reversed cancer induced bone pain. Further study indicated that neuronal complement promoted the activation of microglia via complement 3 receptor ( C3R). In the in vitro experiments , the proliferation of microglia was enhanced by the activation product of C3 ( iC3b) , but was inhibited by compstatin. These results indicated that neuronal complement pathway promoted the activation of microglia via C3R and contributed to the development of BCP.
