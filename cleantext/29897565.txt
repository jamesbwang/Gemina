  γδ T cells are effector lymphocytes recognized as key players during chronic inflammatory processes. Mouse studies suggest a pathological role for γδ T cells in models of kidney disease. Here we evaluated γδ T cells in human native kidneys with tubulointerstitial fibrosis<disease> , the pathological hallmark of chronic kidney disease. γδ T cells were extracted from human kidney tissue and enumerated and phenotyped by multicolour flow cytometry. Localization and cytokine production by γδ T cells was examined by immunofluorescent microscopy. We detected significantly elevated numbers of γδ T cells in diseased biopsies with tubulointerstitial fibrosis<disease> compared with diseased biopsies without fibrosis<disease> and healthy kidney tissue. At a subset level , only numbers of Vδ1 + γδ T cells were significantly elevated in fibrotic kidney tissue. Expression levels of cluster of differentiation 161 ( CD161) , a marker of human memory T cells with potential for innate-like function and interleukin ( IL) -17 A production , were significantly elevated on γδ T cells from fibrotic biopsies compared with nonfibrotic kidney tissue. Flow cytometric characterization of CD161 + γδ T cells in fibrotic biopsies revealed significantly elevated expression of natural killer ( NK) cell-associated markers CD56 , CD16 and CD336 ( NKp44) compared with CD161- γδ T cells , indicative of a cytotoxic phenotype. Immunofluorescent analysis of fibrotic kidney tissue localized the accumulation of γδ T cells within the tubulointerstitium , with γδ T cells identified , for the first time , as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A. Collectively , our data suggest that human effector γδ T cells contribute to the fibrotic process and thus progression to chronic kidney disease.
