  Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion is an essential process during ischemic stroke. The apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells induced by ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury is an important cause for brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia. Longxuetongluo capsule ( LTC) has been used for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinic. However , its underlying action mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to verify the protective effect and mechanisms of LTC on HUVEC cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation ( OGD/R) injury through MTT , LDH , flow cytometry , AO/EB staining and western blot assays. As a result , OGD/R significantly decreased the viability of HUVEC cells , which was significantly improved by LTC. LDH release assay showed that OGD/R significantly increased the lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) release , and LTC dramatically reduced the OGD/R-induced LDH release. Further mechanism study indicated that LTC dose-dependently inhibited the cleavage of PARP , caspase 3 , and caspase 9 induced by OGD/R , suggesting that LTC could inhibit the activation of caspase 3/9 apoptosis pathway in the OGD/R-induced apoptosis of HUVEC cells. In conclusion , LTC could protect HUVEC cells against OGD/R injury by inhibiting the activation of mitochondria-related caspase 3/9 apoptosis pathway.
