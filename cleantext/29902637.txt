  Currently , there is a lack of evidence on the medium-term follow-up of cementless total hip arthroplasty ( THA) using metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene bearing ( MoXPE) , ceramic on ceramic bearing ( CoC) at more than 5 years follow-up. Therefore , we performed a case control study to: compare the incidence rate of osteolysis; compare the longevity for both types of THAs , and to evaluate the wear rate of MoXPE THAs. CoC THAs will have a lower rate of osteolysis and better longevity than MoXPE THAs. We performed a retrospective analysis of 77 MoXPE ( 68 women , 9 men) and 105 CoC ( 85 women , 20 men) THAs , with an average patient age at the time of surgery of 64.7 years ( range , 27 to 76 years). The cohorts were matched according to sex , body mass index , or diagnosis of hip<symptom> joint disease. Clinical and radiologic measurements were analyzed at a mean follow-up of 6.7 years ( range , 5-9 years). There were no between-group differences with regard to the Harris hip score ( 87.0 ( 64.0-98.0) and 89.9 ( 70.0-100.0) for the MoXPE and CoC group , respectively) and the incidence rate of osteolysis ( 2.6 % and 1.9 % , respectively). Revision was required for 1 case for each THA type. The Kaplan-Meier survival at 8 years , using implant loosening or revision as the end-point of analysis , was 96.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 90.0-99.3) for the MoXPE group and 98.9 % ( 95 % CI , 92.2-99.8) for the CoC group ( p = 0.189). The mean annual liner wear rate was 0.0160 mm/year ( range , 0.0050 to 0.0390 mm/year) for the MoXPE THAs. There was no difference between CoC and MoXPE THAs in the incidence of osteolysis or in survival rate at 8 years post-surgery. Excellent clinical and radiological outcomes were obtained for both types of bearings. III , Case control study , case control retrospective design.
