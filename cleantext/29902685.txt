  To explore the relationship among housebound status , depression<symptom> and cognitive function , and further to study whether depression<symptom> can take on a mediator among elders in rural communities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 720 community residents aged â‰¥ 60 years from March to May in 2016 in Hebei province , China. We used the Chinese version of Housebound scale , the Rasch-Derived of the Center for Epidemiological studies Depression<symptom> scale ( CES-D-R) , and the Minimental State Examination Scale ( MMSE) to estimate housebound status , depression<symptom> , and cognitive function separately. Correlation , multiple linear regression , and structural equation modeling was used to data analyses. 712 completely replied questionnaires were finally used in the data analyses among 720 questionnaires , which indicated that effective response rate was 98.9 %. Results indicated that the scores of housebound status were positively correlated with the MMSE scores. Being housebound correlated negatively with MMSE scores. Housebound status and three dimensions of CES-D-R ( i.e. negative affect , positive affect , and interpersonal problems) were deemed as significant predictors of cognitive function among rural elders. The effect of housebound status on cognitive function was fully mediated by depression<symptom> Not all subscales of CES-D-R can affect MMSE scores among rural elders. There may be full mediation effects of depression<symptom> within the impact of housebound status on cognitive function , mainly through negative affect , positive affect and interpersonal problems. It indicates that preventing the elderly from housebound status could relieve the decline of cognitive function by the intermediary role of
