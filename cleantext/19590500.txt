  While restrictive and compensatory eating disorders ( e.g. anorexia<symptom> and bulimia) are associated with elevated risk of suicide , less is known about binge eating disorder ( BED). There is suggestive evidence of a U-shaped relationship between body mass index ( BMI) and completed suicide , but fewer studies on suicidal ideation or attempts. This study examined the association between BED , BMI , and suicidality , and assessed whether these relationships varied by gender. Data come from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiologic Surveys ( N = 14,497). Binge episodes and BED were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory ( CIDI). BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Suicidal ideation/attempts were assessed using the CIDI. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association between binging/BED , BMI and suicidality. Interaction terms were used to assess whether the relationship between BMI and suicidality was moderated by binging/BED , and whether the relationships between binging/BED and BMI differed by gender. One-third of adults with BED had a history of suicidality , compared to 19 % of those without. Both binging ( OR: 1.95 , 95 % CI: 1.50-2.53) and BED ( OR: 2.01 , 95 % CI: 1.41-2.86) were associated with suicidality in fully-adjusted models. BMI was associated with suicidality in a curvilinear manner , and this relationship was exacerbated by binging/BED ( OR Binge eating , even below the threshold for BED , is associated with suicidality. BMI is associated with suicidality in a curvilinear manner , and the BMI-suicidality relationship is potentiated by binge eating/BED. Findings support the thoughtful integration of psychiatric care into weight<symptom> loss<symptom> programs for adults with a history of binging behavior.
