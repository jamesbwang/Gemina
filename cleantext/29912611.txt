  The Texas Revised Inventory of Grief-Present Scale ( TRIG-Present) is a widely used tool to measure grief. Most existing research related to the assessment and characteristics of grief has been conducted sampling bereaved Western subjects and , as such , limited information is available on the experience of grief in Chinese samples. This study aims to validate the Chinese version of the TRIG-Present ( TRIG-Present-C) and explore the predictors of grief among bereaved adults in China. Responses from 460 bereaved Chinese adults were collected through an online survey. Subjects completed a specially developed questionnaire covering demographic data/loss-related variables , the TRIG-Present-C , and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D-9). Confirmatory factor analysis validates the original one-factor structure. The overall content validity index is equal to 1.0. Significant correlations were observed , with CES-D-9 and factor subscales ( r ranged from -0.228 to 0.607 , p < 0.05) indicating the convergent validity. The TRIG-Present-C scores distinguished grieving individuals from those experiencing unanticipated death and those where death was anticipated. The internal consistency is satisfactory ( Cronbach 's Î± = 0.957). In multiple regression analyses , with grief severity as the dependent variable , 28.6 % of the variance was explained by religious belief , the immediacy of the loss , the loss of a first-degree relative , and where the deceased was relatively young. The TRIG-Present-C scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing grief reaction among bereaved Chinese adults. Religious belief , loss of a first-degree relative , where the deceased was relatively young , and the immediacy of loss were associated with higher levels of grief.
