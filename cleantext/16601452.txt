  Survival analysis in biology and reliability theory in engineering concern the dynamical functioning of bio/electro/mechanical units. Here we incorporate effects of chaotic dynamics into the classical theory. Dynamical systems theory now distinguishes strong and weak chaos. Strong chaos generates Type II survivorship curves entirely as a result of the internal operation of the system , without any age-independent , external , random forces of mortality. Weak chaos exhibits ( a) intermittency and ( b) Type III survivorship , defined as a decreasing
