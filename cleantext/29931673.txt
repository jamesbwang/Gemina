  Fear of being laughed at and family interaction are highly related. Parental over-control and over-protection influence children 's excessive anxiety<symptom> over being laughed at. Conversely , parental attachment is an important index of the parent-child relationship and is closely correlated to children 's gelotophobia. However , is it the style of parenting or the outcome of parenting ( i.e. attachment) that influences a child 's gelotophobia? To answer this question , the present study analysed the relationships between gelotophobia , perceived parenting of children and parent-child attachment , as well as the mediating role of attachment between parenting and children 's gelotophobia , using a sample of 373 high-school students. The results show that being highly communicative and close attachment completely weakened the negative correlation between warm , caring parenting and the child 's gelotophobia; moreover , being highly communicative and close attachment , together with over-protective and over-controlling parenting , influence children 's gelotophobia. In sum , this study indicates that parent-child attachment has a direct and indirect influence on perceived parental care and protection and children 's fear of being laughed at.
