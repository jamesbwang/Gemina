  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) growth and progression is frequently driven by RAS pathway activation through upstream growth factor receptor activation or through mutational activation of KRAS or BRAF. Here we describe an additional mechanism by which the RAS pathway may be modulated in CRC. PTPRS , a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase , appears to regulate RAS pathway activation through ERK. PTPRS modulates ERK phosphorylation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Native mutations in PTPRS , present in ~ 10 % of CRC , may reduce its phosphatase activity while increasing ERK activation and downstream transcriptional signaling.
