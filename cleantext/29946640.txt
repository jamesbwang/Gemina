  To investigate the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF) and serum of patients with Graves ' disease ( GD) and periodontitis<disease> ( CP) , and to analyze the correlation between Graves ' disease and periodontitis<disease> One hundred and twenty subjects were selected and divided into 4 groups: 30 healthy participants as the control group , 30 patients with CP , 30 patients with GD , and 30 patients with GD and CP. The serum and GCF level of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , and clinical periodontal parameters including probing depth ( PD) , clinical attachment level ( CAL) and sulcus bleeding indexes ( SBI) were examined. The date was analyzed with SPSS19 .0 software package. The concentration of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum and GCF of patients with GD+CP group was significantly higher than that in CP group and GD group ( P < 0.05). The level of IL-6 and TNF-α in serum and GCF of patients in GD+CP group and GD group was positively correlated with FT3 and FT4 ( P < 0.05) , and the correlation between GD+CP group was significantly higher than that in GD group. The level of IL-6 and TNF-α in GD+CP group were significantly higher than those in CP group and GD group , indicating that there is an interaction between periodontitis<disease> and Graves ' disease in immune mechanism.
