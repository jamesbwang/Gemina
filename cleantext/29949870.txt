  Manganese ( Mn) exposure can result in parkinsonism. However , understanding of manganese neurotoxicity has been limited by the lack of a cumulative Mn biomarker. Therefore , the current goal was to develop Mn cumulative exposure indices ( MnCEI) , an established method to estimate cumulative exposure , and determine associations of MnCEI with blood Mn ( BMn) , fingernail Mn ( FMn) , and bone Mn ( BnMn). We completed a cross-sectional study of 60 male Chinese workers. Self-reported occupational history was used to create two MnCEIs reflecting the previous 16 years ( MnCEI
