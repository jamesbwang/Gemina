  Cigarette smoking has declined in the United States. Still , identifying prevalent and modifiable barriers to quitting can help inform the next steps for tobacco control. Illicit drug use , which may be increasingly common in the United States , could be one such factor. We investigated the relationship between past-month illicit drug use and cigarette smoking status and estimated trends in the prevalence of past-month illicit drug use by cigarette smoking status from 2002 to 2014 in the United States. The 2002-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health was used to obtain nationally representative data on past-month illicit drug use. From 2002 to 2014 , past-month illicit drug use ( for all drugs considered) was nearly 5 times more common among current smokers than among never smokers ( adjusted odds ratio = 4.79) and nearly twice as prevalent in former smokers as in never smokers ( adjusted odds ratio = 1.99). Illicit drug use increased linearly over time from 2002 to 2014 in the entire general population ( ie , across and within current smokers , former smokers , and never smokers). This increasing trend in drug use was most rapid among former smokers ( relative to current smokers and never smokers) and was largely , but not entirely , driven by increases in cannabis use. Illicit drug use is most prevalent among current cigarette smokers. Yet , the rate of increase in illicit drug use prevalence was most rapid among former smokers. Because former smokers outnumber current smokers in the general population , it may be important to monitor former smokers into the future for potential negative drug-related outcomes.
