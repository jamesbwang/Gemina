  Recent large-scale analyses suggest that local management actions may not protect coral reefs from climate change , yet most local threat-reduction strategies have not been tested experimentally. We show that removing coral predators is a common local action used by managers across the world , and that removing the corallivorous snail Coralliophila abbreviata from Caribbean brain corals ( Pseudodiploria and Diploria species) before a major warming event increased coral resilience by reducing bleaching severity ( resistance) and post-bleaching tissue mortality ( recovery). Our results highlight the need for increased evaluation and identification of local interventions that improve coral reef resilience.
