  Over recent years we have witnessed an increase in the resistance of microorganisms to the available antimicrobials and a decrease in the number of new antimicrobials. Fosfomycin is a safe and cheap broad-spectrum antibiotic which has shown very promising results in combination therapy , mainly against gram-negative microorganisms. Little is known , however , about its clinical efficacy against gram-positive microorganisms. We performed a retrospective review of all patients with severe gram-positive infections who received fosfomycin as part of their treatment from 2011 to 2017. We also performed in vitro time-kill assays to study the behaviour of fosfomycin with different antimicrobials against two strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) and two strains of methicillin-susceptible S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MSSA). Seventy-five patients were treated with different fosfomycin combinations. Among them , 61 ( 81 %) were successfully treated. Daptomycin plus fosfomycin was the most effective combination. Overall , the treatment with fosfomycin was safe , and side effects were minor. There was only one major side effect that resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Time-kill studies demonstrated increased activity of fosfomycin combinations , with daptomycin-fosfomycin being the most active combination against both MRSA and MSSA strains. Our results suggest that antimicrobial combinations including fosfomycin are an alternative and effective approach for gram-positive infections.
