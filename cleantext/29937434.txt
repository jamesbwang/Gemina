  Insulin-dependent diabetes may occur in patients with cancers who are treated with checkpoint inhibitors ( CPIs). We reviewed cases occurring over a 6-year period at two academic institutions and identified 27 patients in whom this developed , or an incidence of 0.9 %. The patients had a variety of solid-organ cancers , but all had received either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Diabetes presented with ketoacidosis in 59 % , and 42 % had evidence of pancreatitis<disease> in the peridiagnosis period. Forty percent had at least one positive autoantibody and 21 % had two or more. There was a predominance of HLA-DR4 , which was present in 76 % of patients. Other immune adverse events were seen in 70 % , and endocrine adverse events in 44 %. We conclude that autoimmune , insulin-dependent diabetes occurs in close to 1 % of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or- PD-L1 CPIs. This syndrome<disease> has similarities and differences compared with classic type 1 diabetes. The dominance of HLA-DR4 suggests an opportunity to identify those at highest risk of these complications and to discover insights into the mechanisms of this adverse event.
