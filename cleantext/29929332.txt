  Due to their significant absorption and reduction abilities , nanoscale zero-valent iron ( nZVI)/ granular activated carbon ( GAC) composites are very effective for the degradation of organic contaminants and heavy metals. However , to date , there is no systematic study on the applicability of nZVI/GAC for the removal of multiple highly toxic nitrosamines from water supplies. For this study , nZVI/GAC was synthesized and applied to the degradation of multiple nitrosamines. The effects of initial nitrosamine concentration , composite dosage , contact duration , competition with coexistent elements , and reaction mechanisms during the nitrosamine removal process from aqueous solutions were investigated. Compared with bare nZVI and GAC , the removal rates of six nitrosamines via nZVI/GAC were initially very rapid. The highest removal ratios of the six nitrosamines were 76.1 % ( N-nitrosodimethylamine , NDMA) , 84.7 % ( N-nitrosomethylethylamine , NMEA) , 89.8 % ( N-nitrosodiethylamine , NDEA) , 93.5 % ( N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine , NDPA) , 95.7 % ( N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine , NDBA) , and 80.4 % ( N-nitrosomorpholine , NMor). The nitrosamine degradation kinetics data agreed well with the pseudo-second-order model ( R
