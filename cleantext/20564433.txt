  In addition to the actual composition of the diet ( i.e. nutrient composition , food groups) , the omega-6/ omega-3 fatty acid ratio has been demonstrated to influence the tissue fatty acid profile and subsequently the risk for cardiovascular and other diseases. Likewise , the consumption of green leafy vegetables ( GLVs) may favorably reduce the risks associated with disease. Although an ~ 3:1 omega-6/ omega-3 fatty acid ratio ( ω-6/ ω-3 FAR) is recommended , the typical American diet has an ~ 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR. Previous research affirms the ability of collard greens ( CG) , purslane ( PL) , and sweet potato greens ( SPG) to improve the hepatic profile of spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRs). The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of GLVs , incorporated ( 4 %) into diets with a 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR , on the erythrocyte fatty acid profile of male SHRs. SHRs ( N = 50) were randomly assigned to one of five dietary groups- standardized control ( AIN-76A) , Control ( 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR) , CG ( 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR + 4 % CG) , PL ( 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR + 4 % PL) or SPG ( 25:1 ω-6/ ω-3 FAR + 4 % SPG). Following 6 weeks consumption of diets , SHRs erythrocyte fatty acid profiles were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Significantly lower percentages of total saturated fatty acids ( p < 0.05) and greater percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids were present among SHR erythrocytes following the consumption of diets containing CG , PL and SPG. Total polyunsaturated fatty acids were greatest among SHRs consuming diets containing purslane. The present study demonstrates the ability of GLVs to mitigate the potential effects of an elevated ω-6/ ω-3 FAR , which may contribute to an atherogenic fatty acid profile , inflammation<symptom> and disease pathogenesis. Dietary recommendations for disease prevention should consider the inclusion of these GLVs , particularly among those consuming diets with an ω-6/ ω-3 FAR that may promote disease.
