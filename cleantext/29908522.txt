  This article presents a novel surgical technique in the management of open complete talocrural luxations and evaluates the results , and clinical benefits with its routine clinical utilization. Retrospective study. Seventeen medium- or large-breed client-owned dogs of different breed , age and sex with complete talocrural luxations and radiographic follow-up of at least 24 weeks duration. Selective talocrural arthrodesis was performed by using a hybrid transarticular external skeletal fixator frame. Clinical and radiographical evaluation was performed regarding the lesion<symptom> , concomitant injury , duration of the surgery , time to first use of the limb , fixator removal time , complications and clinical outcomes. Dogs started to use the injured limb between postoperative days 1 to 11. Pin or wire tract related complications were observed in all dogs. Time to fixator removal ranged from 57 to 90 days with a median of 73 days. All of the operated joints with an exception of one dog resulted in talocrural fusion. Mid-term clinical outcomes score was regarded as excellent in 13/17 dogs , good in 3/17 dogs and poor in 1/17 dogs subject to authors ' evaluation. A transarticular hybrid external fixator may allow early use of postoperative limb with an excellent patient compliance and is well tolerated as well. The technique showed a promising opportunity of providing favourable limb use.
