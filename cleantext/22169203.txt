  Tau , a microtubule-associated protein , is the main component of the intracellular filamentous inclusions<disease> that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies , including Alzheimer disease ( AD) , frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 ( FTDP-17) , Pick disease ( PiD) , progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP) and corticobasal degeneration ( CBD). Hyperphosphorylated , aggregated tau proteins form the core of neurofibrillary tangles ( NFTs) , which are shown to be one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. The discovery of mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (
