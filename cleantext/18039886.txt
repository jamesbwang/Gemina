  Identifying maize inbred lines that are more efficient in nitrogen ( N) use is an important strategy and a necessity in the context of environmental and economic impacts attributed to the excessive N fertilization. N-uptake efficiency ( NUpE) and N-utilization efficiency ( NUtE) are components of N-use efficiency ( NUE). Despite the most maize breeding data have a multi-trait structure , they are often analyzed under a single-trait framework. We aimed to estimate the genetic parameters for NUpE and NUtE in contrasting N levels , in order to identify superior maize inbred lines , and to propose a Bayesian multi-trait multi-environment ( MTME) model. Sixty-four tropical maize inbred lines were evaluated in two experiments: at high ( HN) and low N ( LN) levels. The MTME model was compared to single-trait multi-environment ( STME) models. Based on deviance information criteria ( DIC) , both multi- and single-trait models revealed genotypes x environments ( G x E) interaction. In the MTME model , NUpE was found to be weakly heritable with posterior modes of heritability of 0.016 and 0.023 under HN and LN , respectively. NUtE at HN was found to be highly heritable ( 0.490) , whereas under LN condition it was moderately heritable ( 0.215). We adopted the MTME model , since combined analysis often presents more accurate breeding values than single models. Superior inbred lines for NUpE and NUtE were identified and this information can be used to plan crosses to obtain maize hybrids that have superior nitrogen use efficiency.
