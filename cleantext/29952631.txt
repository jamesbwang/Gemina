  To evaluate the long-term effect of cryopreserved human amniotic membrane transplant during strabismus reoperations. A total of 15 patients with persistent strabismus were included in a prospective study to evaluate the effect of wrapping the extra-ocular muscles with cryopreserved amniotic membrane during strabismus reoperations. The study end-point was the last follow-up visit. A successful outcome was defined as 0-10 ∆ of horizontal tropia and 0-4 ∆ of vertical tropia , with no limitation of ductions exceeding -1. A cosmetically acceptable outcome was defined as a tropia of 0-15 ∆. Maximum follow-up was 85 months ( mean: 25.4 ± 25.5 months). At the last follow-up visit , a successful outcome was achieved in 46.7 % , a cosmetically acceptable outcome was achieved in 66.7 % , and the mean ocular deviation angles improved from 38.60 ± 14.63 ∆ , preoperatively , to 10.6 ± 11.08 ∆. Motility limitation on the final follow-up visit exceeded -1 in only 4/180 muscles ( 2.2 %). The effect of cryopreserved amniotic membrane transplantation on the success of strabismus reoperations was moderate in terms of ocular alignment. Its effect was more pronounced in terms of ocular motility. The latter better reflects the level of adhesions. No long-term complications were documented , denoting safety of cryopreserved amniotic membrane usage during strabismus reoperations.
