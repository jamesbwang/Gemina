  Detection of DNA methylation in the genome has been possible for decades; however , the ability to deliberately and specifically manipulate local DNA methylation states in the genome has been extremely limited. Consequently , this has impeded our understanding of the direct effect of DNA methylation on transcriptional regulation and transcription factor binding in the native chromatin context. Thus , highly specific targeted epigenome editing tools are needed to address this. Recent adaptations of genome editing technologies , including fusion of the DNMT3A DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain to catalytically inactive Cas9 ( dC9-D3A) , have aimed to alter DNA methylation at desired loci. Here , we show that these tools exhibit consistent off-target DNA methylation deposition in the genome , limiting their capabilities to unambiguously assess the functional consequences of DNA methylation. To address this , we developed a modular dCas9-SunTag ( dC9Sun-D3A) system that can recruit multiple DNMT3A catalytic domains to a target site for editing DNA methylation. dC9Sun-D3A is tunable , specific , and exhibits much higher induction of DNA methylation at target sites than the dC9-D3A direct fusion protein. Importantly , genome-wide characterization of dC9Sun-D3A binding sites and DNA methylation revealed minimal off-target protein binding and induction of DNA methylation with dC9Sun-D3A , compared to pervasive off-target methylation by dC9-D3A. Furthermore , we used dC9Sun-D3A to demonstrate the binding sensitivity to DNA methylation for CTCF and NRF1 in situ. Overall , this modular dC9Sun-D3A system enables precise DNA methylation deposition with the lowest off-target DNA methylation levels reported to date , allowing accurate functional determination of the role of DNA methylation at single loci.
