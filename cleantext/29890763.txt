  Noble metal aerogels offer a wide range of catalytic applications due to their high surface area and tunable porosity. Control over monolith shape , pore size , and nanofiber diameter is desired in order to optimize electronic conductivity and mechanical integrity for device applications. However , common aerogel synthesis techniques such as solvent mediated aggregation , linker molecules , sol ‚Åª gel , hydrothermal , and carbothermal reduction are limited when using noble metal salts. Here , we present the synthesis of palladium aerogels using carboxymethyl cellulose nanofiber ( CNF) biotemplates that provide control over aerogel shape , pore size , and conductivity. Biotemplate hydrogels were formed via covalent cross linking using 1-ethyl-3- ( 3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC) with a diamine linker between carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibers. Biotemplate CNF hydrogels were equilibrated in precursor palladium salt solutions , reduced with sodium borohydride , and rinsed with water followed by ethanol dehydration<symptom> , and supercritical drying to produce freestanding aerogels. Scanning electron microscopy indicated three-dimensional nanowire structures , and X-ray diffractometry confirmed palladium and palladium hydride phases. Gas adsorption , impedance spectroscopy , and cyclic voltammetry were correlated to determine aerogel surface area. These self-supporting CNF-palladium aerogels demonstrate a simple synthesis scheme to control porosity , electrical conductivity , and mechanical robustness for catalytic , sensing , and energy applications.
