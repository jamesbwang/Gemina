  In dicots , the key developmental process by which immature plastids differentiate into photosynthetically competent chloroplasts commences in the shoot apical meristem ( SAM) , within the shoot apex. Using laser-capture microdissection and single-cell RNA sequencing methodology , we studied the changes in the transcriptome along the chloroplast developmental pathway in the shoot apex of tomato seedlings. The analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for different chloroplast functions already in the stem cell-containing region of the SAM. Thereafter , an en masse up-regulation of genes encoding for various proteins occurs , including chloroplast ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in photosynthesis , photoprotection and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The results highlight transcriptional events that operate during chloroplast biogenesis , leading to the rapid establishment of photosynthetic competence.
