  The mechanical pressure of active fluids in which swimmers are modeled by soft run-and-tumble spheres is investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The incremental pressure ( Π) with respect to the system pressure with inactive swimmers comprises the direct contribution of the swimmers ( π) and the indirect contribution of fluids associated with hydrodynamic interactions ( HIs). The pressure can be determined from the bulk and confining wall and the former is always less than the latter. The π of dilute active dispersions is proportional to their active diffusivity while Π grows generally with propulsive force and run time. However , Π is always substantially less than π because of negative contributions to pressure by HIs. The wall pressure depends on the swimmer-wall interactions , verifying that pressure is not a state function for active spheres due to the HIs. Owing to the distinct flow patterns , Π varies with the swim-type ( pusher and puller) subject to the same run-and-tumble parameters at high concentrations.
