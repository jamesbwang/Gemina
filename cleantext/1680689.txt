  Clinical evidence indicates that drug resistance is a great obstacle in breast cancer therapy. It renders the disease uncontrollable and causes high mortality. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the development of drug resistance , but the underlying cause is usually a shift in the genetic composition of tumor cells. It is increasingly feasible to engineer the genome with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)/ associated ( Cas) 9 technology recently developed , which might be advantageous in overcoming drug resistance. This article discusses how the CRISPR/Cas9 system might revert resistance gene mutations and identify potential resistance targets in drug-resistant breast cancer. In addition , the challenges that impede the clinical applicability of this technology and highlight the CRISPR/Cas9 systems are presented. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is poised to play an important role in preventing drug resistance in breast cancer therapy and will become an essential tool for personalized medicine.
