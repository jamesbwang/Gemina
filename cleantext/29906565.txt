  Development of new antibiotics is costly and time-consuming and therefore it is highly attractive if the efficacy of conventional antibiotics can be expanded. For the human pathogen , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , we recently demonstrated that inactivation of the ATP synthase increases the susceptibility of the pathogen 16-fold to the aminoglycoside , gentamicin. Aminoglycosides are rarely used as monotherapy against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> due to the risk of resistance development and toxic effects. Here we have explored the possibility of enhancing the efficacy of aminoglycosides against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and other Gram-positive pathogens by inhibiting the ATP synthase with resveratrol , a polyphenolic ATP synthase inhibitor that is commonly used as a dietary supplement. We found that co-administration of sub-inhibitory concentrations of resveratrol increased the activity of aminoglycosides , including gentamicin , kanamycin , neomycin , streptomycin and tobramycin , up to 32-fold against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , while the effect was lower ( 2-4-fold reduction in MIC) for other Gram-positive pathogens , i.e. S.<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> , Enterococcus<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> and Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> The mechanism by which resveratrol increases aminoglycoside efficacy appears unrelated to membrane hyper-polarization and disruption of membrane integrity , which previously have been associated with increased aminoglycoside susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the ATP synthase increases the efficacy of aminoglycosides against important Gram-positive pathogens and the ATP synthase can be further explored as a target that may extend the clinical applicability of aminoglycosides.
