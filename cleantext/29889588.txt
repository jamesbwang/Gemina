  Extended distribution refers to the practice whereby people who inject drugs pass on sterile injecting equipment to their networks and can be a means to access people who inject drugs who do not attend state-sanctioned needle and syringe programs. While it is legal , to possess a sterile syringe for the purpose of injecting drugs in New South Wales , Australia , it is a criminal offence to pass this equipment on for others to use. In 2013 a pilot project was established to trial the authorization of `` extended '' peer distribution. This research describes patterns of distribution among attendees participating in this trial. A cross-sectional survey was conducted during one week in October 2014 of the trial with 200 clients. The survey focused on the extent , characteristics , and perceived risks and benefits of extended distribution practices within peer groups. Extended distribution is widespread , not in an organized or intentional manner but as a consequence of day-to-day drug using activities. The profiles of those who do and do not distribute were similar. Willingness to distribute small quantities of equipment to others was higher than willingness to distribute larger quantities , and willingness to distribute was related to perceived benefits of extended distribution. Police scrutiny was a key reason for not wanting to distribute. Extended peer distribution is widespread though mostly not organized. This study supports the evidence that drug users act responsibly to prevent harm and promote the use of sterile equipment among their peers.
