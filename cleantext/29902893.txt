  Chitinases , a glycosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes chitin to N-acetylglucosamine , are widely found in plant cells , and they are an important part of plant antifungal defense system. The function of a Panax notoginseng chitinase gene PnCHI1 was characterized in this paper. Expression vector of PnCHI1 was constructed and transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells , and laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated that PnCHI1 was localized in the cell wall. Prokaryotic expression vector of PnCHI1 was also constructed , and recombinant protein of PnCHI1 was induced and purified. In vitro antibacterial assay showed that recombinant PnCHI1 protein had strong inhibitory activity on the mycelium growth of Fusarium<pathogen> solani , F.<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> and F. verticillioide. The function of PnCHI1 was further verified by reverse genetics. PnCHI1 expression vector was transferred into tobacco by Agrobacterium<pathogen> tumefaciens<pathogen> and expression of PnCHI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR. It was found by leaf inoculation experiment that resistance of transgenic tobacco to F. solani was significantly increased. It is conclnded that: PnCHI1 is a chitinase localized in the cell wall , which inhibits several fungi<pathogen> which cause the root rot disease of P. notoginseng. Overexpression of this chitinase gene in tobacco greatly increased resistance to F. solani. PnCHI1 may be an important resistance gene in P. notoginseng that participates in the defense against root rot disease.
