  Adaptive immunity relies on the generation and maintenance of memory T cells to provide protection against repeated antigen exposure. It has been hypothesised that a self-renewing population of T cells , named stem cell-like memory T ( TSCM) cells , are responsible for maintaining memory. However , it is not clear if the dynamics of TSCM cells in vivo are compatible with this hypothesis. To address this issue , we investigated the dynamics of TSCM cells under physiological conditions in humans in vivo using a multidisciplinary approach that combines mathematical modelling , stable isotope labelling , telomere length analysis , and cross-sectional data from vaccine recipients. We show that , unexpectedly , the average longevity of a TSCM clone is very short ( half-life < 1 year , degree of self-renewal = 430 days): far too short to constitute a stem cell population. However , we also find that the TSCM population is comprised of at least 2 kinetically distinct subpopulations that turn over at different rates. Whilst one subpopulation is rapidly replaced ( half-life = 5 months) and explains the rapid average turnover of the bulk TSCM population , the half-life of the other TSCM subpopulation is approximately 9 years , consistent with the longevity of the recall response. We also show that this latter population exhibited a high degree of self-renewal , with a cell residing without dying or differentiating for 15 % of our lifetime. Finally , although small , the population was not subject to excessive stochasticity. We conclude that the majority of TSCM cells are not stem cell-like but that there is a subpopulation of TSCM cells whose dynamics are compatible with their putative role in the maintenance of T cell memory.
