  There is still an unmet need for xenotransplantation models that efficiently recapitulate normal and malignant human hematopoiesis. Indeed , there are a number of strategies to generate humanized mice and specific protocols , including techniques to optimize the cytokine environment of recipient mice and drug alternatives or complementary to the standard conditioning regimens , that can be significantly modulated. Unfortunately , the high costs related to the use of sophisticated mouse models may limit the application of these models to studies that require an extensive experimental design. Here , using an affordable and convenient method , we demonstrate that the administration of fludarabine ( Fludara
