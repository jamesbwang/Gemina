  Most existing models that are in use to model hepatic function through assessment of hepatic gadoxetic acid enhancement kinetics do not consider quantitative measures of gadoxetic excretion. We developed a model that allows a simultaneous quantitation of uptake and excretion of liver specific contrast agents. The aim was to improve the assessment of hepatic synthetic function , and provide quantitative measures of hepatic excretion function. Sixteen patients underwent dynamic T1-weighted turbo<pathogen> gradient echo imaging at 1.5 T prior and after bolus injection of gadoxetic acid at 0.1 ml/kg. DCE-images were obtained for 30 min after injection. A dual-inlet two-compartment model was then used to fit the measured liver signal values. Four tissue parameters ( extracellular volume fraction , arterial flow fraction , uptake rate and excretion half-time) were extracted for each liver segment. The proposed model provided a good fit to acquired data. Mean values for arterial flow fraction ( 0.08 + -0.04) , extracellular volume ( 0.20 ± 0.08) and uptake rate ( 4.02 ± 1.32/ 100 ml/min) were comparable to those obtained with the conventional model ( 0.08 ± 0.05 , 0.21 ± 0.12 , and 4.93 ± 1.74) , but exhibited significantly less variation and improved fit quality. The proposed model is more accurate than existing conventional models and provides an additional excretion parameter. • Models of hepatic contrast agent uptake can be extended to include excretion. • Including an additional excretion parameter improves accuracy of the model. • Standard diagnostic sequences can be extended to incorporate the model.
