  Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors which arise from adrenal medulla , and sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves , respectively. Hereditary cases afflicted by both or either pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas have been reported: these are called hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromes<disease> ( HPPS). Many cases of HPPS are caused by mutations of one of the succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH) genes; mainly SDHB and SDHD that encode subunits for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II. In this study , we investigated mutations of SDH genes in six HPPS patients from four Japanese pedigrees using peripheral blood lymphocytes ( from one patient with pheochromocytoma and five patients with neck paraganglioma) and tumor tissues ( from two patients with paraganglioma). Results showed that all of these pedigrees harbor germline mutations in one of the SDH genes. In two pedigrees , a novel IVS2-2A > C mutation in SDHB , at the acceptor-site in intron 2 , was found , and the tumor RNA of the patient clearly showed frameshift caused by exon skipping. Each of the remaining two pedigrees harbors a reported missense mutation , R242H in SDHB or G106D in SDHD. Importantly , all these mutations are heterozygous in constitutional DNAs , and two-hit mutations were evident in tumor DNAs. We thus conclude that the newly identified IVS2-2A > C mutation in SDHB is responsible for HPPS. The novel mutation revealed by our study may contribute to improvement of clinical management for patients with HPPS.
