  The development of a medical facility for boron neutron capture therapy at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics is under way. The neutron source is based on a tandem accelerator with vacuum insulation and lithium target. The proposed accelerator is conceived to deliver a proton beam around 10 mA at 2.3 MeV proton beam. To deliver a therapeutic beam for treatment of deep-seated tumors a typical Beam Shaping Assembly ( BSA) based on the source specifications has been explored. In this article , an optimized BSA based on the
