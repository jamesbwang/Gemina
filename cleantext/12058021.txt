  The coexistence of lipid domains with different degrees of lipid packing in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells has been postulated , but direct evidence has so far been challenging to obtain because of the small size and short lifetime of these domains in live cells. Here , we use fluorescence spectral correlation spectroscopy in conjunction with a probe sensitive to the membrane environment to quantify spectral fluctuations associated with dynamics of membrane domains in live cells. With this method , we show that membrane domains are present in live COS-7 cells and have a lifetime lower bound of 5.90 and 14.69 ms for the ordered and disordered phases , respectively. Comparisons to simulations indicate that the underlying mechanism of these fluctuations is complex but qualitatively described by a combination of dye diffusion between membrane domains as well as the motion of domains within the membrane.
