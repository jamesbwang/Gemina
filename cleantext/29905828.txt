  Chronic exposure to arsenic , a potent environmental oxidative stressor , is associated with the incidence of diabetes. However , the mechanisms for arsenite-induced reduction of insulin remain largely unclear. After CD1 mice were treated with 20 or 40 ppm arsenite in the drinking water for 12 months , the mice showed reduced fasting insulin levels , a depression<symptom> in glucose clearance , and lower insulin content in the pancreas. The levels of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS) in pancreatic β-cells isolated from arsenite-exposed mice were low compared to those for control mice. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that arsenite exposure resulted a reduction of insulin content in the pancreas of mice. Exposure of Min6 cells , a pancreatic beta cell line , to low levels of arsenite led to lower GSIS in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Since microRNAs ( miRNAs) are involved in pancreatic β-cell function and the pathogenesis of diabetes , we hypothesized that arsenite exposure activates miR-149 , decreases insulin transcription factor v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue A ( mafA) , and induces an insulin synthesis and secretion disorder. In arsenite-exposed Min6 cells , mafA activity was lowered by the increase of its target miRNA , miR-149. Luciferase assays illustrated an interaction between miR-149 and the mafA 3 ' untranslated region. In Min6 cells transfected with an miR-149 inhibitor , arsenite did not regulate GSIS and mafA expression. In control cells , however , arsenite decreased GSIS or mafA expression. Our results suggest that low levels of arsenite affect β-cell function and regulate insulin synthesis and secretion by modulating mafA expression through miR-149.
