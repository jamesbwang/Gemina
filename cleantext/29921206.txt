  Niosomes are surfactant-based vesicular nanosystems that proved their efficiency in transdermal delivery by overcoming skin inherent anatomic barrier; startum corneum. Central composite design is an efficient tool for developing and optimizing niosomal formulations using fewer experiments. The objective of this study was to prepare niosomes as a transdermal delivery system of diacerein using film hydration technique , employing central composite design , for avoiding its oral gastrointestinal problems. Three-level three-factor central composite design was employed for attaining optimal niosomes formulation with the desired characteristics. Three formulation variables were assessed: amount of salt in hydration medium ( X1) , lipid amount ( X2) and number of surfactant parts ( X3). DCN-loaded niosomes were evaluated for entrapment efficiency percent ( Y1) , particle size ( Y2) , polydispersity index ( Y3) and zeta potential ( Y4). The suggested optimal niosomes was subjected to further characterization and utilized as a nucleus for developing elastic vesicles for comparative ex vivo and in vivo studies. The values of the independent variables ( X1 , X2 and X3) in the optimal niosomes formulation were 0 g , 150 mg and 5 parts , respectively. It showed entrapment efficiency percent of 95.63 % , particle size of 436.65 nm , polydispersity index of 0.47 and zeta potential of -38.80 mV. Results of ex vivo permeation and skin deposition studies showed enhanced skin permeation and retention capacity of the prepared vesicles than drug suspension. Results revealed that a transdermal niosomal system was successfully prepared and evaluated using central composite design which will result in delivering diacerein efficiently , avoiding its oral problems.
