  In adult bone injuries , periosteum-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( MSCs) form bone via endochondral ossification ( EO) , whereas those from bone<disease> marrow ( BM)/ endosteum form bone primarily through intramembranous ossification ( IMO). We hypothesized that this phenomenon is influenced by the proximity of MSCs residing in the BM to the trabecular bone microenvironment. Herein , we investigated the impact of the bone mineral phase on human BM-derived MSCs ' choice of ossification pathway , using a biomimetic bone-like hydroxyapatite ( BBHAp) interface. BBHAp induced hyperstimulation of extracellular calcium-sensing receptor ( CaSR) and temporal down-regulation of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor ( PTH1R) , leading to inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs even in the presence of chondroinductive factors , such as transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1). Interestingly rescuing PTH1R expression using human PTH fragment ( 1-34) partially restored chondrogenesis in the BBHAp environment. In vivo studies in an ectopic site revealed that the BBHAp interface inhibits EO and strictly promotes IMO. Furthermore , CaSR knockdown ( CaSR KD) disrupted the bone-forming potential of MSCs irrespective of the absence or presence of the BBHAp interface. Our findings confirm the expression of CaSR in human BM-derived MSCs and unravel a prominent role for the interplay between CaSR and PTH1R in regulating MSC fate and the choice of pathway for bone formation.
