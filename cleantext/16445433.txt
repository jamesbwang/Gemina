  The purpose of this study is to compare the long-term outcomes of intravitreal bevacizumab ( IVB) with a combination therapy including IVB/intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide ( IVB/IVTA) in neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). This prospective , randomized clinical trial was conducted on 136 eyes of 136 patients with neovascular AMD. Eyes were randomly assigned to receive IVB alone ( 71 eyes) or in combination with IVTA ( 65 eyes). In the IVB group , three consecutive injections of 1.25 mg/0 .05 ml of bevacizumab were administered 1 month apart , whereas in the IVB/IVTA group , 4 mg/0 .05 mL of triamcinolone acetonide was added to bevacizumab in the first injection. Additional IVB injections were administered in eyes demonstrating active choroidal neovascularization. Best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) and optical coherence tomography were performed at baseline as well as at all follow-up visits. No differences were seen between the patients receiving IVB and those receiving IVB/IVTA in terms of baseline BCVA ( Our results suggest that the synergistic effect of intravitreal triamcinolone and IVB for treatment of neovascular AMD shows itself most apparently after 8 months of follow-up.
