  To discuss the value of Gemstone Spectrum Imaging ( GSI) CT anterior spinal artery angiography in the patients with cervical spinal cord injury , and to evaluate the correlation between the change of the blood flow of the anterior spinal artery and the postoperative recovery of nerve function. From January 2014 to June 2016 , thirty patients who underwent cervical open door laminoplasty for spinal cord injury were retrospective analyzed and included 21 males and 9 females with an average age of ( 46.4 ± 9.7) years old ranging from 33 to 59 years. Within 2 weeks after injury , open door laminoplasty was performed through cervical posterior approach. Among them , there were 8 cases of 3 segments of open door decompression , 18 cases of 4 segments , 4 cases of 5 segments. GSI CT were performed at 3 days before operation and 5 days after operation. The anterior spinal artery was reconstructed and evaluated the improvement of blood flow after operation. The cervical JOA score was calculated at 1 day before operation , 5 days after operation and 1 , 6 and 12 months after operation , and the JOA score improvement rate of the corresponding follow-up points was calculated. All patients were followed up for 12 to 30 months with an average of ( 17.4 ± 7.6) months. The iodine content ratio ( ASA/VA) of the anterior spinal artery before and after operation was 0.75 ± 0.20 and 0.89 ± 0.02 respectively , the postoperative improvement was significantly higher than that before operation ( GSI CT anterior spinal artery angiography is safe and feasible , the imaging is satisfactory , it can quantitatively evaluated the blood flow of the anterior spinal artery. There was a positive linear correlation between the improvement of blood flow in anterior spinal artery and the recovery of neurological function. Early postoperative improvement of blood flow in the anterior spinal artery can be used as a reference index for predicting the recovery of neurological function in patients.
