  Trichophyton<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> is one of the most common dermatophytes , which can cause fungal nail and ringworm infections. Infections associated with T.<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> have become a global phenomenon. Herein , we report the antifungal photodynamic inactivation of T.<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> ( ATCC 28188) using the mesoporous silica-coated silver nanoparticle-based hybrid photosensitizers without involving antifungal drugs. Results show that the hybrid photosensitizers display low cytotoxicity under the experimental conditions where significant killing ( ~ 3 orders of magnitude) against T.<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> is observed. These results demonstrate the potential applications of the nanoparticle-based hybrid photosensitizers in antifungal photodynamic therapy against
