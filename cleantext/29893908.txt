  The topological state of DNA in vivo is regulated by topoisomerases. Gyrase is a bacterial topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. According to the strand-passage mechanism , a double-strand of the DNA substrate is cleaved , and a second double-stranded segment is passed through the gap , converting a positive DNA node into a negative node. The correct orientation of these DNA segments for strand passage is achieved by wrapping of the DNA around gyrase , which involves the C-terminal domains ( CTDs) of both GyrA subunits in the A2B2 heterotetramer. Gyrase lacking both CTDs can not introduce negative supercoils into DNA. Here , we analyze the requirements for the two CTDs in individual steps in the supercoiling reaction. Gyrase that contains a single CTD binds , distorts , and cleaves DNA similarly to wildtype gyrase. It also shows wildtype-like DNA-dependent ATPase activity , and undergoes DNA-induced movement of the CTD as well as N-gate narrowing. Most importantly , the enzyme still introduces negative supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction , with a velocity similar to wildtype gyrase , and decreases the linking number of the DNA in steps of two. One CTD is thus sufficient to support DNA supercoiling.
