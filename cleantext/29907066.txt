  Monohydroxy alcohols with a large supramolecular Debye-type dielectric process often exhibit a significant decoupling between the Debye mode and the structural relaxation. Using shear rheology , a technique that is sensitive to both processes as well , the current work reveals a widely applicable correlation in terms of the dynamical onset and the viscosity enhancement of the supramolecular shear mode with respect to the structural relaxation. Rheological data from an array of about 50 oligomers , associating polymers , ( polymerized) ionic liquids , and aqueous solutions corroborate this correlation which thus appears to be generic to many classes of complex fluids.
