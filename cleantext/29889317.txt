  Hemophilia is associated with a high financial burden on individuals , healthcare systems , and society. The development of inhibitors significantly increases the socioeconomic burden of the diseases. This study aimed to review and describe the burden of hemophilia with inhibitors , providing a reference scenario to assess the impact of new products in the real word. Two systematic literature reviews were performed to collect data on ( i) health economics and ( ii) health-related quality of life evidences in hemophilic patients with inhibitors. The costs associated with patients with hemophilia and inhibitors are more than 3 times greater than the costs incurred in those without inhibitors , with an annual cost per patient that can be higher than $ 1 000 000. The costs of bypassing agents account for the large majority of the total healthcare direct costs for hemophilia treatment. The quality of life is more compromised in patients with hemophilia and inhibitors compared to those without inhibitors , in particular the physical domains , whereas mental domains were comparable to that of the general population. The development of an inhibitor has a high impact on costs and quality of life. New treatments have the potential to change positively the management and socioeconomic burden of hemophilia with inhibitors.
