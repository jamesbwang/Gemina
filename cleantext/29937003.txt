  Surgery for anorectal diseases is thought to cause significant pain postoperatively. There is little known regarding standardized opioid-prescribing trends and patient use following surgery for anorectal diseases. We aimed to evaluate and analyze opioid-prescribing trends and patient use for outpatient anorectal operations. All patients who underwent outpatient anorectal surgery performed over a 1-y period at a single institution were eligible. Procedures included hemorrhoidectomy , anal fistula<disease> repair/seton , anal fissure treatment with sphincterotomy , and transanal excision of rectal tumors. Demographic , operative , and postoperative data were obtained. Patients were given a survey to determine postoperative pain control with opioid and non-narcotic analgesia use; respondents were included in analysis. Forty-two outpatient anorectal surgery patients were included: 13 had hemorrhoidectomy , 22 had anal fistula<disease> repair/seton , one had sphincterotomy , and six had transanal excisions. All patients had multimodality treatment with either an anal block and/or postoperative nonopioid analgesics. Ninety percent were prescribed opioids postoperatively with a median of 20 pills ( range: 0-120 pills). Forty-three percent ( 18/42) did not fill their prescription. For those who used opioids , the median number of pills taken was four. Eighty percent of pills prescribed were not used. One patient required a refill. Greater than 60 % of respondents reported good to excellent pain control on a five-point scale. Most patients had adequate pain control after anorectal surgery with little to no use of opioids and that more than 80 % of opioid pills prescribed were not consumed. We intend to standardize our prescribing opioid quantities for outpatient anorectal operations to reflect this reduced use.
