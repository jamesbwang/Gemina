  Molecular organization of electron-deficient aromatic systems like perylenediimides ( PDI) is extremely appealing , as they are potential candidates for organic electronics. The performance of these molecules in such applications primarily depends on the self-organization of the molecules. However , any correlation between the morphology of these self-assembled semiconducting molecules and their electrical performances has not yet been formulated. Herein , for the first time , we have made an effort to find such a correlation by studying the self-assembly , morphology , and their conducting properties for a peptide-PDI conjugate. The PDI conjugate formed fiber-like morphology in relatively nonpolar solvents ( THF and CHCl
