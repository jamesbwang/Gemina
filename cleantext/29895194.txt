  Small RNAs play an important role in gene regulatory networks. The gene suppressive effect of small RNAs was previously the dominant focus of studies , but during the recent decade , small RNA-induced gene activation has been reported and has become a notable gene manipulation technique. In this study , a putative tumor suppressor , INTS6 , was activated by introducing a promoter-targeted small RNA ( dsRNA-915) into castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) cells. Unique dynamics associated with the gene upregulation phenomenon was observed. Following gene activation , cell proliferation and motility were suppressed in vitro. Downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was observed during the activation period , and the impairment of β-catenin degradation reversed the tumor suppressor effects of INTS6. These results suggest the potential application of small activating RNAs in targeted gene therapy for CRPC.
