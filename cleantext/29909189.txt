  Atomic-resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM) has recently been shown to be a powerful approach to investigate local chemistry of nanoscale structures quantitatively. While most of the studies have been focused on the quantification of the chemical composition in bulk crystals , few were discussed on interfaces. In this study , we theoretically explored the applicability of STEM EDS for the quantification of local chemistry in grain boundaries ( GBs) , where the electron channeling can be dramatically changed compared with the bulk due to non-periodic atomic arrangement. We find that: ( 1) line scan analysis across the GBs or mapping analysis , which have been widely used for interface analysis , sometimes leads to misinterpretation of true interface chemistry. ( 2) Tilting the specimen , which is effective to reduce the effects of scattering , is not always useful for the quantification of GBs. ( 3) EDS analysis covering the whole GB structure unit , such as using a box scan , can provide true chemical information. Our study provides useful insights into characterization of interface chemistry using STEM EDS.
