  RNA metabolism impacts different steps of mRNA life cycle including splicing , polyadenylation , nucleo-cytoplasmic export , translation , and decay. Growing evidence indicates that defects in any of these steps lead to devastating diseases in humans. This chapter reviews the various RNA metabolic mechanisms that are disrupted in Myotonic Dystrophy-a trinucleotide repeat expansion disease-due to dysregulation of RNA-Binding Proteins. We also compare Myotonic Dystrophy to other microsatellite expansion disorders and describe how some of these mechanisms commonly exert direct versus indirect effects toward disease pathologies.
