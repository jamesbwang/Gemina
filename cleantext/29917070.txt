  To evaluate safety and efficacy for 3 additional years of subcutaneous golimumab maintenance in patients with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis<disease>. The PURSUIT-maintenance long-term extension enrolled patients who had completed placebo or golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg treatment q4w through Week 52 and evaluations at Week 54 ( n = 666); treatment continued through Week 212. Patients receiving placebo were discontinued after study unblinding. Efficacy endpoints , golimumab concentrations , and antidrug antibodies were summarized as observed for golimumabinduction responders who continued golimumab therapy during long-term extension. Safety was summarized for all treated patients. Overall , 63 % of patients who were receiving golimumab at the beginning of the extension remained on treatment through the end of the study. Among all treated patients in the extension , rates of adverse events of special interest ( eg , tuberculosis<disease> , demyelination , and malignancy) were infrequent. Nine deaths occurred during the extension ( 1 placebo , 1 golimumab 50 mg , and 7 golimumab 100 mg). Serum golimumab concentrations were dose-proportional and maintained over time. During the extension through Week 228 , antidrug antibody rates with golimumab 50 mg and 100 mg were 4.4 % and 3.7 % , respectively. Among golimumab-induction responders , 99.3 % had no disease or mild disease activity per the Physician 's Global Assessment , 92.5 % were corticosteroid-free , and 76.1 % had an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores â‰¥ 170 at Week 216. Subcutaneous golimumab treatment of moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis<disease> for up to 3 additional years during the extension maintained clinical benefit with no new safety signals observed.
