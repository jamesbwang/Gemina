  The increased risk of falls associated with advancing age has increased demand for methods to improve balance<symptom> and mobility. The primary purpose of the study was to determine whether wearing Aqua Titan-treated stockings could improve balance<symptom> and walking performance in an older population; secondary was to elucidate the mechanisms. In a randomized , double-blind crossover , 16 healthy older adults ( age , 67.9 ± 4.2 years; BMI , 24.8 ± 3.1 kg/m ²) performed two 4-day trials composed of baseline measures and fatiguing exercise on Day 1 , with recovery measures at 14 , 38 and 62 h post-exercise , wearing Aqua Titan and control stockings. Balance<symptom> , walking performance , triceps surae stretch reflex , ankle range of motion and gastrocnemius muscle microvascular perfusion , blood flow and oxygen consumption were measured at baseline and during recovery. Aqua Titan had no effect on the microvascular parameters , but increased total ankle range of motion at 38 h ( 2.4 & deg;; 95 % CI ± 1.8 & deg ;-RRB- and 62 h ( 2.7 & deg;; ± 1.7 & deg ;-RRB- , contributed to by increases in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. There was decreasing persistence in the medial-lateral center of pressure movement at 38 h ( q = 0 , & minus; 0.0635 ± 0.0455) , compared to control stockings. Aqua Titan garments hold potential for improving balance<symptom> and mobility in older adults in the days following a bout of fatiguing exercise. The proposed mechanisms associated with enhanced sensory feedback require further exploration.
