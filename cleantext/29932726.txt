  The tiny droplets of quark gluon plasma ( QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions experience fast expansion and cooling with a lifetime of a few fm/c. Despite the information provided by probes such as jet quenching and quarkonium suppression , and the excellent description by hydrodynamical models , direct access to the time evolution of the system remains elusive. We point out that the study of hadronically decaying W bosons , notably in events with a top-antitop quark pair , can provide key novel insight into the time structure of the QGP. This is because of a unique feature , namely a time delay between the moment of the collision and that when the W-boson decay products start interacting with the medium. Furthermore , the length of the time delay can be constrained by selecting specific reconstructed top-quark momenta. We carry out a Monte Carlo feasibility study and find that the LHC has the potential to bring first limited information on the time structure of the QGP. Substantially increased LHC heavy-ion luminosities or future higher-energy colliders would open opportunities for more extensive studies.
