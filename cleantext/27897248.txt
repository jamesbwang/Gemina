  The metabolic profiles of tobacco leaves of two differential Chinese cultivars from different growing regions were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). The results of principal component analysis , partial least-squares discriminant analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis showed significant differences in metabolome among three groups , identified 24 differential metabolites , and analysed the metabolic pathway in which the metabolites were involved. Among them , 13 metabolites were associated with geographical regions , including seven organic and fatty acids , four carbohydrates and two secondary metabolites. Four amino acids and two monosaccharides were associated with cultivars and the remaining five metabolites were associated with both. The relationships among the differential metabolites and the distinct characteristics of environment and cultivar were further discussed. In addition , correlation analysis indicated that most of the differential carbohydrates were negatively correlated with the differential amino acids and organic acids. Taken together , this study demonstrates the metabolite differences between two cultivars in different regions , and highlights the effect of environment and cultivar on tobacco leaf metabolism.
