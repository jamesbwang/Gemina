  To report the long-term clinical outcomes of a patient with Terrien 's marginal degeneration who underwent successful peripheral corneal cross-linking ( CXL) to arrest progression. Clinical assessment included uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA) , corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA) , corneal topography , anterior segment optical coherence tomography , ultrasonic pachymetry , corneal hysteresis , and corneal resistance factor. Eccentric epithelium-off CXL was performed in both eyes after limbal conjunctival resection. Following the Dresden protocol , fluence irradiation was set at 5.4 J/cm Nine years of postoperative follow-up showed significant bilateral improvement in visual acuity , refraction , and corneal topography with no signs of progression of Terrien 's marginal degeneration. In the right eye , UDVA improved from 0.05 to 0.3 decimal and CDVA from 0.8 to 1.2 decimal , cylinder was reduced from -14.00 to -3.00 diopters ( D) , simulated keratometry improved from 10.50 to 3.70 D , and the thinnest point on pachymetry remained almost unchanged ( from 483 to 469 μm). In the left eye , UDVA improved from 0.1 to 0.2 decimal and CDVA remained unchanged at 1.2 decimal , cylinder was reduced from -6.00 to -2.75 D , simulated keratometry improved from 5.60 to 3.30 D , and the thinnest point on pachymetry remained stable at 486 μm. Eccentric peripheral CXL can be a safe , noninvasive alternative therapeutic approach for the management of Terrien 's marginal degeneration with peripheral thinning.
