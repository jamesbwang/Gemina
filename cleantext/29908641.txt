  In mammals , the placenta is an organ that is required to maintain the development of fetus during pregnancy. Although the proper formation of placenta is in part regulated by the post-translational modifications of proteins , little is known regarding protein arginine methylation during placental development. Here , we characterized developmental expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 ( PRMT1) in mouse placentas. Expression levels of PRMT1 mRNA and protein in placentas were investigated using the real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot , respectively. Next , the localization of PRMT1 was determined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. In addition , the levels of methylarginines of placental proteins were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS). PRMT1 mRNA and its protein were expressed at highest levels in mid-gestation stages , and their expression showed stepwise decrease in the late gestation. At embryonic ( E) day 9 , PRMT1 was observed in several different trophoblast cell ( TC) subtypes. Furthermore , PRMT1 was mainly expressed in the labyrinth zone of TCs at E13. Finally , total methylarginines of proteins were significantly reduced in late gestation of placentas compared with mid-gestation stages. In this study , we found developmental changes in the placental expression of PRMT1 and in protein arginine methylation status during pregnancy. These findings provide fundamental information regarding placental PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation during the development.
