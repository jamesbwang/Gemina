  Targeting glucose metabolism is a promising way to interfere with tumor cell proliferation and survival. However , controversy exists about the specificity of some glucose metabolism targeting anticancer drugs. Especially the potency of STF-31 has been debated. Here , we aimed to assess the impact of the glucose transporter ( GLUT) inhibitors fasentin and WZB117 , and the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ( NAMPT) inhibitors GMX1778 and STF-31 on tumor cell proliferation and survival , as well as on glucose uptake. Tumor-derived A172 ( glioblastoma) , BHY ( oral squamous cell carcinoma) , HeLa ( cervix adenocarcinoma) , HN ( head<disease> neck cancer) , HT-29 ( colon carcinoma) and MG-63 ( osteosarcoma) cells were treated with fasentin , WZB117 , GMX1778 and STF-31. Proliferation rates and cell viabilities were assessed using XTT , crystal violet and LDH assays. mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 and NAPRT were assessed using qPCR and Western blotting , respectively. The effects of inhibiting compounds on glucose uptake were measured using ( Stimulation of tumor-derived cells with the different inhibitors tested revealed a complex pattern , whereby proliferation inhibiting and survival reducing concentrations varied in ( Our data reveal a dual mode of action of STF-31 , serving either as a NAMPT or as a GLUT inhibitor , whereby the latter seems to be apparent only at higher STF-31 concentrations. The molecular basis of such a dual function and its appearance in compounds previously designated as NAMPT-specific inhibitors requires further investigation.
