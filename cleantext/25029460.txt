  An opportune early diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) would help to overcome symptoms and improve the quality of life for AD patients. Research studies have identified early manifestations of AD that occur years before the diagnosis. For instance , eye movements<symptom> of people with AD in different tasks differ from eye movements<symptom> of control subjects. In this review , we present a summary and evolution of research approaches that use eye tracking technology and computational analysis to measure and compare eye movements<symptom> under different tasks and experiments. Furthermore , this review is targeted to the feasibility of pioneer work on developing computational tools and techniques to analyze eye movements<symptom> under naturalistic scenarios. We describe the progress in technology that can enhance the analysis of eye movements<symptom> everywhere while subjects perform their daily activities and give future research directions to develop tools to support early AD diagnosis through analysis of eye
