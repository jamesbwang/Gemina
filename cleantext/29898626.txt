  Obesity is a low-grade sustained inflammatory state that causes oxidative stress in different metabolic tissues , which leads to insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). Particularly , obesity-induced metabolic endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflammation<symptom>. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant signaling that serves as a primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Pharmacological stimulation of Nrf2 mitigates obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however , Nrf2 activators are not clinically available due to biosafety concerns. A recent study demonstrated that glucoraphanin , a precursor of the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane , ameliorates obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue , and attenuates obesity-related inflammation<symptom> and insulin resistance by polarizing M2 macrophages and reducing metabolic endotoxemia. Thus , this review focuses on the efficiency and safety of glucoraphanin in alleviating obesity , insulin resistance , and NAFLD.
