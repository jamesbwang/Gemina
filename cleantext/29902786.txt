  To evaluate possible increases in bone conduction ( BC) hearing thresholds in patients undergoing subtotal petrosectomy ( SP) with fat obliteration and blind sac closure of the outer ear canal and subsequent round window vibroplasty. Between 1997 and 2013 , 43 patients ( 45 ears<disease>) with combined hearing loss and recurrent chronic<disease> otitis<disease> or status post formation of a radical cavity underwent SP around 6 months prior to implantation of a Vibrant SoundbridgeTM. Pure tone audiograms ( 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 kHz) prior to SP , after SP , prior to implantation , after implantation , and at first fitting around 5 weeks after implantation were collected and statistically analyzed. The comparison between BC thresholds before SP and at first fitting showed an overall decline during the two-step procedure between 2.8 and 6 dB that was significant ( p < 0.05 , Student t test) at 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 kHz. In some cases , SP is the only way to eradicate chronic<disease> otitis<disease> and to achieve a suitable environment for the implantation of active middle ear implants. The present data demonstrate a relatively small but significant decline in BC thresholds throughout the whole procedure. Knowledge of its extent is mandatory for a correct indication for later implantation of a Vibrant SoundbridgeTM.
