  Breast cancer ( BC) poses a tremendous threat to the health of women worldwide , especially triple-negative breast cancers ( TNBCs). Currently , the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) has been recognized in more and more people worldwide; however , the specific effect has not been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this cohort study is to evaluate the clinical effects of TCM syndrome<disease> differentiation on recurrence and metastasis rate , survival rate , and the quality of life in patients with TNBC. This study is a multicenter observational cohort trial taking 2 years. A total of 620 patients will be allocated at a ratio of 1:1 to receive TCM or not. The primary outcomes are progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) , which are calculated at the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes include TCM symptoms , Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS) , ECOG score , European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC) Breast-Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-BR23) , as well as clinical indicators including tumor markers , immune function evaluation , chest computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging , and abdominal B-ultrasound. Assessments will be performed at baseline and 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 16 , and 20 weeks after observation. This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the PFS and OS in TNBC patients receiving TCM , which may be used to assess the feasibility of a larger-scale clinical trial in the future , and formulate a standardized TCM treatment plan.
