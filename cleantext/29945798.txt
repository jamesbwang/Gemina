  Elucidate the influence of debonding on stress distribution and maximum stresses for intra-radicular restorations. Five intra-radicular restorations were analyzed by finite element analysis ( FEA): MP = metallic cast post core; GP = glass fiber post core; PP = pre-fabricated metallic post core; RE = resin endocrowns; CE = single piece ceramic endocrown. Two cervical preparations were considered: no ferule ( f The Ïƒ FEA most closely predicted failure performance of intra-radicular posts when frictional contact was modeled. Results of analyses where all interfaces are assumed to be perfectly bonded should be considered with caution.
