  Pulmonary hypertension ( PH) due to left heart disease ( LHD) is a common condition associated with significant morbidity. It contributes to the elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary pressure , eventually leading to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and even mortality. The present study aimed to explore the potential efficacy of late and long‑term treatment with a Rho‑kinase ( ROCK) signaling inhibitor , namely fasudil , in a rat model of end‑stage PH‑LHD. The PH‑LHD model was established by supracoronary aortic banding , and the effect of fasudil treatment on the progression of PH‑LHD was monitored. After 9 weeks ( 63 days) of supracoronary aortic banding , a significant increase in mean pulmonary pressure and RV systolic pressure was observed in the rats , associated with increased RhoA/ROCK activity in the lungs. Therapy with fasudil ( 30 mg/kg/day , intraperitoneal) for 4 weeks from postoperative day 35 reversed the hemodynamic disorder and prevented pulmonary vascular remodeling in rats with PH‑LHD. In addition , the blockade of ROCK signaling by fasudil decreased the protein levels of endothelin‑1 ( ET‑1) and the mRNA expression levels of endothelin A receptor and promoted the production of nitric oxide ( NO) in rats with PH‑LHD. Furthermore , fasudil inhibited the migration of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells induced by ET‑1. Therefore , this late , long‑term blockade of the ROCK pathway by fasudil may be a promising strategy to reverse hemodynamic dysfunction and impede the development of end‑stage PH‑LHD in patients.
