  This research aimed to determine changes to some micromorphological characteristics of certain landscape plants grown in areas with different dominant climate types. Leaf samples were collected from eight woody plant species in areas with terrestrial , Black Sea , and Mediterranean climate types in Turkey. Then , scaled images of the collected leaf samples were obtained using SEM. StomaLength , StomaWidth , PoreLength , PoreWidth , and StomaDensity were determined using measurements made on the images. Data were statistically evaluated , and the changes to these characteristics by climate type and species were determined. The results show that the lowest values were for plants grown in the terrestrial climate , while the highest values were for plants grown in the Mediterranean climate for all characteristics except SDEN. For SDEN , the lowest value was for plants grown in the Mediterranean climate , while the highest value was obtained for plants grown in the terrestrial climate.
