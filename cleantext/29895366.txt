  Neonatal TSH screening is effective in detecting congenital hypothyroidism and estimating iodine status in a given population , but various factors influence TSH levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal and neonatal factors on neonatal TSH levels. Data were obtained from an ongoing prospective cohort study. A total of 988 pregnant women and their newborn infants participated in the study from April 2015 to May 2017 at Tianjin Maternal and Child Health Center and Tanggu Maternity Hospital in Tianjin , China. Maternal demographic information , including age , height , and parity , was recorded by questionnaire. Fasting blood and urinary samples were collected from all pregnant women. After parturition , information on gestation duration , mode of delivery , neonatal sex , neonatal TSH , neonatal birth weight , and neonatal birth height were recorded. Maternal age , maternal BMI , gestation duration , parity , and neonatal birth weight and height were significantly correlated with neonatal TSH ( p < 0.05). Quantile regression revealed that maternal age , TSH , FT Neonatal TSH levels are dynamic and may be affected by several maternal and neonatal factors including maternal age , TSH , FT
