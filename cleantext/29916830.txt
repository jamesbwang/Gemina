  Approximately one in 10 children in foster care are medically complex and require intensive medical supervision , frequent hospitalization , and difficult medical decision making. Some of these children are in foster care because their parents can not care for their medical needs; other parents are responsible for their child 's medical needs due to abuse or neglect. In either case , there can be uncertainty about the role that a child 's biological parents should play in making serious medical decisions. Here we highlight some of the ethical challenges inherent in making these decisions for children in foster care , as seen through the lenses of a child welfare provider , an inpatient care physician , and a primary care pediatrician.
