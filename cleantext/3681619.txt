  Pectus excavatum is a chest wall deformity that results in caved-in or sunken appearance of lower half of anterior chest. Surgical treatment is favored when functional or cosmetic concerns arise. We present a case and series of six patients ( mean haller index: 4.28) who had repair with minimal pleural disruption and sternal plate. After a broad bilateral inframammary skin incision , the anterior aspect of sternum is identified and incised. Next , the surgeon hyperextends and fixates the bone in its desired position by applying manual dorsal pressure through a small intercostal incision. Superior and inferior fasciocutaneous flaps are raised and then advanced to reconstruct the soft tissue defect. All patients had durable repair of the chest wall abnormalities and they had minimal pain during the postoperative period. No analgesia medication was necessary 1 month post-operatively. This may provide significantly less pain compared to the Nuss or Ravitch procedures to fix Pectus excavatum.
