  The ductus venosus agenesis ( DVA) is a rare condition with a variable prognosis that relies partly on the presence of associated conditions. The purpose of our study was to analyze the literature regarding the post-natal outcome of fetuses with DVA associated with fetal malformations , in order to discuss the best management options for couples. We performed a systematic review of the literature of MEDLINE and SCOPUS electronic databases in a 25-year period from 1992 to September 2017. We found 340 cases of DVA associated with fetal abnormalities. The most common chromosomal abnormalities were: monosomy X ( 12/48 , 25 %) , trisomy 21 ( 11/48 , 22.9 %) and trisomy 18 ( 6/48 , 12.5 %). From the 340 cases with DVA , in 31 cases the umbilical venous shunt type was not reported. Of the fetuses , 60.8 % ( 188/309) had an extrahepatic umbilical venous drainage while 39.2 % ( 121/309) presented an intrahepatic connection. The DVA was associated in 71 cases ( 23.0 %) with cardiac abnormalities , in 82 cases ( 26.5 %) with extracardiac abnormalities and in 85 cases ( 27.5 %) with both cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities. DVA associated with both cardiac and extracardiac malformations may confer a poorer fetal outcome , a clinically relevant fact that should clarify what can be expected from this entity and help prenatal counseling.
