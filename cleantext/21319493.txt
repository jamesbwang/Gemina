  Serotonin 2C receptors ( 5HT2C) are involved in serotonin-driven dynamic equilibrium adjustments responsible for homeostatic stability in brain structures that modulate behavior and emotions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) from the serotonin 2C receptor gene ( HTR2C) have been associated with several neurological and mental disorders , including abnormalities in cognitive and emotional processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the rs6318 SNP of the HTR2C gene and behavioral characteristics exhibited by children and adolescents based on the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL/6 -18) inventory. Eighty-five psychiatric outpatients between 8 and 18 years of age underwent genotyping of the rs6318 SNP. The CBCL/6 -18 scale was administered to their caregivers. The chi-squared test was used to assess differences in the frequency of C and G alleles of the rs6318 SNP relative to the grouped CBCL/6 -18 scores; significance level was 5 %. The presence of the G allele of rs6318 was found to be associated with characteristics of aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> and social problems , and aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> was found to be associated with heterozygosis in females. These findings contribute to the identification of mental and behavioral phenotypes associated with gene expression.
