  Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH) , the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GTP biosynthesis , plays an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation. It has been demonstrated that IMPDH can aggregate into a macrostructure , termed the cytoophidium , in mammalian cells under a variety of conditions. However , the regulation and function of the cytoophidium are still elusive. In this study , we report that spontaneous filamentation of IMPDH is correlated with rapid cell proliferation. Intracellular IMP accumulation promoted cytoophidium assembly , whereas elevated GTP level triggered disassociation of aggregates. By using IMPDH2 CBS domain mutant cell models , which are unable to form the cytoophidium , we have determined that the cytoophidium is of the utmost importance for maintaining the GTP pool and normal cell proliferation in the condition that higher IMPDH activity is required. Together , our results suggest a novel mechanism whereby cytoophidium assembly upregulates IMPDH activity and mediates guanine nucleotide homeostasis.
