  To characterize multidrug-resistant tuberculosis<disease> ( MDR-TB) patients treated in a low endemic area in France and to determine risk factors for resistance. We also analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) treatment. Between 2002-2013 , all MDR-TB patients diagnosed in western France ( hospitals belonging to the GERICCO group) were retrospectively included , with a follow-up period running until 2016. A case-control study ( 1:2) , matched according to age , sex , and year of diagnosis , was performed to assess socio-demographic and clinical data , treatment strategies , and outcomes for the MDR-TB patients and controls treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis<disease> during the same period. Of 134 TB patients , 44 were MDR-TB and 90 were drug-susceptible TB. Of the 44 MDR-TB patients ( 35 MDR and nine extensively drug-resistant ( XDR)) , 33 ( 75 %) were males; the median age was 33 years; and 27 ( 61 %) were born in Eastern Europe. Prior treatment failure was more frequently reported for XDR-TB ( 8/9) in Georgian patients. In multivariate analysis , risk contacts and prior TB history were associated with MDR-TB. Treatment failure was associated with MDR/XDR-TB and miliary TB. In western France , MDR-TB more frequently occurred in recent migrants from high-risk countries with a previous history of at-risk contact with other MDR-TB patients or previous TB treatment failure.
