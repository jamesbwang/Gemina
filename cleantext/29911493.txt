  To provide normative data for the Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale , 3rd edition ( WAIS-III) in a population-based sample of community-dwelling older adults in Germany according to age , sex , and level of education. The sample comprised 1385 participants aged 65-79 years from the nationwide representative ` German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults ' ( DEGS1 , 2008-2011). Participants with known cognitive impairment or dementia , other medical conditions affecting cognition , or currently using psychotropic drugs were excluded. Educational level was categorized as low , medium , and high according to the Comparative Analyses of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations ( CASMIN) scale. Normative values for the DSST according to age , sex , and level of education were estimated by multiple linear regression using population weights. Mean age was 71.1 years , 48.6 % were men and low , medium , and high education levels were 62.8 , 24.6 , and 12.6 % , respectively. Younger age , female sex , and higher level of education were significantly associated with higher DSST scores. Regression-based normative data for the DSST is provided according to age , sex , and level of education. In addition , a normative score calculator is provided. These are the first age- , sex- , and education-specific normative data for older individuals for the DSST of the WAIS-III in Germany. These normative data will enable future population-level analyses on impaired cognitive function according to DSST.
