  In the present study , we investigated whether salience determines the sequence of selection when participants search for two equally relevant visual targets. To do this , attentional selection was tracked overtly as observers inspected two items of differing physical salience: one a highly salient color singleton , and the other a less salient shape singleton. Participants were instructed to make natural eye movements<symptom> in order to determine whether two line segments contained within the two singletons were oriented in the same or in different directions. Because both singleton items were task-relevant , participants had no reason to inspect one item before the other. As expected , observers fixated both targets on the majority of trials. Critically , saccades to the color singleton preceded saccades to the less salient shape singleton on the majority of trials. This demonstrates that the order of attentional object selection is largely determined by stimulus salience when task relevance is equated.
