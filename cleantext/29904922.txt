  Sideroxylin is a C-methylated flavone isolated from Callistemon lanceolatus and exerts antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> However , the anticancer effects of sideroxylin and its intracellular signaling mechanisms have not yet been identified. Results of our study showed that sideroxylin decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis , causing DNA fragmentation , depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane , the generation of reactive oxygen species , and an increase of lipid peroxidation in ovarian cancer cells ( ES2 and OV90 cells). Additionally , sideroxylin activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , JNK , P38 , and MAPK proteins and the use of LY294002 , U0126 , SB203580 , and SP600125 to block their phosphorylation , respectively , in ES2 and OV90 cells. Collectively , the results of present study indicated that sideroxylin was a novel therapeutic agent to combat the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells through the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of PI3 K and MAPK signal transduction.
