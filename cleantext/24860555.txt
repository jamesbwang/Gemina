  Characterizing protein kinase substrate specificity motifs represents a powerful step in elucidating kinase-signaling cascades. The protocol described here uses a bacterial system to evaluate kinase specificity motifs in vivo , without the need for radioactive ATP. The human kinase of interest is cloned into a heterologous bacterial expression vector and allowed to phosphorylate E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> proteins in vivo , consistent with its endogenous substrate preferences. The cells are lysed , and the bacterial proteins are digested into peptides and phosphoenriched using bulk TiO
