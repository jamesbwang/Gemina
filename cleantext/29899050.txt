  The incidence of depression<symptom> is high during the perinatal period. This mood disorder can have a significant impact on the mother , the child and the family. To examine the effect of an exercise programme during pregnancy on the risk of perinatal depression<symptom> Healthy women who were < 16 weeks pregnant were randomly assigned to two different groups. Women in the intervention group participated in a 60 min exercise programme throughout pregnancy , 3 days per week , which was conducted from October 2014 to December 2016. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale was used to measure the risk of depression<symptom> at the beginning of the study ( 12-16 weeks) , at gestational week 38 and at 6 weeks postpartum. One hundred and twenty-four pregnant women were allocated to either the intervention ( IG = 70) or the control ( CG = 54) group. No differences were found in the percentage of depressed women at baseline ( 20 % vs 18.5 %) ( χ2 = 0.043; p = 0.836). A smaller percentage of depressed women were identified in the IG compared with the CG at 38 gestational weeks ( 18.6 % vs 35.6 %) ( χ2 = 4.190; p = 0.041) and at 6 weeks postpartum ( 14.5 % vs 29.8 %) ( χ2 = 3.985; p = 0.046) using the per-protocol analysis. No significant differences were found using the intention-to-treat analyses , except in the multiple imputation analysis at week 38 ( 18.6 % vs 34.4 %) ( χ2 = 4.085; p = 0.049). An exercise programme performed during pregnancy may reduce the prevalence of depression<symptom> in late pregnancy and postpartum. NCT02420288; Results.
