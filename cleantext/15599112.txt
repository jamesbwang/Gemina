  The present study was aimed to estimate deltamethrin residues in cow 's and goat 's environment over a certain period of time post-application , to identify the role of both feed and water as a source of pesticides , and to conduct some trials to reduce their levels in milk. A total of 80 water and feed samples ( 40 of each) and 120 milk samples ( 80 cow 's milk and 40 goat 's milk) were collected. Fresh milk samples were collected directly from the udder as well as from feed and water before application and 1 Deltamethrin residues were detected after its application in both water and feed at different levels up to the first 3 days and in all cow 's and goat 's milk samples at 35 Microwaving of milk is an effective method to decline deltamethrin concentration in milk.
