  The function of jealous behaviour is to facilitate the maintenance of an important social relationship that is threatened by a third-party , a rival individual. Although jealous behaviour has an important function in gregarious species , it has been investigated almost exclusively in humans. Based on functional similarity between dog-owner and mother-infant attachments , we hypothesised that jealous behaviour can be evoked in dogs , similarly to children. In our study owners focused their attention solely on the test partner , while they ignored their dog. We deployed familiar and unfamiliar dogs as social test partners , and familiar and unfamiliar objects as non-social test partners; all subjects encountered all test partners. Dogs showed more jealous behaviour , i.e. owner-oriented behaviour and attempts to separate the owner and test partner in case of social compared to non-social test partners. Results suggest that jealous behaviour emerges in dogs , and it is functionally similar to that in children observed in similar situations. Alternative explanations like territoriality , dominance rank can be excluded.
