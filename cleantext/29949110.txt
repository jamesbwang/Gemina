  Aerobic exercise reduces blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , but it is unknown whether a high-intensity training approach can elicit a greater BP reduction in populations with elevated BP. This systematic review compared the efficacy of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT) versus moderate-intensity continuous training ( MICT) for reducing BP in adults with pre- to established hypertension. Five electronic databases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , CENTRAL , PEDro , and SPORTDiscus) were searched for randomized trials comparing the chronic effects of HIIT versus MICT on BP in individuals with resting systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg and/or under antihypertensive medication. Random-effects modelling was used to compare changes from pre- to post-intervention in resting and ambulatory BP between HIIT and MICT. Changes from pre- to post-intervention in maximal oxygen uptake ( ( Formula: see text) O Ambulatory BP was excluded from the meta-analysis due to the limited number of studies ( two studies). Comparing changes from pre- to post-intervention , no differences in resting systolic BP ( MD- 0.22 mmHg ( CI 95 % ,- 5.36 to 4.92) , p = 0.93 , I HIIT and MICT provided comparable reductions in resting BP in adults with pre- to established hypertension. HIIT was associated with greater improvements in ( Formula: see text) O PROSPERO registration ( 2016: CRD42016041885).
