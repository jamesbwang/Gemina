  Clinic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) is recognized as the gold standard for the screening , diagnosis , and management of hypertension. However , optimal diagnosis and successful management of hypertension can not be achieved exclusively by a handful of conventionally acquired BP readings. It is critical to estimate the magnitude of BP variability by estimating and quantifying each individual patient 's specific BP variations. Short-term BP variability or exaggerated circadian BP variations that occur within a day are associated with increased cardiovascular events , mortality and target-organ damage. Popular concepts of BP variability , including `` white-coat hypertension '' and `` masked hypertension '' , are well recognized in clinical practice. However , nocturnal hypertension , morning surge , and morning hypertension are also important phenotypes of short-term BP variability that warrant attention , especially in the primary-care setting. In this review , we try to theorize and explain these phenotypes to ensure they are better understood and recognized in day-to-day clinical practice.
