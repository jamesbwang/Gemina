  After treatment with chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells , interleukin ( IL) -15 elevation and CAR T-cell expansion are associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL) outcomes. However , the association of preinfusion CAR product T-cell functionality with clinical outcomes has not been reported. A single-cell analysis of the preinfusion CD19 CAR product from patients with NHL demonstrated that CAR products contain polyfunctional T-cell subsets capable of deploying multiple immune programs represented by cytokines and chemokines including interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) , IL-17A , IL-8 , and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α. A prespecified T-cell polyfunctionality strength index ( PSI) applied to preinfusion CAR product was significantly associated with clinical response , and PSI combined with CAR T cell-expansion or pretreatment serum IL-15 levels conferred additional significance. Within the total product cell population , associations with clinical outcomes were greater with polyfunctional CD4 + T cells compared with CD8 + cells. Grade 3 + cytokine release syndrome<disease> was associated with polyfunctional T cells , and both grade 3 + neurologic toxicity ( NT) and antitumor efficacy were associated with polyfunctional IL-17A-producing T cells. The findings in this exploratory study show that a preinfusion CAR product T-cell subset with a definable polyfunctional profile has a major association with clinical outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy.
