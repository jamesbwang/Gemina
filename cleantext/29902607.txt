  Surgical access to the temporal lobe is complex with many eloquent white fiber tracts , requiring careful preoperative surgical planning. Many microsurgical approaches to the temporal lobes are described , each with their own disadvantages. The adoption of the endoscope in neurosurgery has increased the options available when treating these difficult access tumors. We present our experience of a novel , minimally invasive , endoscopic approach to resect temporal lobe tumors. All patients undergoing endoscopic temporal lobe tumor resection between December 1 , 2011 and December 1 , 2017 , with a single surgeon , were included. Tumors were resected through a minicraniotomy using a high-definition rigid endoscope with a 0- and 30-degree viewing angle. Bimanual resection was performed using standard microsurgical technique. There were 45 patients ( 22 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 53 years. There were 23 ( 51 %) glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> , 11 ( 24 %) metastases , 7 ( 16 %) astrocytoma , 3 ( 7 %) anaplastic astrocytoma , and 1 ( 2 %) World Health Organization grade I glioneuronal tumor. In 82.2 % of cases ( 37/45) , > 95 % resection was achieved and 42.2 % ( 19/45) of patients achieving gross total resection. The endoscope has a role in temporal lobe intraparenchymal tumor surgery , especially in 3 illustrative scenarios: 1) medial temporal , parahippocampal-gyrus low-grade nonenhancing gliomas , 2) subcortical high-grade glioma and metastases medial to the sagittal stratum , and 3) recurrent gliomas with cystic resection cavity. The endoscope offers a safe and useful adjunct to the surgeons ' armamentarium in brain tumor surgery. A minimally invasive approach also reduces surgical morbidity and length of stay.
