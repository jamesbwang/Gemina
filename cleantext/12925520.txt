  Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E) is a key regulator of protein synthesis. Changes in eIF4E activity disproportionally affect the translation of a subset of oncogenic mRNAs in some cancers. We have assessed the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGFC) , eIF4E , eIF4E-binding proteins ( 4E-BPs) and phospho-4E-BP1 in clear cell renal carcinoma ( ccRCC; n = 101) using immunohistochemistry and analyzed the relevant mRNA levels and survival using online databases. The protein levels of VEGFC , an eIF4E-regulated gene , were upregulated in ccRCC tissues compared with adjacent normal renal tissues , indicating an enhanced eIF4E activity in ccRCC. The expression of eIF4E had no significant changes in ccRCC tissues. However , 4E-BP1 and phospho-4E-BP1 were found to be overexpressed in ccRCC tissues ( From these results , we could infer that the increase in eIF4E activity may be caused by the increased phospho-4E-BP1 level , which was probably due to the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) pathway.
