  About 1.6 million rehabilitation applications are submitted to the German pension insurance annually. Physicians working in ambulatory care play an important role in the application process. Studies show that there is too little knowledge about medical rehabilitation in these groups of physicians , the detection of rehabilitation needs and the process of application for rehabilitation. Against this background , a website Information for Doctors on Rehabilitation & Retirement was developed which addresses especially these needs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the website within a practical test. The practical test was performed with a mixed Methods Approach: 1) Quantitative survey with respect to increased knowledge after using the homepage , 2) assessment of cases with regard to rehabilitation indication and 3) evaluation of the user friendliness of the homepage by participating doctors by means of think-aloud technique. A total of 79 postgraduate General Practice trainees participated. They had high information needs regarding different aspects of rehabilitation , which were partly satisfied by the use of the homepage. The correct assessment of rehabilitation cases improved with the aid of the website for general practitioners with experience with application for rehabilitation only. The homepage was evaluated as clear and helpful , but the texts were judged as too extensive. The homepage can support physicians working in ambulatory care with respect to rehabilitation. Some impulses for optimization of the content have been identified and can help to further increase the usefulness of the website.
