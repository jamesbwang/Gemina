  Encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents inside a nanoscale delivery platform can provide an attractive therapeutic strategy with many pharmaceutical benefits , such as increased plasma solubility , prolonged in vivo circulation , and reduced acute toxicity. Given that the biological activities of polymeric nanoparticles are highly dependent on their colloidal structures , the molecular geometry-regulated programming of self-assembled nanoscale architecture is of great interest for chemical design of an ideal delivery platform. In this report , we demonstrate that the molecular geometry of block-copolymer excipients can govern the level of drug-loading capacity and core hydrophobicity of polymeric nanoparticles , which can eventually control the pH-sensitive drug-release property. Atom-transfer radical polymerization was employed as a controlled synthetic method for the copolymer excipients , which contain the metal-chelating poly ( acrylic acid) block linked to either a small mPEG-grafted poly ( methacrylate) to generate a bulky brush-like chains or a simple linear mPEG segment. During the coordination of cis-diammineplatinum ( II) as an active pharmacophore of cisplatin , aqueous-phase size-exclusion chromatography analyses exhibited highly different self-association kinetic regimes prompted by versatile molecular geometry of copolymer excipients , which further allows us to explore the molecular geometry-colloidal property relationship.
