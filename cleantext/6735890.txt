  We report two cases of anterior megalophthalmos with cataract. Both cases have megalocornea , cavernous anterior chamber , enlarged iris-lens diaphragm , and normal axial length. The vision was less due to cataract. To restore vision , phacoemulsification was performed in each eye in both cases. Intraoperatively , to overcome anatomical challenges , we made scleral tunnel incision , stained anterior capsule , and fixated intraocular lens ( IOL) by different techniques. In thefirst case , IOL was fixated through the sclera<symptom> , whereas in the second case , IOL stabilization was achieved by capturing the optic in anterior capsulorhexis margin and placing the haptics in sulcus. Successful vision was restored in both cases without pseudophacodonesis.
