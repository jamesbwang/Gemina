  Recent cross-sectional and randomized controlled studies of small sample sizes revealed that regular exercise is effective for improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However , there has been no large-scale longitudinal study addressing the effect of regular exercise on remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Thus , we investigated the impact of exercise on the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We analyzed 1,010 ( 860 men and 150 women) Japanese participants who received health checkups repeatedly over 10 years by a historical cohort study and were diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at baseline. Regular exercise was defined as participating in any kind of sports at least once a week. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed by ultrasonographic images. During 10 years of follow-up , remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was observed in 46.0 % ( 396/860) of men and 48.7 % ( 73/150) of women. In men , the adjusted hazard ratio of regular exercise for remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was 1.46 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.10-1.95 ,
