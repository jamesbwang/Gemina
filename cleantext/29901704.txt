  Maintenance of mixed grass-legume pastures for stand<symptom> longevity and improved animal utilization is a challenge in warm-season climates. The goal of this study was to assess grazing management on stand<symptom> persistence , forage intake , and N balance<symptom> of beef heifers grazing mixed pastures of Brachiaria brizantha and Arachis pintoi. A two-year experiment was carried out in Brazil , where four grazing management were assessed: rest period interrupted at 90 % , 95 % , and 100 % of light interception ( LI) and a fixed rest period of 42 days ( 90LI , 95LI , 100LI , and 42D , respectively). The LI were taken at 50 points at ground level and at five points above the canopy for each paddock using a canopy analyzer. For all treatments , the post-grazing stubble height was 15 cm. Botanical composition and canopy structure characteristics such as canopy height , forage mass , and vertical distribution of the morphological composition were evaluated pre-and post-grazing. Forage chemical composition , intake , and microbial synthesis were also determined. A randomized complete block design was used , considering the season of the year as a repeated measure over time. Grazing management and season were considered fixed , while block and year were considered random effects. In the summer , legume mass accounted for 19 % of the canopy at 100LI , which was less than other treatments ( a mean of 30 %). The 100LI treatment had a greater grass stem mass compared with other treatments. In terms of vertical distribution for 100LI , 38.6 % of the stem mass was above the stubble height , greater than the 5.7 % for other treatments. The canopy structure limited neutral detergent fiber intake ( P = 0.007) at 100LI ( 1.02 % of BW/d) , whereas 42D , 90LI , and 95LI treatments had NDF intake close to 1.2 % of BW/d. The intake of digestible organic matter ( OM; P = 0.007) and the ratio of crude protein/digestible OM ( P < 0.001) were less at 100LI in relation to the other treatments. The production of microbial N ( P < 0.001) and efficiency of microbial synthesis ( P = 0.023) were greater at 95LI and 90LI , followed by 42D and less at 100LI. Overall , the range from 90 to 95 % of LI is the recommendation to interrupt the rest period , since this strategy enhanced community stability , forage intake , and nutritional value of the diet. Under on-farm conditions , brachiaria grass and forage peanut pastures should be managed at a range height of 24 to 30 cm.
