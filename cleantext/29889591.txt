  Pemphigus is a chronic potentially life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease affecting the skin and/or mucous<symptom> membranes<symptom>. Rituximab is being increasingly used and found efficacious in the treatment of pemphigus. To present the Middle-Eastern experience with the use of rituximab in pemphigus. A retrospective analysis of patient files was conducted which revealed 23 patients of pemphigus who were treated with rituximab ( either alone or with IVIG) in the dermatology department of a tertiary care hospital from July 2004 to December 2014. The mean time to disease control was 8 weeks ( median 5 weeks and range 2-30 weeks). 90.9 % attained early study end point with the first cycle of rituximab. The remaining 9.1 % needed an additional course of rituximab + IVIG to attain disease control. 90.5 % of our patients attained complete remission during the study period. The average time to attain complete remission on minimal treatment was 25.4 weeks and partial remission on minimal treatment was attained after a mean period of 18.3 weeks. Rituximab was well tolerated by our patients and the rate of adverse-effects in our cohort was comparable to the previous reports. Rituximab is an effective and safe treatment for pemphigus and should be considered earlier in the algorithm of pemphigus treatment.
