  Pigmentation in mammals is primarily determined by the distribution of eumelanin and pheomelanin , the ratio of which is mostly controlled by the activity of melanocortin 1 receptor ( MC1R) and agouti signalling protein ( ASIP) genes. Using 91 animals from ten Arabian camel populations , that included the four predominant coat color phenotypes observed in the dromedary ( light brown , dark brown , black and white) , we investigated the effects of the MC1R and ASIP sequence variants and identified candidate polymorphisms associated with coat color variation. In particular , we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) , found in the coding region of MC1R ( 901C/T) , linked to the white coat colour , while a 1-bp deletion ( 23delT/T) and a SNP ( 25G/A) in exon 2 of ASIP are associated with both black and dark brown coat colours. Our results also indicate support that the light brown coat colour is likely the ancestral coat colour for the dromedary. These sequence variations at the MC1R and ASIP genes represent the first documented evidence of candidate polymorphisms associated to Mendelian traits in the dromedary.
