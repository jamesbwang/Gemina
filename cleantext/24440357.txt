  The aim of the study was to establish 24 month changes in upper limb function using a revised version of the performance of upper limb test ( PUL 2.0) in a large cohort of ambulant and non-ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and to identify possible trajectories of progression. Of the 187 patients studied , 87 were ambulant ( age range: 7-15.8 years) , and 90 non-ambulant ( age range: 9.08-24.78). The total scores changed significantly over time ( p < 0.001). Non-ambulant patients had lower total scores at baseline ( mean 19.7) when compared to the ambulant ones ( mean 38.4). They also had also a bigger decrease in total scores over 24 months compared to the ambulant boys ( 4.36 vs 2.07 points). Multivariate model analysis showed that the Performance of Upper<symptom> Limb changes reflected the entry level and ambulation status , that were independently associated to the slope of Performance of Upper<symptom> Limb changes. This information will be of help both in clinical practice and at the time of designing clinical trials.
