  The HIV-1 envelope ( Env) spike is a trimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers that mediates viral entry. Binding to CD4 on the host cell membrane is the first essential step for infection but disrupts the native antigenic state of Env , posing a key obstacle to vaccine development. We locked the HIV-1 Env trimer in a pre-fusion configuration , resulting in impaired CD4 binding and enhanced binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies. This design was achieved via structure-guided introduction of neo-disulfide bonds bridging the gp120 inner and outer domains and was successfully applied to soluble trimers and native gp160 from different HIV-1 clades. Crystallization illustrated the structural basis for CD4-binding impairment. Immunization of rabbits with locked trimers from two different clades elicited neutralizing antibodies against tier-2 viruses with a repaired glycan shield regardless of treatment with a functional CD4 mimic. Thus , interdomain stabilization provides a widely applicable template for the design of Env-based HIV-1 vaccines.
