  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between whey protein supplementation , body composition and muscle strength , in resistance-trained individuals. Forty-nine healthy males , aged 18 to 35 years that were engaged in resistance training for at least one year , were assigned into two groups according to whey protein intake ( Whey: n = 26 , 30.7 ± 7.4 yr , 75.8 ± 9.0 kg; WithoutWhey: n = 23 , 31.0 ± 7.4 yr , 77.9 ± 9.3 kg). Using a cross-sectional design , a morning assessment of body fat mass ( FM) ( by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and strength ( using 1RM for bench press and back squat) was performed. Nutritional assessment was performed by 3-day food records. Regarding nutritional habits , differences between total energy intake ( kcal) and estimated energy requirements ( kcal) were observed. Results , from both raw data or controlling for energy intake , estimated energy requirements or achieved percentage of energy requirements , showed that whey protein supplementation was inversely correlated with whole-body FM ( R = -0.367 ( p = 0.010); R = -0.317 ( p = 0.049); R = -0.380 ( p = 0.011); R = -0.321 ( p = 0.047) , respectively) , trunk FM ( R = -0.396 ( p = 0.005) , R = -0.367 ( p = 0.022) , R = -0.423 ( p = 0.004) , R = -0.369 ( p = 0.021) , respectively) and android FM ( R = -0.381 ( p = 0.007) , R = -0.332 ( p = 0.039) , R = -0.383 ( p = 0.010) , R = -0.336 ( p = 0.036) , respectively). No correlations were found between muscle strength outcomes and whey protein supplementation. The present data suggests that whey protein ingestion has a positive association with whole-body and regional ( trunk and android) FM.
