  Post-operative urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( POUR) is a common cause of unplanned admission following day-case surgery and has negative effects on both patient and surgical institution. We aimed to prospectively evaluate potential risk factors for the development of POUR following day-case general surgical procedures. Over a 24-week period , consecutive adult patients undergoing elective day-case general surgery at a single institution were prospectively recruited. Data regarding urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , comorbidities , drug history , surgery and perioperative anaesthetic drug use were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of POUR , defined as an impairment of bladder voiding requiring either urethral catheterisation , unplanned overnight admission or both. Potential risk factors for the development of POUR were analysed by logistic regression. A total of 458 patients met the inclusion criteria during the study period , and data were collected on 382 ( 83 %) patients ( 74.3 % male). Sixteen patients ( 4.2 %) experienced POUR. Unadjusted analysis demonstrated three significant risk factors for the development of POUR: age ≥ 56 years ( OR 7.77 ( 2.18-27.78) , p = 0.002) , laparoscopic surgery ( OR 3.37 ( 1.03-12.10) , p = 0.044) and glycopyrrolate administration ( OR 5.56 ( 2.00-15.46) , p = 0.001). Male sex and lower urinary tract symptoms were not significant factors. Multivariate analysis combining type of surgery , age and glycopyrrolate use revealed that only age ≥ 56 years ( OR 8.14 ( 2.18-30.32) , p = 0.0018) and glycopyrrolate administration ( OR 3.48 ( 1.08-11.24) , p = 0.0370) were independently associated with POUR. Patients aged at least 56 years and/or requiring glycopyrrolate-often administered during laparoscopic procedures-are at increased risk of POUR following ambulatory general surgery.
