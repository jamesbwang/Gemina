  Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder , but its underlying etiology is poorly understood. Both humans and animals exhibit binge-like intake of highly-palatable food , suggesting that the behavior is driven by the rewarding properties of food , rather than homeostatic signals. Food reward is regulated , in part , by endogenous opioid mechanisms which , themselves , may be altered by excessive eating. We examined this hypothesis by testing whether binge-like sucrose intake modifies the subsequent development of a conditioned place preference ( CPP) to sucrose and morphine in both female and male adult rats. Separate groups were given intermittent ( 12h) or continuous ( 24 h) access to a sweet solution ( 10 % sucrose or 0.1 % saccharin) and food in their home cage over 28 days. Intermittent sucrose access induced binge-like intake , defined as increased consumption within the first hour; importantly , daily sucrose intake was similar for continuous and intermittent access groups. In a later test , all rats developed a conditioned place preference ( CPP) to 15 % sucrose with the exception of female and male rats given 12-h intermittent access to sucrose. In a separate experiment , all groups displayed a CPP to morphine ( 4 mg/kg). These findings demonstrate that binge-like sucrose intake , not just increased consumption , disrupts reward processing without affecting stimulus-reward learning. This fits with clinical evidence of hypo-reward responsivity in patients with binge eating disorder.
