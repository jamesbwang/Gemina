  The ogt gene encodes O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase ( O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT)) that catalyzes the transfer of β-N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc) from the uridine-diphosphate-GlcNAc to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. This process is a common protein posttranslational modification , called protein O-GlcNAcylation , which is a known intracellular sensor of glucose metabolism and plays an important role in regulating cellular signaling , transcription , and metabolism. However , little is known about the function of OGT in the brain. Here , we report that the CaMKIIα promoter-dependent neuronal knockout ( KO) of OGT in adult mice led to short-term overeating , body<symptom> weight gain , and peripheral insulin resistance. These phenotype changes were accompanied by marked elevation of serum insulin and leptin levels and neuronal cell death , including the loss of leptin receptor-expressing neurons , in the hypothalamus. The neuronal OGT KO exacerbated obesity and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet. Surprisingly , the peripheral insulin resistance induced by neuronal OGT KO was reversed at its own 2-3 months after OGT KO , and the mice even showed increased insulin sensitivity several months later. These findings reveal an important role of neuronal OGT in the regulation of feeding behavior , body<symptom> weight , and peripheral insulin sensitivity.
