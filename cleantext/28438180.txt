  Endocrine therapy has historically formed the basis of treatment of metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The development of endocrine resistance has led to the development of newer endocrine drug combinations. Use of the CDK4/6 inhibitors has significantly improved progression-free survival in this group of patients. There are multiple studies of the use of P13K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors for use as subsequent lines of therapy , particularly for endocrine resistance. The optimal sequencing of therapy should be based on medical comorbidities , prior adjuvant therapies , quality of life , side-effect profile , and disease-free interval.
