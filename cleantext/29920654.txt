  The immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of NASH underlying hepatocyte injury and fibrosis<disease> progression at all disease stages. Oral administration of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAb) has been shown in pre-clinical studies to be an effective method for systemic immune modulation and alleviates immune-mediated disorders without T-cell depletion. In the present review , we summarize the concept of the oral administration of humanized anti-CD3 mAb in patients with NASH and discuss the potential of this treatment to address the current requirements of treatments for NASH. Recently published pre-clinical and clinical data on oral administration of anti CD3 are discussed. Human trials have shown that the oral administration of anti-CD3 in healthy volunteers , patients with chronic HCV infection , and patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes is safe and well tolerated , as well as biologically active. Oral anti-CD3 induces regulatory T cells , suppresses the chronic inflammatory state associated with NASH , and exerts a beneficial effect on clinically relevant parameters. Foralumab is a fully human anti-CD3 mAb that has recently been shown to exert a potent anti-inflammatory effect in humanized mice. It is being developed for treatment of NASH and primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC). Oral administration of anti CD3 may provide an effective therapy for patients with NASH.
