  Rearrangements involving the neurotrophic receptor kinase genes ( NTRK1 , NTRK2 , and NTRK3; hereafter referred to as TRK) produce oncogenic fusions in a wide variety of cancers in adults and children. Although TRK fusions occur in < 1 % of all solid tumors , inhibition of TRK results in profound therapeutic responses resulting in breakthrough FDA-approval of the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib for adult and pediatric solid tumor patients regardless of histology. In contrast to solid tumors , the frequency of TRK fusions and clinical effects of targeting TRK in hematologic malignancies is unknown. Here , through an evaluation for TRK fusions across > 7,000 patients with hematologic malignancies , we identified TRK fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) , acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , histiocytosis , multiple myeloma and dendritic cell neoplasms. Although TRK fusions occurred in only 0.1 % of patients ( 8 out of 7,311 patients) , they conferred responsiveness to TRK inhibition in vitro and in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft and a corresponding AML patient with ETV6-NTRK2 fusion. These data identify that despite their individual rarity , collectively TRK fusions are present in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies and predict clinically significant therapeutic responses to TRK inhibition.
