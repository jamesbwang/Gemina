  Increasing evidence from recent reports of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains poses a challenge worldwide. Drug-resistant strains often undergo mutations , adopt alternative pathways , and express drug efflux pumps to reduce or eliminate drug doses. Besides these intrinsic resistance mechanisms , bacteria can evade drug doses by forming biofilms. Biofilms are the concerted growth of adherent microorganisms , which can also be formed at the air-water interface. The growth is supported by the extracellular polymer matrix which is self-produced by the microorganisms. Reduced metabolic activity in a nutrient-deficient environment in the biofilm may cause the microorganisms to take alternative pathways that can make the microorganisms recalcitrant to the drug doses. Recent works have shown that
