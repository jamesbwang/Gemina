  Chitin nanocrystals ( ChNCs) and chitin nanofibers ( ChNFs) are nanomaterials with great innovative potential for sustainable applications in academic and industrial fields. The research related to their isolation and production , characterization , and utilization is still new. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the production process on the morphology and properties of ChNFs and ChNCs produced from the same source of chitin. ChNCs were prepared by acid hydrolysis of commercial shrimp<disease> shell Î±-chitin , and ChNFs were prepared by mechanical defibrillation using closed loop supermass colloidal grinding. Differences in their shape , size , and crystallinity were observed. ChNFs were observed to have higher aspect ratio , higher viscosity , and better thermal stability than ChNCs. Although the ChNC casting film had a higher degree of transparency , it had lower mechanical properties than ChNF film. In addition , the capacities of each nanomaterial for producing Pickering emulsions were comparatively investigated. ChNFs showed better oil-in-water emulsion stabilization ability than ChNCs at the same concentrations. In vitro cytotoxicity assays using two epithelial-like cell lines and two fibroblast-like cell lines demonstrated that both nanomaterials were non-toxic. Finally , we evaluated the economics of production using process engineering simulation to assess the energy and chemical consumption for each process of production of these nanomaterials.
