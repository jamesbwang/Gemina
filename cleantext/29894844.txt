  Vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase ( VE-PTP) is essential for endothelial cells ( ECs) adherens junction and vascular homeostasis; however , the regulatory mechanism of VE-PTP transcription is unknown , and a drug able to promote VE-PTP expression in ECs has not yet been reported in the literature. In this study , we used human ECs as a model to explore small molecule compounds able to promote VE-PTP expression , and found that atorvastatin , a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor widely used in the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia-related cardiovascular diseases , strongly promoted VE-PTP transcription in ECs through activating the VE-PTP promoter and upregulating the expression of the transcription factor , specificity protein 1 ( SP1). Additionally , atorvastatin markedly reduced VE-cadherin-Y731 phosphorylation induced by cigarette smoke extract and significantly enhanced stability of endothelial adherens junctions. Together , our findings reveal that atorvastatin up-regulates VE-PTP expression , increases VE-cadherin protein levels , and decreases VE-cadherin-Y731 phosphorylation to strengthen EC adherens junctions and maintain vascular cell monolayer integrity , offering a new mechanism of atorvastatin against CSE-induced disruption of vascular integrity and relevant cardio-cerebrovascular disease.
