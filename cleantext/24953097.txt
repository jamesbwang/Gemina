  The Patient Assessment of Constipation<symptom> Quality of Life ( PAC-QOL) questionnaire is the most validated and the most specific tool for measuring the quality of life of patients with constipation<symptom>. Over 120 million people live in countries whose official language is Persian. There is no reported Persian version of the PAC-QOL questionnaire yet. The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the PAC-QOL questionnaire and to assess its reliability and validity among Persian patients with chronic constipation<symptom>. Following the translation and cultural adaptation of the PAC-QOL questionnaire to Persian , 100 patients ( mean ± SD age = 40.51 ± 13.67) with constipation<symptom> were recruited for validity measurement and 20 patients were re-examined for reliability. Content validity was assessed based on the opinions of an expert committee and the floor/ceiling effect. Construct validity was evaluated according to the hypothesis test. The SF-36 questionnaire was used for concurrent criterion validity , intra-class correlation coefficient for reliability , and Cronbach 's alpha for internal consistency. The content validity of the PAC-QOL questionnaire was proven , and there was no floor/ceiling effect. Construct validity also was confirmed based on the hypothesis test. The overall Cronbach 's alpha of the PAC-QOL questionnaire was 0.92 ( range = 0.72-0.92) , and the overall intra-class correlation coefficient of the questionnaire was 0.88 ( range = 0.69-0.87). The correlation between the SF-36 and PAC-QOL questionnaires was moderate. The Persian version of the PAC-QOL questionnaire demonstrated good validity and reliability properties in chronic constipation<symptom>. Accordingly , Persian researchers and clinicians can benefit from this questionnaire in further research and assessment of treatment outcomes.
