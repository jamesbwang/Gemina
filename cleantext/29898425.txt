  Tyramine ( TY) adsorption on a Ca-montmorillonite ( SAz-2) was investigated with batch experiments and complementary analyses utilizing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography , ion chromatography , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy , and thermogravimetry ( TG). The adsorption reached equilibrium in 8 h , complying with the pseudo-second-order rate equation , and came to an adsorption capacity of 682 mmol kg
