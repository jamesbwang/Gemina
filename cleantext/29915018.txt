  Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EndoMT) has recently emerged as a potentially important contributor in promoting fibrosis<disease> in chronic kidney disease. However , little is known about the role and molecular basis of its involvement in hypertensive renal injury. Here , we aim to determine the role of SIRT ( sirtuin) 3 on EndoMT in hypertensive renal injury and to explore its underlying mechanisms. We found that SIRT3 expression was significantly reduced in Ang II ( angiotensin II)- induced hypertensive model , accompanied with induction of EndoMT and increased reactive oxygen species and renal fibrosis<disease>. In SIRT3
