  Iron overload causes many diseases , while the underlying etiologies of these diseases are unclear. Cell death processes including apoptosis , necroptosis , cyclophilin D- ( CypD)- dependent necrosis<symptom> and a recently described additional form of regulated cell death called ferroptosis , are dependent on iron or iron-dependent reactive oxygen species ( ROS). However , whether the accumulation of intracellular iron itself induces ferroptosis or other forms of cell death is largely elusive. In present study , we study the role of intracellular iron overload itself-induced cell death mechanisms by using ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC) and a membrane-permeable Ferric 8-hydroxyquinoline complex ( Fe-8HQ) respectively. We show that FAC-induced intracellular iron overload causes ferroptosis. We also identify 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ( PDK1) inhibitor GSK2334470 as a potent ferroptosis inhibitor. Whereas , Fe-8HQ-induced intracellular iron overload causes unregulated necrosis<symptom> , but partially activates PARP-1 dependent parthanatos. Interestingly , we identify many phenolic compounds as potent inhibitors of Fe-8HQ-induced cell death. In conclusion , intracellular iron overload-induced cell death form might be dependent on the intracellular iron accumulation rate , newly identified cell death inhibitors in our study that target ferroptosis and unregulated oxidative cell death represent potential therapeutic strategies against iron overload related diseases.
