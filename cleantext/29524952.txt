  A more sophisticated understanding of the unpredictable , disorderly and unstable aspects of healthcare organisations is developing in the knowledge translation ( KT) literature. In an article published in this journal , Kitson et al introduced a new model for KT in healthcare based on complexity theory. The Knowledge Translation Complexity Network Model ( KTCNM) provides a fresh perspective by making the complexity inherent in complex systems overt. The model encourages a whole system view and focuses on the interdependent relationships between actions , interactions and actors. Taking a systems approach assists our understanding of the connections , communication and collaboration necessary to promote knowledge mobilisation and facilitate the adoption of change. With further development , this could enable the targeting of more effective strategies across the various stakeholders and levels of service , fostering redesign and innovation.
