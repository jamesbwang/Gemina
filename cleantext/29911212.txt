  Porous V2O3 @C hollow spheres composed of ultrathin nanosheets were facilely fabricated via a one-step solvothermal route. When evaluated as an anode material , a large capacity of 583 mA h g-1 can be retained after 800 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1 , exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance.
