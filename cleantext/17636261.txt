  In a recent publication in Nature Communications the group of Dr. Dmitry Gabrilovich takes us one step closer to understanding why lipid accumulation impairs the function of tumour-associated dendritic cells ( DCs). In this study , the authors present two surprising and significant findings. First , they show that in mouse DCs oxidized lipids function as a sink that traps the heat shock<symptom> chaperone HSP70 , a molecular target of emerging anti-cancer strategies. Secondly , they find that HSP70 in turn regulates the trafficking of peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I ( pMHC-I) molecules , a complex that triggers the proliferation of cancer-killing T cells. These observations are discussed briefly in the context of lipid droplet function and pMHC-I trafficking in tumour-associated DCs , as well as HSP70 's pleiotropic and incompletely understood roles- and what they mean for future cancer therapy designs.
