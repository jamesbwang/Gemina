  Coffee husk ( CH) , a waste obtained from processing of coffee cherries via dry method , causes serious environmental problems. In this study , strategies were designed to utilize CH for succinic acid ( SA) production. Three different CH hydrolysis methods: thermal , thermochemical and crude enzymes obtained by solid state fermentation of Aspergillus<pathogen> niger and Trichoderma<pathogen> reesei , were evaluated to generate fermentable feedstock for SA production using Actinobacillus<pathogen> succinogenes. The feasibility of these pretreatment methods was investigated. Accordingly , thermochemical hydrolysis using H
