  In this study , activated magnetic biochars ( AMBCs) were successfully synthesized via one-step synthetic method with different temperature ( 300 , 500 and 700 °C). Characterization experiments indicated that AMBCs had larger surface area , higher pore volume and more contained‑oxygen functional groups compared to the pristine biochar. In addition , AMBCs showed better adsorption performance for 17β-estradiol ( E2) and copper ( Cu ( II)) in single/binary-solute systems than unmodified pristine biochar. AMBC-700 exhibited the highest capacity ( 153.2 mg/g) for E2 , while the AMBC-300 showed the best adsorption capacity ( 85.93 mg/g) for Cu ( II) in single-solute system. Adsorption of Cu ( II) and E2 both followed by pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isothermal model. The initial pH of the solution had an effect on the adsorption of E2 and Cu ( II) in single-solute system. Coadsorption experiments indicated that there existed site competition and enhancement of E2 and Cu ( II) on the sorption in binary-solute system. Results from this study indicated that the E2 was adsorbed by hydrogen bonds , π-π EDA interactions. Cu ( II) was mainly adsorbed via chemical complexation between contained‑oxygen functional groups and Cu ( II) ions. Therefore , the AMBCs via one-step synthesis could be converted into value-added biochar as effective sorbent for simultaneous removal of E2 and Cu ( II) from water.
