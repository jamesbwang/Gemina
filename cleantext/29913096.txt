  Little is known about the complex factors that underpin persistence and success for preregistration physiotherapy students. This article presents findings from a qualitative study which explored the perceptions of eight recent graduates from one UK university about their experiences of their physiotherapy undergraduate degree program , and what they considered important in their success. Data were collected via one-to-one , semi-structured interviews. An in-depth thematic analysis was undertaken from which three overarching themes were inferred. First , successful learning was portrayed as a fundamentally social activity , embedded in tight learning communities of peers and tutors which conferred a firm sense of belonging. Second , participants recalled having a strong sense of commitment to their future identity as physiotherapists which may have helped them to resist some of the difficulties they encountered as students. Finally , a minority of these successful participants reported overcoming hardship on clinical placement by drawing on a range of personal and institutional resources. Crucially , these successful students ' sense of belonging , and their alignment with the norms and values of the program , may have been critical to accessing and using these formal and informal resources.
