  Here , we describe a strategy for the rapid preparation of pure positional isomers of complex N-glycans to complement an existing array comprising a larger number of N-glycans and smaller glycan structures. The expanded array was then employed to study context-dependent binding of structural glycan fragments by monoclonal antibodies and C-type lectins. A partial enzymatic elongation of semiprotected core structures was combined with the protecting-group-aided separation of positional isomers by preparative HPLC. This methodology , which avoids the laborious chemical differentiation of antennae , was employed for the preparation of eight biantennary N-glycans with Galβ1 ,4 GlcNAc ( LN) , GalNAcβ1 ,4 GlcNAc ( LDN) , and GalNAcβ1 ,4 ( Fucα1 ,3) GlcNAc ( LDNF) motifs presented on either one or both antennae.
