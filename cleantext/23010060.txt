  In photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , chlorin e6 ( Ce6) , with its high phototoxic potential and strong absorption of visible light , penetrates deeply into photodamaged tissue. However , despite this fact , the direct application of Ce6 to PDT has been limited by its low water solubility and poor cancer cell localization. To ameliorate this situation , we report herein on the use of a hydrophilic nanoconjugate ( DC) comprised of Ce6 and poly ( amidoamine) dendrimer , which improves the water solubility and intracellular uptake of Ce6 , thereby enhancing PDT efficacy. The synthesis of DC was verified by ¹ H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) analysis , and the coupling ratio of Ce6 introduced onto DC was 2.64. The prepared DC was spherical , with an average diameter of 61.7 ± 3.5 nm. In addition , the characteristic ultraviolet-visible absorption bands of DC in distilled water were similar to those of free Ce6 in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) , indicating that the Ce6 chromophore did not change upon conjugation. Investigation using fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy revealed a greater intracellular uptake of DC than of Ce6 alone. Moreover , DC exhibited significantly increased phototoxicity to human cervical cancer cells , mostly because of apoptotic cell death. These results imply that DC is a candidate for the clinical treatment of PDT.
