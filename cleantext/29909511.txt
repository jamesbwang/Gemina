  Abdominoplasty is a common procedure in postbariatric surgery. Over the years , a high number of technical refinements of the procedure have been established to improve safety and reduce associated complications. Nevertheless , the complication rate is high. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of postoperative complications in patients undergoing abdominoplasty in association with prolonged postoperative immobilization. Retrospective analysis of 82 patients who underwent abdominoplasty was performed. Patients were divided in two study groups regarding their immobilization period. Group 1 included patients with an immobilization period defined as strict bed rest for at least 45 h after surgery. Group 2 included all patients with shorter immobilization time , but earliest mobilization in the evening on the day of surgery. Overall , complication rate was 27 %. Major complications were observed in 15 % in group 1 and in 23 % in group 2. Hematoma requiring surgical revision was observed in 5 % in group 1 and in 14 % in group 2. Surgical revisions within the first 60 days were necessary in 5 % in group 1 and in 20 % in group 2. Prolonged immobilization after abdominoplasty does not crucially lower the overall complication rate , but influences the severity of complications in a positive way. Increasing the duration of postoperative immobilization up to 45 h after abdominoplasty significantly decreases the reoperation rate in our practice. The risk for a surgical revision is nearly four times higher if the patient leaves bed earlier. Surgeons should consider this option especially in patients with a high risk for complication development.
