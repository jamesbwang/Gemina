  To evaluate the failure rate and performance of cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) testing , mainly in terms of detection rates for trisomy 21 , performed by 2 laboratories using different analytical methods. cfDNA testing was performed on 2,870 pregnancies with the HarmonyTM Prenatal Test using the targeted digital analysis of selected regions ( DANSR) method , and on 2,635 pregnancies with the `` Cerba test '' using the genome-wide massively parallel sequencing ( GW-MPS) method , with available outcomes. Propensity score analysis was used to match patients between the 2 groups. A comparison of the detection rates for trisomy 21 between the 2 laboratories was made. In all , 2,811 patients in the Harmony group and 2,530 patients in the Cerba group had no trisomy 21 , 18 , or 13. Postmatched comparisons of the patient characteristics indicated a higher no-result rate in the Harmony group ( 1.30 %) than in the Cerba group ( 0.75 %; p = 0.039). All 41 cases of trisomy 21 in the Harmony group and 93 cases in the Cerba group were detected. Both methods of cfDNA testing showed low no-result rates and a comparable performance in detecting trisomy 21; yet GW-MPS had a slightly lower no-result rate than the DANSR method.
