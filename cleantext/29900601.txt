  The synthesis and structuration of a novel low molecular amphiphilic catechol 1 is reported. The combination of a hydrophilic tail containing a catechol group and a pyrene-based hydrophobic head favors its solvent tuned supramolecular assembly. Formation of hollow nanocapsules/vesicles occurs in concentrated solutions of both polar protic and non-protic organic solvents , whereas in water a fibril-like aggregation process is favored even at low concentrations. The emission properties of the pyrene moiety have allowed the monitoring of the self-assembly process which could be confirmed by optical and electronic microscopy. In organic solvents and at low concentrations , compound 1 remains on its non-assembled monomeric form. As the concentration increases , the aggregation containing pre-associated pyrene moieties becomes more evident up to a critical micellar concentration where vesicle-like structures are formed. In contrast , nanosized twist belt-like fibers have been observed in water even at low concentrations , meanwhile at high concentration microplate structures appears. The interactions between molecules in different solvents have been studied by molecular dynamics simulations , which have confirmed different solvent driven supramolecular interactions.
