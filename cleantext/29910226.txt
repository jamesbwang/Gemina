  Dyslipidemia is the most common lipid metabolism disorder in humans , and its etiology remains elusive. Hypertriglyceridemia ( HTG) is a type of dyslipidemia that contributes to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) , apolipoprotein CII ( APOC2) , apolipoprotein AV ( APOA5) , glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 ( GPIHBP1) , lipase maturation factor 1 ( LMF1) , and glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase 1 ( GPD1) are responsible for HTG by using genomic microarrays and next-generation sequencing. The aim of this study was to identify genetic lesions<symptom> in patients with HTG. Our study included a family of seven members from Jiangsu province across three generations. The proband was diagnosed with severe HTG , with a plasma triglyceride level of 38.70 mmol/L. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and Sanger sequencing were performed to explore the possible causative gene mutations for this patient. Furthermore , we measured the post-heparin LPL and hepatic lipase ( HL) activities using an antiserum inhibition method. A compound heterozygous mutation in the LMF1 gene ( c. 257C ＞ T/p. P86L and c. 1184C ＞ T/p. T395I) was identified and co-segregated with the affected patient in this family. Both mutations were predicted to be deleterious by three bioinformatics programs ( Polymorphism Phenotyping-2 , Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant , and MutationTaster). The levels of the plasma post-heparin LPL and HL activities in the proband ( 57 and 177 mU/mL) were reduced to 24 % and 75 % , respectively , compared with those assayed in the control subject with normal plasma triglycerides. A compound heterozygous mutation of LMF1 was identified in the presenting patient with severe HTG. These findings expand on the spectrum of LMF1 mutations and contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with HTG.
