  Objectives In order to produce near real-time onsite results to detect surface contamination by antineoplastic drugs , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health developed monitors for 5-fluorouracil , which use surface wiping and lateral flow immunoassay for measurement. The monitors were tested in the laboratory to assess the sensitivity of detection on laboratory-produced contaminated surfaces. A field evaluation to assess the capability of the monitors to make measurements in healthcare workplaces was carried out in collaboration with a medical device company and the results are presented in this report. Methods The 5-fluorouracil monitor was evaluated in areas where oncology drugs were prepared and administered to patients at five different hospitals. The levels of contamination measured with the monitors were compared to levels measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results The 5-fluorouracil values measured with the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ranged from 0 to over 200,000 ng/100 cm
