  Obesity is an epidemic that is closely associated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The ultimate treatment for end-stage heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is cardiac transplantation. Patients with morbid obesity are often excluded from receiving donor organs. Many transplant centers use body mass index ( BMI) > 35 kg/m The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) in LVAD patients and the impact on heart<symptom> failure<symptom> recovery as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. University hospital. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of patients with morbid obesity and LVADs who underwent LSG at a large academic medical center between 2013 and 2017. Age , BMI , percent excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , cardiac ejection fraction , listing status for transplantation , and success of transplant were reviewed. Eleven patients were identified with morbid obesity and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with LVAD support who underwent LSG. There were no perioperative deaths. Four patients ( 37 %) achieved BMI < 35 and were successfully listed for and received cardiac transplantation. An additional 3 patients ( 27 %) achieved BMI < 35 kg/m LSG can be safely used in patients with morbid obesity and end-stage heart<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring LVAD support to lower their BMI and become eligible for cardiac transplantation.
