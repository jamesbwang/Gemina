  To improve imaging , a reliable setup method is critical for the accurate localization of lesions<symptom> and surface markers. Because an anisotropic marker has not yet been validated for MRI , direct localization of surface markers is not yet feasible in fractional anisotropy ( FA) maps. This study aimed to develop an anisotropic surface marker using wood for an FA map and to determine whether a wood marker is useful for various sequences. Wood infiltrated with water was used to develop an anisotropic surface marker. The wood marker was compared with phantoms composed of clinically available markers , including MR-SPOTS Packets ( Beekley Medical , Bristol , CT , USA) , Breath Care Oral Refreshing Capsules ( Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Osaka , Japan) , and baby oil ( Johnson & Johnson , New Brunswick , NJ , USA). Magnetic resonance images were acquired using the Achieva 3T TX MRI System ( Philips HealthCare , Best , Netherlands) equipped with a QD head coil including T Breath Care Oral Refreshing Capsules and baby oil were not observed in the FA map. The FA value of the MR-SPOTS Packets was 0.18. The FA value of the wood marker was 0.80. The coefficient of variation of the MR-SPOTS Packets and the wood marker were 0.0263 and 0.0013 , respectively , in the FA map. Microscopic observation revealed a wood anisotropic structure. The wood maker enabled direct localization in the FA map. Hence , wood markers may be useful to radiologists and contribute to obtaining useful findings.
