  To investigate the clinical efficacy of acupotomy stress position percutaneous dynamic release for severe shoulder periarthritis. From April 2012 to August 2016 , 160 patients with severe shoulder periarthritis were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. Among them , 80 patients in treatment group were treated with acupotomy stress position percutaneous dynamic release including 32 males and 48 females with an average of ( 52.47 ± 9.04) years old ranging from 40 to 74 years old; the courses of disease was ( 20.72 ± 9.55) months on average. The other 80 patients in control group were treated with simple joint loosening according to Maitland technique in grade III-IV therapy , once a day , 15 to 20 min each time , and 10 d for 1 course , for a total of 2 courses , including 33 males and 47 females with an average of ( 53.19 ± 10.18) years old ranging from 42 to 75 years old; the average course of disease was ( 21.98 ± 8.99) months. After operation , the shoulder muscles training and shoulder joint activity training were routinely conducted , the treatment lasted for 3 weeks. The visual analogue scale ( VAS) and Constant-Murley shoulder function score were observed and compared between the two groups before treatment and 3 weeks , 3 , 6 months after treatment. The VAS scores of the treatment group at 3 weeks , 3 and 6 months after treatment were all lower than those of the control group ( Treatment of severe shoulder periarthritis with acupotomy stress position percutaneous dynamic release can obviously improve the shoulder joint function and pain , according to the different parts of the shoulder joint<symptom> pain<symptom> and function limitation , the corresponding shoulder stress and body position should be designed and maintained during the treatment process , and the angle of stress position gradually increased by loosening the adhesion , which is the key to ensure the curative effect.
