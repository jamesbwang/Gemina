  Diseases as a ` Stumbling Block `- a Case of Multimorbidity in Clinical Practice Abstract. Here we report on a 83 year-old patient with cardiac syncope and consecutive traumatic brain injury with intracranial haemorrhage receiving anticoagulation for recurrent pulmonary embolism: a ` medical dilemma ' due to the syncope with consecutive traumatic event and the underlying condition. A pre-existing underlying cardiac disease was identified as the cause of the syncope and the intracranial haemorrhage was most likely due to oral anticoagulation for recurrent pulmonary embolisms. The intracranial bleeding inhibited an optimal management of the underlying cardiac condition and the patient deceased shortly thereafter.
