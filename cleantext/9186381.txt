  SOCRATES ( Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) , comparing ticagrelor with aspirin in patients with acute cerebral ischemia , found a nonsignificant 11 % relative risk reduction for stroke , myocardial infarction , or death ( A prespecified subgroup analysis in SOCRATES ( n = 13199) , randomizing patients with acute ischemic stroke ( National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of â‰¤ 5) or transient ischemic attack ( ABCD The 4232 patients in the prior-aspirin group were older , had more vascular risk factors , and vascular disease than the other patients. In the prior-aspirin group , the primary end point occurred in 138/2130 ( 6.5 %) of patients on ticagrelor and in 177/2102 ( 8.3 %) on aspirin ( hazard ratio , 0.76; 95 % confidence interval , 0.61-0.95; In this secondary analysis from SOCRATES , fewer primary end points occurred on ticagrelor treatment than on aspirin in patients receiving aspirin before randomization , but there was no significant treatment-by-prior-aspirin interaction. A new study will investigate the benefit-risk of combining ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with acute cerebral ischemia ( URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03354429).
