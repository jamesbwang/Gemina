  Clinical and community samples indicate that eating disorders ( EDs) and disordered eating behaviors ( DEBs) may co-occur among adolescents and young adults at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as overweight or obese. To determine the prevalence of EDs and DEBs among young adults at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as overweight or obese using a nationally representative sample and to characterize differences in prevalence by sex , race/ethnicity , sexual orientation , and socioeconomic status. Cross-sectional nationally representative data collected from Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health ( Add Health). Young adults ages 18-24 years old. ED diagnosis and DEBs ( self-reported binge eating or unhealthy weight control behaviors including vomiting<symptom> , fasting/skipping meals , or laxative/diuretic use to lose weight). Covariates: age , sex , race/ethnicity , sexual orientation , weight<symptom> status<symptom> , and education. Of the 14,322 young adults in the sample , 48.6 % were at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as overweight or obese. Compared to young adults at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as underweight or normal weight , those at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as overweight or obese reported a higher rate of DEBs ( 29.3 vs 15.8 % in females , 15.4 vs 7.5 % in males). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that odds of engaging in DEBs were 2.32 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.05-2.61) times higher for females compared to males; 1.66 ( 1.23-2.24) times higher for Asian/Pacific Islander compared to White; 1.62 ( 1.16-2.26) times higher for homosexual or bisexual compared to heterosexual; 1.26 ( 1.09-1.44) times higher for high school or less versus more than high school education; and 2.45 ( 2.16-2.79) times higher for obesity compared to normal weight , adjusting for all covariates. The high prevalence of DEBs particularly in young adults at a weight<symptom> status<symptom> classified as overweight or obese underscores the need for screening , referrals , and tailored interventions for DEBs in this population.
