  Exposure to low-dose lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) before cerebral ischemia is neuroprotective in stroke models , a phenomenon termed preconditioning ( PC). Although it is well established that LPS-PC induces central and peripheral immune responses , the cellular mechanisms modulating ischemic injury remain unclear. Here , we investigated the role of immune cells in the brain protection afforded by PC and tested whether monocytes may be reprogrammed by
