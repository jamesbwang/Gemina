  Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cause of cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer deaths for women in developing countries. Traditional screening tools , such as human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> and Pap tests , can not provide results in real-time and can not localize suspicious regions. Colposcopy-directed biopsies are invasive in nature and only a few sites of the cervix may be chosen for investigation. A non-invasive , label-free and real-time imaging method with a resolution approaching that of histopathology is desirable for early detection of the disease.
