  In recent years there has been a trend towards centralisation of services for general paediatric surgery in the United Kingdom. Fewer District General Hospitals supply provision of paediatric surgery , placing a strain on Specialist Centres. The cause behind the decline is unclear but lack of interest from general surgical trainees may be a contributing factor. A survey was conducted across current higher surgical trainees to review this. A short online survey ( Typeform) was sent nationally to higher general surgical trainees. The results were analysed using SPSS Version 21. 121 trainees responded to the survey. Only 29 % trainees expressed an interest in pursuing general paediatric surgery as part of their future chosen specialty. The main concerns of trainees in regards to paediatric surgery was a limited training time , perception that a paediatric consultant would be unwilling to train a general surgical trainee , and a concern that ISCP requirements were unattainable in six months. There was no significant difference in opinion between those who had/not completed a paediatric surgical placement. There is a growing disinterest of general surgical trainees to pursue paediatric surgery within their future chosen specialty. This is resulting in fewer consultants being qualified to provide the service within a District General Hospital. Trainees often have negative preconceived ideas about the specialty , which may be modified by a positive experience within the specialty.
