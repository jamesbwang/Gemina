  We investigate the response of quasiperiodically driven nonlinear systems exhibiting strange nonchaotic attractors ( SNAs) to deterministic input signals. We show that if one uses two square waves in an aperiodic manner as input to a quasiperiodically driven double-well Duffing oscillator system , the response of the system can produce logical output controlled by such a forcing. Changing the threshold or biasing of the system changes the output to another logic operation and memory latch. The interplay of nonlinearity and quasiperiodic forcing yields logical behavior , and the emergent outcome of such a system is a logic gate. It is further shown that the logical behaviors persist even for an experimental noise floor. Thus the SNA turns out to be an efficient tool for computation.
