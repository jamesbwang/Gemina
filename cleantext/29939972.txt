  Retrospective comparative study. To compare the outcomes of C1-C2 transarticular screw combined with C1 laminar hook ( TAS + C1H) and C1-C2 transarticular screw combined with modified Gallie technique ( TAS + G) for treating reducible atlantoaxial dislocation ( AAD). Both TAS + C1H and TAS + G fixation were 3-point fixation techniques for AAD. TAS+C 1H technique was comparable to TAS + G technique in biomechanics. However , it is unknown whether it can achieve same outcomes as TAS + G technique. Data of the 63 patients who underwent TAS+C 1H or TAS+G fixation and fusion because of AAD were retrospectively reviewed. Bone fusion time was recorded. The outcomes evaluated by visual analog scale score for neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( VASSNP) , Nurick scale , neck stiffness ( none/mild/severe) , patient satisfaction and Neck Disability Index ( NDI) were compared between two groups. At the final follow-up , bone graft fusion rates were 100 % in both groups ( P > 0.05). Nurick scales were significantly improved in both groups ( P < 0.05) , but with no significant differences between groups ( P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between two groups in VASSNP , neck stiffness , patient satisfaction , or NDI ( all P > 0.05). There were no complications related to the surgical approach and instrumentation in either group. Both TAS + C1H and TAS + G fixation were effective in the treatment of reducible AAD. TAS + C1H was safer than TAS + G because it could potentially reduce the risk of spinal cord and venous plexus injury associated with sublaminar cables. 3.
