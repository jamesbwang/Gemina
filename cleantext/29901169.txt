  γ-tocotrienol ( γ-T3) , a tocotrienol isoform belonging to the vitamin E family , has been revealed to exert inhibitory effects on proliferation , migration and invasion in human gastric cancer cells. However , its precise mechanism of action is still unclear and needs to be further tested. Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) is well known for its key role in promoting the migration and invasion abilities of human gastric cancer cells. In light of these data , our study aimed to validate whether the inhibitory actions of γ-T3 could be achieved by downregulation of COX-2 activity in vitro. In the present study , a Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay was performed to observe proliferation in human gastric cancer cells ( SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells) , and wound<disease> healing and Transwell chamber assays were performed to detect migration and invasion. Western blot analyses were performed to analyse the relative expression of COX-2 , matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 ( MMP-2 and MMP-9) proteins , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA) were used to determine the exocrine roles of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The results revealed that γ-T3 exerted significant inhibitory effects on proliferation , migration , invasion and COX-2 protein expression , as well as on exocrine functions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells. Therefore , our results indicated that γ-T3 exerts inhibitory effects on migration and invasion , which may be mediated through downregulation of COX-2 expression in SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells.
