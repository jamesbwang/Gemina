  Immunological memory is broadly understood as the underlying mechanism by which an organism remembers previous encounters with pathogens , aberrant cells , or self-antigens to produce a more rapid or robust secondary response upon re-encounter. This phenomenon is widely accepted as the hallmark feature of the adaptive immune system. However , work within the last decade has continuously challenged this viewpoint and opened up the idea that immunological memory extends beyond just conventional B cells and T cells. Along with critical studies on natural killer cells , recent evidence suggest that innate B and T cells , innate lymphoid cells , and even myeloid cells are capable of varying degrees of immune memory. In this article , we review recent work describing memory-like features within the innate immune system , and provide evidence that immunological memory may be more nuanced than previously appreciated.
