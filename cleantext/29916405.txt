  We examined the relationship between general ability of mentalization , the specific aspect of affective mentalizing of self and others , emotion regulation strategies , and eating disorder ( ED) symptoms. Twenty-five female adolescent and young adult inpatients with EDs , and 22 healthy subjects , were administered a semi-structured interview- the Reflective Function ( RF) scale , self-rating scales assessing alexithymia , emotion regulation , depression<symptom> and ED symptomatology , and a neurocognitive measure assessing Theory of Mind. Participants with EDs presented lower levels of RF regarding the self and higher levels of alexithymia , using more emotional suppression and less cognitive reappraisal than controls. Elevated levels of general RF and self RF and attenuated alexithymia , along with elevated cognitive reappraisal and attenuated emotional suppression , were correlated with attenuated ED symptoms. Comorbidity with depressive symptoms predicted greater ED symptomatology. High mentalization may serve as a coping mechanism to attenuate ED symptoms.
