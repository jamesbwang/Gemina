  In this study , the complete mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) sequence of the crab Parasesarma affine is determined , characterized and compared with other decapod crustaceans. The P. affine mitochondrial genome ( mitogenome) is 15,638 bp in size , and contains 13 protein-coding genes ( PCGs) , 2 ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) genes , 22 transfer RNA ( tRNA) genes and a control region ( CR). Then , 23 of the 37 genes are encoded by the heavy ( +) strand while 14 are encoded by the light (-) strand. All PCGs are initiated by ATN codons and 4 of the 13 PCGs harbored the incomplete termination codon by T or TA. The CR with a high A + T % ( 82.33 %) spans 678 bp. The nucleotide composition of the P. affine mitogenome is also biased toward A + T nucleotides ( 74.83 %). The gene order of P. affine has a difference that trnI-trnQ turns into trnQ-trnI when compared with ancestor of Brachyura , which can also been seen in other Sesarmidae species. Phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial 13 PCGs from 49 decapod crustaceans and one outgroup using Bayesian inference ( BI) and Maximum Likelihood ( ML) , which determined that P. affine belongs to Sesarmidae and Parasesarma is monophyletic.
