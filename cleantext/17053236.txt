  When closely related individuals mate , they produce inbred offspring , which often have lower fitness than outbred ones. Geographical exogamy , by favouring matings between distant individuals , is thought to be an inbreeding avoidance mechanism; however , no data has clearly tested this prediction. Here , we took advantage of the diversity of matrimonial systems in humans to explore the impact of geographical exogamy on genetic diversity and inbreeding. We collected ethno-demographic data for 1,344 individuals in 16 populations from two Inner Asian cultural groups with contrasting dispersal behaviours ( Turko-Mongols and Indo-Iranians) and genotyped genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms in 503 individuals. We estimated the population exogamy rate and confirmed the expected dispersal differences: Turko-Mongols are geographically more exogamous than Indo-Iranians. Unexpectedly , across populations , exogamy patterns correlated neither with the proportion of inbred individuals nor with their genetic diversity. Even more surprisingly , among Turko-Mongols , descendants from exogamous couples were significantly more inbred than descendants from endogamous couples , except for large distances ( > 40 km). Overall , 37 % of the descendants from exogamous couples were closely inbred. This suggests that in Inner Asia , geographical exogamy is neither efficient in increasing genetic diversity nor in avoiding inbreeding , which might be due to kinship endogamy despite the occurrence of dispersal.
