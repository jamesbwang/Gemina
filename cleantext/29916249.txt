  Cataracts are a leading cause of vision impairment , which stem from the misfolding and aggregation of crystallins in the eye lens. Despite its prevalence and severity , the detailed mechanism by which misfolded crystallins aggregate into cataracts remains elusive. Recently , in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that lanosterol , a steroid-type compound found in human and animal eyes , can not only prevent cataract formation but also reverse the formation. Inspired by these experimental observations , we investigate the preventive activity of lanosterol in the aggregate formation of human γD-crystallins ( HγD-Crys) using all atom molecular dynamics ( MD) simulation and free energy perturbation ( FEP) techniques. Our results reveal that lanosterol preferentially binds to the HγD-Crys hydrophobic dimerization interface , in particular , to the structured C-terminus ( near residues 135-165) with a stronger binding affinity than the unfolded N-terminus. Furthermore , we observe that the C-terminal binding is more favorable than lanosterol self-aggregation , further attesting to lanosterol 's efficacy. Finally , we compare the binding free energy of lanosterol with cholesterol using alchemical transformation and discuss the possible correlation of the molecular geometry of steroids with binding affinity.
