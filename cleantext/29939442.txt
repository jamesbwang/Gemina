  The rapid assembly of molecular complexity continues to be at the forefront of novel reaction development. In the pursuit of that goal , we herein report a novel Sc ( OTf) 3-catalyzed , one-pot multicomponent reaction , that furnishes complex multicyclic 2 pyrrolines with excellent overall yields and perfect diastereocontrol. This process is based on our previously established ( 2 +2 +1)- cycloannulation of in situ-generated 1-azaallyl cations , 1,3-dicarbonyls and primary amines. The newly formed and highly reactive aminal moiety is readily substituted with indoles and pyrroles both as external and internal p-nucleophiles to provide densely functionalized N-heterocycles with four new s-bonds and two vicinal quaternary stereogenic centers. In addition , DFT-calculations have been conducted to further characterize the intermediate 1- azaallyl cations.
