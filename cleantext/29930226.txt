  Significant inconsistencies exist in findings on association of bio-elements ( BE) concentrations and schizophrenia. Hypothesis of this research was that different concentrations of BE are associated with different psychopathological schizophrenia symptoms. This cross-sectional study was performed from 2014 to 2016 at Psychiatric Hospital `` Sveti Ivan '' and University Psychiatric Hospital `` Vrapƒçe '' , Zagreb , Croatia , on the consecutive sample of 67 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. BE concentrations were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS) at the Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health in Zagreb. Severity of schizophrenia symptoms was assessed on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS). After adjustment for all preplanned possible confounding variables , the first canonical correlation between BE and BPRS dimensions variates were statistically significant ( Rc Concentrations of different BE are associated with different schizophrenia symptoms. Maximal correlation between BPRS and BE may be achieved with the weighted linear composite of negative schizophrenia symptoms and copper ( Cu) , lead ( Pb) , lithium ( Li) and cobalt ( Co).
