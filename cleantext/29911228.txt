  A microwave-assisted structure-conversion ( MASC) method was used to obtain photochromic hackmanites ( M , Na) 8Al6Si6O24 ( Cl , S) 2 ( M: Li , Na , and K) in a fast ( 12 to 20 min) one-step process. Structural conversion from Zeolite A to hackmanite minerals has been proven to be very effective through an aluminosilicate crystalline intermediate. Photochromism is observed with both UV and X-ray ( CuKÎ±) excitation.
