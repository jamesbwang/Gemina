  The expression and purification of recombinant proteins using bacterial vectors is a mature and preferred system to obtain folded and stable proteins. However , functional post-translational protein modifications , such as glycosylation or phosphorylation , can only be achieved using eukaryotic expression systems. In addition , insolubility is another challenge when using proteins expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , such as certain intrinsically disordered proteins , which are more prone to aggregation than folded proteins. Eukaryotic protein expression systems , including human cells , baculovirus/insect cells , and yeast , have become indispensable for the production of functional eukaryotic proteins. This article describes a detailed protocol for performing cytosolic protein expression , protein purification , and protein characterization using the budding yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> The introduced protein expression and purification system in yeast are advantageous due to the low cost , high yield , high protein solubility , and minimal expertise required.
