  Cannabis use is associated with a range of neurocognitive deficits , including impaired episodic memory. However , no study to date has assessed whether these difficulties extend to episodic foresight , a core component of which is the ability to mentally travel into one 's personal future. This is a particularly surprising omission given that episodic memory is considered to be critical to engage episodic foresight. In the present study , we provide the first test of how episodic foresight is affected in the context of differing levels of cannabis use , and the degree to which performance on a measure of this construct is related to episodic memory. Fifty-seven regular cannabis users ( 23 recreational , 34 regular) and 57 controls were assessed using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview. The results showed that regular-users exhibited greater impairment of episodic foresight and episodic memory than both recreational-users and cannabis-na√Øve controls. These data therefore show for the first time that cannabis-related disruption of cognitive functioning extends to the capacity for episodic foresight , and they are discussed in relation to their potential implications for functional outcomes in this group.
