  A neonatal ductal stent deployed in a straight short conical duct on second postnatal day migrated owing to inadequate ductal constriction. It was successfully retrieved using a larger balloon and redeployed in the duct again. Intravenous indomethacin prevented further stent migration. This is the first report of successful transcatheter retrieval and repositioning of a migrated expanded neonatal ductal stent.
