  Plasma renin activity is involved in the regulation of body salt content and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. However , there is a paucity of data regarding the association between low or high plasma renin activity and the development of hypertension. We investigated the relation of baseline plasma renin activity to increases in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and the incidence of hypertension after four years in 2,146 non-hypertensive individuals from a community-based Korean population ( mean age , 50 years) , 58 % of whom were women. We defined an `` increase in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> '' as an increment of systolic blood-pressure â‰¥ 10 mmHg or initiation of antihypertensive drugs and defined `` hypertension '' as a systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of 140 mm Hg or higher , a diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of 90 mm Hg or higher , or the use of antihypertensive medications. After 4 years , the increase in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> had increased in 27.9 % of the participants , and hypertension had developed in 17.9 %. After adjustment , the lowest sex-specific tertile of plasma renin activity was an independent risk factor of an elevation in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( Adjusted Odds Ratio 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval 1.07-1.74 , p = 0.011) and hypertension ( Adjusted Odds Ratio 1.84 , 95 % confidence interval 1.36-2.50 , p < 0.001) compared to the highest sex-specific tertile. The associations between the plasma renin activity and blood-pressure outcomes were evident in adults with especially high urine sodium excretion. Low plasma renin activity was associated with the development of hypertension in the middle-aged Asian population , especially in peoples with high sodium intake.
