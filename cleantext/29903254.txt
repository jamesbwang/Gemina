  To get a baseline of 32 provincial center for disease control and prevention ( CDC) microbiology laboratory in the aspect of quantitative test ability of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureu , qualitative test ability of diarrheagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and unknown intestinal pathogen , and to comprehend the quality of microbiology testing. Two different concentration samples of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> I and II were made. Diarrheagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and unknown intestinal pathogen samples were transported using the special semi-solid AGAR transport medium , in the form of four pure different serotypes each. The results of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureu were logarithmic transformed , and evaluated with Z-score method using the average and standard deviation. The reporting results of diarrheagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and unknown intestinal pathogen were evaluated as right or wrong , and non-reporting were evaluated as missing. The satisfaction rate of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was 82. 81 %. The accuracy rate of diarrheagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> was 45. 16 %. Of the 32 results of unknown intestinal pathogen , 29 CDCs reported correctSalmonella serotypes , and the accuracy rate was 90. 63 %. Combined the three quality control results , 9 CDCs reached the accurate results , with the accuracy rate of 28. 13 %. 32 provincial CDCs have the identification ability of Salmonella<pathogen> serotyping and qualitative test ability of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureu , while they need to strength diarrheagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> identification and serotyping ability.
