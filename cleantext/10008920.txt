  Multiferroic materials have been receiving attention for their potential applications in multifunctional devices. Chemical substitution is an effective method for improving the physical properties of BiFeO ₃ ( BFO). However , different experimental results have been reported for Lanthanum- ( La-) and Manganese ( Mn)- doped BFO ceramics. Here , we systematically studied the magnetic properties and spontaneous polarization of La- , Mn- , and Nitrogen ( N)- doped tetragonal BiFeO ₃ using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation and U-value method. The calculated results demonstrated that the systems show ferromagnetism with Mn and N doping , whereas no magnetization was found with La doping in G- and C-type antiferromagnetic orderings. Our research further revealed that the ferromagnetism is attributed to the
