  Androgen and estrogen determinations serve as important diagnostic markers in a variety of clinical conditions. However , one challenge is to enhance assay sensitivity for determination in the lowest range , such as in prepubertal children. We here present a recently developed gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( GC-MS/MS) method for determination of androstenedione ( A Steroids were extracted in ethyl acetate n-hexane solution from serum spiked with isotopically labeled internal standard and derivatized sequentially with pentafluorobenzyl bromide , pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine and pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride and analyzed by GC-MS/MS using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in negative chemical ionization mode. Leftover routine samples ( n = 414) were used to evaluate the concordance between GC-MS/MS and RIAs and the validity of GC-MS/MS for pediatrics; of these samples , 101 were from seemingly healthy children. Pubertal stage was recorded for reference interval evaluation. Lower limit of detection for A We report the development of a GC-MS/MS method sensitive enough to accurately determine serum levels of androgens and estrogens in children.
