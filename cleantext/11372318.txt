  To evaluate whether the change in the CE angle of Wiberg and the acetabular index after Ganz periacetabular osteotomy is statistically significant. The pre- and postoperative CE angle of Wiberg and acetabular index of 14 hips operated at a tertiary hospital in Curitiba , Paran√° , Brazil were evaluated. The postoperative measurements showed significant differences in relation to the preoperative period. There was a significant reduction in the CE angle of Wiberg in the postoperative period , as well as in the acetabular index. These differences were statistically significant for both the right and left sides. The radiographic evaluation of patients submitted to Ganz periacetabular osteotomy presented some statistically significant results; however , a larger sample is still necessary.
