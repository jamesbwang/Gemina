  Counseling about reducing access to lethal means of suicide , especially firearms , is a recommended practice in emergency departments ( EDs) but does not occur routinely. Understanding influencers of decisions makers in health care ( ED nurse leaders , mental health providers) and temporary firearm storage ( law enforcement and gun retailers) could enhance practice. We surveyed these 4 groups in the 8-state region of the Mountain West. For ED nurse leaders ( n = 190) , hospital legal , risk management , and quality improvement representatives , and the ED nursing director were most often cited as influential , whereas mental health providers ( n = 67) cited their own team. Law enforcement officials ( n = 448) identified the overall community and leaders of mental health or general health organizations as influential. Firearm retailers ( n = 95) cited local law enforcement and national firearm organizations. Advocacy from influential groups may encourage efforts to provide lethal means counseling and temporary off-site storage of firearms for suicide prevention.
