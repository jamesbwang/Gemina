  Although lung cancer remains the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide , the advent of immunotherapy is changing the survival of patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). A multitude of clinical trials are evaluating different immune checkpoints inhibitors in this new field of thoracic oncology. At the beginning of the immunotherapy era , nivolumab , pembrolizumab and atezolizumab showed high efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC in second-line setting , receiving approvals for clinical practice. Nivolumab and atezolizumab are approved independently from programmed death lig and 1 ( PD-L1) expression , while pembrolizumab is currently approved only for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1 %. The role of PD-L1 expression acquired more interest considering first-line clinical trials , in which the role of immunotherapy as monotherapy was confirmed only for pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50 %. These data were analysed in this paper , focusing on the implications in clinical practice and how to use them to an accurate clinical benefit of patients with advanced NSCLC. We report a review based on a MEDLINE/PubMed , searched for randomised phase 2/3 trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors and NSCLC , that moved to an approval from Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and European Medicine Agency ( EMA). The evidence discussed in this manuscript and the final therapeutic algorithm , coming out from an International Experts Panel Meeting of the Italian Association of Thoracic Oncology.
