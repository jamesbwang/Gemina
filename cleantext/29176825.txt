  Spatial heterogeneity plays an important role in the evolution of drug resistance. While recent studies have indicated that spatial gradients of selection pressure can accelerate resistance evolution , much less is known about evolution in more complex spatial profiles. Here we use a stochastic toy model of drug resistance to investigate how different spatial profiles of selection pressure impact the time to fixation of a resistant allele. Using mean first passage time calculations , we show that spatial heterogeneity accelerates resistance evolution when the rate of spatial migration is sufficiently large relative to mutation but slows fixation for small migration rates. Interestingly , there exists an intermediate regime-characterized by comparable rates of migration and mutation-in which the rate of fixation can be either accelerated or decelerated depending on the spatial profile , even when spatially averaged selection pressure remains constant. Finally , we demonstrate that optimal tuning of the spatial profile can dramatically slow the spread and fixation of resistant subpopulations , even in the absence of a fitness cost for resistance. Our results may lay the groundwork for optimized , spatially resolved drug dosing strategies for mitigating the effects of drug resistance.
