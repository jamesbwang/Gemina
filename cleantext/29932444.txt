  Lubricant and hydraulic fluid ageing impacts the performance of the machines , gears , transmissions or automatisms where they are being used. This manuscript describes the work accomplished for bringing an innovative measurement concept for analysing the physical- chemical properties of these fluids , to a real industrial product ready to be integrated into different industrial equipment. The steps taken to deal with uncertainties and evolving requirements while progressing in the sensor development are described , covering the stages of theoretical formulation of the problem , optical and fluidic simulations , sensor prototype development and tests. The sensor working principle is based on a combination of transmittance and diffuse reflectance photonic inspection of the fluid sample that is collected in a microcavity through a standard hydraulic fitting. Photonics , electronics , micro-mechanics , fluidics , data processing and analysis has been merged with a deep knowledge in the lubricant degradation process to develop a sensor solution that is able to measure the Oil Degradation Index , Oil Oxidation , Acid Number , Ruler and Membrane Patch Colorimetry data from an inservice lubricating oil sample. The photonic micro sensor presented here offers a powerful tool that operates directly immersed in the fluid , at an economic cost and compacted size for inline oil degradation monitoring.
