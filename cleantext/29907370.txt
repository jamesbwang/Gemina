  Transplant procedures are frequently performed outside the regular working hours ( after hours). In general surgery , several studies observed worse outcomes for operations performed after hours. The predetermined hypothesis was that patients undergoing transplantation during after hours might suffer from an excess in post-operative mortality and morbidity when compared to patients undergoing transplantations during the regular working hours. A systematic review of the PubMed database identified 11,993 records , of which eleven cohort studies including a total of 287,741 patients investigated the association between the starting time of transplant surgery and postoperative mortality ( primary outcome) and/or morbidity ( secondary outcome). Eight studies evaluated kidney transplants ( in 165,277 patients) , two studies analyzed liver transplants ( in 95,346 patients) , and one study investigated transplantations of thoracic organs ( in 27,118 patients). Results were conflicting with two studies ( in liver and lung transplantation) showing an increased mortality for transplantations performed after hours , and five studies showing no effects on mortality. A meta-analysis on estimates from four studies yielded a hazard ratio of 1.01 ( 95 % CI , 0.98 to 1.04) for mortality comparing transplantations performed during versus outside the regular working hours. The evidence was also inconclusive for a variety of morbidity outcomes with studies demonstrating either a deterioration of outcome , no effect or an improved outcome for after hours procedures. On the basis of the available evidence , it appears impossible to give an unequivocal recommendation regarding starting times in transplant surgery.
