  There is a growing human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) epidemic in Tajikistan. This paper presents factors associated with linkage to HIV<pathogen> care among people aged 15 years and older in Tajikistan. This retrospective cross-sectional study used the Tajikistan Ministry of Health HIV<pathogen> registry data from patients diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> at age 15 years or older from 2000 to 2016. Chi squared tests and logistic regression models tested factors associated with linkage to care. A multivariable logistic regression model examined effect modifications. While linkage to care had an overall increase from 2000 to 2016 , the odds of linkage were lower among certain sub-groups including among people in Dushanbe , men , people engaging in sex work , injection drug users , and older people. Regional differences exist with linkage to care , occurring least frequently in Dushanbe. While access to care and quality of care have increased significantly over time , findings suggest that linkage to care is low , especially in the capital city where many services are provided. Evaluation focusing on acceptability of HIV<pathogen> services should be undertaken to understand why certain people do not link with services. Additional research about the types of barriers to linking with HIV<pathogen> care is needed to increase linkage to HIV<pathogen> care.
