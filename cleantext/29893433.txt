  Surveillance biopsies after renal transplantation remain debatable. To drive the decision of such intervention , we propose a predictive score of abnormal histology at 1-year post-transplantation , named 1-Year Renal Biopsy Index ( 1-RBI). We studied 466 kidney recipients from the DIVAT cohort alive with a functioning graft and a surveillance biopsy at 1-year post-transplantation. Patients displaying abnormal histology ( 49 %) ( borderline , acute rejection , IFTA grade 2 or 3 , glomerulonephritis<disease> were compared to the normal or subnormal ( IFTA grade 1) histology group. Obtained from a lasso penalized logistic regression , the 1-RBI was composed of recipient gender , serum creatinine at 3- , 6- and 12-months post-transplantation and anti-class II immunization at transplantation ( internal validation: AUC = 0.71 , 95 % CI ( 0.53- 0.83); external validation: AUC = 0.62 , 95 % CI ( 0.58- 0.66)). While we could not determinate a threshold able to identify patients at high chance of normal or subnormal histology , we estimated and validated a discriminating threshold capable of identifying a subgroup of 15 % of the patients with a risk of abnormal histology higher than 80 %. The 1-RBI is computable online at www.divat.fr. The 1-RBI could be a useful tool to standardize 1-year biopsy proposal and may for instance help to indicate one in case of high risk of abnormal histology. This article is protected by copyright.
