  Executive functions ( EFs) are key abilities that allow us to control our thoughts and actions. Research suggests that two EFs , inhibitory control ( IC) and working memory ( WM) , emerge around 9 months. Little is known about IC earlier in infancy and whether basic attentional processes form the `` building blocks '' of emerging IC. These questions were investigated longitudinally in 104 infants tested behaviorally on two screen-based attention tasks at 4 months , and on IC tasks at 6 and 9 months. Results provided no evidence that basic attention formed precursors for IC. However , there was full support for coherence in IC at 9 months and partial support for stability in IC from 6 months. This suggests that IC emerges earlier than previously assumed. A video abstract of this article can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVE17hooANY.
