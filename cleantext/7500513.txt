  Kt/V is a nondimensional number and a scaling parameter that has , with arbitrary definitions , been recast as a measure of dialysis by Gotch and Lysaght. This editorial discusses the concept of nondimensional numbers within the context of dialysis measurement , modeling , and medical evidence. It concludes that Gotch 's Kt/V , Lysaght 's Kt/V , and standardized Kt/V are not well suited to measure dialysis. An ideal dialysis measure would be proportional to toxins cleared by the kidney , portable with regard to dialysis modality , practical ( largely devoid of calculations) and reflective of the pathology/physiology.
