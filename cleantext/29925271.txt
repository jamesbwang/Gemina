  A comparison of conventional pairwise propensity score matching ( PSM) and generalized PSM method was applied to the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatment options for lung cancer. Deidentified data were analyzed. Covariate balances<symptom> between compared treatments were assessed before and after PSM. Cox proportional hazards regression compared overall survival after PSM. The generalized PSM analyses were able to retain 61.2 % of patients , while the conventional PSM analyses were able to match from 24.1 to 77.1 % of patients from each treatment comparison. The generalized PSM achieved statistical significance ( p < 0.05) in 8/10 comparisons , whereas conventional pairwise PSM achieved 1/10. The noted differences arose from different matched patient samples and the size of the samples.
