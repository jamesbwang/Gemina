  This study established a network related to nurses ' job stress by conducting a social network analysis of titles , keywords , and abstracts , and it identified emerging topics of research. NetMiner 4.0 visualized an interconnection between critical keywords and investigated their frequency of appearance to construe the trends in nurses ' job stress measures used in studies conducted over 55 years ( 1960-2015). Text Rank Analyzer examined a collection of 9,218 keywords from 2,662 studies. The analysis revealed four groups of newly emerging keywords in the research. The following five clusters were identified: concept , subject , method and tool , outcome and response , and solution and management. Thus , if new researchers refer to existing trends to establish the subject of their study , replication studies can be reduced , and the direction of the development of future research on nurses ' job stress can be predicted. Further application of new interventions , development of objective indicators , working environment , and broader participants are needed.
