  The purpose of this study is to relate the clinical quality of the complete denture and specific anamnestic factors to the level of satisfaction perceived by patients. Also identifying possible prognostic parameters that could be predictive of future satisfaction. On the basis of a substantial existing literature , the most appropriate parameters to determine the prosthetic quality have been determined to evaluate the satisfaction perceived by patients about their denture; a completely new questionnaire has been drawn up. Ninety-eight patients have been included in the research , they have undergone a clinical examination , and they have filled out the questionnaire anonymously. The ANOVA test and Pearson correlation test have been employed to relate clinical and anamnestic factors to the overall satisfaction score. The average level of patients ' satisfaction was between `` quite satisfied '' and `` very satisfied. '' There is no significant variability of satisfaction related to the type of prosthesis. The ANOVA test did not verify relationships between the overall satisfaction score and the anamnestic data examined. Pearson linear correlation coefficient between the overall prosthetic quality and the general satisfaction perceived by patients is 0.493 ( there is a moderately strong relationship between the overall prosthetic quality and the general satisfaction perceived by patients. Particularly , the retention and the adequate extension of the prosthetic body appear to be factors that are most associated with satisfaction. Instead , the anamnestic factors are not related to overall satisfaction score.
