  It is not known if dysglycemia and sleep-disordered breathing are linked in adolescents , as in adults. To perform a pilot study evaluating measures of sleep-disordered breathing across the spectrum of glucose tolerance in obese adolescents. We hypothesized that dysglycemia would be associated with sleep-disordered breathing. This was a prospective , cross-sectional clinical pilot study that included 57 adolescents ( body mass index ( BMI) 38.9 Â± 8.4 kg/m Anthropometrics , overnight polysomnogram , and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Participant characteristics and outcome measures were compared by glucose tolerance status. Correlational analyses were conducted to assess the associations between variables of interest. Participants with dysglycemia ( Further study with a larger proportion of youth with prediabetes and T2D is necessary to determine whether evaluation for sleep-disordered breathing is uniformly warranted.
