  Due to their increased energy expenditure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) patients with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> are susceptible to malnutrition. This study aimed to compare the predictive values of the following three widely used nutritional assessment methods for the clinical prognosis of COPD patients with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>: body mass index ( BMI) , Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 ( NRS 2002) , and serum albumin ( ALB) level. COPD patients with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> treated in our center from June 2013 to June 2016 were retrospectively included. Patient BMI , NRS 2002 and ALB values were measured to assess their nutritional status. A multivariable analysis was conducted , and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves were generated to explore the predictive factors for clinical prognoses. A total of 438 qualified patients were enrolled in our study. Multivariable analysis revealed that the BMI and ALB values independently predicted in-hospital mortality , the BMI and NRS 2002 predicted 1-year mortality , and all three methods ( BMI , NRS 2002 , and ALB) predicted 30-day readmission after discharge ( P < 0.05). Regarding the results of the AUROC analysis , the optimal cutoff values that maximized the ability to predict the prognosis were an ALB level of 30.5 g/L for in-hospital mortality , an NRS 2002 score of 3 points for 1-year mortality , and an ALB level of 30.1 g/L for readmission within 30 days following discharge. For COPD patients with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , ALB level was superior for predicting in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission after discharge , and NRS 2002 was superior for long-term prognosis of 1-year mortality.
