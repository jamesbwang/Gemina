  Emergency Department ( ED) physicians ' next day discharge rate ( NDDR) , the percentage of patients who were admitted from the ED and subsequently discharged within the next calendar day was hypothesized as a potential measure for unnecessary admissions. The objective was to determine if NDDR has validity as a measure for quality of individual ED physician performance. Hospital admission data was obtained for thirty-six ED physicians for calendar year 2015. Funnel plots were used to identify NDDR outliers beyond 95 % control limits. A mixed model logistic regression was built to investigate factors contributing to NDDR. To determine yearly variation , data from calendar years 2014 and 2016 were analyzed , again by funnel plots and logistic regression. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to estimate the percent of total variation in NDDR attributable to individual ED physicians. NDDR varied significantly among ED physicians. Individual ED physician outliers in NDDR varied year to year. Individual ED physician contribution to NDDR variation was minimal , accounting for 1 %. Years of experience in Emergency Medicine practice was not correlated with NDDR. NDDR does not appear to be a reliable independent quality measure for individual ED physician performance. The percent of variance attributable to the ED physician was 1 %.
