  Neurodegenerative diseases are a set of disorders characterized by progressive neuronal death and are associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Recently , neuroinflammation is proposed as a promising therapeutic target for many neurodegenerative diseases. Alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT) is recognized as a novel immunomodulatory agent in autoimmune diseases and transplantation , however , its impact on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration remains unknown. This study aims to explore the effects of AAT on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and retinal degeneration in rd1 mouse model. We found reduced expression of AAT in rd1 retina , and AAT supplement exhibited certain protective effect on retinal degeneration , presenting with increased amount of photoreceptor nuclei , and amplified wave amplitudes in electroretinogram analysis. Of note , AAT shifted microglia phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 ( CD16/CD32
