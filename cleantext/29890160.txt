  To investigate the natural history of Stargardt disease ( STGD1) using fixation location and fixation stability. Multicenter , international , prospective cohort study. Fixation testing was performed using the Nidek MP-1 microperimeter as part of the prospective , multicenter , natural history study on the Progression of Stargardt disease ( ProgStar). A total of 238 patients with ABCA4-related STGD1 were enrolled at baseline ( bilateral enrollment in 86.6 %) and underwent repeat testing at months 6 and 12. Outcome measures included the distance of the preferred retinal locus from the fovea ( PRL) and the bivariate contour ellipse area ( BCEA). After 12 months of follow-up , the change in the eccentricity of the PRL from the anatomic fovea was -0.0014 degrees ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , -0.27 degrees , 0.27 degrees; P = .99). The deterioration in the stability of fixation as expressed by a larger BCEA encompassing 1 standard deviation of all fixation points was 1.21 degrees squared ( deg Our observations point to the complexity of fixation parameters. The association of increasingly eccentric and unstable fixation with longer disease duration that is typically found in cross-sectional studies may be countered within individual patients by poorly understood processes like neuronal adaptation. Nevertheless , fixation parameters may serve as useful secondary outcome parameters in selected cases and for counseling patients to explain changes to their visual functionality.
