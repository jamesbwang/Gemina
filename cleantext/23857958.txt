  While surgical resection represents the standard potentially curative therapy for liver cancer , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE) has evolved as a standard therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) as well as liver metastases. However , it is still not fully understood which patients particularly benefit from TACE. Cytokines represent a broad category of signaling molecules that might reflect concomitant inflammation<symptom> as an adverse prognostic factor. Here , we evaluated the role of interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-8 , and CC-chemokine ligand ( CCL) 22 as biomarkers in the context of TACE treatment. Cytokine serum levels were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay in 54 patients ( HCC:
