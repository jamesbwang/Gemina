  Adult day centers provide comprehensive care for older adults and may enhance autonomy , well-being , and socialization. This quasi-experimental study evaluated the impact of such multidisciplinary day care on functionality , fear of falling , and risk of falls in community elders. Fifty-two seniors who attended day services were followed for 1 year. During the year , the adults maintained functionality for activities of daily living , presented improvement in instrumental activities of daily living , and no longer presented high risk for falls. No association was found between the risk of falling and fear of falling , however. Results are discussed in terms of the positive outcomes of attending day services.
