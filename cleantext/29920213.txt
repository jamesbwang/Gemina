  In the postprandial state , glucose homeostasis is challenged by macronutrient intake , including proteins that trigger insulin secretion and provide glucose precursors. However , little is known about the postprandial response of gluconeogenesis to a protein meal. We aimed to quantify the evolution of fractional gluconeogenesis after a meat meal. Thirteen healthy subjects received oral doses of D
