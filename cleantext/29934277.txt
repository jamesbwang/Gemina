  Potentially inappropriate medications ( PIM) for the older adults are those with an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio when more effective and safe therapeutic alternatives are available and is an important public health problem. To analyze the factors associated with the use of PIM by the older adults and to investigate the agreement of PIM use frequency using the 2015 American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults- 2015 AGS Beers Criteria , the Brazilian consensus on potentially inappropriate medication for older adults ( BCPIM) and the European union list of potentially inappropriate medications- EU ( 7)- PIM List. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in two primary health care centers in southeastern Brazil. The 2015 AGS Beers Criteria , BCPIM , and EU ( 7)- PIM List were used for the classification of PIM. The association between PIM use and independent variables was assessed by multiple logistic regression. The level of agreement of PIM use among the three criteria was measured with the Cohen 's kappa coefficient. A total of 227 patients ≥ 60 years of age were included in the study. The frequency of PIM use was 53.7 % for 2015 AGS Beers , 55.9 % for BCPIM and 63.4 % for the EU ( 7)- PIM List. The agreement between 2015 AGS Beers and BCPIM and between this and the EU ( 7)- PIM List was high , and moderate between the 2015 AGS Beers and the EU ( 7)- PIM List. Logistic regression showed association of PIM use with polypharmacy , self-reported neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal diseases , age ≤ 70 years , preserved cognition and positive self-perception of health. The frequency of PIM use by the older adults of health centers investigated is high. Strategies for improving the pharmacotherapy of the older adults in primary health care should be implemented.
