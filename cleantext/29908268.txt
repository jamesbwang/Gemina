  Multidrug-resistant ( MDR) Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> is a major cause of biofilm-associated and indwelling device related infections. The present study explores the anti-virulent and antibiofilm potency of chitosan extracted from the shells of the marine crab Portunus sanguinolentus against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). The chemical characterization results revealed that the extracted chitosan ( EC) has structural analogy to that of a commercial chitosan ( CC). The extracted chitosan was found to be effective in reducing the staphyloxanthin pigment , a characteristic virulence feature of MRSA that promotes resistance to reactive oxygen species. Furthermore , Confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM) revealed that EC exhibited a phenomenal dose dependent antibiofilm efficacy against mature biofilms of the standard as well as clinical MRSA strains and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM) confirmed EC had a higher efficacy in disrupting the thick Exopolysaccharide ( EPS) layer than CC. Additionally , EC and CC did not have any cytotoxic effects when tested on lung epithelial cell lines. Thus , the study exemplifies the anti-virulent properties of a marine bioresource which is till date discarded as a biowaste.
