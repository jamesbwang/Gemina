  Combined heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification ( HAD) is a sustainable and practical method for removing nitrate from organic-limited wastewater. However , the active microorganisms responsible for denitrification in wastewater treatment have not been clearly identified. In this study , a combined microelectrolysis , heterotrophic , and autotrophic denitrification ( CEHAD) process was established. DNA-based stable isotope probing was employed to identify the active denitrifiers in reactors fed with either
