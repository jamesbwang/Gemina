  Fresh figs have less shelf life due to the growth of yeasts and molds. The study aimed at extending the shelf life of fresh fig with the help of irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging ( MAP). Effects of irradiation and MAP on the quality and shelf life of fresh fig were evaluated. Combined effect of irradiation and MAP on the quality of fresh fig was also studied. To optimize irradiation dose , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 kGy doses were given to fresh fig. Firmness and overall acceptability of fresh fig were minimally affected by 1 kGy irradiation dose. Whereas , 2 , 3 and 4 kGy had negative effects on firmness and overall acceptability score. Thus , 0.5 and 1 kGy were selected to evaluate the combined effect of irradiation and MAP. Fresh figs were packed in an atmosphere of 5 % O
