  At central nervous system synapses , agonist binding to postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs) results in signaling between neurons. N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA) receptors are a unique family of iGluRs that activate in response to the concurrent binding of glutamate and glycine. Here , we investigate the process of agonist binding to the GluN2A ( glutamate binding) and GluN1 ( glycine binding) NMDA receptor subtypes using long-timescale unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. We find that positively charged residues on the surface of the GluN2A ligand-binding domain ( LBD) assist glutamate binding via a `` guided-diffusion '' mechanism , similar in fashion to glutamate binding to the GluA2 LBD of AMPA receptors. Glutamate can also bind in an inverted orientation. Glycine , on the other hand , binds to the GluN1 LBD via an `` unguided-diffusion '' mechanism , whereby glycine finds its binding site primarily by random thermal fluctuations. Free energy calculations quantify the glutamate- and glycine-binding processes.
