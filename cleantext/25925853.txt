  The authors describe a new coating for use in solid-phase microextraction ( SPME). Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) were prepared by using gallic acid or glucose as the reducing agents , and then supported onto a stainless steel wire that was previously coated with a silver mirror. Coating with AgNPs was performed by a layer-by-layer approach of up to eight cycles of consecutive deposition of AgNPs and the thiol linker 1,8-octanedithiol. This procedure allows proper control of the coating thickness. Thicknesses are 3.2 μm and 3.5 μm with AgNPs obtained with gallic acid and glucose , respectively. This is in agreement with theoretical estimations ( 3.8 μm). The fibers were used in the direct-immersion SPME-GC-FID determination of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) from different waters. The performance of the method was compared to the one using polydimethylsiloxane fibers ( 100 μm) , which is the most suitable commercial SPME fiber for PAHs. Despite the low thickness of the AgNP coatings ( compared to PDMS) , the analytical features of the method using the most adequate coating ( AgNPs prepared with gallic acid) include: ( a) limits of detection down to 0.6 ng · mL
