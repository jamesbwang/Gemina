  Dementias are clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Often , dementias with genetic etiology are clinically indistinguishable from non-genetic ones. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the yield of clinical exome sequencing in dementias , potentially associated with monogenic genetic predisposition. For this purpose 20 consecutive patients younger than 65 years were studied in the period from January 2014 to December 2017; 14 with the diagnosis of Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD) , 3 with early-onset Alzheimer disease ( EOAD) and 3 with unspecified dementia. In addition to clinical exome sequencing including 57 genes associated with dementia , C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion as tested in all patients. We found genetic etiology in 6 patients: 2 mutations in the PSEN1 gene ( p.Pro264Ser and p.Phe105Cys) in the EOAD patients , C9orf72 expansion and MAPT ( c. 1920 +16 C > T) , mutation in the FTD group of patients as well as MAPT ( c. 1920 +16 C > T) mutation and likely pathogenic mutation in the TYROBP mutation ( p.Asp32Asn) in patients with unspecified diagnosis. Our preliminary results imply significant diagnostic yield in identifying rare genetic causes of dementia , combining comprehensive clinical exome sequencing and targeted C9orf72 expansion testing.
