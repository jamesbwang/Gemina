  A totally synthetic microperoxidase-11 ( MP-11) is reported. Accordingly , the undecapeptide ( VQKCAQCHTVE) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis followed by the thiol-ene click reaction with haemin for reconstitution. High-speed atomic force microscopy measurement conducted in water confirmed the protein reconstitution by visualizing the morphological differences as animated molecular images. The synthetic MP-11 showed a considerable magnitude of catalytic activity ( 27 %) against the natural MP-11 in the oxidation of 3,3 ' ,5,5 '- tetramethylbenzidine by hydrogen peroxide , whereas it showed very low ( 2.7 %) activity of a synthetic variant with a point mutation ( VQKCAQC
