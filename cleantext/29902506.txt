  The legs of the primary larva of Mantispa aphavexelte , parasite in egg sacks of spiders , were examined using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , histology and confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM). The leg morphology is described in detail , including intrinsic muscles. Functional adaptations of the leg attachment devices are discussed , especially regarding the material composition. For example , a sole-like flexible ventral tarsal surface containing resilin is combined with sclerotized pseudo-claws. This likely enables the larvae to cope with surface structures on the spider 's body , with substrates on the ground , and also with various structural elements in the spider 's nest. The leg morphology is evaluated with respect to phylogenetic affinities. A trumpet-shaped , elongated empodium has likely evolved early in the evolution of Neuroptera and may consequently belong to the groundplan of a large subgroup of the order. It characterizes most groups of the hemerobiform lineage and is also present in the myrmeleontiform Psychopsidae. The presence of a tarsal protrusion resembling a pretarsus confirms the monophyletic origin of Mantispoidea. A single fixed tooth and a specific surface structure are potential autapomorphies of Mantispidae. A distal tibial subunit partly separated from the main part of the leg segment is an apomorphy only described for larvae of M. aphavexelte.
