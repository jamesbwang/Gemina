  In the past decades , coronary imaging has evolved as a valuable adjunct to angiography , providing scientific insights into vascular biology and practical guidance by direct visualization of atherosclerosis and other pathologic conditions within the vessel walls. Especially with intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) , the signal is able to penetrate below the luminal surface , so the entire cross-section of an artery , including the complete thickness of the plaque , can be imaged in real-time. On the other hand , optical coherence tomography ( OCT) has been offering higher image resolution of both the plaque and the luminal surface. These technologies offer the opportunity to gather diagnostic information about the process of atherosclerosis and to directly observe the effects of various interventions on the plaque and arterial walls. IVUS has proven itself to be a practical and useful tool in the evaluation and optimal guidance of interventional vascular medicine. In this review , we detail the current modalities of coronary imaging and their usefulness in the diagnosis and management of patients with high-risk coronary plaques.
