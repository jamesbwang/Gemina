  Adolescence is a time of change during which several health problems , such as pain problems , increase. Psychosocial mechanisms involved in this development , such as interpersonal stressors and worry , are still understudied , especially longitudinally. The first aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in Swedish adolescents between the ages 13 and 15 using pain grades. The second aim was to study the role of peer-related stress , worry , and gender in the development of musculoskeletal pain problems over time. Adolescents in 18 public schools were followed from 7th to 9th grade ( N = 1181) and answered self-report questionnaires at three time points. Prevalence was assessed at all three time points and a moderated mediation analysis investigated if peer-related stress in 7th grade predicted musculoskeletal pain two years later and if this relationship was mediated by worry in 8th grade. Gender was entered as a moderator. In 7th grade , 8.4 % of adolescents reported musculoskeletal pain with some functional impairment. In 8th and 9th grade around 10 % of adolescents reported musculoskeletal pain problems , with girls reporting a higher prevalence than boys. Peer-related stress in 7th grade predicted musculoskeletal pain problems in 9th grade , mediated by worry in 8th grade. The mediation was moderated by gender: peer-related stress predicted worry for girls , but not for boys. Peer-related stress and worry seem to be involved in the development of pain over time. These factors should therefore be targeted in preventative interventions and during treatment.
