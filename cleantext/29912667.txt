  The accurate diagnosis of endometrial cancer ( EC) holds great promise for improving its treatment choice and prognosis prediction. This work aimed to identify diagnostic biomarkers for differentiating EC tumors from tumors in other tissues , as well as prognostic signatures for predicting survival in EC patients. We identified 48 tissue-specific markers using a cohort of genome-wide methylation data from three common gynecological tumors and their corresponding normal tissues. A diagnostic classifier was constructed based on these 48 CpG markers that could predict cancerous versus normal tissue with an overall correct rate of 98.3 % in the entire repository. Fifteen CpG markers associated with the overall survival ( OS) and development of EC were also identified based on the methylation patterns of the EC samples. A prognostic model that aggregated these prognostic CpG markers was established and shown to have a higher discriminative ability to distinguish EC patients with an elevated risk of mortality than the FIGO staging system and several other clinical prognostic variables. This study presents the utility of DNA methylation in identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of EC and will help improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of EC.
