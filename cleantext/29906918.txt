  We present a general framework for constructing trans-scale discrete Boltzmann models ( DBMs) for high-speed compressible flows ranging from continuum to transition regime. This is achieved by designing a higher-order discrete equilibrium distribution function that satisfies additional nonhydrodynamic kinetic moments. To characterize the thermodynamic nonequilibrium ( TNE) effects and estimate the condition under which the DBMs at various levels should be used , two measures are presented: ( i) the relative TNE strength , describing the relative strength of the ( N +1) th order TNE effects to the Nth order one; ( ii) the TNE discrepancy between DBM simulation and relevant theoretical analysis. Whether or not the higher-order TNE effects should be taken into account in the modeling and which level of DBM should be adopted is best described by the relative TNE intensity and/or the discrepancy rather than by the value of the Knudsen number. As a model example , a two-dimensional DBM with 26 discrete velocities at Burnett level is formulated , verified , and validated.
