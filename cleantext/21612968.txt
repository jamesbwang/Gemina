  Rice by-products are extensively abundant agricultural wastes from the rice industry. This study was designed to optimize experimental conditions for maximum recovery of free and bound phenolic compounds from rice by-products. Optimized conditions were determined using response surface methodology based on total phenolic content ( TPC) , ABTS radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power ( FRAP). A Box-Behnken design was used to investigate the effects of ethanol concentration , extraction time and temperature , and NaOH concentration , hydrolysis time and temperature for free and bound fractions , respectively. The optimal conditions for the free phenolics were 41 ⁻ 56 % , 40 & deg; C , 10 min , whereas for bound phenolics were 2.5 ⁻ 3.6 M , 80 & deg; C , 120 min. Under these conditions free TPC , ABTS and FRAP values in the bran were approximately 2-times higher than in the husk. However , bound TPC and FRAP values in the husk were 1.9- and 1.2-times higher than those in the bran , respectively , while bran fraction observed the highest ABTS value. Ferulic acid was most evident in the bran , whereas
