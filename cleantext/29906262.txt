  Aging is related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and is affected by environmental factors. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) is associated with adverse health outcomes; but the association of such exposure with DNA methylation aging , a novel aging marker , is unclear. Our aim was to investigate the association of PAH exposure with methylation aging. We trained and validated a methylation age predictor suitable for Chinese populations using whole blood methylation data in 989 Chinese and 160 Caucasians. We defined two aging indicators: δage , as methylation age minus chronological age; and aging rate , the ratio of methylation to chronological age. The association of PAH exposure with aging indicators was evaluated using linear regressions in three panels of healthy Chinese participants ( We developed a methylation age predictor providing accurate predictions in both Chinese individuals and Caucasian persons ( R = 0.94-0.96 , RMSE = 3.8-4.3). Among the 10 urinary metabolites that we measured , 1-hydroxypyrene and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene were associated with methylation aging independently of other OH-PAHs and risk factors; 1-unit increase in 1-hydroxypyrene was associated with a 0.53-y increase in Δage ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.18 , 0.88; false discovery rate ( FDR) We developed a methylation age predictor specific for Chinese populations but also accurate for Caucasian populations. Our findings suggest that exposure to PAHs may be associated with an adverse impact on human aging and epigenetic alterations in Chinese populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2773.
