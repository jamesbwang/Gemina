  Talin is a key component molecule of the extracellular matrix-integrin-cytoskeleton. It serves an important role in the activation of integrin , which , in turn , is known to mediate physiological and pathological processes , including cell adhesion , growth , tumorigenesis , and metastasis. In vertebrates , there are two Talin genes , Talin1 and Talin2. Talin1 is known to regulate focal adhesion dynamics , cell migration and cell invasion; however , the precise role of Talin2 in cancer remains unclear. In the present study , the functional role of Talin2 was examined in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Talin2 knockdown significantly inhibited growth , migratory capacity and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells , and promoted apoptosis. The expression levels of Talin2 in breast cancer cells and in the peritumoral normal breast tissues were also determined by immunohistochemistry. Talin2 was identified to be overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with that in the peritumoral breast tissues. In addition , the knockdown of Talin2 by specific RNA interference markedly inhibited cell growth , and caused the downregulation of the apoptotic markers , cleaved Caspase-3 and phosphorylation of poly ADP-ribose polymerase. These findings demonstrate that Talin2 expression is upregulated in human breast cancer and that downregulation of Talin2 may serve as a useful therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer.
