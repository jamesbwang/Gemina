  The Hedgehog pathway disrupting drug sonidegib is used in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. Side effects of sonidegib include anemia<symptom> , which could result either from impaired erythropoiesis or from loss of erythrocytes e.g. due to suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis , which is characterized by cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the cell surface and by cell shrinkage. Eryptosis is stimulated by cell stress , including energy depletion , hyperosmotic shock<symptom> , oxidative stress and excessive increase of cytosolic Ca2 + activity ( ( Ca2 +) i). The present study explored , whether sonidegib exerts an effect on eryptosis. Human erythrocytes have been treated with energy depletion ( glucose withdrawal for 48 hours) , hyperosmotic shock<symptom> ( addition of 550 mM sucrose for 6 hours) , oxidative stress ( addition of 0.3 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide ( tBOOH) for 50 min) or Ca2 + ionophore ionomycin ( 1 µM for 60 min) in absence and presence of sonidegib ( 2-6 µg/ ml). After treatment flow cytometry was employed to quantify phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding , and cell volume from forward scatter. Hemolysis<symptom> was estimated from the hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant. In the absence of cell stress exposure to sonidegib did not significantly modify annexin-V-binding or forward scatter , but triggered hemolysis<symptom>. Energy depletion , hyperosmotic shock<symptom> , oxidative stress and ionomycin , all markedly and significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding erythrocytes , and decreased the forward scatter. Sonidegib significantly blunted the effect of energy depletion , hyperosmotic shock<symptom> , and oxidative stress , but not of ionomycin on annexin-V-binding. Sonidegib further significantly blunted the effect of energy depletion , but not of hyperosmotic shock<symptom> , oxidative stress , and ionomycin on forward scatter. Sonidegib is a novel inhibitor of erythrocyte cell membrane scrambling following energy depletion , hyperosmotic shock<symptom> and oxidative stress.
