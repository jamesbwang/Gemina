  To evaluate the correlation between nailfold capillaroscopic ( NC) findings and the presence of interstitial lung disease ( ILD) in systemic sclerosis ( SSc) patients. We retrospectively involved 71 SSc patients , 45 patients with ILD. NC was performed in all the patients according to the standard method. The NC findings were semi-quantitatively scored , including enlarged and giant capillaries , hemorrhages<symptom> , loss of capillaries , avascular areas , ramified/bushy capillaries and disorganization of the vascular array. The demographic and clinical data collected were gender , age , presence/absence of Raynaud phenomenon ( RP) , duration of RP , serological acute phase reactants and antibodies , presence of ILD ( also evaluated the CT score for ILD) and pulmonary function parameters. Among the 71 patients , the frequency of the women was 91.5 % , the mean age was ( 52.59 ± 12.77) years , and disease duration was ( 3.00 ± 6.00) years. NC changes of the scleroderma pattern were observed in 90.1 % patients. There were 45 patients with ILD and 26 patients without ILD. The patients with ILD had significantly higher loss of capillaries score ( 0.50 ( 1.03) vs. 0.00 ( 0.43) , P = 0.003) , avascular area score ( 0.75 ( 1.24) vs. 0.25 ( 0.83) , P = 0.006) and ramified/bushy capillaries score ( 0.33 ( 0.88) vs. 0.13 ( 0.25) , P = 0.006) compared with those without ILD. Moreover , ramified/bushy capillaries score together with diffused SSc were independent risk factors for the presence of ILD. And the score of giant capillaries were significantly lower in the patients with more severe ILD group ( 0.25 ( 0.94) vs. 0.00 ( 0.28) , for the mild and severe ILD groups respectively , P = 0.019). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the scores of enlarged capillaries , hemorrhages<symptom> , or disorganization of the vascular array. Capillary deletion and severe deformity in NC were associated with the presence of ILD in SSc patients. And patients with less giant capillaries had more severe ILD involvement. These indicated that NC maybe a useful tool to evaluate ILD in SSc.
