  We study tree structures termed optimal channel networks ( OCNs) that minimize the total gravitational energy loss in the system , an exact property of steady-state landscape configurations that prove dynamically accessible and strikingly similar to natural forms. Here , we show that every OCN is a so-called natural river tree , in the sense that there exists a height function such that the flow directions are always directed along steepest descent. We also study the natural river trees in an arbitrary graph in terms of forbidden substructures , which we call k-path obstacles , and OCNs on a d-dimensional lattice , improving earlier results by determining the minimum energy up to a constant factor for every ( Formula: see text) Results extend our capabilities in environmental statistical mechanics.
