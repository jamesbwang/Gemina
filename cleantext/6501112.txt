  The medial geniculate body ( MGB) is the target of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several neural sources. Among these , the inferior colliculus ( IC) is an important nucleus in the midbrain that acts as a nexus for auditory projections , ascending and descending , throughout the rest of the central auditory system and provides both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the MGB. In our study , we assessed the relative contribution from presumed excitatory and inhibitory IC neurons to the MGB in mice. Using retrograde tract tracing with cholera<disease> toxin beta subunit ( CT & beta ;-RRB-- Alexa Fluor 594 injected into the MGB of transgenic , vesicular GABA transporter ( VGAT)- Venus mice , we quantitatively analyzed the projections from both the ipsilateral and contralateral IC to the MGB. Our results demonstrate inhibitory projections from both ICs to the MGB that likely play a significant role in shaping auditory processing. These results complement prior studies in other species , which suggest that the inhibitory tectothalamic pathway is important in the regulation of neuronal activity in the auditory forebrain.
