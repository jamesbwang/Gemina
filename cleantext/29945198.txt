  R-loops are three-stranded RNA: DNA hybrid structures essential for many normal and pathobiological processes. Previously , we generated a quantitative R-loop forming sequence ( RLFS) model , quantitative model of R-loop-forming sequences ( QmRLFS) and predicted âˆ¼ 660 000 RLFSs; most of them located in genes and gene-flanking regions , G-rich regions and disease-associated genomic loci in the human genome. Here , we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of these RLFSs using experimental data and demonstrated the high performance of QmRLFS predictions on the nucleotide and genome scales. The preferential co-localization of RLFS with promoters , U1 splice sites , gene ends , enhancers and non-B DNA structures , such as G-quadruplexes , provides evidence for the mechanical linkage between DNA tertiary structures , transcription initiation and R-loops in critical regulatory genome regions. We introduced and characterized an abundant class of reverse-forward RLFS clusters highly enriched in non-B DNA structures , which localized to promoters , gene ends and enhancers. The RLFS co-localization with promoters and transcriptionally active enhancers suggested new models for in cis and in trans regulation by RNA: DNA hybrids of transcription initiation and formation of 3D-chromatin loops. Overall , this study provides a rationale for the discovery and characterization of the non-B DNA regulatory structures involved in the formation of the RNA: DNA interactome as the basis for an emerging quantitative R-loop biology and pathobiology.
