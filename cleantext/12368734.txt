  Thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR) has become the preferred option for treatment of thoracic aortic pathology , but lack of vascular access options is a common contraindication to TEVAR. The authors report a case of a 67 year old male patient with multiple revascularisation procedures: bilateral axillofemoral bypass and thoracic aortofemoral bypass , both occluded. An anastomotic pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta developed and detected on computed tomography angiography ( CTA). A femoral artery approach could not be performed because of complete occlusion of both iliac arteries. A left subclavian artery approach was performed and through a Dacron prosthetic graft extension anastomosed to the proximal segment of the occluded axillofemoral bypass a distal component of a Zenith Alpha endograft ( Cook Â®) was successfully deployed upside down. There was a good seal<disease> without endoleaks and no complications. In patients with aortic bypass systematic follow up is important to detect anastomotic pseudoaneurysm and prevent its related complications. TEVAR may be offered for the treatment of thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> pathology even in patients with a lack of vascular access. In the absence of a standard iliofemoral approach , use of an alternative subclavian approach may be considered. The reduction of the carrier system profiles allows performance of TEVAR with safety and efficiency.
