  To investigate the cognitive profile of healthy individuals with increased Cardiovascular Risk Factors , Aging and Dementia ( CAIDE) dementia risk score and to explore whether this association is related to vascular burden and CSF biomarkers of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. Cognitively normal participants ( mean age 57.6 years) from the Gipuzkoa Alzheimer Project study were classified as having high risk ( HR; n = 82) or low risk ( LR; n = 293) for dementia according to a CAIDE score cutoff of 9. Cognitive composites were compared between groups. We explored using generalized linear models the role of HR participants obtained lower scores on executive function ( EF) ( Healthy participants at increased dementia risk based on CAIDE scores show lower performance in EF and VPC. This difference is related to
