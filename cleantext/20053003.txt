  In the present study , we investigated whether fathers ' and mothers ' parenting behavior is differentially related to parental factors ( such as age and employment) , child factors ( age and gender) as well as social support. Parents reported on their use of a broad range of parenting behaviors , including affection , responsivity , explaining , autonomy , support , rewarding , and punishing. We used survey data from the Netherlands for 1197 mothers and 903 fathers of children aged 2 to 17. Seemingly unrelated regression analyses were conducted to combine the regression results on the separate subsamples ( fathers and mothers) and to test for differences in the coefficients between those subsamples. Our expectation that the parenting behavior of fathers is more dependent on parents ' characteristics , children 's characteristics , and social support than that of mothers was only partly confirmed by the results of our analysis. In general , our results suggest that fathers ' parenting behaviors seem to be associated with parental and child characteristics and contextual factors in ways that are similar to how these factors are associated with mothers ' parenting behaviors. Results are discussed in relation to the roles and expectations associated with motherhood and fatherhood.
