  BK virus ( BKPyV)- associated nephropathy ( BKPyVAN) may affect up to 10 % of renal transplant recipients , causing graft failure in the absence of intervention. The dilemma in monitoring BKPyVAN in renal transplant patients has been that only testing urine BK viral load represents higher sensitivity ( earlier detection) but lower specificity , while testing plasma BK viral load represents lower sensitivity ( later detection) but higher specificity. However , blindly testing both urine and plasma inevitably contributes to unnecessary medical cost. We analyzed 1030 paired urine and plasma BKPyV viral load results and identified a reliable urine BKPyV viral load cutoff ( 4.0 log IU/mL) that can predict BKPyV viremia with 99.7 % negative predictive value ( NPV). We propose a cost-effective screening algorithm to first only monitor the urine BKPyV levels until the viral load reaches 4.0 log IU/mL , and then only monitor plasma with higher frequency. This approach ensures 98.7 % sensitivity of catching the earliest BKPyV viremia onset , and 100 % sensitivity of detecting the critical BKPyV viremia. In addition , we identified a urine BKPyV viral load cutoff of 6.7 log IU/mL as predictive of critical BKPyV viremia ( defined as plasma viral load > 4.0 log IU/mL) with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % NPV.
