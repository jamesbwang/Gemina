  Development of arterial dissection is thought to be an important key factor for bailout stenting in femoropopliteal disease. We aimed to evaluate the difference in dissection rate and outcomes between the treatment group with rotational atherectomy and without it. From January 2011 to October 2016 , we compared the angiography after balloon angioplasty ( BA) of de-novo , femoropopliteal , steno-occlusive lesions<symptom> whether they were treated by rotational atherectomy prior to the BA or not. Fifty-nine lesions<symptom> ( 8 occlusions; 3 involving popliteal segment; lesion<symptom> length: 86.3 ± 66.8 mm) in 44 patients ( 29 males; mean age 66.9 ± 9.7 years) were enrolled for this review. Forty-two lesions<symptom> were treated using rotational atherectomy , prior to BA while 17 were recanalized firstly by BA. Clinical and lesion<symptom> characteristics were not different between the groups. However , the rate of significant arterial dissection ( type C to F) was lower in the atherectomy group ( 88.2 % Rotational atherectomy before BA reduced the rate of significant dissection and therefore , might be a valuable option for minimizing need of bailout stenting.
