  Minimal ( or measurable) residual ( MRD) disease provides a biomarker of response quality for which there is robust validation in the context of modern intensive treatment for younger patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia<disease> ( AML). Nevertheless , it remains a relatively unexplored area in older patients with AML. The lack of progress in this field can be attributed to two main reasons. First , physicians have a general reluctance to submitting older adults to intensive chemotherapy due to their frailty and to the unfavourable biological disease profile predicting a poor outcome following conventional chemotherapy. Second , with the increasing use of low-intensity therapies ( i.e. , hypomethylating agents) differing from conventional drugs in mechanism of action and dynamics of response , there has been concomitant skepticism that these schedules can produce deep hematological responses. Furthermore , age dependent differences in disease biology also contribute to uncertainty on the prognostic/predictive impact in older adults of certain genetic abnormalities including those validated for MRD monitoring in younger patients. This review examines the evidence for the role of MRD as a prognosticator in older AML , together with the possible pitfalls of MRD evaluation in older age.
