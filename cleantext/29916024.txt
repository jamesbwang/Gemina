  Cells utilize a complex network of proteins to regulate translation , involving post-transcriptional processing of RNA and assembly of the ribosomal unit. Although the complexity provides robust regulation of proteostasis , it also offers several opportunities for translational dysregulation , as has been observed in many neurodegenerative disorders. Defective mRNA localization , mRNA sequatration , inhibited ribogenesis , mutant tRNA synthetases , and translation of hexanucleotide expansions have all been associated with neurodegenerative disease. Here , we review dysregulation of translation in the context of age-related neurodegeneration and discuss novel methods to interrogate translation. This review primarily focuses on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD) , a spectrum disorder heavily associated with RNA metabolism , while also analyzing translational inhibition in the context of related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Huntington 's disease and the translation-related pathomechanisms common in neurodegenerative disease.
