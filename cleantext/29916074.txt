  A series of optimized protocols to isolate vacuoles from both yeast and plant cells , and to characterize the purified organelles at a functional and structural level , are described. For this purpose , we took advantage of the combined use of cell fractionation techniques with different fluorescence-based approaches namely flow cytometry , fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorimetry. These protocols altogether constitute valuable tools for the study of vacuole structure and function , as well as for the high-throughput screening of drug libraries to identify new molecules that target the vacuole.
