  Brain Computer Interface ( BCI) determines the intent of the user from a variety of electrophysiological signals. These signals , Slow<symptom> Cortical Potentials , are recorded from scalp , and cortical neuronal activity is recorded by implanted electrodes. This paper is focused on design of an embedded system that is used to control the finger movements of an upper limb prosthesis using Electroencephalogram ( EEG) signals. This is a follow-up of our previous research which explored the best method to classify three movements of fingers ( thumb movement , index finger movement , and first movement). Two-stage logistic regression classifier exhibited the highest classification accuracy while Power Spectral Density ( PSD) was used as a feature of the filtered signal. The EEG signal data set was recorded using a 14-channel electrode headset ( a noninvasive BCI system) from right-handed , neurologically intact volunteers. Mu ( commonly known as alpha waves) and Beta Rhythms ( 8-30 Hz) containing most of the movement data were retained through filtering using `` Arduino Uno '' microcontroller followed by 2-stage logistic regression to obtain a mean classification accuracy of 70 %.
