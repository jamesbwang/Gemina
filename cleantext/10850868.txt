  A dog with lameness<symptom> , stifle effusion<symptom> , and osteophytes , but in which the stifle retained stability for 10 months after the onset of lameness<symptom> , was evaluated with 3T magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Imaging revealed a tear in the caudal meniscotibial ligament of the medial meniscus. Arthroscopy findings correlated well with MRI and a partial meniscectomy was subsequently carried out , without any surgery to stabilize the stifle , and lameness<symptom> resolved.
