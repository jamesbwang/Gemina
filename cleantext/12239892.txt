  Predictive processing ( PP) approaches to the mind are increasingly popular in the cognitive sciences. This surge of interest is accompanied by a proliferation of philosophical arguments , which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects of the emerging framework. In particular , the question of how to position predictive processing with respect to enactive and embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientific and philosophical merit , they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here , we first present a basic review of neuroscientific , cognitive , and philosophical approaches to PP , to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications-with a firm commitment to modular , internalistic mental representation-to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of ` body-representations ' , and finally to those which fit comfortably with radically enactive , embodied , and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing theory ( e.g. , of attention or consciousness<symptom>) must take into account this continuum of views , and associated theoretical commitments. As a final point , we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle ( FEP) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition , by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal ` representations ' arise from autopoietic self-organization. The FEP thus furnishes empirically productive process theories ( e.g. , predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.
