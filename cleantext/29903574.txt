  Accumulating evidence indicates that chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions invoke biological responses beyond their originally described function of orchestrating leukocyte trafficking. In this review we will extend the findings that chemokines participate actively in the neoplastic process , and consider the contribution of CCL5 activation of CCR5 on breast cancer cells to upregulation of anabolic metabolic events that would support the energy demands of cell replication and proliferation.
