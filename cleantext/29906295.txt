  To examine the association between TYMS 2R3R polymorphism and DPYD ( IVS) 14 +1 G > A mutation by comparing healthy subjects with colorectal cancer ( CRC) patients in the Mexican population. Genotyping of the 2R/3R was performed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and ( IVS) 14 +1 G > A mutation by real-time PCR analysis. The observed frequencies of the TYMS 2R3R polymorphism and the- ( IVS) 14 +1 G > A mutation in DPYD did not indicate an increased risk for CRC ( p > 0.05). However we observed an association of the 2R/2R ( OR 3.08 , 95 % CI 1.66-6.08 , p = 0.0017) and heterozygous ( OR 1.98 , 95 % CI 1.32-2.97 , p = 0.0012) genotypes as risk factors when comparing controls and CRC patients that were also tobacco consumers. An association between the genotype and the disease was evident. The distribution of the 2R/2R genotype and hematological toxicity ( adjusted OR 2.26 , 95 % CI 1.54-4.45 , p = 0.0259) , heterozygous ( 2R/3R) with tumor stage III-IV ( OR 1.81 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.94 , p = 0.020) and 2R/2R- 2R/3R in non-chemotherapy response CRC patients with hematological ( OR 2.3 , 95 % CI 1.21-4.4 , p = 0.014) and gastric toxicities ( OR 3.11 , 95 % CI 1.18-8.2 , p = 0.035) confirmed that this factor may significantly contribute to the CRC susceptibility. TYMS 2R3R polymorphism and the- ( IVS) 14 +1 G > A mutation in DPYD was not associated with susceptibility to CRC. However , the 2R/2R and 2R/3R genotypes of TYMS polymorphism could significantly contribute to hematological and gastric toxicity in CRC patients in this sample population.
