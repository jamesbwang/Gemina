  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is among cancers with highest incidence globally and currently ranks fourth as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It remains an urgent need for novel strategies in the management of patients with advanced CRC. Adoptive transfer of allogeneic natural killer ( NK) cells represent an attractive option in the treatment of patients with CRC. In this study , we successfully expanded NK cells from umbilical cord blood ( UCB) with membrane-bound IL-21 , termed eUCB-NK cells. eUCB-NK cells efficiently lysed CRC cell lines in vitro and secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ , TNF-α , GM-CSF and CCL3 compared with IL-2 stimulated NK cells. Adoptive transfer of these NK cells significantly inhibited the growth of HT29 xenografts , whereas LoVo tumors were not effectively controlled with eUCB-NK cells. More NK cells inside HT29 tumors , not seen in LoVo tumors , might contribute to the differences in response to eUCB-NK cells. Combination of bevacizumab can increase extravasation of adoptively transferred NK cells into the LoVo tumors and improve the therapeutic activity of eUCB-NK cells. These results justified clinical translation of this UCB-derived NK cell-based therapeutics , either used alone or combined with bevacizumab , as a novel treatment option for patients with CRC.
