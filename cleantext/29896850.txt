  In the context of post-marketing surveillance supporting public-health authorities to take evidence-based decisions to fight the spread of poor-quality medicines , the quality of antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine ( AL) medicines was assessed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC). A total of 150 samples of AL-containing products was collected from private pharmaceutical outlets in 8 main cities: Goma , Kikwit , Kinshasa , Kisangani , Lubumbashi , Matadi , Mbandaka , and Mbuji-Mayi. All drug samples were successively analyzed by visual inspection , thin-layer chromatography ( TLC) , and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) following The International Pharmacopoeia. Of the 150 collected drug samples , 3 ( 2 %) failed the visual inspection as they had shelf lives different from those of other samples with the same brand name. Four samples ( 2.7 %) did not pass the TLC test as they contained only 1 or even none of the 2 declared active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs). HPLC assays showed that 46 ( 30.7 %) samples had artemether contents below 90 % and 17 ( 11.3 %) above 110 % of the content claimed on the label. For lumefantrine , 32 ( 21.7 %) samples had contents below 90 % , and 8 ( 5.3 %) had contents above 110 %. This survey in DRC gives evidence that poor-quality antimalarial medicines are widely present. Based on 3 detection techniques , the study shows the necessity to equip developing countries with modern techniques such as HPLC , which , if combined with affordable techniques like TLC , could provide a pertinent analytical strategy to combat drug counterfeiting and poor manufacturing.
