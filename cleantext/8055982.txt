  Spontaneous pneumomediastinum ( SPM) is a rare and benign condition predominantly seen in young males. Patients present with non-specific pleuritic<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , cough<symptom> , and dyspnea<symptom>. Hence , it is difficult to diagnose in the acute setting until other serious differential diagnoses involving the integrity of the aerodigestive tract have been excluded. This results in over investigation and overtreatment until a diagnosis has been confirmed. We report a case of a 21-year-old Omani female who presented with a complaint of cough<symptom> She was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings after exclusion of hollow viscous perforation to have SPM extending to the spinal canal ( pneumorrhachis). Her condition improved following conservative management , and she was sent home after three days.
