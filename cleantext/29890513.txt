  In a multi-centre randomised controlled trial ( RCT) , we are assessing whether giving very preterm ( i.e. , born at < 32 weeks ' gestation) infants prophylactic enteral bovine lactoferrin supplementation ( 150 mg/kg/day) from shortly after birth until 34 weeks ' post-menstrual age reduces the incidence of late-onset invasive<disease> infection<disease> ( primary outcome) , all-cause mortality , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , necrotising enterocolitis<disease> , retinopathy of prematurity , and the duration of antibiotic exposure , intensive care , and hospital admission. The trial is recruiting 2,200 participants from 37 neonatal care centres in the UK over 4 years. We will undertake an economic evaluation within the RCT to evaluate cost-effectiveness and provide an estimate of incremental costs for differences in the pre-specified outcomes in primary and subgroup analyses. If a statistically significant and clinically important effect on the primary outcome is detected , we will seek further funding and approval to assess the impact of enteral lactoferrin supplementation on rates of adverse neuro-developmental outcomes in the participating infants when they are 5 years old.
