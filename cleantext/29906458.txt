  Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE) plays crucial roles not only in lipid metabolism but also in bone metabolism. Specifically ApoE4 , one of major ApoE isoforms , has been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of developing osteoporosis compared to another major isoform ApoE3. However , the detailed mechanism of how the different ApoE isoforms affect bone metabolism remains unclear. Micro-CT analyses of distal femora demonstrated severely decreased bone mass in 48-week-old female homozygous ApoE-knockout ( ApoE-KO) mice compared to age- and gender-matched wild type C57BL/6 J ( WT) mice. Physiological levels of either ApoE3 or ApoE4 protein ( 1-20 μg/ml) significantly increased the expression of osteoblast-related genes and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity of primary calvarial osteoblasts by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2) pathway in a dose-dependent manner , and ApoE3 showed greater osteoblastic induction compared to ApoE4. Furthermore , both ApoE3 and ApoE4 protein inhibited osteoclastogenesis and the expression of osteoclast-related genes of mouse bone<disease> marrow derived macrophages ( BMDM) via down regulation of c-Fos , nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 ( NFATc1) and nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) pathway. Moreover , ApoE3 showed greater inhibition of c-Fos , dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein ( DC-STAMP) , and Cathepsin K gene expression compared to ApoE4. Collectively , ApoE plays crucial roles in preserving bone mass , suggesting that targeting ApoE and its isoforms as a promising treatment candidate of both osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia.
