  We investigated the adhesion behavior of nanocomposite hydrogels ( NC gels) , consisting of unique organic ( polymer)- inorganic ( clay) network structures , toward inorganic and organic materials. The NC gels exhibit instant and strong adhesion to inorganic and organic substrates with hydrophilic porous surfaces. The NC gels instantly adhere to hydrophilic porous substrates ( e.g. , unglazed ceramic surfaces and polymer membranes<symptom>) through simple light contact. In addition , a small piece of NC gel effectively joined two substrate samples ( e.g. , concrete blocks and bricks) through lamination of the interposing NC gel. The resulting conjoined materials were unable to be separated at the gel-substrate interface; rather , the gel itself fractured upon separation , which indicates that the adhesive strength at the interface is greater than the tensile strength of the NC gel. With the exception of NC gels with very high clay concentrations ( C
