  This study presents first feasibility experiences with a new 3-dimensional ( 3D) marker clip system in clinical practice. The rate of clinical complete responses in the treatment of breast cancer patients is increasing; additionally , a change to targeted axillary dissection is being considered after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT). Consequently , marker clips are needed which are reliable and easy to handle even in the axillary lymph node system. A total of 50 patients from the Breast Care Unit of the Kliniken Essen Mitte were included. Clip marking of all 50 primary breast cancer lesions<symptom> as well as 23 lymph nodes was performed using the Tumark Vision Â® clip. Following application , the position and visibility of the marker clip were monitored and documented in 2 axes. The feasibility of the Tumark Vision clip was excellent in everyday clinical practice as none of the markers dislocated. After clip marking of the tumor region and/or suspicious lymph nodes , all Tumark Vision clips could be detected in both axes. The 3D shape could be observed in all cases after application. The new 3D-shaped marker clip seems to be a promising tool for marking breast cancer lesions<symptom> and even lymph nodes before NACT. As there are many studies ongoing to prove the feasibility of a shift from standard axillary dissection after NACT towards targeted axillary dissection , the Tumark Vision clip seems to provide good visibility even in lymph nodes after NACT. Further studies are warranted.
