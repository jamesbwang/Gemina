  Traditional quantitative and qualitative research methods inadequately capture the complexity of patients ' daily self-management. Contextual inquiry methodology , using home visits , allows a more in-depth understanding of how patients integrate immunosuppressive medication intake , physical activity , and healthy eating in their daily lives , and which difficulties they experience when doing so. This mixed-method study comprised 2 home visits in 19 purposively selected adult heart , lung , liver , and kidney transplant patients , asking them to demonstrate how they implement the aforementioned health behaviors. Meanwhile , conversations were audio-taped and photographs were taken. Audio-visual materials were coded using directed content analysis. Difficulties and supportive strategies were identified via inductive thematic analysis. We learned that few patients understood what `` sufficiently active '' means. Physical discomforts and poor motivation created variation across activity levels observed. Health benefits of dietary guidelines were insufficiently understood , and their implementation into everyday life considered difficult. Many underestimated the strictness of immunosuppressive medication intake , and instructions on handling late doses were unclear. Interruptions in routine and busyness contributed to nonadherence. We also learned that professionals often recommend supportive strategies , which patients not always like or need. This contextual inquiry study revealed unique insights , providing a basis for patient-tailored self-management interventions.
