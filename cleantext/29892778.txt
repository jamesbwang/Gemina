  The wooden Crucifix of the Santa Maria dei Servi Church in Padua was recently attributed to the great sculptor Donatello. This crucifix recently underwent a demanding restoration. In the context of a multidisciplinary study of this sculpture , several analyses were carried out ( Digital Rx , 3D scanning , CT scanning and micro-stratigraphic analysis) and the anatomical study was performed. Donatello sculpted the anatomy of this Christ realistically reproducing the human body , emphasizing some particulars , with less attention to details in the regions of the body hidden by the Crux. A swelling is well appreciable just below the lateral portion of the inguinal ligament , on the right thigh. It is a six cm wide bulge and it could be the consequence of the beating suffered by Christ before the crucifixion.
