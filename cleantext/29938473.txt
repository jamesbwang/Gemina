  Background: The incidence rate of colorectal cancer in Thailand is increasing. Hence , the nationwide screening programme with copayment is being considered. There are two proposed screening alternatives: annual fecal immunochemical test ( FIT) and once-in-10-year colonoscopy. A copayment for FIT is 60 Thai baht ( THB) per test ( ≈ 1.7 USD); a copayment for colonoscopy is 2,300 THB per test ( ≈ 65.5 USD). Methods: The willingness to pay ( WTP) technique , which is theoretically founded on a cost-benefit analysis , was used to assess an effect of copayment on the uptake. Subjects were patients aged 50-69 years without cancer or screening experience. WTP for the proposed tests was elicited. Results: Nearly two thirds of subjects were willing to pay for FIT. Less than half of subjects were willing to pay for colonoscopy. Among them , median WTP for both tests was greater than the proposed copayments. In a probit model , knowing CRC patient and presence of companion were associated with non-zero WTP for FIT. Presence of companion , female , and family history of cancer were associated with non-zero WTP for colonoscopy. After adjustment for starting price in the linear model , marital status , drinking behavior , and risk attitude were associated with WTP. None of factors was significant for colonoscopy. Uptake decreased as levels of copayment increased. At proposed copayments , the uptake rates of 59.8 % and 21.6 % were estimated for colonoscopy and FIT respectively. The demand for FIT was price inelastic; the demand for colonoscopy was price elastic. Estimates of optimal copayment were 62.1 THB for FIT and 460.2 THB for colonoscopy. At the optimal copayment , uptake rates would be 59.8 % for FIT and 42.3 % for colonoscopy.Conclusion ( s): More subjects were willing to pay for FIT than for colonoscopy ( 59.0 % versus 46.5 %). The estimated uptake rates were 59.8 % and 21.6 % for colonoscopy and FIT at the proposed copayments.
