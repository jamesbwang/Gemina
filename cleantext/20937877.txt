  DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) are highly toxic lesions<symptom> that can impair cellular homeostasis and genome stability to result in tumorigenesis for inappropriate repair. Although DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination ( HR) or non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ) , the related mechanisms are still incompletely unclear. Indeed , more and more evidences indicate that the methylation of histone lysine has an important role in choosing the pathways of DNA repair. For example , tri-methylated H3K36 is required for HR repair , while di-methylated H4K20 can recruit 53BP1 for NHEJ repair. Here , we reviewed the recent progress in the molecular mechanisms by which histone methylation functions in DNA double-strand breaks repair ( DSBR). The insight into the mechanisms of histone methylation repairing DNA damage will supply important cues for clinical cancer treatment.
