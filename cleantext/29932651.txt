  Emergence of endogenous nanoparticles in thermally processed food has aroused much attention due to their unique properties and potential biological impact. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of fluorescence nanoparticles in roasted chicken breasts<disease> , elemental composition , physicochemical properties , and their molecular interaction with human serum albumin ( HSA). Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the foodborne nanoparticles from roasted chicken were nearly spherical with an average particle size of 1.7 ± 0.4 nm. The elemental analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the composition of nanoparticles as 47.4 % C , 25.8 % O , and 26.1 % N. The fluorescence of HSA was quenched by the nanoparticles following a static mode , and the molecular interaction of nanoparticles with HSA was spontaneous ( Δ G
