  To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP)- lowering efficacy and safety of brimonidine ( 0.2 %) , brimonidine purite ( 0.15 %) , and brimonidine purite ( 0.1 %) in patients of primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG). Sixty patients of POAG with IOP > 21 mmHg were enrolled into this study for 6-week duration. The patients were randomly divided into three groups with 20 patients in each group. Group A instilled brimonidine 0.2 % , Group B instilled brimonidine purite 0.15 % , and Group C instilled brimonidine purite 0.1 % twice daily. IOP was recorded by applanation tonometry at baseline and subsequently at 2 , 4 , and 6 weeks at 9:00-10:00 am during each visit around 30 min after instillation of eye drops. Mean IOP reduction in Group A was from 25.55 ± 2.01 to 19.85 ± 2.05 mmHg at the end of study , thus resulting in fall of 5.70 mmHg ( 22.30 %) , in Group B , it decreased from 25.65 ± 2.41 to 19.55 ± 2.43 mmHg , thus resulting in fall of 6.10 mmHg ( 23.78 %) , and in Group C , it decreased from 25.80 ± 2.26 mmHg to 19.85 ± 2.16 mmHg , thus resulting in fall of 6.35 mmHg ( 24.61 %). There was no statistically significant difference in IOP-lowering efficacy of study drugs. Conjunctival hyperemia<symptom> , foreign body<symptom> sensation<symptom> , dry eye , and papillary reaction were the important side effects seen with study drugs. Brimonidine 0.2 % caused more side effects than brimonidine purite 0.15 % and brimonidine purite 0.1 %. All the three formulations of brimonidine produced statistically equal lowering of IOP in patients of POAG with reduced systemic and ocular adverse reactions with brimonidine purite 0.15 % and 0.1 %.
