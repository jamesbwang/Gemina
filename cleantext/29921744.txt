  Clozapine is considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs for treating treatmentresistant schizophrenia. However , side effects of clozapine include agranulocytosis and , less commonly , cardiovascular disease , which is occasionally fatal. We describe a 56-year-old woman who developed clozapine-related paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia<symptom> during clozapine dose titration and had a recurrence despite being treated with verapamil. For treatment-resistant schizophrenia , a slow titration of the clozapine dose is necessary , and potential cardiac side-effects should be monitored.
