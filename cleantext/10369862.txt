  Copy number variation ( CNV) has been implicated in the genetics of multiple human<disease> diseases<disease>. Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA) and 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome<disease> ( 22q11 .2 DS) are two of the most common diseases which are caused by DNA copy number variations. Genetic diagnostics for these conditions would be enhanced by more accurate and efficient methods to detect the relevant CNVs. Competitive PCR with limited deoxynucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs) and high-resolution melting ( HRM) analysis was used to detect 22q11 .2 DS , SMA and SMA carrier status. For SMA , we focused on the copy number of SMN1 gene. For 22q11 .2 DS , we analyzed CNV for 3 genes ( CLTCL1 , KLHL22 , and PI4KA) which are located between different region-specific low copy repeats. CFTR was used as internal reference gene for all targets. Short PCR products with separated Tms were designed by uMelt software. One hundred three clinical patient samples were pretested for possible SMN1 CNV , including carrier status , using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA) commercial kit as gold standard. Ninety-nine samples consisting of 56 wild-type and 43 22q11 .2 DS samples were analyzed for CLTCL1 , KLHL22 , and PI4KA CNV also using MLPA. These samples were blinded and re-analyzed for the same CNVs using the limited dNTPs PCR with HRM analysis and the results were completely consistent with MLPA. Limited dNTPs PCR with HRM analysis is an accurate method for detecting SMN1 and 22q11 .2 CNVs. This method can be used quickly , reliably , and economically in large population screening for these diseases.
