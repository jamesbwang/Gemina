  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide accounting for around 70 % of all cases. There is currently no treatment for AD beyond symptom management and attempts at developing disease-modifying therapies have yielded very little. These strategies have traditionally targeted the peptide Aβ , which is thought to drive pathology. However , the lack of clinical translation of these Aβ-centric strategies underscores the need for diverse treatment strategies targeting other aspects of the disease. Metal dyshomeostasis is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases such as AD , Parkinson 's disease , and frontotemporal dementia , and manipulation of metal homeostasis has been explored as a potential therapeutic avenue for these diseases.
