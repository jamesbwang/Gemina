  Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. It is known that there are many factors , either genetic or environmental factors , involved in PD , but the mechanism of PD is still not fully understood. Several animal models have been established to study the mechanisms of PD. Among these models , Drosophila melanogaster has been utilized as a valuable model to get insight into important features of PD. Drosophila melanogaster possesses a well-developed dopaminergic ( DA) neuron system which is known to play an important role in PD pathogenesis. The well understanding of DA neurons from early larval through adult stage makes Drosophila as a powerful model for investigating the progressive neurodegeneration in PD. Besides , the short life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster serves an advantage in studying epidemiological features of PD. Most of PD symptoms can be mimicked in Drosophila model such as progressive impairment in locomotion , DA neuron degeneration , and some other non-motor symptoms. The Drosophila models of PD , therefore , show a great potential in application for PD genetic and drug screening.
