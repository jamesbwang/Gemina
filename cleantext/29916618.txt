  Smoking prevalence among health care workers is higher in comparison with general population and the prevalence of women who smoke is higher than among men. In the prevention strategies the multimedia campaign may be a positive impact on the fight against tobacco. Objective. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the last Italian campaign against smoking ( Il fumo fammale) in the health care women workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Latium and Sicily ( Italy) in 2015 , through an interview on memories and impressions about the spots and after a new vision of the spot and eventually other comments. 357 individuals entered the study , 204 female health care workers and 153 from the general population. The female health care workers were more skeptical than the general population. The impressions aroused in the healthcare workers versus the general population were: sadness ( OR = 2.96; IC95 %: 1.17-7.49) , indifference ( OR = 5.57; IC95 %: 2.43-12.77); while a cue to reflect was more considered from general population than health care workers ( OR = 0.13; IC95 %: 0.07-0.23). The female professionals health referred the main characteristics of the spot as no original , no impactful , no persuasive and boring too. In conclusion the multimedia campaign to fight against the smoking should be useful , but the psico-behavioural factors have applied and considered when it is implemented; to reduce the tobacco consumption in the healthcare workers can make them an example for the people of healthy life styles and they are a start up of prevention mechanism too. Furthermore it is important to consider the healthcare professional 's opinions for future healthy communications and multimedia campaign on tobacco harm.
