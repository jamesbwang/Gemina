  Association between psoriasis severity and cerebro- and cardiovascular comorbidities has rarely been investigated. We aimed to investigate differences in cerebro- and cardiovascular comorbidities by psoriasis severity. Using Swedish nationwide health-care registers , new adult users of anti-psoriatic drugs ( 2007-2013) with a recorded diagnosis of psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis<disease> or a filled prescription for calcipotriol were included. Psoriasis severity was based on the type of anti-psoriatic treatment ( topical/mild , non-biologic systemic/moderate-to-severe , and biologics/ severe). Age standardized prevalence rates of cerebro- and cardiovascular comorbidities and their risk factors were compared between the groups. We found that severe psoriasis patients ( N = 2147) were younger than moderate-to-severe ( N = 11,919) or mild ( N = 70,796) patients ( median 44 , 52 , and 55 years). Prevalence of hypertension was 29.9 % , 32.6 % , and 36.5 % , myocardial infarction was 2.5 % , 2.3 % , and 1.8 % , and stroke was 2.4 % , 2.2 % , and 1.1 % in mild , moderate-to-severe , and severe psoriasis patients , respectively. Diabetes prevalence was 7.6 % in mild , 8.0 % in moderate-to-severe , and 10.7 % in severe psoriasis. Myocardial infarction and stroke were less common in patients with severe psoriasis while , despite being younger , they had a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension.
