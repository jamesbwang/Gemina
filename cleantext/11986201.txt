  Iron is suggested to play a detrimental role in the progression of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). The kidney recycles iron back into the circulation. However , the localization of proteins relevant for physiological tubular iron handling and their potential role in CKD remain unclear. We examined associations between iron deposition , expression of iron handling proteins and tubular injury in kidney biopsies from CKD patients and healthy controls using immunohistochemistry. Iron was deposited in proximal ( PT) and distal tubules ( DT) in 33 % of CKD biopsies , predominantly in pathologies with glomerular dysfunction , but absent in controls. In healthy kidney , PT contained proteins required for iron recycling including putative iron importers ZIP8 , ZIP14 , DMT1 , iron storage proteins L- and H-ferritin and iron exporter ferroportin , while DT only contained ZIP8 , ZIP14 , and DMT1. In CKD , iron deposition associated with increased intensity of iron importers ( ZIP14 , ZIP8) , storage proteins ( L- , H-ferritin) , and/or decreased ferroportin abundance. This demonstrates that tubular iron accumulation may result from increased iron uptake and/or inadequate iron export. Iron deposition associated with oxidative injury as indicated by heme oxygenase-1 abundance. In conclusion , iron deposition is relatively common in CKD , and may result from altered molecular iron handling and may contribute to renal injury.
