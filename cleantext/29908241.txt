  Environmental conditions , such as stress and environmental enrichment ( EE) , influence predisposition to alcohol use/abuse; however , the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To assess the effect of environmental conditions on the initial rewarding effects of alcohol , we examined conditioned place-preference ( CPP) to alcohol following exposure to EE in mice. Since social context is a major factor contributing to initial alcohol-drinking , we also assessed the impact of EE on the levels of the `` social neuropeptide '' oxytocin ( OT) and its receptor , OTR. Finally , we assessed the effect of pharmacological manipulations of the oxytocinergic system on EE-induced alcohol CPP. While EE increased sociability and reduced anxiety-like behaviors , it caused a âˆ¼ 3.5-fold increase in alcohol reward compared to controls. EE triggered profound neuroadaptations of the oxytocinergic system; it increased hypothalamic OT levels and decreased OTR binding in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory nuclei of the brain. Repeated administration of the OT analogue carbetocin ( 6.4 mg/kg/day) mimicked the behavioral effects of EE on ethanol CPP and induced similar brain region-specific alterations of OTR binding as those observed following EE. Conversely , repeated administration of the OTR antagonist L,369-899 ( 5 mg/kg/day) during EE exposure , but not during the acquisition of alcohol CPP , reversed the pronounced EE-induced ethanol rewarding effect. These results demonstrate for the first time , a stimulatory effect of environmental enrichment exposure on alcohol reward via an oxytocinergic-dependent mechanism , which may predispose to alcohol abuse. This study offers a unique prospective on the neurobiological understanding of the initial stages of alcohol use/misuse driven by complex environmental-social interplay.
