  Poor<symptom> mental health status is more prevalent in women and may be related to poor hypertension outcomes and increased hospital inpatient visits. This study aims to find the association between mental health status and hypertension in women and the combined effect of mental health status and hypertension on hospital inpatient visits in women in the U. S. The household component ( HC) of 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys ( MEPS) was analyzed ( n = 9,137). Kessler ( K6) scale for mental health status ( poor , good/excellent) , hypertension ( yes , no) , and hospital inpatient visits ( yes , no) were examined. A combined effect variable for mental health status and hypertension was created. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted and adjusted odds ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. After adjusting for confounders , women who reported poor mental health had significantly higher odds of hypertension compared to women who reported good/excellent mental health ( AOR = 1.39 , 95 % CI = 1.16 , 1.68). Further , women who reported hypertension coupled with poor mental health had higher odds of having hospital inpatient visits compared to women who reported no hypertension coupled with good/excellent mental health in the adjusted analysis ( AOR = 3.03 , 95 % CI = 1.96 , 4.69). There is a significant association between mental health status and hypertension in women. Further , poor mental health status coupled with hypertension leads to increase hospital inpatient visits for women. It is important that health professionals focus on utilizing available screening tools to assess mental health status of women for early detection and to manage the disorder.
