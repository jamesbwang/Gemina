  This study aimed to investigate whether adjunctive inspiratory muscle training ( IMT) can enhance the well-established benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR) in patients with COPD. 219 patients with COPD ( FEV No significant differences between the intervention group ( n = 89) and the control group ( n = 85) in improvements in 6MWD were observed ( 0.3 m , 95 % CI -13 to 14 , p = 0.967). Patients who completed assessments in the intervention group achieved larger gains in inspiratory muscle strength ( effect size: 1.07 , p < 0.001) and endurance ( effect size: 0.79 , p < 0.001) than patients in the control group. 75 s additional improvement in endurance cycling time ( 95 % CI 1 to 149 , p = 0.048) and significant reductions in Borg dyspnoea score at isotime during the cycling test ( 95 % CI -1.5 to -0.01 , p = 0.049) were observed in the intervention group. Improvements in respiratory muscle function after adjunctive IMT did not translate into additional improvements in 6MWD ( primary outcome). Additional gains in endurance time and reductions in symptoms of dyspnoea were observed during an endurance cycling test ( secondary outcome) TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01397396; Results.
