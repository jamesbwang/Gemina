  Enzymatic destruction of adipose tissue has been achieved by encapsulation of lipase into the polymeric microcapsules. Adipose tissue destruction was delayed while lipase is encapsulated comparing with the direct lipase action as demonstrated by optical microscopy and optical coherence tomography in in vitro studies. Raman spectroscopy confirms that triglycerides in fat tissue were cleaved into free fatty acids , glycerol , and possible di- and monoglyceride residues. The results underpin the concept of local and controlled treatment of tissues via encapsulation. Effect of lipase encapsulation into the polymeric microcapsules on adipose tissue destruction compared to free lipase application.
