  Intracellular symmetry breaking plays a key role in wide range of biological processes , both in single cells and in multicellular organisms. An important class of symmetry-breaking mechanisms relies on the cytoplasm/membrane redistribution of proteins that can autocatalytically promote their own recruitment to the plasma membrane. We present an analytical construction and a comprehensive parametric analysis of stable localized patterns in a reaction-diffusion model of such a mechanism in a spherical cell. The constructed patterns take the form of high-concentration patches localized into spherical caps , similar to the patterns observed in the studies of symmetry breaking in single cells and early embryos.
