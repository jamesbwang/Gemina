  The mineralization-front theory is historically rooted in mineralization research fields for many decades. This theory is widely used to describe mineralization events in both osteogenesis and dentinogenesis. However , this model does not provide enough evidence to explain how minerals are propagated from the pulp-end dentin to dentin-enamel junction ( DEJ). To address this issue , we modified the current research approaches by
