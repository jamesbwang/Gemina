No gender or age differences concerning the items of behavior ( PHBQ-AS) were found. The quality of postoperative recovery ( PRiC) in girls was lower , with higher levels of nausea<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> , coldness , and headache<symptom> compared to the boys. Children < 6 years of age reported higher levels of dizziness<symptom> and lower sleep quality and lower general health.
