  Total joint arthroplasty ( TJA) remains the highest expenditure in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) budget. One model to control cost is the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement ( CJR) model. There has been no published literature to date examining the efficacy of CJR on value-based outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and sustainability of a multidisciplinary care redesign for total joint arthroplasty under the CJR paradigm at an academic tertiary care center. We implemented a system-wide care redesign , affecting all patients who underwent a total hip or total knee arthroplasty at our academic medical center. The main study outcomes were cost ( to CMS) , discharge destination , complications and readmissions , and length of stay ( LOS); these were measured using the 2017 initial CJR reconciliation report , as well as our institutional database. The study included 1536 patients ( 41 % Medicare). Per-episode cost to CMS declined by 19.5 % to 11 % below the CMS-designated national target. Home discharge increased from 62 % to 87 %. CMS readmissions declined from 15 % to 6 %; major complications decreased from 2.3 % to 1.9 %; and LOS declined from 3.6 to 2.1 days. A mandatory episode-based bundled-payment program can induce favorable changes to value-based metrics , improving quality and outcomes for health-care consumers. Quality and value were improved in this study , evidenced by lower 90-day episode cost , more home discharges , lower readmissions and complications , and shorter LOS. This approach has implications not just for CMS , but for private payers , corporate health programs , and fixed-budget health-care models.
