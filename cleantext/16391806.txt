  This study aimed to explore the clinical correlation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase ( TS) and runt-related transcription factor 1 ( RUNX1) in patients with postoperative stage II and III gastric cancer ( GC). Samples were obtained from 661 patients with postoperative stage II and III GC. TS ( rs34743033) and RUNX1 ( rs2014300) were genotyped in 261 patients who received postoperative basic platinum and fluorouracil chemotherapy regimens and 400 patients who did not accept chemotherapy. TS ( rs34743033) variant genotypes significantly prolonged the median overall survival ( OS) time compared to the patients who only received adjuvant chemotherapy ( HR 1.604 , 95 % CI 1.068-2.410 , These preliminary results indicated that the two polymorphisms had a significant effect on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. TS ( rs34743033) and RUNX1 ( rs2014300) may be used as biomarkers to predict prognosis and select chemotherapy regimens in GC patients.
