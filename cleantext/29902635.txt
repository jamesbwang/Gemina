  Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) donor-specific antibodies are key serum biomarkers for assessing the outcome of transplanted patients. Measuring their active concentration , i.e. the fraction that really interacts with donor HLA , and their affinity could help deciphering their pathogenicity. Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) is recognized as the gold-standard for measuring binding kinetics but also active concentrations , without calibration curves. SPR-based biosensors often suffer from non-specific binding ( NSB) occurring with the sensor chip surface and the immobilized targets , especially for complex media such as human serum. In this work we show that several serum treatments such as dialysis or IgG purification reduce NSB but insufficiently for SPR applications. We then demonstrate that the NSB contribution to the SPR signal can be eliminated to determine precisely and reliably the active concentration and the affinity of anti-HLA antibodies from patients ' sera. This was achieved even at concentrations close to the limit of quantification of the method , in the 0.5-1 nM range. The robustness of the assay was demonstrated by using a wide range of artificially generated NSB and by varying the density of the targets captured onto the surface. The assay is of general interest and can be used with molecules generating strong NSB , as far as a non-cognate target structurally close to the target can be captured on the same flow cell , in a different binding cycle. Compared with current fluorescence-based methods that are semi-quantitative , we expect this SPR-based assay to help better understanding anti-HLA antibodies pathogenicity and improving organ recipients ' management.
