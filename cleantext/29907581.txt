  To assess the effect of empagliflozin on bone fractures and bone mineral density in patients with type 2 diabetes in pooled placebo-controlled trial data and a head-to-head study versus glimepiride. Pooled data were analyzed from patients who were randomized 1:1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg , empagliflozin 25 mg , or placebo in phase I-III clinical trials. Data were also analyzed from the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial in which patients received empagliflozin 25 mg or glimepiride as an add-on to metformin for 104 weeks with a 104-week extension. Bone fracture adverse events ( AEs) were evaluated through a search of investigator-reported ( nonadjudicated) events. In the pooled analysis , bone fracture AEs were reported in 119 of 4,221 ( 2.8 %) , 105 of 4,196 ( 2.5 %) , and 123 of 4,203 ( 2.9 %) patients in the empagliflozin 10 mg , empagliflozin 25 mg , and placebo groups , respectively ( rates of 1.55 , 1.36 , and 1.69/ 100 patient-years , respectively). In the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial , bone fracture AEs were reported in 31 of 765 ( 4.1 %) patients receiving empagliflozin 25 mg and in 33 of 780 ( 4.2 %) patients receiving glimepiride ( rates of 1.28 and 1.40/ 100 patient-years , respectively). Empagliflozin did not increase the risk of bone fracture compared with placebo in a pooled analysis of > 12,000 patients or compared with glimepiride in a 4-year head-to-head study.
