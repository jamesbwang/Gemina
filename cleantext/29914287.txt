  Successfully implementing pharmacogenomics into routine clinical practice requires an efficient process to order genetic tests and report the results to clinicians and patients. Lack of standardized approaches and terminology in clinical laboratory processes , ordering of the test and reporting of test results all impede this workflow. Expert groups such as the Association for Molecular Pathology and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium have published recommendations for standardizing laboratory genetic testing , reporting and terminology. Other resources such as PharmGKB , ClinVar , ClinGen and PharmVar have established databases of nomenclature for pharmacogenetic alleles and variants. Opportunities remain to develop new standards and further disseminate existing standards which will accelerate the implementation of pharmacogenomics.
