  In addition to being influenced by the environment , the indoor air pollution in hospitals may be associated with specific compounds emitted from various products used , health care activities and building materials. This study has enabled assessment of the chemical and microbiological concentrations of indoor air in two French hospitals. Based on an integrated approach , the methodology defined aims to measure concentrations of a wide range of chemical compounds ( > 50 volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds) , particle concentrations ( PM
