  Cinacalcet is an effective treatment for renal hyperthyroidism when traditional medical therapy has failed. We studied the impact of pre-operative cinacalcet administration on post-surgical outcomes. A retrospective analysis was performed of patients from 2002 to 2017 diagnosed with renal hyperparathyroidism requiring parathyroidectomy to evaluate the need for post-operative supplementation and outcomes. 102 patients were identified; 34 patients were treated with cinacalcet prior to undergoing parathyroidectomy. The cinacalcet treatment cohort ( CT) demonstrated a greater duration of renal replacement therapy ( p = 0.03) relative to the untreated cohort ( NC). NC had greater proportion receiving peritoneal dialysis ( p = < 0.0001) compared to other forms of renal replacement , greater pre-operative PTH levels ( p = 0.001) and greater decrease in PTH after resection ( p = 0.0086). Post-operative vitamin D supplementation was more frequent in the CT group ( p = 0.02). After propensity matching for pre-operative PTH and duration of renal replacement therapy , there were no differences in post-operative supplementation or outcomes. Cinacalcet patients may have advanced disease. These patients have longer duration of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and higher PTH levels. After propensity matching , no significant differences were noted in terms of need for supplementation or outcomes.
