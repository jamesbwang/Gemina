  To evaluate clinical , demographic , and histopathological characteristics of pigmented lesions<symptom> of the oral mucosa. A cross-sectional study was conducted over a 64-year period. Information was collected from medical charts , and all archived histopathological specimens with diagnoses of any pigmented lesion<symptom> were retrieved. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. A total of 34,127 archived specimens were reviewed , revealing 458 ( 1.34 %) pigmented lesions<symptom> , of which 230 were melanocytic and 228 nonmelanocytic. Most patients were females ( 74.2 %) , white-skinned ( 49.1 %) , in the third and seventh decades of life ( mean of 45 years). Most lesions<symptom> were macular ( 59.8 %) , followed by plaques and nodules<symptom> ( 4.8 %) , measuring 0-5 mm ( 41.9 %). Cheek mucosa ( 21.0 %) , alveolar mucosa ( 16.6 %) , and gingiva ( 11.8 %) were the most commonly affected sites. Amalgam tattoo was applied in 212 cases ( 46.3 %) , followed by melanotic macule ( 22.9 %) and nevus ( 20.5 %). Other diagnoses included racial pigmentation , exogenous pigmentation , melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy , melanoma , melanoacanthoma , smoker 's melanosis , and heavy metal pigmentation. Pigmented lesions<symptom> represent an uncommon diagnosis in oral pathology routines. The most frequent entities are amalgam tattoo , melanotic macule , and nevus. Patients are usually middle-aged women presenting a small , long-lasting , macular lesion<symptom> on the cheek mucosa.
