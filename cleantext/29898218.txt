  Recent studies have shown that Friedewald underestimates low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) at lower levels , which could result in undertreatment of high-risk patients. A novel method ( Martin/Hopkins) using a patient-specific conversion factor provides more accurate LDL-C levels. However , this method has not been tested in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) inhibitor-treated patients. To investigate accuracy of 2 different methods for estimating LDL-C levels ( Martin/Hopkins and Friedewald) compared with gold standard preparative ultracentrifugation ( PUC) in patients with low LDL-C levels in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk ( FOURIER) trial. The FOURIER trial was a randomized clinical trial of evolocumab vs placebo added to statin therapy in 27564 patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The patients ' LDL-C levels were assessed at baseline , 4 weeks , 12 weeks , 24 weeks , and every 24 weeks thereafter , and measured directly by PUC when the level was less than 40 mg/dL per the Friedewald method ( calculated as non-HDL-C level- triglycerides/5). In the Martin/Hopkins method , patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( VLDL-C) ratios were determined and used to estimate VLDL-C , which was subtracted from the non-HDL-C level to obtain the LDL-C level. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol calculated by the Friedewald and Martin/Hopkins methods , with PUC as the reference method. For this analysis , the mean ( SD) age was 62.7 ( 9.0) years; 2885 of the 12 742 patients were women ( 22.6 %). A total of 56624 observations from 12742 patients had Friedewald , Martin/Hopkins , and PUC LDL-C measurements. The median difference from PUC LDL-C levels for Martin/Hopkins LDL-C levels was -2 mg/dL ( interquartile range ( IQR) , -4 to 1 mg/dL) and for Friedewald LDL-C levels was -4 mg/dL ( IQR , -8 to -1 mg/dL; P < .001). Overall , 22.9 % of Martin/Hopkins LDL-C values were more than 5 mg/dL different than PUC values , and 2.6 % were more than 10 mg/dL different than PUC levels. These were significantly less than respective proportions with Friedewald estimation ( 40.1 % and 13.3 %; P < .001) , mainly because of underestimation by the Friedewald method. The correlation with PUC LDL-C was significantly higher for Martin/Hopkins vs Friedewald ( ρ , 0.918 ( 95 % CI 0.916-0.919) vs ρ , 0.867 ( 0.865-0.869) , P < .001). In patients achieving low LDL-C with PCSK9 inhibition , the Martin/Hopkins method for LDL-C estimation more closely approximates gold standard PUC than Friedewald estimation does. The Martin/Hopkins method may prevent undertreatment because of LDL-C underestimation by the Friedewald method. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01764633.
