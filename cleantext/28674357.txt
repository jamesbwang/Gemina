  As suggested by the 2012 KDIGO guidelines , persistent elevation of serum creatinine > 3.5 mg/dl ( > 309 μmol/l) ( or an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m is one of contradictions for the use of immunosuppressive therapy in membranous nephropathy. A 45-year-old man with membranous nephropathy negative for serum anti-phospholipase-A2-receptor antibody , showed no response to corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. He progressed to chronic kidney disease stage 4 ( CKD4) under tacrolimus and relapsed after withdrawal. The patient received repeated renal biopsy , comfirming the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. He was treated with successfully four times with lose-dose ( 180 mg/m every 2-3 months) rituximab ( RTX) depending on his B cell counts , aiming to remain at 0-5 cells/μl. The patient was followed-up for almost 6 years. He achieved a partial remission at 11 months and a complete remission of the nephritic range of proteinuria<symptom> at 34 months following infusion of RTX. RTX was well tolerated and the patient 's renal function improved. He had no edema<symptom> and his dosage of corticosteroids could be discontinued. This case strongly suggested that rituximab has promising therapeutic significance , even in patients progressing to CKD4.
