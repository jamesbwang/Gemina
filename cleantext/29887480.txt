  A correct measurement of the QT interval in the out-of-hospital setting is important whenever the long QT syndrome<disease> ( LQTS) is suspected or a therapy might lead to drug-induced LQTS ( diLQTS) because QT interval monitoring in the initial days of therapy could alert to dangerous QT prolongation. We explored whether automated QTc measurements ( BGM) by BodyGuardian ™ ( BG) , a wearable remote monitoring system , are sufficiently reliable compared to our own manual measurements ( MM) performed on the same beats during 12‑lead Holter recordings in LQTS patients ( pts) and in healthy controls. We performed 351 measurements in 20 LQTS pts and 16 controls. MM and BGM were compared by a Bland-Altman plot ( BAp). High values of BAp indicate large differences between measurements. In all 36 subjects QTc was 446 ± 41 and 445 ± 47 ms in MM and BGM , respectively. The mean ± SE BAp was -1.4 ± 1.8 ms for QTc in all subjects , 8.3 ± 2.3 and -7.2 ± 2.5 ms respectively in controls and LQTS. The disagreement between BGM and MM < 15 ms in all , in controls , and in LQTS was respectively 57 % , 63 % and 54 %. Among controls , there were only 3/132 false positive measurements ( BGM QTc > 470 ms when MM QTc < 440 ms) in 3 different subjects. Among LQTS , there were 10/219 false negative measurements ( BGM QTc < 440 ms when MM QTc > 470 ms) in 6 pts , but only two had multiple false negative values. This wearable monitoring system reliably identifies a prolonged QT interval and probably also subjects at risk for diLQTS.
