  Bone is a common metastatic site of cancer. Bone metastasis reduces life expectancy and results in serious symptoms and complications such as bone pain , pathological fractures , and spinal cord compression , decreasing quality of life by restricting sleep and mobility. Treatment for bone metastasis includes drugs ( pure analgesics , hormones , cytotoxic chemotherapy , and bisphosphonates , among others) , external radiation therapy , surgery , and radionuclide therapy using bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Particulate radiation with α- or β-rays is used as a bone-targeting radiopharmaceutical in radionuclide therapy. β-Emitters have lower energy and a longer range than α-emitters and have less tumoricidal activity and deliver more radiation to adjacent normal tissue. Therefore , the main therapeutic effect of bone-targeting β-emitters such as
