  Although particulate matter ( PM) is composed of various chemicals , investigations regarding the toxicity that results from mixing the substances in PM are insufficient. In this study , the effects of low levels of three PAHs ( benz ( a) anthracene , benzo ( a) pyrene , and dibenz ( a , h) anthracene) on Ni toxicity were investigated to assess the combined effect of Ni-PAHs on the environment. We compared the difference in cell mortality and total glutathione ( tGSH) reduction between single Ni and Ni-PAHs co-exposure using A549 ( human alveolar carcinoma). In addition , we measured the change in Ni solubility in chloroform that was triggered by PAHs to confirm the existence of cation-π interactions between Ni and PAHs. In the single Ni exposure , the dose-response curve of cell mortality and tGSH reduction were very similar , indicating that cell death was mediated by the oxidative stress. However , 10 μM PAHs induced a depleted tGSH reduction compared to single Ni without a change in cell mortality. The solubility of Ni in chloroform was greatly enhanced by the addition of benz ( a) anthracene , which demonstrates the cation-π interactions between Ni and PAHs. Ni-PAH complexes can change the toxicity mechanisms of Ni from oxidative stress to others due to the reduction of Ni
