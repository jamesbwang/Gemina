  This paper proposes a phase definition , named the vector field phase , which can be defined for systems with arbitrary finite dimension and is a monotonically increasing function of time. The proposed definition can properly quantify the dynamics in the flow direction , often associated with the null Lyapunov exponent. Numerical examples that use benchmark periodic and chaotic oscillators are discussed to illustrate some of the main features of the definition , which are that ( i) phase information can be obtained either from the vector field or from a time series , ( ii) it permits not only detection of phase synchronization but also quantification of it , and ( iii) it can be used in the phase synchronization of very different oscillators.
