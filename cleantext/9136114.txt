  Reproduction is a complex physiological process that is regulated by multiple genes and pathways. Compared with studies of common livestock , fewer studies of genes related to the fertility of rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been reported , and the molecular mechanism of their high productivity is still poorly understood. To identify candidate genes associated with development and prolificacy in rabbits , we analyzed gene expression differences among the ovaries of mature Californian rabbit ( LC) , and mature ( HH) and immature Harbin white rabbit ( IH) using digital gene expression technology. We detected 885 and 321 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in comparisons between HH/IH and HH/LC , respectively. The functions of the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were determined by GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis. The results suggest that most of the DEGs between the mature and immature developmental stages were predominantly associated with DNA replication , cell cycle , and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation , and most were up-regulated in the IH group compared with the HH group. The DEGs involved in disparate fecundities between HH and LC were associated with reproduction , fructose and mannose metabolism , steroid hormone biosynthesis , and pyruvate metabolism. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of changes in the regulatory network in ovary at different developmental stages and in different fertility of rabbit.
