  The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of single short implants , less than 8 mm in length , placed in the posterior area. A total of 128 patients ( 75 male and 53 female , mean age: 52.6 ± 11.2 years) with 154 implants participated. Implant marginal bone loss , and survival and success rates were measured. The mean follow-up period was 51.35 ± 24.97 months. A total of 128 implants , 8 mm in length , were placed in patients who had mean marginal bone loss of 0.75 mm. These implants had a survival rate of 95.3 %. Twenty-six implants , 7 mm in length , were placed in areas with a mean marginal bone loss of 0.78 mm and had a survival rate of 96.2 %. Both marginal bone loss and survival rate were not statistically different among the groups. In the maxilla , 34 implants showed a mean marginal bone loss of 0.77 mm and a survival rate of 97.1 %. In the mandible , 120 implants showed a mean marginal bone loss of 0.75 mm and a survival rate of 95.0 %. The average marginal bone loss around all implants was 0.76 ± 0.27 mm at the last follow-up review after functional loading. The survival rate was 95.6 % and success rate was 93.5 %. In our study , single short implants less than 8 mm in length in the posterior areas had favorable clinical outcomes.
