  The olfactory epithelium ( OE) of vertebrates is a highly regenerative neuroepithelium , maintained under normal condition by a population of stem and progenitor cells- globose basal cells ( GBCs) that also contribute to epithelial reconstitution after injury. However , aging of the OE often leads to neurogenic exhaustion<symptom>- the disappearance of both GBCs and olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs). Aneuronal tissue may remain as olfactory , with an uninterrupted sheet of apically arrayed microvillar-capped sustentacular cell , or may undergo respiratory metaplasia. We have generated a transgenic mouse model for neurogenic exhaustion<symptom> using OMP-driven Tet-off regulation of the A subunit of
