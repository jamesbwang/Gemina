  In this study Aesculus indica<pathogen> fruit was subjected to isolation of phytochemicals. Two antioxidants quercetin and Mandelic acid were isolated in pure state. The free radical scavenging and acetyl choline esterase inhibitory potential of the crude extract and sub fractions were also determined. The antioxidant capacity of crude extract , fractions and isolated compounds were determined by DPPH and ABTS methods. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method was used to estimate the total phenolic contents and were found to be 78.34 ± 0.96 , 44.16 ± 1.05 , 65.45 ± 1.29 , 37.85 ± 1.44 and 50.23 ± 2.431 ( mg/g of gallic acid) in crude extract , ethyl acetate , chloroform , n-hexane and aqueous fractions respectively. The flavonoid concentration in crude extract , ethyl acetate , chloroform , n-hexane and aqueous fraction were; 85.30 ± 1.20 , 53.80 ± 1.07 , 77.50 ± 1.12 , 26.30 ± 1.35 and 37.78 ± 1.25 ( mg/g of quercetin) respectively. The chloroform fraction was more potent against enzymes , acetyl choline esterase and butyryl choline esterase ( IC The Aesculus indica<pathogen> fruit extracts showed antioxidant and anticholine esterase inhibitory potentials. Two bioactive compounds were isolated in the pure form ethyl acetate fraction. From results it was concluded that the fruit of this plant could be used to minimize oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species.
