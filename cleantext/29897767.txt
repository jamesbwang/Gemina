  Understanding the diffusion of gold nanorods ( AuNRs) and their composites in dispersion is important at fundamental level and in fields as diverse as material science , nanobiotechnology to drug delivery. The translational and rotational diffusion of AuNRs decorated with thermoresponsive poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes having hydrophilic and hydrophobic end groups was investigated in the dilute regime by dynamic light scattering. The same series of functionalized AuNRs were studied in the isotropic concentrated dispersions by high-resolution NMR diffusometry. The dependence of translational and rotational diffusivity upon molecular weight and polymer end group were measured as a function of temperature in the region of the brush phase transition. The effective hydrodynamic radius of AuNR composites proved to be the most sensitive quantity to the temperature-induced phase transition of brushes , allowing the evaluation of the brush thickness in the swollen and collapsed states.
