  Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous time-keeping processes in eukaryotes with a period of ~ 24 hr. Light is perhaps the main environmental cue ( zeitgeber) that affects several aspects of physiology and behaviour , such as sleep/wake cycles , orientation of birds and bees , and leaf movements in plants. Temperature can serve as the main zeitgeber in the absence of light cycles , even though it does not lead to rhythmicity through the same mechanism as light. Additional cues include feeding patterns , humidity , and social rhythms. At the molecular level , a master oscillator orchestrates circadian rhythms and organizes molecular clocks located in most cells. The generation of the 24 hr molecular clock is based on transcriptional regulation , as it drives intrinsic rhythmic changes based on interlocked transcription/translation feedback loops that synchronize expression of genes. Thus , processes and factors that determine rhythmic gene expression are important to understand circadian rhythms. Among these , the poly ( A) tails of RNAs play key roles in their stability , translational efficiency and degradation. In this article , we summarize current knowledge and discuss perspectives on the role and significance of poly ( A) tails and associating factors in the context of the circadian clock.
