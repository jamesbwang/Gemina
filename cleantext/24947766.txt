  The traditional surgical approach for removing a symptomatic urachal remnant is via a lower midline laparotomy and infraumbilical incision or a laparoscopic approach with umbilicoplasty. We reviewed our experience with umbilicus-sparing laparoscopic urachal remnant excision in a single-center study and evaluated its efficacy versus open approach ( OA). This study was a retrospective study. Between March 2012 and September 2016 , 32 consecutive patients with symptomatic urachal remnants underwent the umbilicus-sparing laparoscopic approach ( USLA) ( n = 17) or OA ( n = 15). The efficacy , recovery , and long-term outcomes were reviewed. Our Results showed that the clinical characteristics of the patients in each group , such as age , gender , body mass index ( BMI) , and disease type , had no significant differences ( P > .05). No significant difference was found in the surgical procedure times ( 76.1 ± 15.4 vs 69.2 ± 13.9 minutes , P = .189) and intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 29.4 ± 13.3 vs 32.2 ± 12.9 mL , P = .543) between the USLA groups and OA groups. However , the mean postoperative hospital stay ( patients with bladder cuff excision: 4.1 ± 1.8 vs 6.1 ± 1.4 days , P = .040 and patients without bladder cuff excision: 1.8 ± 0.5 vs 3.6 ± 0.8 days , P < .001) and the time of full recovery ( 11.2 ± 1.9 vs 15.6 ± 3.1 days , P < .001) , the USLA group were both significantly shorter than that of the OA group. No infected recurrence and malignant transformation had occurred at a mean follow-up of 32.4 ± 8.1 and 34.1 ± 8.8 months in USLA group and OA group , respectively. In conclusion , to minimize the morbidity of radical excision , umbilicus-sparing management of benign urachal remnants in adults is a safe and efficacious alternative with superior cosmetic outcomes , postoperative recovery compared with an OA or umbilicoplasty.
