  The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( S-ICD) lacks the antitachycardia pacing ( ATP) capability of tranvenous ICDs ( TV-ICD). S-ICD patient selection can be challenging as some patients may benefit from ATP. We aim to identify clinical predictors of ATP benefit , in order to improve patient selection for S-ICD or TV-ICD therapy. De novo single- and dual-chamber TV-ICD patients implanted between March 2011 and December 2015 were included. Ventricular arrhythmias terminated by ATP and not followed by a shock<symptom> were considered successful ATP therapy. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to assess the adjusted effect of multiple predictors for appropriate ATP and shock<symptom> therapy. Note that 431 patients were included with a median follow-up of 26 months. Ninety-nine patients ( 23 %) received appropriate ATP therapy , which terminated the arrhythmia in 67 %. A history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( NSVT) or monomorphic VT ( MVT) was the only predictor of appropriate ATP therapy in the multivariable model ( hazard ratio ( HR) 2.73 , P < 0.001). Sixty-five of 221 patients with a history of NS ( VT) received appropriate ATP ( 29 %) versus 24 patients ( 11 %) without a history NS ( VT) ( P < 0.001). A secondary prevention indication was the only predictor in the multivariate model for appropriate shock<symptom> therapy ( HR 1.82 , P = 0.05). A history of NSVT or MVT is a significant predictor for appropriate and successful ATP therapy. One in three patients with NSVT or MVT received appropriate ATP versus one in 10 patients without a history of NSVT or MVT over a 2-year period of follow-up.
