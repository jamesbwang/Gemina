  Tumor cells alter their metablosim to meet their demand for macromolecules , support a high rate of proliferation as well as cope with oxidative stress. The transcription factor yin yang 1 ( YY1) is upregulated in various types of tumors and is crucial for tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. However , its role in tumor cell metabolic reprogramming is poorly understood. Here we show that YY1 alters tumor cell metabolism by activating glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) , the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. By stimulating the pentose phosphate pathway , YY1 enhanced production of nucleotides and DNA synthesis , decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels , and promoted antioxidant defense by supplying increased reducing power in the form of NADPH. Importantly , YY1-mediated regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway in tumor cells occurred not through p53 , but rather through direct activation of G6PD transcription by YY1. Regulation of pentose phosphate pathway activity through G6PD was strongly related to YY1-induced proliferation of tumor cells and tumorigenesis. Together , our results describe a novel role for YY1 in regulating G6PD in a p53-independent manner , which links its function in tumorigenesis to metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells.
