  Tobacco mosaic virus coat protein was modified with a small molecular fluorous ponytail at specific sites , and self-assembled into spherical nanoparticles through fluorous interaction induced self-assembly. By loading the anti-cancer drug cisplatin through metal-ligand coordination , this spherical assembly with high stability has potential as a drug carrier.
