  Improvement of dyslipidemia is an important benefit of bariatric surgery. The benefits of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) among dyslipidemia are still a matter of debate. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study between 2010 and 2013. Obese patients undergoing LSG , with recorded dyslipidemia at admission and a follow-up for at least 1 year , were included for analysis. Demographic characteristics , medication in use , and a complete lipid profile were collected before surgery. After surgery , weight was controlled at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months. Lipid profile was re-evaluated 1 year after surgery. Patients were divided according to weight<symptom> loss<symptom> into two groups: ( A) adequate weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and ( B) inadequate weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Lipid profile evolution was then compared between groups. One hundred seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Pre-op mean BMI was 45.13 Â± 7.5 kg/m LSG produces an improvement in lipid profile , with a significant increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL , triglycerides , and non-HDL-C.
