  Manipulating the relaxation pathways of excited states and understanding mechanisms of photochemical reactions present important challenges in chemistry. Here we report a unique zinc ( II) complex exhibiting unprecedented interplay between the excitation-wavelength-dependent emission , thermally activated delayed fluorescence ( TADF) and excited state intramolecular proton transfer ( ESIPT). The ESIPT process in the complex is favoured by a short intramolecular OH... N hydrogen bond. Synergy between the excitation-wavelength-dependent emission and ESIPT arises due to heavy zinc atom favouring intersystem crossing ( isc). Reverse intersystem crossing ( risc) and TADF are favoured by a narrow singlet-triplet gap , Î”EST ~ 10 kJ mol-1. These results provide the first insight into how a proton transfer system can be modified to show a synergy between the excitation-wavelength-dependent emission , ESIPT and TADF. This strategy offers new perspectives for designing ESIPT- and TADF emitters exhibiting tuneable excitation-wavelength-dependent luminescence.
