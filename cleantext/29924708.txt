  Echolocating bats must process temporal streams of sonar sounds to represent objects along the range axis. Neuronal echo-delay tuning , the putative mechanism of sonar ranging , has been characterized in the inferior colliculus ( IC) of the mustached bat , an insectivorous species that produces echolocation calls consisting of constant frequency ( CF) and frequency modulated ( FM) components , but not in species that use FM signals alone. This raises questions about the mechanisms that give rise to echo-delay tuning in insectivorous bats that use different signal designs. To investigate whether stimulus context may account for species differences in echo-delay selectivity , we characterized single unit responses in the IC of awake , passively listening FM-bats , Eptesicus fuscus , to broadcasts of natural sonar call-echo sequences , which contained dynamic changes in signal duration , interval , spectro-temporal structure and echo-delay. In E. fuscus , neural selectivity to call-echo delay emerges in a population of IC neurons when stimulated with call-echo pairs presented at intervals mimicking those in a natural sonar sequence. To determine whether echo-delay selectivity also depends on the spectro-temporal features of individual sounds<symptom> within natural sonar sequences , we studied responses to computer-generated echolocation signals that controlled for call interval , duration , bandwidth , sweep-rate and echo-delay. A sub-population of IC neurons responded selectively to the combination of the spectro-temporal structure of natural call-echo pairs and their temporal patterning within a dynamic sonar sequence. These new findings suggest that the FM-bat 's fine control over biosonar signal parameters may modulate IC neuronal selectivity to the dimension of echo-delay.
