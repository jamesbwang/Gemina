  After rotator cuff repair , some patients have ongoing problems significant enough to warrant presentation to a clinic for reassessment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this cohort of patients was more likely to have a healed rotator cuff. We hypothesized that patients who had an unscheduled postoperative visit were more likely to have a healed rotator cuff than those who did not have an unscheduled postoperative visit. Cohort study; Level of evidence , 3. A total of 321 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were evaluated; of these , 50 patients had an unscheduled return to clinic that included an ultrasound assessment of the cuff repair within 4 months postoperatively. Repair integrity was evaluated in all patients at 6 months postoperatively via ultrasonography. The failure-to-heal rate was greater in patients who had an unscheduled assessment ( 8/50; 16 %) than in those who did not ( 14/275; 5 %) ( Patients who had an unscheduled clinic visit after rotator cuff repair had a 16 % chance of a failed healing response , whereas those who did not have an unscheduled visit had a 5 % rate of failed healing. The risk of a failed healing response was greater if the tear was larger than 4 cm
