  The oceanographic features of the Nordic Seas , situated between Iceland and Svalbard , have been extensively studied over the last decades. As well , the Nordic Seas hydrothermal systems situated on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge System have received an increasing interest. However , there is very little knowledge on the microbial communities inhabiting the water column of the Nordic Seas , and nothing is known about the influence of the different water masses and hydrothermal plumes on the microbial community structures. In this study , we aimed at characterizing the impact of hydrothermal plumes on prokaryotic and T4-like viral communities around the island<disease> of Jan Mayen. To this end , we used 16S rRNA-gene and
