  The complex ultrastructure of the meniscus determines its vital functions for the knee , the lower extremity , and the body.The most recent concise , reliable , and valid classification system for meniscal tears is the International Society of Arthroscopy , Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine ( ISAKOS) Classification , which takes into account the subsequent parameters: tear depth , tear pattern , tear length , tear location/rim width , radial location , location according to the popliteal hiatus , and quality of the meniscal tissue.It is the orthopaedic surgeon 's responsibility to combine clinical information , radiological images , and clinical experience in an effort to individualize management of meniscal tears , taking into account factors related to the patient and lesion.Surgeons should strive not to operate in most cases , but to protect , repair or reconstruct , in order to prevent early development of osteoarthritis by restoring the native structure , function , and biomechanics of the meniscus.Currently , there are three main methods of modern surgical management of meniscus tears: arthroscopic partial meniscectomy; meniscal repair with or without augmentation techniques; and meniscal reconstruction. Meniscus surgery has come a long way from the old slogan , `` If it is torn , take it out! '' to the currently accepted slogan , `` Save the meniscus! '' which has guided evolving modern treatment methods for meniscal tears. This last slogan will probably constitute the basis for newer alternative biological treatment methods in the future.
