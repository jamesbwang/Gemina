  The protein kinase C ( PKC) family of serine/ threonine kinases has been shown to play active roles as either suppressors or promoters of carcinogenesis in different types of tumors. Using antibodies that preferentially recognize the active conformation of classical PKCs ( cPKCs) , we have previously shown that in breast cancer samples the expression levels of cPKCs were similar in estrogen receptor-positive ( ER
