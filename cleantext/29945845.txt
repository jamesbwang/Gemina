  Postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( POPF) remains the most common complication after distal pancreatectomy. The International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery definition of POPF is used worldwide. Recently , an update of the definition was published. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical impact of the update. An international retrospective validation study , including patients who underwent DP ( 2005 -2016) in 5 centers was performed. Distribution of complications amongst POPF grades were compared for the old and updated definition. In total , 1089 patients were included. The incidence of POPF decreased with the updated definition from 47 % to 24 % ( P < 0.01) , largely because a downgrade of grade A and grade B into biochemical leak. Comparable morbidity was seen in the old and updated ` no POPF group ' ( Clavien - Dindo 3 5 % vs. 6 % P = 0.320 and hospital stay ( 7 vs. 7 days P = 0.301). The change in definition of POPF grade B resulted in more Clavien- Dindo 3 ( 38 % vs. 51 %) P < 0.01) and longer hospital stay ( 9 ( 9 -13) vs. 9 days ( 7 -15) P < 0.01) in the updated ` grade B group '. Applying the updated POPF definition showed improved discrimination between grades and should therefore be used to report POPF after DP.
