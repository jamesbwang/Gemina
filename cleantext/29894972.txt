  Archived soil samples can provide important information on the history of environmental contamination and by comparison with recently collected samples , temporal trends can be inferred. Little previous work has addressed whether mercury ( Hg) concentrations in soil samples are stable with long-term storage under standard laboratory conditions. In this study , we have re-analyzed using cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy a set of archived soil samples that ranged from relatively pristine mountainous sites to a polluted site near a non-ferrous metal smelter with a wide range of Hg concentrations ( 6.7-6485 Î¼g kg
