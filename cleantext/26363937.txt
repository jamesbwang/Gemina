  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 's food insecurity questionnaire was administered to 155 children ( 77 African American , 65 White , 13 `` Other '' ( 7 Hispanic; 6 mixed races)) in grade 4 twice , 28-32 days apart. Test-retest reliabilities were modest and somewhat similar for assessment mode ( classroom , interview) and subgroup variables ( gender , race , socioeconomic status , academic achievement , body mass index percentile , social desirability). As academic achievement increased , White and Other children reported less food insecurity , and African-American children reported slightly less. As social desirability increased , White and African-American children reported slightly more food insecurity , and Other children reported substantially more. Although the questionnaire may be acceptable for use with diverse groups of children in grade 4 , validation is needed.
