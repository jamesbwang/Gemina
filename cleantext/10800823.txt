  Systemic-to-pulmonary artery collateral networks commonly develop in patients with single-ventricle physiology and chronic hypoxemia<symptom>. Although these networks augment pulmonary blood flow , much of the flow is ineffective and contributes to cardiac volume loading. This volume loading can have detrimental effects , especially for single-ventricle patients. Some data suggest that occluding collaterals may improve outcomes after subsequent operations , especially when the volume of collateral flow is significant. Traditional practice has been to coil occlude the feeding vessel. We perform particle embolization of these collateral networks for two primary reasons. First , access to the feeding vessel is not blocked as collaterals may redevelop. Second , particles occlude the most distal connections. Thus , embolization with particles should be considered as an alternative to coil occluding the proximal feeding vessel.
