  Spermatogenesis in mammals is a very complex , highly organized process , regulated in part by testosterone and retinoic acid ( RA). Much is known about how RA and testosterone signaling pathways independently regulate this process , but there is almost no information regarding whether these two signaling pathways directly interact and whether RA is crucial for steroidogenic cell function. This study uses a transgenic mouse line that expresses a dominant-negative form of RA receptor Î± ( RAR-DN) and the steroidogenic cell-specific Cre mouse line ,
