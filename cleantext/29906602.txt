  Despite the fact that vaccination is an effective primary prevention strategy for the containment of influenza<disease> outbreaks , health policymakers have shown great concern over the enormous costs involved in universal immunization , particularly when resources are limited. A two-arm cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA) was conducted that took into account the aspect of herd immunity. The analysis used a study cohort of 100000 residents with a demographic make-up identical to that of the underlying population in Taipei County , Taiwan , during the epidemic influenza<disease> season of 2001-2002. The parameters embedded in the dynamic process of infection were estimated through the application of the newly proposed susceptible-infection-complication-recovery ( SICR) model to the empirical data , in order to compute the number of deaths and complications averted due to universal vaccination compared to no vaccination. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve ( CEAC) given maximum amount of willingness-to-pay ( WTP) were calculated to delineate the results of the two-arm CEA. The incremental costs involved in the vaccinated group as compared to the unvaccinated group were $ 1195 to reduce one additional complication and $ 805 to avert one additional death , allowing for herd immunity. The corresponding figures were higher for the results without considering herd immunity. Given the ceiling ratio of WTP equal to $ 10000 ( approximately two-thirds of GDP) , the probability of the vaccination being cost-effective for averting death was 100 % and for averting complications was 96.7 %. Universal vaccination against seasonal influenza<disease> was found to be very cost-effective , particularly when herd immunity is considered. The probability of being cost-effective was almost certain given the maximum amount of WTP within two-thirds of the GDP.
