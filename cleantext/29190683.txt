  To establish the likely accuracy of pH testing to identify gastric aspirates at different pH cut-offs to confirm nasogastric tube placement. This prospective observational study included a convenience sample of adult patients who had two ( one fresh and one frozen) gastric and oesophageal samples taken during gastroscopy or two bronchial and saliva samples taken during bronchoscopy. The degree of observer agreement for the pH of fresh and frozen samples was indicted by kappa ( Ninety-seven patients had a gastroscopy , 106 a bronchoscopy. There was complete agreement between observers in 57/92 ( 62 %) of the paired fresh and frozen gastric samples ( The diagnostic accuracy of pH â‰¤ 5.5 to differentiate gastric from non-gastric samples was low , regardless of whether patients were taking antacids or not. Due to the limited accuracy of the pH sticks and the operators ' ability to differentiate colorimetric results , there is an urgent need to identify more accurate and safer methods to confirm correct placement of nasogastric tubes.
