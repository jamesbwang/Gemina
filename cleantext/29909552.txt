  Traditional open approach is an efficient way to treat lumbar spinal stenosis ( SS) combined with disk herniation ( DH); however , risk factors such as advanced age , osteoporosis etc. are associated with the complications after the surgery. This study aims to analyze the early clinical and radiological outcomes of treatment on SS&DH by using newly developed minimal invasive TESSYS-ISEE technique. Patients with limp and unilateral lower limb radiculopathy underwent minimal invasive surgery by using TESSYS-ISEE technique. The visual analogue scale score ( VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) were evaluated before operation and 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months after surgery. The clinical global outcomes were also evaluated using modified MacNab criteria after surgery. A total of 32 cases underwent operation by using TESSYS-ISEE technique from December 2016 to December 2017. The mean age for the study group was 53.9 ± 11.14 years and the ratio between male and female was 1.29:1; Mean follow-up of the study was 7.78 ± 3.48 months and mean estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 11.41 ± 4.79 mL per-level. VAS leg score improved from 8.44 ± 0.98 to 2.18 ± 0.75 ( P < 0.001) , VAS back score improved from 4.44 ± 0.95 to 1.57 ± 0.54 ( P < 0.001) , and ODI improved from 73.88 ± 5.95 to 29.04 ± 7.48 ( P < 0.001). The success rate was 90.7 %. There were no serious complications during follow-up. Two patients experienced dysesthesia and one patient required revision surgery. It is safe and minimal-invasively to treat SS&DH by using TESSYS-ISEE technique. However , potential complications still require careful consideration and further evaluation.
