  Epigenetics confers adaptability and survival advantage to an organism. Most epigenetic processes demonstrate memory and heritability. DNA methylation is an epigenetic process that adds imprints which can be inherited during cell division and across generations. DNA methylation adds an additional level of information to the basic DNA sequence and can influence chromatin organization and the function of the DNA sequence. In bacteria , it works as a defence strategy and preserves genome integrity. DNA methylation in eukaryotes has been implicated in a large number of cellular regulatory processes and is implied in development , differentiation , life style diseases and cancer. Mammals have an intricate DNA methylation machinery with dNMT1 , 3A and 3B enzymes. The human X chromosome inactivation , an example of differential regulation of homologous chromosomes , is known to involve many epigenetic processes with intricate interactions of lncRNAs , miRNAs and DNA methylation.
