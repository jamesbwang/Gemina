  Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT) was originally conceived as a volumetric imaging method. Quickly , OCT images went beyond structural data and started to provide functional information about an object enabling for example visualization of blood flow or tissue elasticity. Minimal or no need for system alterations make functional OCT techniques useful in performing multimodal imaging , where differently contrasted images are produced in a single examination. We propose a method that further extends the current capabilities of OCT and requires no modifications to the system. Our algorithm provides information about the sample 's Group Velocity Dispersion ( GVD) and can be easily applied to any OCT dataset acquired with a Fourier domain system. GVD is calculated from the difference in material 's optical thickness measured from two images obtained for different spectral ranges. Instead of using two separate light sources , we propose to apply a filter-based , numerical procedure that synthesizes two spectra from one broadband spectrum. We discuss the limitations of the method and present GVD values for BK7 and sapphire and ocular media: cornea and aqueous humour of a rat eye. Results corroborate previous measurements using two different light sources.
