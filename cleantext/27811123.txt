  18-Fluoride labeled sodium fluoride ( Na-18-F) positron emission tomography with computer tomography ( PET/CT) has a better sensitivity and specificity than whole body bone scan ( WBBS) in detecting osseous metastatic prostate cancer. We performed a pilot study of 20 men to examine what level of impact Na-18-F PET/CT has on management plans when used for staging newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Twenty men were prospectively enrolled into the study in South Australia. Men were eligible if they had newly diagnosed , untreated , and biopsy-confirmed intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer ( D'Amico classification). WBBS and Na-18-F PET/CT scans were performed within 1 week of each other. Following review of the WBBS , treatment type and intent was documented by the treating urologist. The Na-18-F PET/CT scan was then reviewed. The impact of the Na-18-F PET/CT was measured on whether treatment modality or intent was subsequently altered: high impact = treatment intent or modality was changed; medium impact = treatment modality was modified; low impact = no change in treatment. In 18 men ( 90 %) , the WBBS and Na-18-F PET/CT were negative for osseous metastases. In one man ( 5 %) , the WBBS demonstrated widespread osseous metastases which were similarly demonstrated on the Na-18-F PET/CT. One man ( 5 %) had a normal WBBS; however , the Na-18-F PET/CT demonstrated widespread osseous metastases. Subsequently , in 19 men ( 95 %) , the results of the two scans were congruent and the addition of the Na-18-F PET/CT scan demonstrated a low impact on management. In one man ( 5 %) , the addition of the Na-18-F PET/CT had a high impact as treatment type and intent was altered. Our pilot study is the first of its kind in Australia , and our findings suggest that Na-18-F PET/CT is a safe and feasible modality for staging prostate cancer. However , its true impact on prostate cancer management warrants further investigation.
