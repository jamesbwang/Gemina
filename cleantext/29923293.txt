  A combination of nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy ( NRVS) , FTIR spectroscopy , and DFT calculations was used to observe and characterize Fe-H/D bending modes in CrHydA1 ( FeFe)- hydrogenase Cys-to-Ser variant C169S. Mutagenesis of cysteine to serine at position 169 changes the functional group adjacent to the H-cluster from a- SH to- OH , thus altering the proton transfer pathway. The catalytic activity of C169S is significantly reduced compared to that of native CrHydA1 , presumably owing to less efficient proton transfer to the H-cluster. This mutation enabled effective capture of a hydride/deuteride intermediate and facilitated direct detection of the Fe-H/D normal modes. We observed a significant shift to higher frequency in an Fe-H bending mode of the C169S variant , as compared to previous findings with reconstituted native and oxadithiolate ( ODT)- substituted CrHydA1. On the basis of DFT calculations , we propose that this shift is caused by the stronger interaction of the- OH group of C169S with the bridgehead- NH- moiety of the active site , as compared to that of the- SH group of C169 in the native enzyme.
