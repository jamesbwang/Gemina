  It is argued that the knowledge argument fails against externalist theories of mind. Enclosing Mary and cutting her off from some properties denies part of the physical world to Mary , which has the consequence of denying her certain kinds of physical knowledge. The externalist formulation of experience is shown to differ in vehicle , content , and causal role from the internalist version addressed by the knowledge argument , and is supported by results from neuroscience. This means that though the knowledge argument has some force against material internalists , it misses the mark entirely against externalist accounts.
