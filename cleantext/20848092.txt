  It is becoming evident that microglia , the resident immune cells of the central nervous system ( CNS) , are active contributors in neurological disorders. Nevertheless , the impact of microgliosis on neuropathology , behavior and clinical decline in neuropathological conditions remains elusive. A mouse model lacking multifunctional protein-2 ( MFP2) , a pivotal enzyme in peroxisomal Î²-oxidation , develops a fatal disorder characterized by motor problems similar to the milder form of human<disease> disease<disease>. The molecular mechanisms underlying neurological decline in men and mice remain unknown. The hallmark of disease in the mouse model is chronic proliferation of microglia in the brain without provoking neuronal loss or demyelination. In order to define the contribution of
