  Paradigm-shifting studies in the mouse have identified tissue macrophage heterogeneity as a critical determinant of immune responses. In contrast , surprisingly little is known regarding macrophage heterogeneity in humans. Macrophages within the mouse heart are partitioned into CCR2- and CCR2 + subsets with divergent origins , repopulation mechanisms , and functions. Here , we demonstrate that the human myocardium also contains distinct subsets of CCR2- and CCR2 + macrophages. Analysis of sex-mismatched heart transplant recipients revealed that CCR2- macrophages are a tissue-resident population exclusively replenished through local proliferation , whereas CCR2 + macrophages are maintained through monocyte recruitment and proliferation. Moreover , CCR2- and CCR2 + macrophages have distinct functional properties , analogous to reparative CCR2- and inflammatory CCR2 + macrophages in the mouse heart. Clinically , CCR2 + macrophage abundance is associated with left ventricular remodeling and systolic function in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients. Collectively , these observations provide initial evidence for the functional importance of macrophage heterogeneity in the human heart.
