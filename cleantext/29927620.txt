  Medical anthropology overwhelmingly reveals vulnerability as a problem of powerlessness. Vulnerable groups and individuals are those exposed to the pernicious effects of inequalities , injustices , and oppressive political realities. This largely pejorative stance , we argue , simplifies the place of vulnerability within human experience and in relation to the body , health and illness. By showcasing a range of interlocking vulnerabilities , this paper reveal the spectrum of positive and negative vulnerabilities that affect health and recovery. Through the concept of vulnerable articulations , this paper argues that health and illness experiences simultaneously create and require a range of different interconnected vulnerabilities , some of them harmful , and some of them life affirming. Ethnographically , this paper explore the concept of vulnerable articulations through two contrasting case studies: a group of British and New Zealand nuclear test veterans seeking compensation from the state , and clients of equine therapy in New Zealand. These case studies reveal that understanding human vulnerability requires a close attention to how people navigate between the diverse vulnerabilities that they face , and that attaining well-being often involves harnessing positive vulnerabilities in order to lessen the effects of damaging vulnerabilities.
