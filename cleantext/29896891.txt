  Successful ageing with diabetes is challenged by co-morbidities , which may present barriers to self-care. Currently , measurement of physical and cognitive status is not part of routine care of the older person with diabetes , and these are not taken into account when devising the treatment plan. To describe a novel approach that integrates cognitive and physical assessment into the routine evaluation of the older person with diabetes and the tailor-made treatment plan devised accordingly. To provide estimates of the relative contribution of cognitive and physical disabilities in this population. Cognitive and physical assessments were added to the standard evaluation. A composite measure of cognitive and of physical status categorizing each individual to intact , mild , or severe impairment was generated. In addition , all recommendations provided were categorized and tabulated. Of 119 individuals , over the age of 60 with type 2 diabetes who were referred because of difficulties in managing their disease , 16 % and 3 % of individuals met the criteria for severe cognitive/physical impairment , respectively , and 42 % and 21 % met the criteria for mild cognitive/physical impairment; 72 % , 12.5 % , 61 % received recommendations related to intensification of physical activity , cognitive treatment , change in pharmacological agents , respectively. 25 % were referred for further emotional treatment. These data suggest that a substantial proportion of individuals with diabetes over the age of 60 may have cognitive/physical impairment. It highlights the importance of measuring these as part of the multidisciplinary evaluation and being able to provide a tailor made treatment plan.
