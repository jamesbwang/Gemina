  The development of high-titre inhibitory antibodies ( inhibitors) against factor VIII ( FVIII) remains a challenge in the management of patients with haemophilia A ( HA). Patients with high-titre inhibitors are more likely to experience uncontrolled bleeding , physical disability from chronic arthropathy and premature death compared with those without this complication. Immune tolerance induction ( ITI) , utilizing repeated infusions of FVIII , is an effective therapeutic approach to eliminating inhibitory antibodies. This strategy can eradicate FVIII inhibitors , so that FVIII-specific tolerance is induced. However , patients undergoing ITI are still vulnerable to the development of serious and/or repeated bleeding events. The efficacy of bypassing agents in preventing bleeding episodes has been widely proven in patients with HA and inhibitors to FVIII. Evidence suggests that reducing bleeding during ITI can also shorten the time to tolerance. There are concerns with the use of bypassing agents , including the cost of treatment , short half-life , management of non-responders and the risk of thrombosis. Despite these concerns , and the still limited evidence from prospective studies and consensus reports , the use of prophylaxis with bypassing agents during ITI has been gaining support. This review presents a rationale and current data supporting the use of prophylactic bypassing agents as effective and safe therapies to reduce the incidence of joint<symptom> bleeding<symptom> due to inhibitors and improve quality of life in patients with HA undergoing ITI.
