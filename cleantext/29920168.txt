  The rural-urban migration of family members often leads to a higher probability of older people living alone , and minimizes family/social networks , which increases old age loneliness. In this study , we describe the existence of loneliness among older adults in Nigeria and its factors , aiming to inform the development of interventions for reducing old age loneliness. We adopted a descriptive phenomenological approach to the qualitative design , purposefully selecting and conducting face-to-face interviews with 12 older adults aged 58-88. We analyzed the data using a Thematic Analysis. Results of the analysis revealed three major themes: perception and existence of loneliness , factors for loneliness , and context-dependent coping strategies. We described results based on the theory of interactionist perspectives of loneliness and drew policy implications from this. Participants drew interesting associations between loneliness , decreasing family/social networks , recent family ties structures , disability-associated ageing , and lack of social programs , and suggested context-dependent coping strategies to reduce loneliness.
