  The performance of electrode materials in lithium-ion ( Li-ion) , sodium-ion ( Na-ion) and related batteries depends not only on their chemical composition but also on their microstructure. The choice of a synthesis method is therefore of paramount importance. Amongst the wide variety of synthesis or shaping routes reported for an ever-increasing panel of compositions , spray-drying stands out as a versatile tool offering demonstrated potential for up-scaling to industrial quantities. In this review , we provide an overview of the rapidly increasing literature including both spray-drying of solutions and spray-drying of suspensions. We focus , in particular , on the chemical aspects of the formulation of the solution/suspension to be spray-dried. We also consider the post-processing of the spray-dried precursors and the resulting morphologies of granules. The review references more than 300 publications in tables where entries are listed based on final compound composition , starting materials , sources of carbon etc..
