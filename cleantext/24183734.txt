  Evaluation of the impact of lower uterine segment involvement ( LUSI) in type II endometrial cancer , and mutational profile of uterine papillary serous carcinomas ( UPSC). Retrospective cohort study comparing patients with type II endometrial cancer with LUSI to patients without LUSI. Genes commonly implicated in carcinogenesis were analyzed in a subgroup of 42 patients with UPSC using next generation sequencing. 83 patients with type II endometrial cancer were included in the study , of these , LUSI was diagnosed in 31.3 %. During a median follow-up of 45.5 months , patients with LUSI developed more local and distant recurrences ( local: 19.2 % vs. 3.5 % , Type II endometrial cancers presenting in the LUS have a significantly worse prognosis and this might be associated with a unique mutational profile.
