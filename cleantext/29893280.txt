  By precalculation of an entire set of planning solutions for protons , penalizing them and providing a graphical navigator tool ( Automated Treatment Planning ( ATP)) , we aim to improve the efficiency of the planning procedure for uveal melanoma ( UM) and make it independent of treatment planner experience. A phase space of plans is evaluated by transforming the eye model in each gaze angle , calculating cumulative dose-volume histograms for each position , and defining a dose-volume constraint for each considered structure. The final result is a map of the plan phase space , displaying how many criteria are fulfilled for each gaze angle. To test its usability and performance , ATP was used retrospectively on 48 UM patients treated with protons. In 36 of 48 cases ( 75 %) , the planning result was either the same ( 13 of 48 , 27 %) or comparable ( 23 of 48 , 48 %). In 11 of 48 evaluated cases ( 23 %) , ATP plans showed improvements. In 1 case ( 2 %) the patient 's visual acuity had been impaired , and an optimization was not possible. We have developed a dose calculation and planning engine that prepares a set of treatment plans covering a wide range of theoretical clinically feasible gaze angles for a given patient , by precalculating the dose distributions for each gaze angle. By considering different structures and adapting their constraints , the identification of the optimal gaze angle can be realized. With a better understanding of the dose-volume constraints and the development of strategies to react to the trade-offs between considered structures , ATP may lead to a complete automation of the planning process for UM treated with proton therapy.
