  To investigate the associations of muscular strength in adolescence with later disability pension ( DP) , across different body mass index ( BMI) categories and in combination with aerobic fitness. This prospective cohort study consisted of males aged 16-19 years , recruited from the Swedish military conscription register between 1969 and 1994. A total of 1 212 503 adolescents met all the inclusion criteria and were therefore included in the analyses. Knee extension , handgrip and elbow flexion strength and aerobic fitness ( bicycle ergometer test) were measured during conscription. Causes of DP were retrieved from the Social Insurance Office between years 1971 and 2012 ( average follow-up time: 29.6 years). Knee extension strength in adolescence was inversely associated with men 's risk of obtaining DP due to all causes ( HR 1.40 , 95 % CI 1.36 to 1.44 for lowest vs highest strength quintile). Thus , muscular weakness<symptom> was associated with DP. The risk associated with low muscular strength differed between specific causes of DP and the strongest associations were found for psychiatric , nervous system and other causes ( HRs between 1.47 and 1.90 for lowest vs highest quintile). Being strong was associated with lower DP risk across BMI categories and being unfit , weak and obese was associated with the highest DP risk ( HR 3.70 , 95 % CI 2.99 to 4.58). There was a strong association between muscular weakness<symptom> and disability. A combination of muscular weakness<symptom> and low aerobic fitness was an especially important risk factor for disability. This adds weight<symptom> to call for muscular strength and fitness enhancing exercise for adolescents in all BMI categories.
