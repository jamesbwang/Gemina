  The development of a cytomegalovirus ( CMV) vaccine has become a top priority due to its potential cost-effectiveness and associated public health benefits. However , there are a number of challenges facing vaccine development including the following: ( 1) CMV has many mechanisms for evading immune responses , and natural immunity is not perfect , ( 2) the immune correlates for protection are unclear , ( 3) a narrow range of CMV hosts limits the value of animal models , and ( 4) the placenta is a specialized organ formed transiently and its immunological status changes with time. In spite of these limitations , several types of CMV vaccine candidate , including live-attenuated , DISC , subunit , DNA , vectored , and peptide vaccines , have been developed or are currently under development. The recognition of the pentameric complex as the major neutralization target and identification of various strategies to block viral immune response evasion mechanisms have opened new avenues to CMV vaccine development. Here , we discuss the immune correlates for protection , the characteristics of the various vaccine candidates and their clinical trials , and the relevant animal models.
