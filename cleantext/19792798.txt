  We report results for solitons in models of waveguides with focusing or defocusing saturable nonlinearity and a parity-time ( ( Formula: see text))- symmetric complex-valued external potential of the Scarf-II type. The model applies to the nonlinear wave propagation in graded-index optical waveguides with balanced gain and loss. We find both fundamental and multipole solitons for both focusing and defocusing signs of the saturable nonlinearity in such ( Formula: see text)- symmetric waveguides. The dependence of the propagation constant on the soliton 's power is presented for different strengths of the nonlinearity saturation ,
