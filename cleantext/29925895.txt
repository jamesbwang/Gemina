  PIN1-mediated substrate isomerization plays a role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in PIN1-related pathways may affect tumor sensitivity to oxaliplatin or irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC) patients. We analyzed genomic DNA from five cohorts of mCRC patients ( total 950) treated with different first-line treatments: oxaliplatin cohorts 1 ( n = 146) and 2 ( n = 70); irinotecan cohorts 1 ( n = 228) , and 2 ( n = 276); and combination cohort ( n = 230). Single nucleotide polymorphisms of candidate genes were analyzed by PCR-based direct sequencing. In the oxaliplatin cohort 1 , patients carrying any PIN1 rs2233678 C allele had shorter progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) than the G/G variant ( PFS , 7.4 vs. 15.0 months , hazard ratio ( HR) 3.24 , P < 0.001; OS , 16.9 vs. 31.5 months , HR: 2.38 , P = 0.003). In contrast , patients with C allele had longer median PFS than patients with G/G ( 11.9 vs. 9.4 months , HR: 0.64 , 95 % CI: 0.45-0.91 , P = 0.009) in the irinotecan cohort 1. No significant differences were observed in the combination cohort. In comparison between the irinotecan cohort 1 and combination cohort , the patients carrying the G/G variant benefit greatly from the combination compared with irinotecan-based regimen ( PFS , 11.6 vs. 9.4 months , HR 0.61 , 95 % CI: 0.47-0.78 , P < 0.001; OS , 30.6 vs. 24.0 months , HR 0.79 , 95 % CI: 0.62-1.02 , P = 0.060) , while no significant difference was shown in any C allele. Germline PIN1 polymorphisms may predict clinical outcomes in mCRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based therapy , and identify specific populations favorable to oxaliplatin plus irinotecan combination therapy.
