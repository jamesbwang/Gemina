  Dairy farming involves frequent contact among animals , workers and farm environments. To explore the Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. diversity that occurs on dairy farms , a pilot study sampled dairy workers , cows and the farm environments from five farms , two organic and three conventional farms , in Washington State. Samples were taken from the nares and hands of consenting workers ( n = 24) , udders and nares of selected cows ( n = 25) and representative environmental surfaces ( n = 96) from each farm. To increase diversity of the Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. characterized , five distinct colonies were selected from each sample for identification with 16S analysis. A total of 198 staphylococci were characterized representing 19 different Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp.. The diversity of species ranged from 9-15 Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp./ farm with no difference between conventional and organic farms. S.<pathogen> haemolyticus<pathogen> ( n = 60 isolates) was the most common species and was isolated from all farms and from cows , humans and environmental samples. Whole genome sequencing of selected S.<pathogen> haemolyticus<pathogen> found no genetically related isolates among human , animal and environmental samples within the same farm. S.<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> , S.<pathogen> saprophyticus<pathogen> , S.<pathogen> sciuri<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> xylosus<pathogen> were also found in â‰¥ 1 farms from human , animal and environmental samples.
