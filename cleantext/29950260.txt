  To evaluate the association of obesity with Gleason scores determined in biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Cohort study. Urology Department , Fatih Sultan Mehmet Research Hospital , Istanbul , Turkey from 2007 to 2015. A total of 111 patients , younger than 65 years who underwent radical prostatectomy ( RP) with the diagnosis of prostate cancer , were included in the study. Histopathology reports of the surgical , and TRUS-guided prostate biopsy specimens were analysed. Body mass index ( BMI) and prostate specific antigen ( PSA) levels were also evaluated. Mean age of the patients was 59.06 ± 4.10 ( range = 47-64 years) years. Mean BMI of the patients was 25.59 ± 3.24 kg/m2 ( range = 19-35 kg/m2). In patients whose BMI measurements were equal or above 25 kg/m2; a significant difference was found between Gleason scores of the needle biopsy and RP specimens ( p = 0.001). BMI and PSA , which are known to be the most important parameters effecting Gleason score , were evaluated in combination. Regarding non-concordance with Gleason scores , it has been observed that as a predisposing factor , obesity can explain these incompatibilities similarly to PSA.
