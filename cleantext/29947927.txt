  Protein toxicity can be defined as all the pathological changes that ensue from accumulation , mis-localization , and/or multimerization of disease-specific proteins. Most neurodegenerative diseases manifest protein toxicity as one of their key pathogenic mechanisms , the details of which remain unclear. By systematically deconstructing the nature of toxic proteins , we aim to elucidate and illuminate some of the key mechanisms of protein toxicity from which therapeutic insights may be drawn. In this review , we focus specifically on protein toxicity from the point of view of various cellular compartments such as the nucleus and the mitochondria. We also discuss the cell-to-cell propagation of toxic disease proteins that complicates the mechanistic understanding of the disease progression as well as the spatiotemporal point at which to therapeutically intervene. Finally , we discuss selective neuronal vulnerability , which still remains largely enigmatic.
