  Increasing salinity has important impacts on biogeochemical processes in estuary wetlands , with the potential to influence the soil respiration<symptom> , dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) and microbial population. However , it is unclear how soil respiration<symptom> is related to changes in the DOC and microbial community composition with increasing salinity. In this study , soil cores were sampled from a brackish wetland in the Liaohe River estuary and treated by salinity solutions at four levels ( fresh water , 3 ‰ , 5 ‰ , and 10 ‰). Samples of gas , water and soil were collected to determine the respiration<symptom> rates and microbial community structure of the soil and the DOC leaching from the soil. Compared to the low-salinity treatments ( fresh water and 3 ‰) , the high-salinity treatments ( 5 ‰ and 10 ‰) decreased the soil respiration<symptom> rates by 45-57 % and decreased the DOC concentrations by 47-55 %. However , no significant differences were observed within the low-salinity treatments nor the high-salinity treatments. There is a positive correlation between the soil respiration<symptom> rates and DOC concentrations in all treatments , but it does not indicate a genetic cause-effect relationship between them. The microbial community structure varied with the salinity level , with higher β- and δ-Proteobacteria abundance , as well as higher Anaerolineae , and lower Clostridia abundance in the high-salinity treatments. The respiration<symptom> rates were slightly negatively related to the richness of Proteobacteria and positively related to the richness of Clostridia. This study suggests that there may be a salinity threshold ( 3-10 ‰) impacting the organic carbon loss from estuarine brackish wetlands. In addition , the response of soil respiration<symptom> to increasing salinity may be mainly linked to changes in the microbial community composition rather than changes in the DOC quantity.
