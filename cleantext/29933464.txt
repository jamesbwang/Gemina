  The orthopedic medical history of the now 56-year-old Mr. Z began immediately after his birth with an inpatient clubfoot therapy. With the onset of adolescence , multilocular pain began. The long-standing patient career was characterized by disappointment about the early onset and recurrent need for treatment. The disappointment motive is closely related to the relationship between the patient and his mother. The biography illustrates the intertwining of early ( orthopedic) treatment , primary bonding and disease experiences. A multimodal pain therapy was able to target Mr. Z , create positive body experiences and finally reduce the pain.
