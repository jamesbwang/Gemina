  Quorum sensing ( QS) is an important protective mechanism that allows bacteria to adapt to its environment. A limited number of signal molecules play the key role of transmitting information in this mechanism. Signals are transmitted between individual bacterium<pathogen> through QS systems , resulting in the expression of specific genes. QS plays an important role in a variety of bacterial processes , including drug resistance , biofilm formation , motility , adherence , and virulence. Most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria possess QS systems , mainly the LuxS/AI -2-mediated QS system. Evidence has been brought that LuxS/AI -2 system controls major virulence determinants in Streptococcus<pathogen> suis<pathogen> and , as such , the ability of this bacterial species to cause infections in humans and pigs. Understanding the S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> LuxS/AI -2 system may open up novel avenues for decreasing the drug resistance and infectivity of S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen>. This article focuses on the progress made to date on the S.<pathogen> suis<pathogen> LuxS/AI -2-mediated QS system.
