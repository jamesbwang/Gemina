  Acute arterial occlusions after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) are rare but very serious complication. We present a series of 9 patients who underwent endovascular recanalisation for acute thrombotic occlusion following TKA in our institution. The present series determine the importance of early diagnosis and role of early intervention for good clinical outcome in these cases. From 2013 to 2016 , a total of 9 patients ( 3 male and 6 female) presented with acute popliteal thrombosis following TKA. All the patients underwent endovascular procedure. Clinical presentation , procedural details and clinical outcome was discussed. Technical success is achieved in all the cases. A combination of clot lysis , thromboaspiration and balloon angioplasty was used. 8 patients had successful clinical outcome. One patient underwent amputation despite good recanalisation. High degree suspicion with careful monitoring in the postoperative period is needed to identify the problem at the earliest , and early diagnosis with recanalisation within 6 h is the key to limb salvage in these patients.
