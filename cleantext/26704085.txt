  This study assessed whether children with oral clefts are appropriately classified as at-risk for hearing loss at the time of newborn hearing screening and describes their screening and diagnostic results. Birth certificates were used to identify children with cleft lip and palate or isolated cleft palate born in Washington State from 2008-2013. These were cross-referenced with the state 's Early Hearing Detection , Diagnosis and Intervention ( EHDDI) database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations. Birth records identified 235 children with cleft lip and palate and 116 with isolated cleft palate. Six children were listed as having both diagnoses. Only 138 ( 39 %) of these children were designated as having a craniofacial anomaly in the EHDDI database. Children who were misclassified were less likely to have referred on initial hearing screening , OR 0.3 , 95 % CI ( 0.2 , 0.5). Misclassification of risk factor status was also associated with delayed hearing screening past 30 days of age or unknown age at screening , OR 4.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.5 , 13.3) , p-value 0.008. Of 50 children with diagnostic results; 25 ( 50 %) had hearing loss: 18 conductive , 2 mixed , and 5 unspecified. A majority of children with oral clefts were misclassified regarding risk factor for hearing loss in the EHDDI database.
