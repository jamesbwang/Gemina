  Currently , there is a growing worldwide interest for the treatment of wastes , and especially farm wastes , by anaerobic digestion. Biochemical methane potential is a key parameter for the design , optimisation and monitoring of the anaerobic digestion process , but it is also time consuming ( 4-7 weeks). Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy seems a promising method to predict the biochemical methane potential of a wide range of organic substrates. This study compares a ` global ' predictive model mainly built with biogas plant feedstocks , and a more ` agricultural ' specific one built with farm wastes only ( e.g. manures and crop residues). The global model was calibrated with 245 samples and the specific one with 171 samples. In parallel , validation sets composed of 36 farm wastes and eight other wastes ( sludge , fruit residues and vegetables) were used to evaluate and compare both models. Satisfying results were obtained on the validation sets considering , respectively for the global and the specific models , a root mean square error of prediction of 44 and 34 NL CH
