  Bempedoic acid ( ETC-1002) is a new agent that reduces cholesterol synthesis through inhibition of adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase ( ACL) , an enzyme upstream from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme ( HMG-CoA). In animal models , bempedoic acid also influences fatty acid synthesis but in humans its role is limited primarily to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C). In early clinical trials , bempedoic acid has been well tolerated and without major side effects. Alone or in various combinations with Atorvastatin and/or Ezetimibe , LDL-C lowering has ranged from 17 % to 64 %. In addition , it lowers levels of non high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , C-reactive protein ( CRP) , and apolipoprotein B ( apoB). Statins are first line agents for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However , muscle related side effects and other problems such as elevated liver enzymes may limit their use. In addition , LDL-C lowering beyond that provided by statin therapy alone may be needed. Bempedoic acid may be useful in either of these scenarios , as it is relatively free of muscle related side effects and appears to enhance LDL-C lowering beyond that achieved with statin monotherapy. Phase 3 trials and one outcomes study are currently under way to better define this agent 's potential clinical role.
