  A 56-year-old woman with septic shock<symptom> presented with persistent hyperlactatemia , despite an adequate clinical response to treatment. Carnitine deficiency was suspected , as the patient was malnourished and chronically taking valproic acid. No other plausible cause of hyperlactatemia was found. Carnitine supplementation resulted in rapid normalization of lactatemia.
