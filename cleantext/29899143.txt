  The Mec1/ATR kinase coordinates multiple cellular responses to replication stress. In addition to its canonical role in activating the checkpoint kinase Rad53 , Mec1 also plays checkpoint-independent roles in genome maintenance that are not well understood. Here we used a combined genetic-phosphoproteomic approach to manipulate Mec1 activation and globally monitor Mec1 signaling , allowing us to delineate distinct checkpoint-independent modes of Mec1 action. Using cells in which endogenous Mec1 activators were genetically ablated , we found that expression of `` free '' Mec1 activation domains ( MADs) can robustly activate Mec1 and rescue the severe DNA replication and growth defects of these cells back to wild-type levels. However , unlike the activation mediated by endogenous activator proteins , `` free '' MADs are unable to stimulate Mec1-mediated suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs) , revealing that Mec1 's role in genome maintenance is separable from a previously unappreciated proreplicative function. Both Mec1 's functions in promoting replication and suppressing GCRs are independent of the downstream checkpoint kinases. Additionally , Mec1-dependent GCR suppression seems to require localized Mec1 action at DNA lesions<symptom> , which correlates with the phosphorylation of activator-proximal substrates involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. These findings establish that Mec1 initiates checkpoint signaling , promotes DNA replication , and maintains genetic stability through distinct modes of action.
