  The indirect effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on adult pneumococcal meningitis<disease> has not been thoroughly investigated. We present data from active surveillance on pneumococcal meningitis<disease> in adults in Israel occurring during July 2009-June 2015. Pneumococcal meningitis<disease> was diagnosed for 221 patients , 9.4 % of all invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD) cases. Although overall IPD incidence decreased during the study period , meningitis<disease> increased nonsignificantly from 0.66 to 0.85 cases/100 ,000 population. Incidence of vaccine type ( VT) pneumococcal meningitis<disease> ( VT13) decreased by 70 % , but non-VT13 pneumococcal meningitis<disease> increased from 0.32 to 0.75 cases/100 ,000 population ( incident rate ratio 2.35 , 95 % CI 1.27-4.35). Pneumococcal meningitis<disease> patients were younger and healthier than nonmeningitis IPD patients , and 20.2 % had a history of previous head surgery or cerebrospinal fluid leak compared with < 2.0 % of nonmeningitis patients ( p < 0.0001). Non-VT13 types that rarely cause IPD ( 15B/C , 6C , 23A , 23B , 24F) seem to be emerging as common causes of
