  There is a growing body of evidence that physical activity ( PA) improves symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( MS). Despite the benefits of PA , people with MS are relatively inactive compared with their healthy counterparts. This study investigated associations between social cognitive theory ( SCT) constructs and energy expenditure ( EE) as an objective measure of PA in a sample of inactive people with MS. Participants ( n = 65) completed several questionnaires and were assessed using standardized outcome measures as part of a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled trial ( Step it Up). The bivariate correlation analysis indicated that of all SCT constructs , only exercise self-efficacy was significantly correlated with EE ( r = 0.297 , P = .022). Multiple linear regression analysis found that exercise self-efficacy independently explained 9 % of the variance in EE ( R The constructs of SCT explained little of the variance of objectively measured PA in a sample of inactive people with MS who volunteered for an exercise trial. The only significant variable was exercise self-efficacy , which confirms the importance of enhancing it through PA interventions.
