  To achieve epidemic control of human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection , sub-Saharan African countries are striving to diagnose 90 % of HIV<pathogen> infections , initiate and retain 90 % of HIV-diagnosed persons on antiretroviral therapy ( ART) , and achieve viral load suppression * for 90 % of ART recipients ( 90-90-90) ( 1). In Eswatini ( formerly Swaziland) , the country with the world 's highest estimated HIV<pathogen> prevalence ( 27.2 %) , achieving 90-90-90 depends upon improving access to early ART for men and young adults with HIV<pathogen> infection , two groups with low ART coverage ( 1-3). Although community-based strategies test many men and young adults with HIV<pathogen> infection in Eswatini , fewer than one third of all persons who test positive in community settings enroll in HIV<pathogen> care within 6 months of diagnosis after receiving standard referral services ( 4,5).
