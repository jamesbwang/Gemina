  Magnetic nanoparticles ( NPs) are emerging as promising candidates for the next generation of image contrast agents and their performance is largely dependent on physicochemical properties. In this paper , a new type of ` top-down ' fabrication technique was developed to synthesize ultrasmall magnetic NPs as a contrast enhancer. In a detailed , home-made oxygen plasma generator , fragments of larger KMnF
