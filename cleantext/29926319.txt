  Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS) is a common treatment modality among patients with brain metastases , particularly from malignant melanoma. Our objective was to investigate the difference in local control , toxicity , and survival among patients with hemorrhagic and solid melanoma brain metastases. We collected demographic , treatment , local control , toxicity , and survival for 134 patients with a total of 936 intracranial melanoma metastases who underwent SRS between 1998 and 2015. Pre-radiosurgical diagnostic imaging was reviewed for evidence of hemorrhage<symptom> ( melanin-containing or clearly hemorrhagic). The cohort consisted of 92 men and 42 women with a mea age of 61.7 years ( range 21.2-84.9) at the time of radiosurgery. Overall survival of patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma was 42 , 31 , 12 % at 12 , 24 , and 72 months from date of first SRS. At 6 months , 43 % of the patients with hemorrhagic metastases had local tumor control compared to 83 % of solid melanoma metastases ( p < 0.001). No significant difference in toxicity was noted between the two groups. Factors that were significantly associated with time to local tumor progression on multivariate analysis include prior WBRT ( HR 1.62 , p = 0.003) , prior chemotherapy ( HR 0.69 , p = 0.011) , margin dose ( HR 0.88 , p < 0.001) and radiographic features of melanin deposition ( HR 3.73 , p < 0.001) , or clear hemorrhage<symptom> ( HR 2.20 , p < 0.001). Our findings demonstrate that hemorrhagic intracranial melanoma metastases are associated with inferior local tumor control when treated with SRS , as compared to solid tumors. These results highlight the importance of early radiosurgery among patients with melanoma brain metastases before hemorrhage<symptom> occurs.
