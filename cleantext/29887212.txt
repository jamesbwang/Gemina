  Sinonasal pathologies generate six principal symptoms with major organic and psychosocial impact that can be studied on a self-administered questionnaire assessing chronic sinonasal dysfunction independently of etiology. The objective of the present study was to translate , culturally adapt and validate the DyNaChron questionnaire for Arabic-speaking Moroccan patients. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of DyNaChron followed international guidelines. 164 patients filled out the questionnaire at day 0 and day 7 ( without treatment) and day 60 after treatment. A prospective multicenter study validated the questionnaire for internal consistency , test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change. Mean age was 35 years , with male predominance ( 63 %). Nasal obstruction was the most frequent symptom ( 97.6 %). Internal consistency on Cronbach alpha was high ( 0.97). Reproducibility on intraclass correlation ( ICC) was excellent ( 0.84). Sensitivity to change was excellent for the majority of patients ( effect size = 0.97-6.69; SRM = 2.47-6.74). This study of a cross-cultural Moroccan adaptation of the DyNaChron questionnaire showed good validity , reproducibility and sensitivity to change , and better representation of all symptoms generated by chronic sinonasal dysfunction. It can be used to evaluate the psychosocial and organic impact of chronic sinonasal dysfunction and to assess treatment.
