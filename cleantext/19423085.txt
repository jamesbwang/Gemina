  Macrophages play a crucial role in the innate immune system and contribute to a broad spectrum of pathologies in chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in macrophage functions by regulating macrophage polarization , lipid metabolism and so on. Thus , miRNAs represent promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets in immune disorders. In this review , we will summarize the role of miRNAs in atherosclerosis , metabolic syndrome<disease> , and cancer by modulating macrophage phenotypes , which has been supported by in vivo evidence.
