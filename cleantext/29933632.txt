  Dual-motor Electric Drive Tracked Vehicles ( DDTVs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high transmission efficiency and economical fuel consumption. A test bench for the development and validation of new DDTV technologies is necessary and urgent. How to load the vehicle on a DDTV test bench exactly the same as on a real road is a crucial issue when designing the bench. This paper proposes a novel dynamic load emulation method to address this problem. The method adopts dual dynamometers to simulate both the road load and the inertia load that are imposed on the dual independent drive systems. The vehicle & rsquo; s total inertia equivalent to the drive wheels is calculated with separate consideration of vehicle body , tracks and road wheels to obtain a more accurate inertia load. A speed tracking control strategy with feedforward compensation is implemented to control the dual dynamometers , so as to make the real-time dynamic load emulation possible. Additionally , a MATLAB/Simulink model of the test bench is built based on a dynamics analysis of the platform. Experiments are finally carried out on this test bench under different test conditions. The outcomes show that the proposed load emulation method is effective , and has good robustness and adaptability to complex driving conditions. Besides , the accuracy of the established test bench model is also demonstrated by comparing the results obtained from the simulation model and experiments.
