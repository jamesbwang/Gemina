  The aim of this study is to investigate if a handheld ultrasound device ( BladderScan 速 BVI 6100) can accurately measure bladder volumes in prostate radiotherapy ( RT) patients. A comparison was made of contoured bladder volumes based on treatment planning CT ( TPCT) and BladderScan 速 BVI 6100 ultrasound device in a large prostate RT population. Three bladder volume ( BV) measurements were taken using the bladder volume instrument ( BVI) device on prostate RT patients immediately prior to TPCT ( n = 190). The CT delineation bladder volumes were also recorded. The mean of the three BVI readings ( BVI There was a strong positive correlation between the BVI and CT delineated bladder volumes ( BVI This is the largest study to date ( n = 190) , assessing the accuracy of the BladderScan 速 BVI 6100 in the prostate RT population. The BVI 6100 provides an acceptable indication of BV for use in prostate RT patients for the purposes of monitoring BV. Advances in knowledge: The BladderScan 速 BVI 6100 provides a convenient and non-irradiating method of indicating BV for use in prostate RT patients.
