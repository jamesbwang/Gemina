  Treating wastewater from textile plants using membrane distillation ( MD) has great potential due to the high-salinity wastes and availability of waste heat. However , textile wastewaters also contain surfactants , which compromise the essential hydrophobic feature of the membrane , causing membrane wetting. To address this wetting issue , a custom-made membrane consisting of a hydrophilic layer coated on hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE) was tested on textile wastewater in a pilot MD setup , and compared with a conventional hydrophobic PTFE membrane. The test was carried out with a feed temperature of 60 & deg; C , and a permeate temperature of 45 & deg; C. The overall salt rejection of both membranes<symptom> was very high , at 99 %. However , the hydrophobic membrane showed rising permeate electrical conductivity , which was attributed to wetting of the membrane. Meanwhile , the hydrophilic-coated membrane showed continually declining electrical conductivity demonstrating an intact membrane that resisted wetting from the surfactants. Despite this positive result , the coated membrane did not survive a simple sodium hydroxide clean , which would be typically applied to a membrane process. This brief study showed the viability of membrane distillation membranes<symptom> on real textile wastewaters containing surfactants using hydrophilic-coated hydrophobic PTFE , but the cleaning process required for membranes<symptom> needs optimization.
