  Solution-processed organometallic halide perovskites have obtained rapid development for light-emitting diodes ( LEDs) and solar cells ( SCs). These devices are fabricated with similar materials and architectures , leading to the emergence of perovskite-based light-emitting solar cells ( LESCs). The high quality perovskite layer with reduced nonradiative recombination is crucial for achieving a high performance device , even though the carrier behaviors are fundamentally different in both functions.
