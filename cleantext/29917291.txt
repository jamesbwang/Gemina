  The basal ganglia have been hypothesized to be involved in action selection , i.e. resolving competition between simultaneously activated motor programs. It has been shown that the direct pathway facilitates action execution whereas the indirect pathway inhibits it. However , as the pathways are both active during an action , it remains unclear whether their role is co-operative or competitive. In order to investigate this issue , we designed a striatal model consisting of D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons ( MSNs) and interfaced it to a simulated robot moving in an environment. We demonstrate that this model is able to reproduce key behavioral features of several experiments involving optogenetic manipulation of the striatum<pathogen> , such as freezing and ambulation. We then investigate the interaction of D1- and D2-MSNs. We find that their fundamental relationship is co-operative within a channel and competitive between channels; this turns out to be crucial for action selection. However , individual pairs of D1- and D2-MSNs may exhibit predominantly competition or co-operation depending on their distance , and D1- and D2-MSNs population activity can alternate between co-operation and competition modes during a stimulation. Additionally , our results show that D2-D2 connectivity between channels is necessary for effective resolution of competition; in its absence , a conflict of two motor programs typically results in neither being selected.
