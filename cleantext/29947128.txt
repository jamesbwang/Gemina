  Ligament reconstruction can provide pain relief in patients with a painful , unstable , pre-arthritic trapeziometacarpal ( TMC) joint. Imbrication of the dorsoradial ligament ( DRL) has been proposed as a minimal invasive stabilization technique. It requires less invasive surgery than an Eaton-Littler technique and shows promising long-term clinical outcome. We used dynamic CT to objectively review the effects of the imbrication. Four patients with pain and laxity at the TMC joint , but without radiographic signs of osteoarthritis , were recruited. Dynamic CT scans were made during active thumb abduction-adduction , flexion-extension , and two functional grip tasks using a radiolucent jig. Scans of the patients were acquired before and 3 to 6 months after DRL reconstruction. Motion of each bone in the articular chain of the thumb was quantified. In addition , we mapped changes in the contact patterns between the articular facets during the entire thumb motion. After DRL imbrication , we found no overall decrease in MC1 movement in three out of four patients. Furthermore , no increase in TMC joint congruency , defined as proximity area size , was found for three out of four patients. Pre- and post-operative differences in congruency across different tasks were patient-dependent and relatively small. We demonstrated that , from a biomechanical perspective , there is high variability in post-operative outcome between patients that undergo identical surgical procedures performed by the same surgeon. A post-operative decrease in range of motion , increase in joint congruency or decrease in proximity area shift during thumb motion is not omnipresent. Â© 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
