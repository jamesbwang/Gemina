  In boreal peatlands , litter decomposition plays an important role in modulating ecosystem carbon ( C) cycling and nutrient turnover. However , how climate warming and plant functional group interact to affect litter decomposition is still unclear in these ecosystems. Here , we collected fresh litters of six plant functional groups ( nitrogen ( N)- fixing species , deciduous tree , deciduous shrub , evergreen shrub , graminoid , and Sphagnum moss) from a boreal peatland located in northeast China. A laboratory incubation experiment was used to determine the effect of temperature ( 10 째C vs. 20 째C) on microbial respiration<symptom> and mass loss during decomposition. Among the six functional groups , the litters of N-fixing species and deciduous shrub , followed by deciduous tree , generally had the greatest mass losses and microbial respiration<symptom> rates , whereas the Sphagnum moss decomposed with the slowest rate at both incubation temperatures. Increasing incubation temperature from 10 째C to 20 째C , microbial respiration<symptom> rate and mass loss increased slightly for Sphagnum moss litters ( 25 % and 19 % , respectively) , but increased dramatically for vascular plant litters ( 84-135 % and 49-85 % , respectively). For litters from vascular plants , both decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity showed a tight linear correlation with the initial C: N and C: phosphorus ratios. Considering that climate warming will cause increased dominance of woody plant species coupled with decreased cover by Sphagnum mosses , this study provides clear evidence that climate warming and the associated changes to vegetation community composition can synergistically accelerate plant litter decomposition in boreal peatlands.
