  Co-encapsulation of pancreatic islets with mesenchymal stem cells in a three-dimensional biomaterial 's structure is a promising technique to improve transplantation efficacy and to decrease immunosuppressant therapy. Currently , evaluation of graft quality after co-encapsulation is only based on insulin secretion. Viability measurement in a 3D conformation structure involving two different cell types is complex , mainly performed manually , highly time consuming and examiner dependent. Standardization of encapsulated graft viability analysis before transplantation is a key point for the translation of the method from the bench side to clinical practice. In this study , we developed an automated analysis of islet viability based on confocal pictures processing of cells stained with three probes ( Hoechst , propidium iodide , and PKH67). When compared with results obtained manually by different examiners , viability results show a high degree of similarity ( under 3 % of difference) and a tight correlation (
