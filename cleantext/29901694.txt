  Prochlorococcus is a marine picocyanobacterium with a streamlined genome that is adapted to different ecological niches in the oligotrophic oceans. There are currently > 20 regulatory small RNAs ( sRNAs) that have been identified in the model strain Prochlorococcus MED4. While most of these sRNAs are ecotype-specific , sRNA homologs of Yfr1 and of the Yfr2 family are widely found throughout the cyanobacterial phylum. Although they were identified 13 yrs ago , the functions of Yfr1 and Yfr2 have remained unknown. We observed a strong induction of two Yfr2 sRNA homologs of Prochlorococcus MED4 during high light stress and nitrogen starvation. Several Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus yfr2 promoter regions contain a conserved motif we named CGRE1 ( cyanobacterial GntR family transcriptional regulator responsive element 1). Using the conserved promoter region as bait in a DNA affinity pull-down assay we identified the GntR family transcriptional regulator PMM1637 as a binding partner. Similar to Yfr2 , homologs of PMM1637 are universally and exclusively found in cyanobacteria. We suggest that PMM1637 governs the induction of gene expression of Yfr2 homologs containing CGRE1 in their promoters under nitrogen-depleted and high-light stress conditions.
