  Milk and dairy products harbor a wide variety of bacterial species that compete for both limited resources and space. Under these competitive conditions , bacteria develop specialized mechanisms to protect themselves during niche colonization and nutrient acquisition processes. The bacterial antagonism mechanisms include the production of antimicrobial agents or molecules that facilitate competitor dispersal. In the present work , a bacterial strain designated RC6 was isolated from Ricotta and identified as
