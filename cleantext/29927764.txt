  It is in the brain where the decision is made what and how much to eat. In the last decades neuroimaging research has contributed extensively to new knowledge about appetite<symptom> control by revealing the underlying brain processes. Interestingly , there is the fast growing idea of using these methods to develop new treatments for obesity and eating disorders. In this review , we summarize the findings of the importance of the use of neuropharmacology and neuroimaging techniques in understanding and modifying appetite<symptom> control. Appetite<symptom> control is a complex interplay between homeostatic , hedonic , and cognitive processes. Administration of the neuropeptides insulin and oxytocin curb food intake and alter brain responses in reward and cognitive control areas. Additionally , these areas can be targeted for neuromodulation or neurofeedback to reduce food cravings and increase self-control to alter food intake. The recent findings reveal the potential of intranasal administration of hormones or modifying appetite<symptom> control brain networks to reduce food consumption in volunteers with overweight and obesity or individuals with an eating disorder. Although long-term clinical studies are still needed.
