  Kinetic modelling in haemodialysis is usually based upon the resolution of volume-defined compartment models. The interaction among these compartments is described by purely diffusive processes. In this paper we present an alternative kinetic model for uremic toxins in post-dilutional haemodiafiltration treatments by means of a unidimensional diffusion equation. A wide range of solutes such as urea , creatinine , $ \ beta _ ( 2) $- microglobulin , myoglobin and prolactin were studied by imposing appropriate boundary and initial conditions in a virtual ( 0,1) domain. The diffusivity along the domain and the extraction rate at the dialyser are the kinetic parameters which were fitted by least-squares for every studied solute. The accuracy of the presented volumeless model as well as the behavior of the proposed kinetic parameters could be an alternative to the compartment description for a variety of molecular weight uremic toxins undergoing different treatment configurations.
