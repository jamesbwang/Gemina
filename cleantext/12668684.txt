  The physiological approach suggests that an environment associating mesenchymal stromal cells with low O CD34 Our results showed that the number of TNC cells , CD34 Our data demonstrate that cord blood HSPCs maintain stemness better under hypoxia than normoxia with WJ-MSC coculture , partially due to the increased secretion of VEGF , decreased secretion of IL-6 by WJ-MSCs , and selective activation of stem cell signal pathways in HSPCs. This suggests that the oxygenation may not only be a physiological regulatory factor but also a cell engineering tool in HSPC research , and this may have important translational and clinical implications.
