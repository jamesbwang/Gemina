  The self-healing phenomenon can be found in the elastase-induced abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) model , and an enlarging AAA model was successfully induced by coarctation. Unfortunately , aortic coarctation in these enlarging models is generally not found in human AAA disease. This study aimed to create an experiment model of enlarging AAA in rabbits to better mimic human aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> disease. Eighty-four male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three equal groups: two aneurysm<disease> groups ( A and B) and a SHAM group. Aneurysm<disease> group rabbits underwent extrinsic aortic stenosis below the right<symptom> renal artery and received a 10-minute incubation of 60 μl elastase ( 1 unit/μl). Absorbable suture was used in Group A and nonabsorbable cotton thread was used in Group B. A sham operation was performed in the SHAM group. Aortic diameter was measured after 1 , 3 , 7 , and 15 weeks; thereafter animals were sacrificed for histopathological , immunohistochemical and quantitative studies. Two rabbits died at 29 and 48 days , respectively , after operation in Group B. All aneurysms<disease> formed and enlarged progressively by 3 weeks in the Aneurysm<disease> groups. However , diameter enlargement in Group A was significantly lower than that in Group B at 7 weeks. Aneurysm<disease> groups developed intimal hyperplasia<disease>; intima-media thickness ( IMT) increased significantly by week 7 , and aortic media thickness and intima-media ratio ( IMR) increased significantly by week 15. Marked destruction of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells ( SMCs) occurred 1 week later and increased progressively thereafter. Intimal hyperplasia<disease> and SMCs content in Group A increased significantly by week 15 compared with Group B. Aneurysm<disease> groups exhibited strong expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and RAM11 by week 1 , and decreased progressively thereafter. In conclusion , this novel rabbit AAA model enlarges progressively without coarctation and is capable of better mimicking human aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> disease.
