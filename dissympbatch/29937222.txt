  The present study sought to validate the clinical performance of a previously described PCR-based assay for the diagnosis of bacterial<disease> vaginosis<disease> ( BV). A total of 1579 patients were enrolled in 5 locations; samples were classified as BV positive ( n = 538) or negative ( n = 1,041) based on an algorithm utilizing quantitative Gram-stain analysis of vaginal<symptom> discharge<symptom> and clinical evaluation ( Amsel criteria); a next-generation sequencing ( NGS) approach to determining diversity of vaginal microbiota was used to resolve discordant results between BV-PCR and Nugent/Amsel. BV-PCR demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.0 % ( 483/503) and a specificity of 90.2 % ( 885/981) when measured against the conventional test standard , with 95 samples ( 6.0 %) being classified as indeterminate. After resolution of discordant results by NGS , including elimination of the PCR indeterminate category , the resolved sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative predictive values of the BV-PCR assay were 98.7 % , 95.9 % , 92.9 % , and 96.9 % , respectively. The results of this study conclusively demonstrate that a relatively simple , 3-biomarker , molecular amplification construct can effectively diagnose BV in symptomatic women. Results generated using this assay were congruent with those obtained using conventional and molecular reference methods.
