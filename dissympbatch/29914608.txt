  To study fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO) levels among pre-school children in day care centres ( DCCs) in relation to indoor and outdoor air pollution in northern China. This was a cross-sectional study among children aged 5 years from 34 classrooms at 10 randomly selected DCCs in Taiyuan , China. A total of 507 ( 99 %) children participated. Air pollution and carbon dioxide ( CO2) levels were measured in the classroom and outside the school. Linear mixed models were applied for statistical analysis. The geometric mean FeNO was 9.1 ± 1.5 parts per billion; 11.6 % of children had wheeze , 6.0 % had dry<symptom> cough<symptom> , 26.4 % rhinitis symptoms , 1.6 % ever physician-diagnosed asthma and 29.2 % ever physician-diagnosed pneumonia<disease> FeNO levels were associated with current wheeze ( P = 0.04) and ever physician-diagnosed pneumonia<disease> ( P = 0.05). The mean indoor concentrations were particulate matter with a diameter of < 2.5 μm ( PM2 .5) 268 μg/m3 , sulfur dioxide ( SO2) 40.5 μg/m3 , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2) 43.0 μg/m3 and CO2 827 parts per million. Outdoor concentrations were PM2 .5 244 μg/m3 , SO2 106.6 μg/m3 and NO2 40.9 μg/m3. PM2 .5 levels inside ( P = 0.002) and outside DCCs ( P = 0.05) were associated with FeNO levels. PM2 .5 levels inside and outside DCCs in China can contribute to airway inflammation<symptom> in pre-school children. Children with current wheeze and ever physician-diagnosed pneumonia<disease> may have higher FeNO levels.
