  In Brazil , population-based researches analyzing prevalence and factors associated with metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) , a recognized predictor of cardiovascular diseases ( CVD) , and an important cause of disability and death in the country are scarce. To evaluate prevalence of MS and its associated factors in Brazilian population. Secondary analysis of the 2013 National Health Survey , a cross-sectional survey with national representativeness of Brazilian adult population ( n = 59,402). MS was the outcome variable , defined from harmonization of cardiology international consensus as load â‰¥ 3 of the following components: self-reported diabetes and hypercholesterolemia , high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and high waist circumference. Analysis were stratified by sex and prevalence ratios , with their respective 99 % confidence intervals ( PR ( CI 99 %)) calculated by simple and multiple Poisson regression models. MS prevalence was 8.9 % , being significantly higher among women compared to men; in general , this pattern was maintained in relation to exposure variables studied. Additionally , less than 25 % of population did not present any MS component. In final multiple models , sociodemographic , behavioral and comorbidity variables were associated with MS , however , while low schooling ( 1.46 ( 1.23-1.74) , cerebrovascular accident ( 1.36 ( 1) , 00) ( 1.28 ( 1.03-1.62)) were associated among women , chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 1.85 ( 2.23-2.76)) was associated exclusively among men. We identified MS high prevalence in Brazilian population; on the other hand , factors associated with this condition were different depending on sex.
