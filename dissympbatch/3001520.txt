  Herpes<disease> simplex-1 virus<disease> encephalitis<disease> ( HSE) is the most commonly recognized cause of sporadic encephalitis<disease> in the United States. Historically HSE has been considered extremely detrimental given the associated relentless neurological deterioration secondary to cerebral edema<symptom> and status epilepticus. With recent advances in antiviral therapeutics in past decades , the majority of complications can be managed effectively although the associated morbidity and mortality still remains high. The key modifiable factor determining recovery is the rapid initiation of antiviral therapy. We discuss the case of a 19-year-old female with HSE who received standard acyclovir therapy. Despite using recommended dosage and duration of acyclovir , her clinical condition worsened significantly and subsequently required multiple antiviral therapeutics and steroid therapy.
