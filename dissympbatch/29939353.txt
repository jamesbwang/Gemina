  Supplemental oxygen is a life-saving intervention administered to individuals suffering from respiratory distress , including adults with acute lung injury ( ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS). Despite the clinical benefit , supplemental oxygen can create a hyperoxic environment that increases reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , oxidative stress , and lung injury. We have previously shown that cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 1A enzymes decrease susceptibility to hyperoxia-induced lung injury. In this investigation , we determined the role of CYP1B1 in hyperoxic lung injury in vivo. Eight- to ten-week old C57BL/6 ( WT) and Cyp1b1-/- mice were exposed to hyperoxia ( > 95 % O2) for 24-72 hours or maintained in room air ( 21 % O2). Lung injury was assessed by histology and lung weight<symptom> to body<symptom> weight ( LW/BW) ratios. Extent of inflammation<symptom> was determined by assessing pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and cytokine levels. Lipid peroxidation markers were quantified by GC-MS , and oxidative DNA adducts were quantified by 32P-postlabeling as markers of oxidative stress. We found that Cyp1b1-/- mice have attenuated changes in lung weight and decreased pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> , particularly after 48-72 hours of hyperoxia compared to WT controls. Further , Cyp1b1-/- mice displayed decreased levels of pulmonary oxidative DNA adducts and pulmonary isofurans after 24 hours of hyperoxia. Cyp1b1-/- mice also showed increased pulmonary CYP1A1 and 1A2 and mRNA expression. In summary , our results support the hypothesis that Cyp1b1-/- mice display decreased hyperoxic lung injury than wild type counterparts and that CYP1B1 may act as a pro-oxidant during hyperoxia exposure , contributing to increases oxidative DNA damage and accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides.
