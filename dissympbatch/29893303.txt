  Synovial sarcoma<disease> ( SS) is a malignant mesenchymal tumor with variable epithelial differentiation that affects mostly young adults and can arise at any anatomic site. Primary intrathoracic SS is very rare accounting for < 0.5 % of all lung tumors. Most commonly , it arises from the lung followed by pleura and mediastinum. Primary pulmonary SS ( PPSS) affects both sexes equally with no preference for any hemithorax. The morphology , immunostaining properties , cytogenetic features , and management strategy of PPSS are similar to that of soft tissue SS. Histologically , there are two main types of SS- monophasic and biphasic with a feature of poor differentiation seen in both types. Most patients present with large intrathoracic masses with or without ipsilateral pleural effusion<symptom>. Bone invasion or mediastinal adenopathy<symptom> is very rare. SS is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation producing SS18-SSX fusion gene in more than 90 % of cases. Identification of this fusion gene remains the gold standard for the diagnosis in the presence of consistent histology and immunophenotype. Multimodality treatment including wide excision , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy is the mainstay of therapy. SS is relatively chemosensitive , and ifosfamide-based regimen showed improved survival in metastatic disease. Generally , SS is considered as high-grade tumors with a poor prognosis. Novel therapies targeted at fusion oncogene , SS18-SSX-derived peptide vaccine , epidermal growth factor receptor , and vascular endothelial growth factor are the future hope in SS. We describe a prototype case and present an elaborate review on primary SS of lung.
