  To determine the dose response to weight<symptom> loss<symptom> on clinical and mechanistic outcomes in overweight and obese adults with knee osteoarthritis. This is a secondary analysis of the diet-only ( D) and diet plus exercise ( D+E) groups in the Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis<disease> ( IDEA) randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants were 240 overweight and obese older community-dwelling adults with pain and radiographic knee OA. Participants were divided into 4 groups according to weight<symptom> loss<symptom> achieved over an 18-month period; less than 5 % ( < 5 % group) , between 5 and 10 % ( ≥ 5 % group) , between 10 and 20 % ( ≥ 10 % group) , and greater than 20 % ( ≥ 20 % group). There were significant dose responses to weight<symptom> loss<symptom> for pain ( p = 0.01) , function ( p = 0.0006) , 6-minute walk distance ( p < 0.0001) , physical ( p = 0.0004) and mental ( p = 0.03) health- related quality of life ( HRQL) , knee joint compressive force ( p < 0.0001) , and IL-6 ( p = 0.002). Greater weight<symptom> loss<symptom> resulted in superior clinical and mechanstic outcomes with the highest weight<symptom> loss<symptom> group ( ≥ 20 % group) distinguishing itself on all measures compared to the < 5 % and ≥ 5 % groups; the ≥ 20 % group had 25 % less pain and better function than the ≥ 10 % group , and significantly ( p = 0.006) better physical HRQL. Long-term weight<symptom> loss<symptom> between 10-19.9 % of baseline body<symptom> weight has substantial clinical and mechanistic benefits compared to less weight<symptom> loss<symptom>; the value of an additional 10 % weight<symptom> loss<symptom> includes significantly improved physical HRQL , and a clinically important reduction in pain and improvement in function.
