There are proven strategies available to manage chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> effectively without opioids. Utilization review providers for insurance companies often ignore medicine based scientific peer-reviewed studies that warn against the chronic use of opioid medications , as well as the lack of evidence to support long-term use of opioids for pain.

Possibly knowing a patient 's genetic addiction risk score ( GARS â„¢) could eliminate guessing as it relates to becoming addicted.
