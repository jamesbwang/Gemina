  Free-floating right heart thrombus ( RHT) is an extreme medical emergency in the context of acute massive pulmonary embolism ( PE). Despite the advances in early diagnosis , the management is still very debatable due to lack of consensus. We reported the case of a 66-year-old male , with a history of moderate renal dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy , who presented to the emergency department for acute<symptom> dyspnea<symptom>. His angiographic magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral extensive PE. Transthoracic echocardiography showed RHT with moderate right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Venous Doppler of the lower extremities noted the presence of a floating clot in the right common femoral vein. The patient was managed successfully by thrombolytic therapy with tenecteplase. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report of RHT and PE from Lebanon. Published cases from Middle Eastern<disease> countries are scarse.
