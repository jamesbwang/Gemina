  Hydrocephalus<symptom> occurs in 85 % of patients with tuberculous meningitis<disease> ( TBM). Ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS) insertion is first-line treatment for relieving increased intercranial pressure. VPS obstruction secondary to increased protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) is a known complication. To ascertain if there is a difference in protein levels 1) between cranial and lumbar CSF , and to quantify levels associated with VPS obstruction , and 2) obtained from lumbar puncture vs. ventricular CSF. A 30-year retrospective analysis was undertaken. CSF protein levels were statistically analysed to determine correlation between these levels and VPS obstruction. Of 214 children and 376 adults who underwent VPS insertion for TBM , respectively 27.5 % and 25.5 % sustained blocked VPS. The mean protein level in CSF collected from the non-obstructed group was 1.76 g/l , compared to 2.94 g/l in the obstructed group. The mean CSF protein level from intraoperative ventricular vs. lumbar puncture samples in the VPS obstruction group was respectively 2.471 g/l and 2.474 g/l. Patients with increased protein levels in CSF are at a high risk of VPS blockage. In these patients , temporary measures should be employed until CSF protein levels decrease.
