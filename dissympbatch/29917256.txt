  Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC) analysis is a noninvasive method to assess the lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. In human subjects , EBC hydrogen peroxide ( H To determine associations between EBC biomarkers and cytological and endoscopic definitions of lower airway inflammation<symptom> ( LAI) while controlling for sampling and environmental variables. Prospective , cross-sectional study. Clinical , endoscopic and airway cytological findings from 47 horses were compared with EBC pH and concentrations of H EBC pH and H LAI is challenging to categorise due to a variety of clinical and cytological phenotypes. Although the study was designed to overcome this limitation , numbers of horses were small in some categories. EBC pH and H
