  Pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG) is primarily , a sterile , inflammatory , neutrophilic dermatosis , characterized by recurrent cutaneous ulceration with mucopurulent or hemorrhagic exudate<symptom>. The incidence of PG is uncertain , but it is estimated to be about 3-10 patients per million per year. It occurs most commonly on the lower legs , but has been reported at other sites of the body as well. The causes of PG are unknown , but about 50-70 % of cases are associated with other diseases , mainly inflammatory bowel disease. We hereby report a case of PG in a 21-year-old male , with a history of ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). After appropriate diagnostic methods including biopsy for pathologic confirmation , sigmoidoscopy and computed tomography , we excluded other diseases and the lesion<symptom> was diagnosed as PG. We then carried out regular dressing of the wound<disease> , while UC was treated with steroid and immunosuppressant medication , with inputs from the department of gastroenterology during the hospital stay. There occurred recurrence of the skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> , 7 months after discharge , after which they improved. UC has been in the remission state as per the follow-up , since 2 years.
