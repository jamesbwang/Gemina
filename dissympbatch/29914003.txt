  Background and aims Medical abortion<disease> is often performed at outpatient clinics or gynaecological wards. Yet , some women may stay at home during medical abortion<disease> Pain has been reported to be one of the main side effects of the procedure. Methods We studied whether perceived abortion<disease> pain<symptom> was related to the subjectively evaluated ability to stay at home during medical abortion<disease> The size of the study group was 29 women. We also studied how well these women remembered the intensity and unpleasantness of the abortion<disease> pain<symptom> in a control visit performed 3-6 weeks after abortion<disease> Results Especially , the unpleasantness associated with the pain during abortion<disease> was an important predictor when women evaluated their ability to stay at home during medical abortion<disease> In those women who might have been able to stay at home in their own view , midwives looking after these women at the outpatient clinic estimated the pain intensity and unpleasantness also about 50 % lower than in those who were not able to stay home in their own view. There were no significant differences in intensity , unpleasantness in hindsight of menstruation pain , or the area of this pain in the pain drawings in those women who considered that they might have stayed at home during medical abortion<disease> when compared with those who did not. No difference was found in age , gestational age , magnitude of previous pregnancies , miscarriages , vaginal deliveries , induced abortions<disease> , Beck 's Depression<symptom> Index ( BDI) , Beck 's Anxiety<symptom> Index ( BAI) or AUDIT scores between those who could have stayed at home or those who would not have been able to stay at home during abortion<disease> Components of abortion<disease> pain<symptom> decreased significantly during the second post-abortion day. The more deliveries the subject had experienced the less pain she had during abortion<disease> Multiparous women reported less than a fourth of the pain magnitude of the nulliparous women during abortion<disease> Parity explained both intensity and unpleasantness of abortion<disease> pain<symptom> better than the expected ability to stay at home. The remembrance of the intensity or unpleasantness of abortion<disease> pain<symptom> correlated with actual pain reported at the time of abortion<disease> However , this remembrance did not correlate with the ability to stay at home during the medical abortion<disease> Conclusions The unpleasantness of pain during and immediately after abortion<disease> was recalled , not as a measure of the pain itself , but as a deciding factor in their judgement of whether or not they would be able to undergo medical abortion<disease> at home. Abortion<disease> pain<symptom> is an important factor in enhancing home-based management of medical abortions<disease>. Medical staff may be able to detect those women who do not cope at home during the process by observing the intensity of pain. Therefore , proper treatment of pain might reduce the need for hospital-based medical abortions<disease>. Implications These patients need better care and guidelines for the care of women undergoing medical abortions<disease> should include clear recommendations for analgesic treatments , at the least adequate doses of nonopioid analgesics such as paracetamol in combination with NSAIDs like ibuprofen or diclofenac.
