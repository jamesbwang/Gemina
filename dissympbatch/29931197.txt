  Thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> are a life-threatening condition often diagnosed too late. To discover novel robust biomarkers , we aimed to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying aneurysm<disease> formation. In Fibulin-4R/ R mice , the extracellular matrix protein Fibulin-4 is 4-fold reduced , resulting in progressive ascending aneurysm<disease> formation and early death around 3 months of age. We performed proteomics and genomics studies on Fibulin-4R/ R mouse aortas. Intriguingly , we observed alterations in mitochondrial protein composition in Fibulin-4R/ R aortas. Consistently , functional studies in Fibulin-4R/ R vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) revealed lower oxygen consumption rates , but increased acidification rates. Yet , mitochondria in Fibulin-4R/ R VSMCs showed no aberrant cytoplasmic localization. We found similar reduced mitochondrial respiration<symptom> in Tgfbr-1M318R/ + VSMCs , a mouse model for Loeys-Dietz syndrome<disease>. Interestingly , also human fibroblasts from Marfan ( FBN1) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome<disease> ( TGFBR2 and SMAD3) patients showed lower oxygen consumption. While individual mitochondrial complex I-V activities were unaltered in Fibulin-4R/ R heart and muscle , these tissues showed similar decreased oxygen consumption. Furthermore , aortas of aneurysmal Fibulin-4R/ R mice displayed increased ROS levels. Consistent with these findings , gene expression analyses revealed dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Accordingly , blood ketone levels of Fibulin-4R/ R mice were reduced and liver fatty acids were decreased , while liver glycogen was increased , indicating dysregulated metabolism at the organismal level. As predicted by gene expression analysis , the activity of PGC1α , a key regulator between mitochondrial function and organismal metabolism , was downregulated in Fibulin-4R/ R VSMCs. Increased TGFβ reduced PGC1α levels , indicating involvement of TGFβ signalling in PGC1α regulation. Activation of PGC1α restored the decreased oxygen consumption in Fibulin-4R/ R VSMCs and improved their reduced growth potential , emphasizing the importance of this key regulator. Our data indicate altered mitochondrial function and metabolic dysregulation , leading to increased ROS levels and altered energy production , as a novel mechanism , which may contribute to thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> formation.
