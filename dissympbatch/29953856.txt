  Hypofunction of the salivary gland causes several life-disrupting side effects such as dental<disease> caries<disease> , oral candidiasis , loss of taste , and swallowing disorders. No satisfactory therapy has been established to treat salivary hypofunction. Pilocarpine represents a potential treatment for dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> due to Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease> ( SS). Although subjective improvement was consistently observed with pilocarpine therapy , the mechanism was unclear. In this study , we investigated the mechanism of recovery in salivation<symptom> following treatment with pilocarpine. We first examined the effectiveness of pilocarpine in SS patients as quantified by the Saxon test and the visual analogue scale average. We found that salivation<symptom> ability and subjective symptoms improved by continuous administration of pilocarpine. These results demonstrated that long-term medication for dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> patients was more effective. However , as the mechanism remained unclear , molecular biological mechanisms were analyzed based on the effects of continuous administration of pilocarpine using model mice. In the molecular biological analysis , continuous administration of pilocarpine was effective in both ICR and SS model mice. Gene and protein expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 ( M3R) increased in salivary glands following continuous administration of pilocarpine compared with single administration. Therefore , continuous administration of pilocarpine effectively induced M3R expression , thereby activating
