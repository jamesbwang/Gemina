  The biologic antitumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( anti-TNFα) agents have revolutionised the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). However , some patients experience primary nonresponse , loss of response , or intolerance. Therefore , introducing a newer class of therapy with a mechanism of action that acts on different inflammatory pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is appealing. Vedolizumab is a fully humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively targets α4β7 integrin. Based on the results of the pivotal clinical GEMINI trials , vedolizumab was approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) and Crohn 's disease ( CD) refractory or intolerant to either conventional therapy or TNFα inhibitors. This review describes the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of vedolizumab reported in both randomized , controlled , clinical trials and from real-world experience in patients with UC and CD in order to identify its place in treatment algorithms for IBD.
