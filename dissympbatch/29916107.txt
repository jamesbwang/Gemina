  Randomized controlled trials , including the Japan Clinical Oncology Group ( JCOG) 0912 trial , have shown the safety of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG) for select healthy patients. It is unclear whether LADG is feasible in patients who do not meet trial eligibility criteria. The present study retrospectively reviewed 547 patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer who underwent distal or pylorus-preserving gastrectomy. Of these , 185 were identified as not fulfilling the eligibility criteria of JCOG 0912; the short-term surgical outcomes between LADG and open distal gastrectomy ( ODG) were compared in this group before and after propensity score matching. Patients who were not eligible for inclusion in the trial comprised 33.8 % of the total. After matching , there were 59 patients each in the LADG and ODG groups , with an improved balance<symptom> of confounding factors between the two groups. LADG was associated with significantly longer operation time , less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and shorter postoperative hospital stay than ODG. The rate of overall postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo Grade II or higher did not differ significantly between the LADG and ODG groups ( 23.7 vs. 18.6 % , respectively; p = 0.653). The incidence of pneumonia<disease> ( 6.8 vs. 5.1 %) , intra-abdominal infectious complications ( 5.1 vs. 3.4 %) , and stasis syndrome<disease> ( 5.1 vs. 3.4 %) was also comparable between the two groups. LADG was as safe as ODG in patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria of JCOG 0912. LADG could be a standard treatment option for patients with stage I gastric cancer , regardless of their general condition.
