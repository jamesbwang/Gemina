  Splenic infarction is an unusual cause for a patient to present with left upper abdomen pain. A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left upper abdomen pain. She reported that she stopped taking warfarin two days prior to presentation. A physical examination revealed fine crackles within the left lower lobe and significant tenderness<symptom> within the left upper abdomen. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed mild cardiomegaly with a 2.3 cm calcified thrombus in the left ventricular apex. We noted infarction in the spleen and right kidney with bilateral renal scarring. The patient was initially started on a heparin drip and later bridged to warfarin on the third day. She was discharged after seven days with complete resolution of the abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> The decision to prescribe an anticoagulant should include a consideration of underlying causes , comorbidities , an assessment of risks and benefits , and chances of recurrence. In our patient , her new splenic infarct and renal infarction were most likely embolic in origin due to her left ventricular apical aneurysm<disease> with thrombus and nonadherence to her prescribed anticoagulation medication.
