  The Systolic Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Intervention Trial ( SPRINT) was a randomized controlled trial which studied 9361 adults aged 50 and older with systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> above 130mmHg and one or more cardiovascular risk factor. Patients were randomized to intensive ( ≤ 120mmHg) or standard ( ≤ 140mmHg) systolic targets. In August 2016 , a limited dataset was released for secondary analysis. We hypothesized that excessive lowering of diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> could cause harm. Using the data from SPRINT , we sought to determine whether the development of diastolic hypotension<symptom> during treatment was associated with adverse outcomes. We included 8046 patients from SPRINT with a baseline diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ≥ 65mmHg at study enrollment ( 4041 intensive; 4005 standard target). Using cox-proportional hazards models we evaluated the association between the development of diastolic hypotension<symptom> ( defined as ≤ 55mmHg and modelled as a time-dependent covariate) and the combined outcome of cardiovascular morbidity ( myocardial infarction , other acute coronary syndromes<disease> , stroke , heart<symptom> failure<symptom>) and all-cause death. In multivariable analyses , patients who developed diastolic hypotension<symptom> had an increased risk for our primary outcome ( HR 1.67; 1.24-2.26). This was true in both the intensive ( HR 1.53; 1.04-2.26) and standard treatment arms ( HR 2.23; 1.40-3.54; p for interaction = 0.09). We found an association between diastolic hypotension<symptom> and the combined endpoint of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among SPRINT participants with normal to high diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> at entry. Attention to diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> may be important for optimizing outcomes when targeting systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction.
