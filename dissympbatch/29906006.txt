  5-fluorouracil , a fluoropyrimidine antineoplastic drug , is used to topically treat actinic keratoses. Local skin reactions to the medication are common and anticipated. However , severe adverse events from topical 5-fluorouracil are rare and unexpected. A 69-year-old man with a lower lip actinic keratosis developed severe neutropenia on day 11 of topical 5-fluorouracil treatment- after 14 applications. After receiving a subcutaneous injection of filgrastim , his neutrophil count normalized. The PubMed database was used to search the following terms: agranulocytosis , cream , 5-fluorouracil , granulocytopenia , neutropenia , severe , systemic , topical , and toxicity. The papers , and relevant cited references , generated were reviewed. Systemic reactions to topical 5-fluorouracil included angioedema , melanonychia , neurologic conditions ( such as acute cerebellar syndrome<disease> , headaches<symptom> , and peripheral neuropathy exacerbation) , taste alteration , and systemic toxicity requiring hospitalization ( including severe neutropenia). One of the individuals ( a man with severe neutropenia and other symptoms) also had a deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in 5-fluorouracil metabolism. Evaluation for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency is not routinely performed in patients receiving systemic or topical 5-fluorouracil. Also , the incidence of potentially severe 5-fluorouracil-induced toxicity associated with topical application of the drug may be greater than documented.
