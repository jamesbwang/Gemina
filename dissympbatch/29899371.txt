  Helsmoortel-van der Aa ( SWI/SNF autism-related or ADNP syndrome<disease>) is an autosomal dominant monogenic syndrome<disease> caused by de novo variants in the last exon of ADNP gene and no deletions have been documented to date. We report the first case of a 3 years and 10 months old boy exhibiting typical features of ADNP syndrome<disease> , including intellectual disability , autistic traits , facial dysmorphism , hyperlaxity , mood disorder , behavioral problems , and severe chronic constipation<symptom>. 60K Agilent array-comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH) identified a heterozygous interstitial microdeletion at 20q13 .13 chromosome region , encompassing ADNP and DPM1. Taking into account the clinical phenotype of previously reported cases with ADNP single-point variants , genotype-phenotype correlation in the proband was established and the diagnosis of Helsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome<disease> was made. Our report thus confirms that ADNP haploinsufficiency is associated with Helsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome<disease> as well as highlights the utility of whole-genome array-CGH for detection of unbalanced submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements in routine clinical setting in patients with unexplained intellectual disability and/or syndromic autism.
