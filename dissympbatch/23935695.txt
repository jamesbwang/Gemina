  Evaluate the effectiveness of LLL ( Low level laser therapy) in auriculotherapy points for pain reduction following lower third molar extractions. Randomized , controlled , single-blinded study. Eighty-four bilateral , symmetrical third molar surgeries were performed in 42 healthy patients using a split-mouth design. In the immediate postoperative period , each side was randomly treated in a single-blind method with an LLL at the auriculotherapy points or simulation of its use ( contralateral side) over a 21-day interval. This protocol was repeated 24 and 48 hours after surgery. All patients used the same analgesic ( paracetamol) but only in case of pain. The primary variable was postoperative pain according to the visual analogue scale , and the secondary variables were mouth<symptom> opening , edema<symptom> , local temperature , dysphagia<symptom> , and the presence of infection ( systemic temperature , lymphadenopathy<disease> These variables were evaluated at baseline and at 24 hours , 48 hours and seven days after surgery. Adverse effects were recorded and reported. There was no difference between the groups in relation to any of the evaluated parameters ( p > 0.05). For this experimental model , application of a low-intensity laser at auriculotherapy points did not prevent postoperative pain following lower third molar surgery.
