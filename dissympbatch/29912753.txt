  To evaluate agreement of MCM6-13910 with self-report of dairy sensitivity ( DS) and lactose hydrogen methane breath test ( LHMBT) results in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with symptoms including abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , variable bowel habits , and bloating. Adult patients with lactose malabsorption may present with similar symptoms. Patients with lactose malabsorption have a lactase nonpersistent ( LNP) phenotype. Recent studies found 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with LNP: G/A -22018 and C/T -13910. Genotyping the MCM6-13910 variant of LNP in 538 IBS patients and 317 controls ( without IBS). Subjects completed questionnaires pertaining to gastrointestinal problems and dietary consumption , with charts abstracted. Self-reported DS was higher in IBS ( 45 %) than controls ( 9.8 % , odds ratio = 6.46 , P < 0.001). The C/C -13910 genotype was similar in IBS cases and controls , 81 ( 15.1 %) and 47 ( 14.8 %). Among subjects reporting DS , 49 ( 18.0 %) had the C/C genotype. Overall agreement between genotype and self-reported DS was 0.06 in IBS and 0.07 in controls. There were 20 subjects with LHMBT results; 3 had positive results , 17 were negative. LNP genotypes were found in all 3 of positive LHMBT results; 16 had negative LHMBT among the 17 who were lactase persistent. Agreement between C/C -13910 genotype and LHMBT was excellent with Îº-statistic of 0.83 ( 0.50-1.00). In IBS patients , self-report of lactose intolerance are highly prevalent but are a poor indicator of underlying C/C -13910 genotype. LHMBT had excellent agreement with C/C -13910 genotype.
