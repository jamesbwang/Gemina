  The treatment of periodontitis<disease> primarily consists of mechanical debridement carried out by means of thorough scaling and root planing that might sometimes be a painful procedure which requires the administration of some form of local anesthesia. The present study comparatively evaluates the anesthetic effect of three such forms , viz; eutectic mixture of 25 mg/g lignocaine plus 25 mg/g prilocaine ( EMLA) and needleless jet anesthesia during SRP. 30 patients with probing depth of 5 mm or more and visual analog scale ( VAS) score of â‰¥ 30 mm on probing were selected and asked to assess the pain by VAS and verbal rating scale ( VRS) during SRP after application of the two agents. The difference between the visual analogue values of control , EMLA and Madajet XL is highly significant ( p < 0.001). According to the VRS scores , 6.7 % of the subjects in the EMLA group reported no pain , 80 % mild<symptom> pain<symptom> , and 13.3 % moderate<symptom> pain<symptom>. In the Madajet XL group , 46.7 % reported no pain and 53.3 % mild<symptom> pain<symptom>. In the control group 100 % of the patients reported moderate<symptom> pain<symptom> when none of the anesthetic was administered. None reported severe<symptom> pain<symptom>. Thus , the data suggest that both anesthetics are able to produce anesthesia of the tissues. The needleless anesthesia was relatively superior in performance to EMLA.
