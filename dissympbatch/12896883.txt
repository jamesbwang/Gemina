  Acid-base status is frequently assessed in severe sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. Venous blood gas sampling is proposed as a less-invasive modality but lacks evidence within this population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation and agreement between arterial blood gas ( ABG) , peripheral venous blood gas ( pVBG) , and central venous blood gas ( cVBG) in severe sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. We conducted a prospective , observational cohort study in subjects admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Simultaneous blood gas samples , including ABG , pVBG , and cVBG , were analyzed for correlation and agreement. Severity of illness scores revealed a mean ( ± SD) Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment score of 7.9 ± 3.3 , Simplified Acute Physiology II score of 49.3 ± 16.5 , and a mortality rate of 11.9 % in the intensive care unit and 16.4 % in the hospital. We found a strong intraclass correlation ( > 0.85) for pH , partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( pCO
