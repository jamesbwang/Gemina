  To define the incidence and risk factors associated with rectourethral fistula<disease> ( RUF) formation following primary whole-gland cryosurgery using a multicenter centralized registry. The Cryo On-Line Data ( COLD) registry was queried for men undergoing primary whole-gland cryotherapy between 1990 and 2014 who developed a RUF. Patient factors and disease parameters were correlated with RUF using chi-square and the t-test. Variables with p < 0.25 were entered into a binary logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination to determine the factors associated with RUF formation. A total of 4102 men underwent primary whole-gland cryotherapy in the COLD registry at the time of analysis. Postoperative RUF was documented in 50 out of 4102 cases ( 1.2 %). Patients with RUF had similar demographic data , prostate volume , preoperative prostate-specific antigen level , and clinical stage in comparison to those without fistula<disease>. On both univariate and multivariate analyses , postoperative urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR): 6.30; confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 3.43-11.58 , p < 0.001) , preoperative Gleason score of ≥ 7 ( OR: 1.92; 95 % CI 1.08-3.43 , p = 0.027) , and preoperative incontinence ( OR: 2.95; 95 % CI 1.12-7.76 , p = 0.028) were the most significant risk factors associated with RUF formation. Primary whole-gland cryotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with a historically low rate ( 1.2 %) of postoperative RUF formation. The rate decreased further to 0.55 % over the last several years , suggesting better patient selection and technical improvement. Postoperative urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> , Gleason score ≥ 7 , and preoperative urinary incontinence were the key demographic , clinical , and pathologic features associated with RUF formation in this study.
