  Several studies were conducted to investigate the association between eczema<disease> and risk of depression<symptom> This was important because the care of patients with eczema<disease> might be inadequate if their psychological problems were not also recognized and treated. However , these studies had some inherent limitations such as small sample sizes or lack of controlling for potential confounders. Further , little was known about psychological co-morbidity of eczema<disease> from a global perspective. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed ( 1966 through January 26th 2017) , Cochrane Library ( the Cochrane central register of controlled trials , up to January 26th 2017) , Scopus ( up to December 31st 2016) and Embase ( 1980 through January 26th 2017) supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies and conference proceedings. The relative risk ( RR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was estimated. Ten studies with a total of 188,495 patients were included. Overall , the random effects model summarizing all comparisons suggested a positive association between eczema<disease> and risk of depression<symptom> , the pooled RR was 2.02 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.76 to 2.31 , I Â² = 33.7 %). Similar results were observed in subgroup analysis by region. Methodological limitations such as selection biases , sample sizes , severity of other diseases , treatment strategy , age and other factors might have influenced the results. Our study showed that patients with eczema<disease> were associated with an increased risk of depression<symptom> These findings implicated that clinical doctors should continue to be more aware of the association between eczema<disease> and the risk of
