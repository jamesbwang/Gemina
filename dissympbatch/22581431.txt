  BACKGROUND The literature indicates that chromosome 6 is involved in balanced translocation and is involved in reproductive failure. This aim of this study was to explore the clinical features of chromosome 6 translocation in male carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS We identified 10 patients who were carriers of chromosome 6 translocations and excluded the patients with varicocele , ejaculatory duct obstruction , and the other cause of infertility<symptom>. The karyotype was analyzed using G-banding. A search for translocations on chromosome 6 involved in male infertility<symptom> was performed using PubMed. We included cases of balanced chromosome 6 translocations involving adult men of fertile age and excluded those cases of live-born children , or those without breakpoints involving chromosome 6 , or those with complex chromosomal translocations or chimeras. RESULTS All 10 patients underwent genetic counseling for infertility<symptom>. Semen analysis showed that 1 case had azoospermia , while 9 cases exhibited normal semen criteria. The respective partners of the 9 cases with normal semen parameters had a tendency to miscarry: 3 experienced spontaneous and induced abortion<disease> because of abnormal embryos; 3 experienced 3 incidents of spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> , 2 experienced double<symptom> spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> , and 1 experienced biochemical pregnancy on 3 occasions. Most of the chromosome 6 breakpoints in translocation carriers obtained by the PubMed search were associated with spontaneous<disease> abortion<disease> CONCLUSIONS Chromosome translocations involving chromosome 6 influence fertility status and lead to increased risk of miscarriage. Cytogenetic screening before opting for assisted reproductive technology and the breakpoints of chromosome 6 translocation should be considered for infertile male carriers.
