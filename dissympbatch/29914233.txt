  This study evaluated the feasibility of acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI) elastography and characterized the sonographic features of lymph nodes ( LNs) with Kikuchi disease in pediatric patients. Seventy-six cervical LN biopsies were performed for the diagnosis of cervical<symptom> lymphadenopathy<disease>. ARFI imaging was performed , and the characteristic ultrasound features of the biopsied LNs and the contralateral LNs were analyzed. We also reviewed clinical and conventional ultrasonographic findings. On histology , 56 patients were diagnosed with Kikuchi disease. These LNs were large and elongated , with increased perinodal echogenicity and capsular thickening. In 38 of them , ARFI elastography was performed , and the median shear wave velocity ( SWV) of the biopsied LNs with Kikuchi disease ( 2.19 m/sec; range , 1.45 to 4.57 m/sec) was higher than of the contralateral LNs ( 1.72 m/sec; range , 0.95 to 2.65 m/sec; P < 0.001). In patients with reactive hyperplasia<disease> , the mean SWV of the biopsied LNs ( 2.00 m/sec; range , 1.49 to 2.26 m/sec) was higher than that of the contralateral LNs ( 1.55 m/sec; range , 1.21 to 2.32 m/sec; P = 0.031). The SWV of LNs with Kikuchi disease was significantly higher than that of the contralateral LNs. Morphologically , LNs with Kikuchi disease showed an enlarged , elongated , and oval shape , increased perinodal echogenicity , and capsular thickening. In addition to the conventional ultrasonographic findings , the application of ARFI is feasible even in pediatric patients for the evaluation of
