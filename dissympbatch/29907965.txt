  We report the genetic analysis of a `` humanized '' hyperlipidemic mouse model for progressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) and fibrosis<disease>. Mice carrying transgenes for human APOE * 3-Leiden and CETP and fed a `` Western '' diet were studied on the genetic backgrounds of over 100 inbred mouse strains. The mice developed hepatic inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> that was highly dependent on genetic background , with vast differences in the degree of fibrosis<disease>. Histological analysis showed features characteristic of human NASH , including macrovesicular steatosis , hepatocellular ballooning , inflammatory foci and pericellular collagen deposition. Time course experiments indicated that while hepatic triglyceride levels increased steadily on the diet , hepatic fibrosis<disease> occurred at about 12 weeks. We found that the genetic variation predisposing to NASH and fibrosis<disease> differs markedly from that predisposing to simple steatosis , consistent with a multi-step model in which distinct genetic factors are involved. Moreover , genome-wide association identified distinct genetic loci contributing to steatosis and NASH. Finally , we used hepatic expression data from the mouse panel and from 68 bariatric surgery patients with normal liver , steatosis , or NASH to identify enriched biological pathways. The pathways showed substantial overlap between our mouse model and the human<disease> disease<disease>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
