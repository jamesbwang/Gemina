  Epigenetic mechanisms control skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of the histone 3 Lys-27 ( H3K27) methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( Ezh2) in wildtype mice enhances osteogenesis and stimulates bone formation. However , conditional genetic loss of Ezh2 early in the mesenchymal lineage ( i.e. through excision via Prrx1 promoter-driven Cre) causes skeletal abnormalities due to patterning defects. Here , we addressed the key question whether Ezh2 controls osteoblastogenesis at later developmental stages beyond patterning. We show that Ezh2 loss in committed pre-osteoblasts by Cre expression via the Osterix/Sp7 promoter ( Ezh2 cKO) yields phenotypically normal mice. The Ezh2-cKO mice have normal skull bones , clavicles and long bones , but exhibit increased bone<disease> marrow adiposity , and reduced male body<symptom> weight. Remarkably , in vivo Ezh2 loss results in a low trabecular bone phenotype in young mice as measured by microCT and histomorphometry. Thus , Ezh2 affects bone formation stage-dependently. We further show that Ezh2 loss in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells suppresses osteogenic differentiation and impedes cell cycle progression as reflected by decreased metabolic activity , reduced cell numbers , and changes in cell cycle distribution and in expression of cell cycle markers. RNA-Seq analysis of Ezh2 cKO calvaria revealed that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a is the most prominent cell cycle target of Ezh2. Hence , genetic loss of Ezh2 in mouse pre-osteoblasts inhibits osteogenesis in part by inducing cell cycle changes. Our results suggest that Ezh2 serves a bifunctional role during bone formation by suppressing osteogenic lineage commitment while simultaneously facilitating proliferative expansion of osteoprogenitor cells.
