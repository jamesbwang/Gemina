  There is a critical need to improve the diagnostic accuracy of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) in children. Several techniques have been developed to improve the quality of sputum<symptom> samples; however , these procedures are very unpleasant and invasive and require hospitalization and trained personnel. This study aims to explore the potential use of a new and noninvasive tool , `` string test , '' for TB diagnosis in children and in adults not able to render sputum<symptom> samples and at risk of developing multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB). Children with clinical suspicion of TB attending the pediatric consultation at the Cetrangolo or Cordero Hospitals and adults suspected of MDR-TB and unable to produce sputum<symptom> attending the Infectious<disease> Disease<disease> Unit of Cetrangolo Hospital were included in this study. The `` string test '' is a string that is swallowed by the patients and exposed to gastrointestinal secretions that were late analyzed for TB diagnosis and drug-resistance detection by GenoType MTBDRplus. MedCalc software was used to perform statistical analysis. This technique could be applied on 62.1 % of selected children. About 11 ( 30.6 %) children were diagnosed as TB cases , 8 ( 22.2 %) from gastric aspirate and using the `` string test. '' Six out of 19 adults were also diagnosed. Genotype directly on the string specimen detected two MDR-TB in adults and two isoniazid-resistant cases before obtaining the isolate. This test was safe , cheap , and easily implemented without requiring hospitalization. This research could represent a significant step forward to diagnose and rapidly detect drug-resistant TB in children.
