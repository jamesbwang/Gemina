  This review aims to summarize the role of the interleukin-1 ( IL-1) blocking agents in cardiovascular diseases , briefly describing the pathogenetic rationale and the most relevant clinical studies. IL-1 is a pivotal cytokine of the innate immune system. Anti-IL-1 agents are currently used for the treatment of several autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. Recently , the role of IL-1 has also emerged in cardiovascular diseases. Indeed , two recent randomized controlled trials have shown that the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra is effective for the treatment of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis<disease> and the IL-1Î² blocking agent canakinumab is effective in reducing myocardial infarction in people at risk. Interestingly , interfering with IL-1 has proved to be also effective in other cardiovascular manifestations , such as myocarditis<disease> , arrhythmias , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Blocking the IL-1 pathway is a possible new therapeutic strategy , potentially leading to innovative therapies in many acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases.
