  Diagnostics of healing , infection , and inflammation<symptom> in chronic<disease> wounds<disease> in comparison with physiological wound<disease> healing in acute wounds<disease> may help for therapy decisions toward individualized therapy management. With emerging new optical techniques the coupling of optical diagnostic devices with tissue provides a great challenge. Traditional coupling with cover slips is used since the early days of microscopy. In modern health care , hygienic covering of surfaces is necessary to avoid infections and cross-contaminations. Measurements in chronic<disease> wounds<disease> were performed at three different areas including the center of the wound<disease> , the border of the wound<disease> and healthy skin as comparison area. For each measurement area , three vertical stacks were taken by MPT. Additionally , three different optical measuring procedures ( MPT , OCT , CLSM) were used for the examination of BNC foil. Examinations of BNC foil were carried out at two different areas of healthy skin compared to a standard setup as control. The MPT evaluation revealed a distinct difference in the second harmonic generation-to-autofluorescence aging index of dermis ( SAAID) behavior between the vertical stacks taken at central wound<disease> areas and wound<disease> margins as well as unaffected skin. Through BNC foil covers , MPT CLSM and OCT images were captured with good quantitative and qualitative results. Phases in chronic<disease> wounds<disease> could be matched with physiologically healing in acute wounds<disease> according to SAAID and MPT imaging. BNC provided an alternative covering for MPT , OCT , and CLSM with clear morphological images.
