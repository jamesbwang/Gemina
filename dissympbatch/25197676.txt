  Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> ( SS) is an autoimmune disease related to two common symptoms: dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> and eyes. Although , xerostomia and hyposialia have been frequently reported in these patients , not many studies have evaluated other oral manifestations. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate prevalence rates of oral lesions<symptom> ( OL) in SS patients and to compare it to a control group ( CG) , when available. An exhaustive search of the published literature of the Pubmed , Scopus , Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols ( PRISMA-P) for relevant studies that met our eligibility criteria ( up to September 1st 2017). Seventeen cross-sectional studies and one cohort study were finally included. The results showed that SS patients presented more OL compared to non-SS patients. The most frequent types of OL registered in primary and secondary SS were angular cheilitis , atrophic glossitis , recurrent oral ulcerations and grooves or fissurations of the tongue , also when compared to a CG. OL are common and more frequent in SS patients when compared to a CG. This may be a consequence of low levels of saliva. More studies where these OL and all the possible cofounding factors are taken into account are needed.
