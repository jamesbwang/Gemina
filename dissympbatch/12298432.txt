  Inherited bone<disease> marrow failure syndrome<disease> ( IBMFS) including Shwachman Diamond Syndrome<disease> ( SDS) can present initially to the hematologist with myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS). Accurate diagnosis affects choice of chemotherapy , donor selection , and transplant conditioning. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of SDS in a family with another child with aplastic anemia<symptom> , and review reported cases of SDS in Asia. This highlights the gap in identifying inherited bone<disease> marrow failure syndromes<disease> in adults with hematologic malignancies.
