  Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death in obese and diabetic patients. In these groups of patients , the alterations of epicardial adipose tissue ( EAT) contribute to both vascular and myocardial dysfunction. Therefore , it is of clinical interest to determine the mechanisms by which EAT influences cardiovascular disease. Two key factors contribute to the tight intercommunication among EAT , coronary arteries and myocardium. One is the close anatomical proximity between these tissues. The other is the capacity of EAT to secrete cytokines and other molecules with paracrine and vasocrine effects on the cardiovascular system. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that EAT thickness is associated with not only metabolic syndrome<disease> but also atherosclerosis and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The evaluation of EAT using imaging modalities , although effective , presents several disadvantages including radiation exposure , limited availability and elevated costs. Therefore , there is a clinical interest in EAT as a source of new biomarkers of cardiovascular and endocrine alterations. In this review , we revise the mechanisms involved in the protective and pathological role of EAT and present the molecules released by EAT with greater potential to become biomarkers of cardiometabolic alterations.
