  Prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and mortality rates from cardiovascular causes are increased in patients with hypopituitarism. Features of obesity , visceral adiposity , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , and hypertension are common in these patients. Unreplaced growth hormone ( GH) deficiency and inadequate replacement of other hormone insufficiencies may be responsible for the adverse body composition and metabolic profile associated with hypopituitarism. Recently , fatty liver disease was added to this unfavorable metabolic phenotype. Long-term treatment with low-dose GH replacement is considered safe and advantageous for metabolic profile and normalization of cardiovascular mortality rates in hypopituitary patients. Positive influence of optimal balance<symptom> in replacement of other pituitary hormone deficiencies with doses of hydrocortisone ( < 20 mg/day) , weight-adjusted T4 doses , and transdermal estrogen in women is also very important. Active screening and treatment of all cardiometabolic risk factors and comorbidities may further improve outcomes in patients with hypopituitarism.
