  Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT) is emerging as a novel treatment option in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS). The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive SBRT on disease control and survival in oligometastatic ( ≤ 3 synchronous lesions<symptom>) STS. In total , 16 consecutive patients , accounting for 26 metastases ( including 21 lung and 5 lymph node or soft tissue metastases) , were treated at our institution with SBRT. Patient- and treatment-related characteristics were collected. Local control ( LC) , overall survival ( OS) , distant metastases-free survival ( DMFS) , and time to initiation of chemotherapy or best supportive care ( corrected disease-free survival , cDFS) were assessed. Four-year OS was 54 % and median OS was 69 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 20-118 months). LC of 26 lesions<symptom> at 4 years was 78 %. Median DMFS and cDFS were 17 ( 95 % CI 5-30 months) and 28 months ( 95 % CI 5-52 months) , respectively. Disease-free interval < 24 months from primary tumor treatment to first metastasis was the only predictor of reduced LC , cDFS , and OS ( p = 0.022 , 0.023 , and 0.028 , respectively). No acute or chronic grade ≥ 3 toxicity was observed. Median follow-up was 36 months ( IQR 18-71 months). In patients with oligometastatic STS , SBRT yields satisfying local control with minimal toxicity. Median OS was 69 months. Repeated SBRT may be considered to extend disease-free and systemic therapy-free interval. Increased time from primary tumor to first metastasis identifies patients with potentially greater benefit from SBRT.
