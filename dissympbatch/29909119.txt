  Renal fibrosis<disease> is the final pathological process common to any ongoing , chronic kidney injury or maladaptive repair. It is considered as the underlying pathological process of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , which affects more than 10 % of world population and for which treatment options are limited. Renal fibrosis<disease> is defined by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix , which disrupts and replaces the functional parenchyma that leads to organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. Kidney 's histological structure can be divided into three main compartments , all of which can be affected by fibrosis<disease> , specifically termed glomerulosclerosis in glomeruli , interstitial fibrosis<disease> in tubulointerstitium and arteriosclerosis and perivascular fibrosis<disease> in vasculature. In this review , we summarized the different appearance , cellular origin and major emerging processes and mediators of fibrosis<disease> in each compartment. We also depicted and discussed the challenges in translation of anti-fibrotic treatment to clinical practice and discuss possible solutions and future directions.
