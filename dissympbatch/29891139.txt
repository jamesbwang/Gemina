  Bovine respiratory<disease> disease<disease> complex<disease> is a major cause of illness in dairy calves. The diagnosis of active infection of the lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> is challenging on daily basis in the absence of accurate clinical signs. Clinical scoring systems such as the Californian scoring system , are appealing but were developed without considering the imperfection of reference standard tests used for case definition. This study used a Bayesian latent class model to update Californian prediction rules. The results of clinical examination and ultrasound findings of 608 preweaned dairy calves were used. A model accounting for imperfect accuracy of thoracic ultrasound examination was used to obtain updated weights for the clinical signs included in the Californian scoring system. There were 20 points ( 95 % Bayesian credible intervals: 11-29) for abnormal breathing pattern , 16 points ( 95 % BCI: 4-29) for ear drop/head tilt , 16 points ( 95 % BCI: 9-25) for cough<symptom> , 10 points ( 95 % BCI: 3-18) for the presence of nasal<symptom> discharge<symptom> , 7 points ( 95 % BCI: -1 to 8) for rectal temperature ≥ 39.2 °C , and -1 points ( 95 % BCI: -9 to 8) for the presence of ocular discharge. The optimal cut-offs were determined using the misclassification cost-term term ( MCT) approach with different possible scenarios of expected prevalence and different plausible ratio of false negative costs/false positive costs. The predicted probabilities of active infection of the lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> were also obtained using posterior densities of the main logistic regression model. Depending on the context , cut-off varying from 9 to 16 can minimized the MCT. The optimal cut-off decreased when expected prevalence of disease and false negative/false positive ratio increased.
