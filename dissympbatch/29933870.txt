  We present a case report of a young nulliparous woman that presented with progressive ascites , night<symptom> sweats<symptom> and weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Clinical and para-clinical findings were not suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) or other peritoneal conditions. A laparoscopy revealed important ascites and granulomatous peritoneal infiltration with normal genital anatomy. Tests for tuberculosis<disease> revealed primary peritoneal involvement in absence of pulmonary TB. This was a case of TB with primary and limited localization in the peritoneum. A strength of this report is that it has adequate illustration of the macroscopic and microscopic findings. In this brief report , we argue that the peritoneal localization of TB has been forgotten , but in countries with a high incidence of this condition , it should always be taken into consideration by doctors from all specialities when making differential diagnosis.
