  Although dopamine replacement therapy is the main risk factor for the occurrence of Impulse Control Disorders ( ICDs) in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , non-pharmacological risk factors for have also been identified in that population and sleep disorders could be part of them. Our objective is to determine whether Restless Legs Syndrome<disease> ( RLS) , that has been associated with more impulsive choices in general population regardless of dopaminergic therapy , could be associated with a specific psycho-behavioral profile and ICDs in PD. Eighty consecutive PD patients were screened for the presence of RLS in a cross-sectional study. Sleep features were evaluated during one video-polysomnography. The frequency of ICDs , according to standard criteria , together with a broad range of psycho-behavioral features using the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in PD , were compared in patients with RLS ( PD-RLS , n = 30) versus without RLS ( PD-nRLS , n = 50). PD patients with RLS reported significantly more ICDs than those without RLS ( 50 % versus 26 % , p = 0.03) , especially compulsive eating disorders , and a different psycho-behavioral profile with more hyperdopaminergic behaviors. There was no between group difference for total and dopamine agonists levodopa equivalent doses. However , age and durations of both disease and dopaminergic treatment were greater in the RLS group. Multivariate and propensity score analyses controlling for age , gender , total sleep time , disease severity , dose and duration of treatment , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> showed that RLS was an independent predictor of ICDs in PD ( OR = 5.91 ( 1.63; 22.1) and OR = 2.89 ( 1.63; 6.67) respectively). RLS per se could be a risk factor for impulsive behaviors in PD.
