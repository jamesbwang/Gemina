  Uncontrolled cardiac fibrosis<disease> following myocardial infarction ( MI) is a critical pathological change leading to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Current pharmacotherapies are limited by unsatisfactory efficacy and undesired systemic side effects. Astaxanthin ( ASX) is a natural carotenoid with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The effects of ASX on MI-induced cardiac fibrosis<disease> and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study , after the establishment of MI model , mice were administrated with ASX ( 200 mg/kg ⋅ d) for 4 weeks. We found that ASX treatment attenuated cardiac fibrosis<disease> and improved heart function following MI , as evidenced by reduced collagen I/III ratio , hydroxyproline content and left ventricular end diastolic pressure ( LVEDP). Lipidomic analysis revealed the overaccumulation of myocardial ceramides in mice with cardiac fibrosis<disease> , which was normalized by ASX treatment. Molecular docking analysis showed that ASX produced a tight fit in the pocket of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 ( SMPD1) , a key enzyme in the production of ceramides. Western blot analysis confirmed the significant inhibition of SMPD1 expression by ASX. Furthermore , MI-induced overexpression of transforming growth factor β1 ( TGF-β1) and phosphorylated SMAD2/3 were attenuated by ASX administration. SMPD1 knockout ( KO) abrogated the beneficial effect of ASX. Taken together , our results suggest that the cardioprotective effects of ASX are mediated by SMPD1 through the indirection inhibition of TGF- β1/SMAD signaling cascade.
