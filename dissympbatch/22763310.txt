  Post-traumatic anterior pituitary insufficiency ( PTAPI) is a rare but established disease caused by ischemic lesions<symptom> after severe cranial trauma. This case study aims to highlight the criteria for imputability of PTAPI to a cranial trauma as well as the specific principles of legal redress in relation to this disease. We conducted a forensic study of a patient with diagnosed PTAPI followed up in the Division of Endocrinology and Legal Medicine at the University Hospital , Sousse ( Tunisia). The patient included in the study was a 45-year old woman with no particular past medical history. ( 6 gynaecological procedures , 4 parities and 2 abortions<disease>) having regular menstrual cycles , without a history of hemorrhagic childbirth , who had been involved in a road accident ( pedestrian got hit by a car) causing occipital trauma without initial knowledge loss. She developed hypothyroidism three years after the accident. The hormonal assessment showed the involvement of all the other axes. Neuroradiological examination objectified pituitary gland and pituitary stalk integrity. The definitive diagnosis of PTAPI was made. Medical examination ( performed 4 years after the accident) concluded that PTAPI was imputable to the accident. Permanent partial disability rate according to ordinary law has been assessed at 25 %. PTAPI diagnosis is made by elimination. The evaluation of physical injury should be based on residual symptoms , on therapeutic constraints and on its impact on daily and professional activity. Patient 's evolution under hormone replacement therapy is often favorable , however , complications may occur , hence the necessity to establish these complications in order to preserve the right of the patient to underwent new treatments.
