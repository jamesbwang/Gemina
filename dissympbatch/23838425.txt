  It remains undetermined whether second-generation drug-eluting stents ( G2-DESs) outperform first-generation DESs ( G1-DESs) in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of G1-DES and G2-DES in ACS patients in a high-volume cardiovascular center. In 2013 , 10,724 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in our institution. We included 4037 patients with ACS who underwent exclusively G1-DES or G2-DES implantation ( n = 364 and n = 3673 , respectively). We used propensity score matching to minimize the imbalance between the G1-DES and G2-DES groups and followed patients for 2 years. The efficacy endpoints were major adverse cardiac events ( MACEs) and its components including target vessel-related myocardial infarction ( TV-MI) , target vessel revascularization/target lesion<symptom> revascularization ( TVR/TLR) , and cardiac death. The safety endpoint was stent thrombosis. Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test , and categorical variables were compared using Pearson 's Chi-square or Fisher 's exact test. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare the event-free survival rates , and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess whether stent type was an independent risk factor for the efficacy and safety endpoints. At the 2-year follow-up , the results for MACE and it components , as well as stent thrombosis , were similar for G1-DES and G2-DES ( MACE , 5.2 % vs. 4.3 % , Ï‡ G1-DES and G2-DES have similar efficacy and safety profiles in ACS patients at the 2-year follow-up.
